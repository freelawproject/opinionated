Writ dated November 28, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-12\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Bell, </em>J. The following facts appeared in evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-13\">There were two boilers in the defendant\u2019s fire room, only one of which was used at a time. They were side by side and were drawn off through valves which connected with the same exhaust pipe. It was part of the plaintiff\u2019s duty every night to draw off the boiler that was in use, called the \u201clive boiler.\u201d The other boiler was called the \u201cdead boiler.\u201d On the night of the accident the plaintiff was proceeding to draw off the live boiler, and had opened the valve for this purpose, when almost immediately hot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>water and steam came out of the valve in the dead boiler, and he was injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-5\">The engineer for the defendant in charge of its fire and engine rooms testified that on the afternoon before the accident he removed a portion of the valve of the dead boiler consisting of the disc and .disc seat; that in order to do that it was necessary for him to remove the bonnet or outside part of the valve; that he placed the bonnet right beside the bottom part of, the valve; that he removed the disc and the disc seat to have them ground down, as he had discovered that water \\yas leaking through them; that he did not tell the plaintiff that he had removed the disc and disc seat; and that after taking out the disc and disc seat he could have put the top or bonnet of the valve back on again, which would have covered up the opening in the valve, so that no steam could have escaped.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-6\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked for a ruling that on all the evidence the plaintiff could not recover. The ruling was refused, there was a verdict for the plaintiff for $1,110; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-7\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-8\"><em>II. R. Bygrave &amp; I. Brayton, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-9\"><em>J. J. Feely &amp; R. Clapp, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b176-10\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqf\">The repair of the boilers necessary to keep them in running order apparently had been entrusted to the engineer, who is not shown to have been incompetent. If upon removal of the disc and disc seat he had replaced the top or bonnet of the valve, or notified the plaintiff who was the fireman of the repairs, the accident would have been averted. It is the defendant\u2019s contention, that the engineer\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause, and, being a fellow servant at common law, he cannot recover. <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>133 Mass. 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">The defendant corporation engaged to provide proper machinery, to keep it in suitable repair, as well as to employ and retain competent servants. But if it could carry on business only through the agency of natural persons acting under delegated powers, the duty to exercise reasonable supervision over the condition in which its permanent ways, works and machinery were kept still devolved upon the employer. <em>McGee </em>v. <em>Boston Cordage Co. </em>139 Mass. 445, 448. \u201cThe general question,\u201d said Mr. Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Field in <em>Rice </em>v. <em>King Philip Mills, </em>144 Mass. 229, 236, \u201cis what under the circumstances the master ought reasonably to have known and done, and, in determining this, the nature of the defect, the length of time it has existed, and the means taken to remedy it, are important facts.\u201d If the jury found, that the defendant ought to have known of the defective and dangerous condition of the boiler, it should have made the premises reasonably safe, or warned the plaintiff of the danger. <em>Ruddy </em>v. <em>George F. Blake Manuf. Co. </em>205 Mass. 172, 178, 179, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The instructions although they might have been more full were unexceptionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Nor could it have been ruled, that the plaintiff was careless. The boilers, each of which was connected with the same exhaust pipe, were used singly, but not in combination. At the close of the day\u2019s work the plaintiff drew off the steam from the boiler in use, and what inferences should be drawn from his failure to notice the condition of the idle boiler upon which no work was then required of him, or to assume in the absence of any information to put him upon inquiry, that it was undergoing repairs, were for the jury. <em>Ruddy </em>v. <em>George F. Blake Manuf. Co. </em>205 Mass. 172, 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
