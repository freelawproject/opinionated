Pierce, late of Worcester, as his dependent next of kin, under St. 1909, c. 514, \u00a7 129, to recover for the instantaneous death of their son on January 5, 1911, when he was-in the employ of the defendant and was engaged in coupling cars in the defendant\u2019s freight yard at Worcester. The eighth count of the declaration, on which alone the case went to the jury after the plaintiffs had waived all their other counts, alleged that the decedent was in the employ of the defendant as-a brakeman and that his death was caused by the negligence of some person or persons in the service of the defendant who at the time had charge and control of a certain train of the defendant in. the defendant\u2019s freight yard at Worcester, by reason of which the. decedent was caught between a moving freight car and a freight, car standing on another track. Writ dated December 19, 1911.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-6\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Hall, </em>J. It appeared that the place where the decedent was killed was between two intersecting repair tracks in the freight yard numbered respectively two and three. The manner of the accident is described in the opinion. The accident happened at 2.30 a. m. on January 5, 1909. It was agreed by the counsel for the defendant that the-Pennsylvania Railroad car standing on repair track number 3 was put there in the daytime on the morning of January 4 and that the Delaware and Hudson Railroad car which was on repair-track number 2 had been put there during the night of January 4. The defendant offered no evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-7\">The judge ruled that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover and ordered a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-8\">D.

These were \u201c repair tracks,\u201d upon which were placed only cars that needed repairing. They were intersecting tracks. There was a practice in the yard, when cars were shunted upon these or other intersecting tracks, to place them, not close to the point of intersection, but at a sufficient distance therefrom to leave room for a man to pass between the cars; and it could be found that this was intended, partly at least, for the safety of men working upon or near to the cars, so that one of the difficulties encountered in <em>Porter </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>210 Mass. 271, 274, does not stand in the way of these plaintiffs. The deceased in the proper performance of his duty had gone between the tracks and between the two cars for the purpose of coupling one of them to a train that-it might be moved out of the way. Accordingly the jury could find that he had a right to act upon the assumption that the cars had been properly placed and that there was room for him to go between them as he needed to do, and that it was not negligent for him to do this without stopping to ascertain whether they were in fact placed far enough away from the intersection of the tracks to afford him sufficient room. <em>Mackenzie </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, </em>211 Mass. 586. <em>Parmelee </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, </em>215 Mass. 294. There are circumstances in the case at bar which differ from those of the cases cited; but there is nothing which requires as matter of law the application of a different rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">There was evidence of negligence for which the defendant could be held liable in placing the car on track number 3 too near to track number- 2. <em>Parmelee </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, supra. Dacey </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railroad, </em>153 Mass. 112. It has not been argued that as to this there was a variance between the declaration and the evidence; and we have not considered whether such a contention could have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
