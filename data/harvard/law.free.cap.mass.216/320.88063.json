The facts which the plaintiff's evidence tended to show are stated in the opinion. There also was evidence that the car was a closed car with vestibules; that the accident occurred on January 31, 1911; that the plaintiff Malvina Benoit was thirty-six years old and the mother of four children, ranging in ages from fifteen to five years; that as she boarded the car she lifted the five year old child into th\u00e9 vestibule and followed her, holding her by the hand; that at the time of the accident she was four and a half or five months advanced in pregnancy, wore a long black coat, buttoned, and \u201cwas quite large;'' and that she gave birth to twins on June 14. Her husband testified that he let her lift the five year old child on to the car and get on herself without assistance, and that he thought she was able to do so without help from him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>At the close of the evidence the defendant asked for the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-3\"><em>\u201c </em>1.

There is no controversy as to her due care. The questions raised by the exceptions are whether there was evidence for the jury that the conductor started the car too soon, or that the motorman started it in a negligent manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">1. When a car has been stopped for the purpose of taking on a passenger it is the duty of the conductor not to give the starting signal until the passenger has got into such a position on the car as to make it safe to start. This does not mean that he must wait until all the passengers have been seated. Such an application of a carrier\u2019s duty would be impracticable under the demands of present day rapid transportation, and is not necessary for the passenger\u2019s safety according to general experience. It is settled law in this Commonwealth that under ordinary circumstances it is not negligence for a conductor to give the starting signal after the passenger is fully and fairly on the car. <em>Sauvan </em>v. <em>Citizens\u2019 Electric Street Railway, </em>197 Mass. 176. <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>190 Mass. 563. <em>Boston Elevated Railway </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>168 Fed. Rep. 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">The facts bring this case within the established rule. The plaintiff was in the body of the car when the conductor rang the bell. She was thirty-six years old, and apparently fully able to protect herself from being injured by the ordinary movement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>a car in starting. It seems clear from the testimony of the passengers and the conduct of her husband that there was nothing in her appearance to indicate to the conductor that she needed special care by reason of pregnancy. The fact that she was leading her five years old child by the hand is not enough to bring the case at bar within the scope of <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>193 Mass. 324. In that case the plaintiff, with her arms extended in front of her, was in the act of caring for her two years old child when the car started at the beginning of a curve. And the Hamilton case differs from this in other particulars. See <em>Sauvan </em>v. <em>Citizens\u2019 Electric Street Railway, ubi supra. </em>Under our decisions the defendant was entitled to the third ruling requested. <em>Tupper </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>204 Mass. 151, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\">2. The presiding judge should have given the fourth ruling requested by the defendant. The plaintiff and her husband said that the car started with a jerk, but there is nothing in the record to show that it was an unusual or extraordinary jerk, or that the movement differed in any way from that ordinarily attending the starting of an electric car. No other facts appear from which it could be inferred that there was carelessness in the way in which, the motorman started the car. <em>Work </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway,. </em>207 Mass. 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The judge should have ruled, as requested by the defendant, that upon all the evidence the plaintiff could not recover; and under-St. 1909, c. 236, judgment must be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
