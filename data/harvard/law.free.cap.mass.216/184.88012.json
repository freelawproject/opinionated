Writs dated December 23, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-6\">In the Superior Court the cases were tried together before <em>Hitchcock, </em>J. It was conceded that the defendant\u2019s automobile was lawfully registered, and that the defendant was duly licensed to operate it. There was evidence tending to show the due care of the plaintiff in the first case, and there also was evidence tending to show the negligence of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-7\">The plaintiff Charles Crompton, against the objection of the defendant and subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, testified that he owned the automobile that he was driving at the time of the accident and that it was registered in the name of Charles Crompton and Sons, under which name he was doing business on September 2,1910, when it was registered; that the corporation Charles Crompton and Sons, Incorporated, was not incorporated until September 27, 1910, and that on November 14, 1910, when the accident occurred, that corporation had the automobile in its use and possession. The certificate of registration was put in evidence. It was dated September 2, 1910, and contained the statement that the vehicle was owned by Charles Crompton and Sons. An operator\u2019s license granted to the plaintiff Charles Crompton, likewise dated September 2,1910, was put in evidence. On cross-examination the plaintiff Charles Crompton testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>that he did business under the name of Charles Crompton and Sons for seventeen years and that he did not remember that he ever had filed with the city clerk of the city of Lynn a certificate that he was doing business as an individual under the name of Charles Crompton and Sons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-5\">At the close of all of the evidence, the defendant requested the judge to rule in each case as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-6\">\u201c1. Upon all the evidence in the case as a matter of law the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-7\">\u201c2. The automobile in which the plaintiff was riding at the time of the accident was not lawfully registered.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-8\">The judge refused to rule as requested, and submitted the case to the jury, instructing them that there was evidence on which they might find, if they believed the testimony, that the automobile operated by the plaintiff Charles Crompton was duly registered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-9\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in each case. No question was raised in regard to the amounts of the verdicts. The defendant alleged exceptions to the admission of the evidence above described, to the judge\u2019s refusal to rule as requested and to his ruling in regard to registration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-10\">The cases were submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b214-11\"><em>W.

St. 1909, c. 534, \u00a7 2. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, </em>208 Mass. 137,157,158. <em>Bourne </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>209 Mass. 155, 172. The statute provides that the application must contain, in addition to such other particulars as the commission may require, a statement of the name, place of residence and address of the applicant with a brief description of the motor vehicle. St. 1909, c. 534, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">Before the formation of the corporation Charles Crompton, the owner and licensed operator of the car, to whom we shall refer as the plaintiff, carried on business under the name of \u201c Charles Crompton &amp; Sons.\u201d A corporation, a partnership or an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>may adopt a trade name under which business can be transacted, actions instituted, or defended, and the title to property acquired and transmitted. <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Rockett, </em>121 Mass. 431. <em>Phipps </em>v. <em>Little, </em>213 Mass. 414, 416, and cases cited. The plaintiff\u2019s application and the registration followed the name in which he did business. But if registration under a fictitious name adopted for the purpose of concealing identity would not be a compliance with the statute, because the record would not show, nor the certificate contain, a descriptive statement by which the true owner could be ascertained, the jury properly could find that\" the plaintiff was well known in the community by his trade name. If this appeared, the requirements of the statute were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Nor is the right of recovery barred by the failure of the plaintiff to comply with the St. of 1907, c. 539, as amended by St. 1908, c. 316, which provides, that individuals engaged in business under names other than their own shall file with the clerk of the city or town in which the place of business is situated, a certificate stating the full name and residence of each person by whom it is conducted. The act is intended for the information and protection of creditors with whom the trader contracts under an artificial designation which in the absence of such certificate may enable the actual or responsible debtor for want of identification to escape all liability. '</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The plaintiff not having parted with the ownership, even if he had become an employee of the corporation by which.the car had been hired, the presiding judge rightly refused to rule that the actions could not be maintained, and submitted the cases to the jury under instructions which are unexceptionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
