Writs dated September 24, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-7\">In the Superior Court the cases were tried together before <em>Wait, </em>J. The material facts shown by the evidence are stated in the opinion. In the course of the trial the plaintiffs offered to show that one Booth, the agent of the defendants, stated, within a few days after the date of the accident, in substance this: \u201cWe have had men working on that not long ago.\u201d This statement was offered as an admission that the defendants had undertaken to repair the gutter and' the premises generally after their attention had been called to its defective condition by the plaintiff Charles P. Rolfe, in view of the fact that that plaintiff had testified that repairs were made after his complaint. The plaintiffs further stated that the evidence related to \u201cwork done on this particular gutter after the complaint of Mr. Rolfe.\u201d This evidence was excluded by the judge against the plaintiffs\u2019 exception. The other evidence excluded against the plaintiffs\u2019 exception related to the \u201clife\u201d or ordinary duration of a gutter such as the one in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-8\">At the close of the evidence the judge ruled that the evidence was not sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to recover, and ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>a verdict for the defendants in each of the cases. The plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b593-5\"><em>C. J.

They had given a lease of the entire building to one Marks, who himself occupied the street floor of the building and had given a lease of the upper part thereof to the plaintiff\u2019s husband. Both of these leases contained provisions whereby the lessees covenanted that they would \u201ckeep all and singular the said premises in such repair, order and condition as the same are in at the commencement of said term, or may be put in during the continuance thereof, damage by fire or other unavoidable casualty only excepted,\u201d and that, \u201call property of'whatever kind that may be on the premises shall be at the sole risk of the lessee, or those claiming under or through him, and the lessor or their heirs or assigns shall not be liable to the lessee or any other person for any injury, loss or damage, to any person, or property, on the premises.\u201d That is, as we understand the statement in the bill of exceptions, Marks had made these covenants with the defendants, and the plaintiff\u2019s husband had made the same covenants with Marks. There was no privity of contract between the plaintiff\u2019s husband and the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">The plaintiff, it was alleged, had sustained a personal injury by falling upon the floor of a room in the premises leased by Marks to her husband. She offered evidence tending to show that her fall was due to the floor having been flooded and made slippery by a sudden rush of water into the room from a defective gutter on the outside of the window of the room; that the gutter previously had become worn out and leaky; that one Booth, who before the accident had been notified of the defective condition of the gutter, and who was agent for the defendants, had undertaken to repair the gutter, but had done this in a negligent manner and that the sudden inrush of water into her room was due to this negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">It is plain that the plaintiff, occupying these premises under the lease to her husband, had no greater rights than he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>have had. <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>188 Mass. 237, 238. . <em>Shute </em>v. <em>Bills, </em>191 Mass. 433,437. <em>Dalton </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>192 Mass. 1. <em>Domenicis </em>v. <em>Fleisher, </em>195 Mass. 281, 283. <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>204 Mass. 419, 421. The question is, therefore, whether he could have maintained an action against the defendants for the injury if it had happened to him in the same manner that it happened to his wife. But it is plain .that under such circumstances neither he nor she could have maintained such an action, unless they could show that after the execution of the leases which have been mentioned the defendants undertook to make repairs upon the gutter, made such repairs, and made them in so negligent a manner as to cause this accident- <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Beals, </em>187 Mass. 250. <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Janvrin, </em>196 Mass. 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">But we find no such evidence in this record. There was evidence that Booth had undertaken to make such repairs, and had made them in a manner which could be found to have caused the accident and to have been negligent. But this was not enough. Booth testified also that he was \u201cagent for the defendants\u201d at the time of the accident and had been so both before and since that time. But there was no evidence as to what that agency was, what authority the defendants had given to him, or how far he was authorized to bind them. There could be no presumption that he had authority from them to release Marks from the covenants of the lease which they had given to Marks, so as to subject them to a duty or liability from which by those covenants they had carefully exempted themselves. Much less could it be inferred from the bare statement which was in evidence that he was authorized to subject them to such a duty or liability to a mere stranger, who had no contractual rights against them, and with whom he had as agent for the defendants no call to concern himself or to create relations which they themselves had no occasion to create. It follows that the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s case fails. <em>Phenix Nerve Beverage Co. </em>v. <em>Dennis &amp; Lovejoy Wharf &amp; Warehouse Co. </em>189 Mass. 82, 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">None of the testimony excluded at the trial bore upon this fundamental question. It is elementary that Booth\u2019s authority could not be proved by evidence of his acts and declaration not brought home to the defendants. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Gerrish, </em>14 Allen, 201. <em>Deane </em>v. <em>American Glue Co. </em>200 Mass. 459, 462. The other evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>dence excluded was immaterial, unless there was, as we have seen that there was not, evidence to establish the fundamental facts on which the right to maintain the action rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\">In each case the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
