Writ dated July 10, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>In the Superior Court the case was heard by <em>McLaughlin, </em>J., without a jury. The judge refused a request of the plaintiffs to rule that on all the evidence they were entitled to recover, and made a memorandum of findings as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\">\u201cThe defendant, who was the lessee of certain premises on Washington Street [in Boston], carrying on business there as a licensed liquor dealer, employed the plaintiff [referring to the one of the plaintiffs who represented both of them in this transaction] to find a customer for his business, agreeing, if the plaintiff effected a sale thereof for the sum of $22,000, to pay him the sum of $600 as a commission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff in good faith procured a customer, one Sullivan, who was ready, able and willing to buy, and who entered into a written agreement with the defendant to purchase for the sum of $22,000. The business without the license, or the license without the lease, would have been useless to such purchaser as the parties intended should be procured. This fact was well understood by the plaintiff and the defendant, and the contract between Sullivan and the defendant contained the following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-7\">\u201crIt is further agreed between the parties that if the party of the second part (Sullivan) is not accepted by the landlord as a tenant, or if the party of the second part is not accepted by the said Excise Board (meaning the Licensing Board for the City of Boston established under St. 1906, c. 291) as a licensee, then the said parties of the first part (Hoffman) shall forthwith pay back and refund to the party of the second part the said deposit of' one thousand dollars ($1,000) paid this day, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, and all claims against each other shall cease and terminate.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">\u201cThe landlord refused to accept Sullivan as a tenant, or to assent to an assignment of the lease, unless Sullivan would agree to pay a much larger rental than Hoffman was paying, a condition with which Sullivan refused to comply, or at least never manifested any willingness so to do. The licensing board, furthermore, refused to accept him as a licensee and the business was subsequently sold to another person who was accepted both by the landlord and the licensing board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-9\">\"Because Sullivan was not accepted either as a tenant or as a licensee, I find that the contract between him and Hoffman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>ceased to be binding; that the plaintiff, therefore, did not effect a sale of the defendant\u2019s business, and is not entitled to his commission. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-5\">The judge made a general finding for the defendant; and the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-6\"><em>J. J. Walsh, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-7\"><em>Lee M. Friedman, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b382-8\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJR\">The defendant, a licensed liquor dealer, employed the plaintiffs to procure a purchaser for the business carried on by him on premises of which he was the lessee, and agreed if a sale were made at a certain price to pay them a fixed sum as a commission. If this had been the entire contract the plaintiffs, when they had found a customer able and willing to buy and pay the price and had notified the defendant, would have earned the commission. <em>Goodnough </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>205 Mass. 203, 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">But, while the judge found that a customer was procured, his further findings, which were warranted by the evidence, show, that independently of the license or of the lease the business as a going enterprise had no market value, and the plaintiffs understood that they were to effect a sale, upon the conditions that the customer could obtain a license from the licensing board, and that the defendant\u2019s landlord would assent to an assignment ol the lease. If the lease and the license could have been obtained,, a binding sale would have been accomplished. It appears, however, that without the fault of the vendor or of the purchaser neither the license nor the lease was procurable, and, no sale having been consummated, the judge properly declined to rule that upon all the evidence as matter of law the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. <em>Munroe </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>191 Mass. 483, 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
