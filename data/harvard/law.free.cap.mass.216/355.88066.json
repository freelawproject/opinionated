Writ dated July 20, 1908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-10\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Fessenden, </em>J., who at the close of the evidence, which is described in the opinion, ordered a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-11\"><em>W. H. Shea, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-12\"><em>F. M.

She had her left foot on the floor of the body of the car, resting her weight on it, and was in the act of raising her right foot from the vestibule floor when the conductor gave the starting signal. That, it was not negligence on his part to start the car when he did is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>settled by the similar cases of <em>Sauvan </em>v. <em>Citizens\u2019 Electric Street Railway, </em>197 Mass. 176, <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, ante, </em>337, <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, post, </em>361.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And see <em>Boston Elevated Railway </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>94 C. C. A. 84. Clearly the fact that he placed his hand on her back and so prevented her from going backward was no assurance that he would protect her from any and every injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">And there is no evidence that the motorman started the car negligently. The plaintiff\u2019s right shoulder and elbow struck the woodwork of the door; but no other passenger was disturbed, although some were standing. The record discloses nothing more than the movement usually incident to the starting of an electric car. <em>Work </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>207 Mass. 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-15\"> This case was decided on the same day that the cases of Flanagan \u2022and Martin were decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
