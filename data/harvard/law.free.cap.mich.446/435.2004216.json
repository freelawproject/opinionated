We therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals upholding the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"ATu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The incident to which the present inquiry relates occurred on December 28, 1989. At approximately 9:30 a.m., complainant Shirley McGriff was filling the gas tank of her car at a self-service station in the City of Detroit. At the same time, defendant was near the station and twice got change from the station attendant. The attendant assumed the change was for bus fare because she observed the defendant stand for several minutes at a nearby bus stop. Defendant testified that, while waiting for the bus, he observed another automobile that he believed contained several individuals whom he thought intended to kill him over an unpaid debt of $1,000. As complainant finished putting gas into her car, defendant jumped in and drove the car away. Defendant testified that he felt that such action was necessary to escape possible harm from the men to whom he owed the debt. Defendant also testified that he had no intent to keep the car permanently, and that he \"figured\u201d that the complainant was going to get her car back.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Complainant testified that when defendant approached her car, she objected to his intent to take it, at which time the defendant threatened to blow her brains out if she did not get away from the car. Consistent with this threat, complainant observed that defendant had his hand in his pocket, holding what she believed to be a gun. Defendant denied that he confronted complainant in any way, and claimed he was unarmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Defendant admitted that he drove complainant\u2019s car throughout the day, making stops at four or five locations, allegedly for the purpose of obtaining a gun to protect himself. At no time, however, did defendant attempt to contact police to ask for their protection from the men that were supposedly out to kill him. Defendant also admitted that complainant\u2019s purse was in the car when he drove off, but denies taking forty-five dollars that was apparently missing when the purse was returned to complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">At approximately 4:30 p.m. that same day, defendant was stopped in complainant\u2019s car by the police. As the police approached the car, defendant backed into an intersection, running into another vehicle, and then accelerated forward in the direction of one of the police officers. After the officer jumped out of the way, defendant crashed the car into a fence and was apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Defendant was charged with armed robbery and assault with intent to murder<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the police officer. The defendant received a trial by jury. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>judge agreed to instruct the jury on several lesser included offenses. The jury was instructed on assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and felonious assault,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as lesser offenses to the principal charge of assault with intent to murder. On the principal charge of armed robbery, the judge instructed the jury on the lesser offenses of unarmed robbery<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and larceny from a person.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s request for lesser offense instructions of unlawfully taking and using an automobile<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>and </em>udaa<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was refused. The defendant was convicted of larceny from a person and acquitted of the assault charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Defendant appealed the refusal to instruct the jury on udaa. The Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the action of the trial judge, finding that armed robbery and udaa consisted of few common elements, and that, more fundamentally, they were not of the same class or category of offenses. 200 Mich App 68; 503 NW2d 689 (1993). On the defendant\u2019s application, we granted leave to appeal. 444 Mich 973 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The duty of the trial judge to instruct the jury is provided by statute. Pursuant to MCL 768.29; MSA 28.1052, a jury must be instructed regarding the law applicable to the case; however, any verdict rendered will not be set aside because of the failure to instruct the jury on any point of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>unless the defendant requests such instruction. Because the defendant here properly requested that instruction be given to the jury on the felony of udaa, we focus our attention on whether the refusal to give such instruction was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">While examination of the law controlling the propriety of lesser included offense instructions in Michigan normally reaches back only to 1975, the doctrine developed at common law much earlier. Lesser included offense instructions originally were intended to assist in the prosecution of cases where there was a deficiency in the proof of some element of the principal crime charged. <em>Keeble v United States, </em>412 US 205, 208; 93 S Ct 1993; 36 L Ed 2d 844 (1973). Application of the common-law doctrine is readily apparent in early Michigan case law, in which instruction on lesser offenses requested by the prosecution was allowed if the information charging the greater, principal offense included allegations supporting a lesser offense. See, e.g., <em>People v McDonald, </em>9 Mich 150, 152 (1861), overruled on other grounds by <em>People v Worrell, </em>417 Mich 617; 340 NW2d 612 (1983) (consent is relevant to a charge of assault to commit statutory rape) but see <em>id. </em>at 623 (Boyle, J., dissenting) (\"It is a general rule of criminal law, that a jury may acquit of the principal charge, and find the prisoner guilty of an offense of lesser grade, if contained within it\u201d); <em>Hanna v People, </em>19 Mich 316 (1869) (affirmed a conviction for assault and battery where the defendant was acquitted of the principal charge of assault with intent to murder). Express allowance for the jury to find a defendant guilty of an inferior degree of an offense is pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>ently provided by statute. MCL 768.32; MSA 28.1055.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Although originating as an aid to prosecution, it is clear th\u00e1t the lesser included offense doctrine has evolved to allow defendants to request instruction on such offenses. <em>Keeble, supra </em>at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The current rule for lesser included offense instructions in Michigan is set forth in <em>People v Ora Jones, supra </em>at 390:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">The duty of the trial judge to instruct on lesser included offenses is determined by the evidence. If evidence has been presented which would support a conviction of a lesser included offense, refusal to give a requested instruction is reversible error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">If the lesser offense is one that is necessarily included within the greater, the evidence will always support the lesser if it supports the greater.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">In the area of \"cognate\u201d lesser offenses, the evidence in each case adduced at the particular trial must be examined to determine whether that evidence would support a conviction of the lesser offense. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">It was also noted in <em>Ora Jones </em>that to warrant instruction of a jury on a lesser included offense, the lesser offense should be \"of the same class or category, or closely related to the originally charged offense . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>requirement does not provide a meaningful restriction on instruction requests for necessarily included lesser offenses, it is essential in limiting the proper scope of cognate offenses for which instruction may be given.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\"><em>Ora Jones </em>articulates rules for determining when to give lesser offense instruction for both \"necessarily included\u201d and \"cognate\u201d lesser offenses. \"Necessarily included\u201d lesser offenses encompass situations in which it is impossible to commit the greater offense without first having committed the lesser. <em>Ora Jones, supra </em>at 387. \"Cognate\u201d lesser included offenses are those that share some common elements, and are of the same class or category as the greater offense, but have some additional elements not found in the greater offense. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The parties do not dispute that the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>before us concerns a possible cognate offense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, further inquiry is limited to the requisite elements necessitating instruction on this type of lesser offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In order to require a properly requested instruction for a cognate lesser included offense, two elements must be satisfied. First, the principal offense and the lesser offense must be of the same class or category, a requirement we have termed in a related context to be one of an \"inherent relationship.\u201d <em>People v Stephens, </em>416 Mich 252, 262; 330 NW2d 675 (1982); <em>People v Steele, </em>429 Mich 13; 412 NW2d 206 (1987). Second, the evidence adduced at trial \"must be examined to determine whether that evidence would support a conviction of the lesser offense.\u201d <em>Ora Jones, supra </em>at 390, <em>People v Pouncey, </em>437 Mich 382, 387; 471 NW2d 346 (1991), and <em>People v Beach, </em>429 Mich 450, 464; 418 NW2d 861 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">In addition to separate tests for determining the propriety of necessarily and cognate lesser included offense instructions, we have also articulated a distinct test for determining when a requested instruction on a lesser included mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>demeanor should be given.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Included as an element of that test is a requirement that there be an \"inherent relationship\u201d between the greater and lesser offense. <em>People v Stephens, supra </em>at 262, <em>People v Steele, supra </em>at 19. The Court in <em>Stephens </em>cited the requirement in <em>Ora Jones, supra </em>at 390, that there be a \"common purpose\u201d protecting the \"same societal interest\u201d for instruction on cognate offenses as an alternative statement of the inherent relationship element of the misdemeanor analysis. The basis for the <em>Stephens </em>and <em>Steele </em>inherent relationship element is instructive in understanding the need for a correlation between a charged offense and a requested lesser offense in the cognate offense setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">As detailed in the misdemeanor lesser offense analysis, an inherent relationship between a greater and lesser offense requires that the two offenses \" 'relate to the protection of the same interests\u2019 \u201d and \" 'must be so related that in the general nature of these crimes, though not necessarily invariably, proof of the lesser offense is necessarily presented as part of the showing of the commission of the greater offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stephens, supra </em>at 262, quoting <em>United States v Whitaker, </em>144 US App DC 344, 349; 447 F2d 314 (1971).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>Stephens, </em>we simply stated that the inherent relationship test was \"required to prevent misuse of lesser included offense instructions by the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262. In <em>Steele, </em>we acknowledged with approval the more expansive explanation of the inherent relationship test from <em>Whitaker:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">\"In the absence of such restraint defense counsel might be tempted to press the jury for leniency by requesting lesser included offense instructions on every lesser crime that could arguably be made out from any evidence that happened to be introduced at trial. 'An element of the mercy-dispensing power is doubtless inherent in the jury system, and may well be a reason why a defendant seeks a lesser included offense instruction, but it is not by itself a permissible basis to justify such instruction.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Steele, supra </em>at 20, n 4, quoting <em>Whitaker, supra </em>at 349. Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">We continue to uphold the requirement for an inherent relationship between a charged offense and a cognate lesser offense for instruction, and similarly approve of the underlying rationale for such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The object of a criminal trial is a determination of the question whether the defendant has committed the crime charged or some related offense on the basis of evidence presented relating to the event or events in question at trial. Additionally, determination of what crime, if any, a defendant is guilty of is necessary so that the proper punishment may be imposed. In order to achieve this end, especially in a jury trial, clarity must be maintained regarding those crimes for which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>defendant may be convicted. As the United States Supreme Court has observed, albeit in a different context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">The absence of a lesser included offense instruction increases the risk that the jury will convict, not because it is persuaded that the defendant is guilty of capital murder, but simply to avoid setting the defendant free. . . . The goal . . ., in other words, is to eliminate' the distortion of the factfinding process .... <em>[Spaziano v Florida, </em>468 US 447, 455; 104 S Ct 3154; 82 L Ed 2d 340 (1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">However, unless there is some evidentiary protection against an appeal to the jury\u2019s mercy-dispensing power, it is likely that the evidence introduced will be \"whatever manner of evidence ... of use in obtaining a charge on the least punitive lesser included offense possible in order that the jury may have the opportunity to be merciful.\u201d Ettinger, <em>In search of a reasoned approach to the lesser included offense, </em>50 Brooklyn LR 191, 217 (1984). To preserve the jury\u2019s proper function, the bounds of possible offenses the jury may consider in a particular case must be described. In the case of cognate lesser offenses, the method of management adopted by this Court is to limit instruction to those offenses that bear a sufficient relationship to the principal charge in that they are in the same class or category, protect the same societal interests as that offense, and are supported by the evidence adduced at trial. Thus, not all lesser offenses that are not necessarily included are potential candidates for consideration as cognate crimes. If the jury\u2019s mercy-dispensing power is unrestrained, attention to the factfinding duty may be diverted, and the jury may assume the punishment prerogative of the court. The guidance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>provided by an inherent relationship requirement helps to keep the jury focused upon its charge.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The initial inquiry then, where jury instruction on a possible cognate lesser included offense has been requested, is whether the lesser offense bears an inherent relationship to, or is of the same class or category as the charged offense. This requirement in the present case dictates that we examine the statutory purpose behind udaa and armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Udaa, more commonly known as \"joyriding,\u201d was enacted soon after the appearance of the automobile to protect against the unauthorized use of those vehicles. The statute was not aimed at preventing theft, because under such circumstances our larceny statutes would suffice.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It was rather directed toward an annoying, but relatively harmless type of trespass, aptly described in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>trial court charge quoted in <em>People v Stanley, </em>349 Mich 362, 364-365; 84 NW2d 787 (1957):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">\"It was early discovered that so many automobiles would be taken, but without intent to permanently deprive the owner of the possession of his property, but merely for the sake of joyriding or something of that kind and then abandoning the cars, so the legislature created this crime, and they called it unlawfully driving away an automobile, and it differs from larceny in that respect, that is, it is not necessary that the State should establish in this type of case any specific intent to permanently deprive the owner of the possession of his property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">In light of this lower standard of intent, udaa requires only that the unauthorized use of the vehicle be done \" 'wilfully\u2019 \u201d or \" 'wilfully and wantonly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stanley, supra </em>at 365, quoting <em>People v Smith, </em>213 Mich 351, 353; 182 NW 64 (1921). See also Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed), p 333. We thus characterize the statutory purpose of the udaa statute as punishment and deterrence of the trespassory taking and use of property, placing it within the class or category of property offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Robbery, while containing elements of theft of property, is primarily an assaultive crime. <em>People v Wakeford, </em>418 Mich 95; 341 NW2d 68 (1983) (robbery of two cashiers in one grocery store constitutes two separate and distinct offenses under the armed robbery statute), <em>People v Allen, </em>429 Mich 558; 420 NW2d 499 (1988). \"Robbery violates the social interest in the safety and security of the person as well as the social interest in the protection of property rights. In fact, as. a matter of abstract classification, it probably should be grouped with offenses against the person . . . .\u201d Perkins &amp; Boyce, <em>supra, </em>p 350. Classification as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>offense against a person is particularly appropriate where the robbery is committed with the aggravating element, of the perpetrator being armed. In this situation, the safety and security of the person is most severely threatened, and the larcenous taking is of secondary importance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">[T]he gravamen of the offense [of armed robbery] is the armed assault on a person when combined with the taking of money or property. The primary purpose of the statute is the protection of persons; the protection of property afforded by the statute is not significantly greater than that afforded by the statute prohibiting larceny from the person of another .... [Wakeford, <em>supra </em>at 111.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Recognizing the aggravating elements of assault and an armed perpetrator required for armed robbery, we agree with the rationale of Wakeford, and conclude that such an offense is most properly classified under the category of crimes against the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">This analysis leads to the conclusion that udaa and armed robbery are not of the same class or category, and that udaa is not a possible cognate offense where the primary offense charged is armed robbery. Udaa, while a property offense, lies within a hierarchy in line with, but below, the outer reaches of larceny. While bearing some relationship to theft, it requires no larcenous intent. Armed robbery also bears some secondary relationship to larceny, but is principally directed at protection of the person. That crime evinces a primary concern for the threat to the safety of the individual inherent in the manner chosen by the perpetrator to accomplish his larcenous end.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Whatever distant association the two offenses may have through their relationship to larceny is simply too tenuous to allow us to conclude that udaa and armed robbery are of the sanie class or character as required for cognate offense instruction. We therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming defendant Hendricks conviction of larceny from a person on this basis. 200 Mich App 71. Because we dispose of the present case on this basis, we need not consider if the evidence presented at trial would support conviction of the lesser offense of udaa.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Applying the requirement for instruction on cognate lesser included offenses that the principal offense and the lesser crime be of the same class or category, or be closely related, we find that armed robbery and udaa do not possess the requisite inherent relationship necessary to consider the possibility of such instruction. Udaa is a property offense, aimed exclusively at deterring and punishing joyriding. Armed robbery, while including the elements of larceny, is a crime against the person, concerned primarily with the safety and protection of the individual. The offenses pertain to distinct criminal behavior and are thus different classes or categories of crimes. We accordingly affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b529-6\">Riley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\"> MCL 750.413; MSA 28.645 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">Any person who shall, wilfully and without authority, take possession of and drive or take away, and any person who shall assist in or be a party to such taking possession, driving or taking away of any motor vehicle, belonging to another, shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than 5 years.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b515-10\"> MCL 750.529; MSA 28.797.

This definition includes only <em>necessarily </em>included lesser offenses. This definition, however, is generally conceded to be unduly restrictive, and thus most jurisdictions, including Michigan, have statutes that are broadly construed to permit conviction of \"cognate\u201d or allied offenses of the same nature, under a sufficient charge. These lesser offenses are related and hence \"cognate\u201d in the sense that they share several elements, and are of the same class or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>category, but may contain some elements not found in the higher offense. <em>[People v Ora Jones, </em>395 Mich 379, 387; 236 NW2d 461 (1975).

The \"inherent relationship\u201d requirement finds its roots in federal case law.

Indeed, our conditions parallel the <em>Whitaker </em>reasoning. Although we do not follow the federal approach for lesser included felony offenses, we do so in the separate misdemeanor realm. This distinction must be made because the federal courts acknowledge <em>only </em>necessarily lesser included offenses; cognate offenses instructions are simply not allowed. Hence, instructions for lesser misde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>meanor offenses are less freely given .... <em>[Steele </em>at 19.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The \"inherent relationship\u201d requirement is not simply an alternative term for the \"same class or category\u201d requirement. This is evidenced by the majority\u2019s own explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">[A]n inherent relationship between a greater and lesser offense requires that the two offenses \" 'relate to the protection of the same interests\u2019 \u201d and \" 'must be so related that in the general nature of these crimes, though not necessarily invariably, <em>proof of the lesser offense is necessaril</em>y <em>presented as part of the showing of the commission of the greater offense.\u2019 \u201d [Ante </em>at 445. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Although the Michigan standard for cognate lesser included felony offenses speaks in terms of the earlier requirement, it does not require the latter. In essence, the second requirement describes a <em>necessarily </em>included offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s inclusion of the latter requirement changes the equation and unduly restricts the instances in which a trial judge will be compelled to instruct on a lesser included felony offense. While the majority asserts that \"[t]he basis for the ... inherent relationship element is instructive in understanding the need for a correlation between a charged offense and a requested lesser offense in the cognate offense setting,\u201d it goes beyond \"instruction,\u201d instead eroding the nearly twenty-year-old standard of <em>Ora Jones.

Admittedly, the crime of robbery is an assaultive crime, but it does include an element of theft similar to udaa.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Both offenses share the common purpose of deterring the deprivation of the use and enjoyment of property (even if only for a short time frame).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Robbery falls into two catego<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>r\u00edes \u2014 property offenses and crimes against the person.

The question remains whether the error was harmless. <em>People v Mosko, </em>441 Mich 496, 501-502; 495 NW2d 534 (1992); <em>People v Beach, </em>429 Mich 450, 466; 418 NW2d 861 (1988).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Generally, the refusal to give an instruction on a lesser included offense is considered harmless if the jury finds the defendant guilty of a greater charge as opposed to an <em>instructed </em>intermediate charge. <em>Mosko </em>at 504, <em>Beach </em>at 490-491. The Court justifies this rule by reasoning that if the jury had doubts about the defendant\u2019s guilt of the charged offense, it would have found the defendant guilty of the <em>instructed </em>lesser included offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">This rule is not applicable in the instant case, however, because the jury found the defendant guilty of the lowest crime on which it was instructed (larceny from a person). Furthermore, there is no evidence that the element that would have reduced the crime from the higher to the lesser offense was not at issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the case at bar, the defendant asserted that he did not intend to steal the car, but he took it temporarily to escape those trying to harm him. In light of the jury\u2019s reluctance to convict the defendant of the charged offense and the presence of evidence that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>support a conviction of the offense of udaa, I could not consider the error harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Accordingly, I would reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction of larceny from a person and remand the case to the trial court for entry of a judgment of conviction of udaa and resentencing.
