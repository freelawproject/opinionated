We further hold that State Farm is subject to liability under the policy to the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, who was an innocent insured, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the inconsistent provisions were not contained in the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Dennis Borman commenced this action against State Farm as personal representative of the estate of Lillian Roach to recover for the loss of personal property belonging to Roach' that was destroyed in December, 1988, by a fire at an adult foster care home that her grandson, Gary Borman, was purchasing on land contract. The fire was set or arranged to be set by Gary Borman or persons in privity with him. Roach was not complicit in the wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The circuit court granted summary disposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>for State Farm relying on the basis of language in the policy excluding coverage for intentional wrongful acts by \"any insured,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman, </em>432 Mich 656; 443 NW2d 734 (1989). The Court of Appeals reversed, relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morgan v Cincinnati Ins Co, </em>411 Mich 267, 276; 307 NW2d 53 (1981).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In <em>Morgan, </em>Helen and Robert Morgan owned a home as tenants by the entireties. The home was extensively damaged by a fire started by Robert Morgan. Divorce proceedings were then pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The insurer claimed that the policy was voided when Robert Morgan intentionally started the fire.

The Court said: \"both the statutory law and judicial decisions have aimed at making certain that the interests of every insured are protected.\u201d The Court said that it was \"moved to limit the rule of law articulated in Monaghan.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALP\">This Court rejected the insurer\u2019s contention that \"the insured\u201d should be read as <em>\"any </em>insured,\u201d with the result that the entire policy would be void if any insured committed fraud. The Court in <em>Morgan </em>said \"[w]e believe such a reading is unwar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ranted,\u201d and read \"the insured\u201d as voiding the policy only in the event of fraud by the insured who committed the fraud. This Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">We . . . hold that the provision voiding the policy in the event of fraud by \"the insured\u201d is to be read as having application only to the insured who committed the fraud and makes claim under the policy. The provision has no application to any other person described in the policy as an insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">Henceforth whenever the statutory clause limiting the insurer\u2019s liability in case of fraud by the insured is used it will be read to bar only the claim of an insured who has committed the fraud and will not be read to bar the claim of any insured under the policy who is innocent of fraud.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">State Farm contends.that <em>Morgan </em>does not govern disposition of this case because the homeowner\u2019s policy provides that the policy is void \"as to you or any other insured\u201d if any person insured under the policy causes or procures a loss to property covered under the policy for the purpose of obtaining insurance benefits, or intentionally conceals or misrepresents any material fact or circumstance and provides that in such event the insurer \"will not pay you or any other insured for this loss.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">In Morgan, the insurer claimed that the first sentence of the standard policy bars recovery by an insured who seeks to defraud the insurer and by' any other person insured under the policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>including an insured who is innocent of wrongdoing. This Court responded that the language of the standard policy applies only to the insured who committed the fraud and has no application to any other person insured under the policy. This Court thus read the standard policy as providing in effect for recovery by an innocent insured under that statutorily mandated fire policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The provisions in the homeowner\u2019s policy relied on by State Farm cover the same subject matter, fraud on the insurer, as the first sentence of the standard policy. While the standard policy contemplates \"[a]dded provisions\u201d \u2014 \"any other provision or agreement <em>not inconsistent </em>with the provisions\u201d of the standard policy<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 because the provisions of the homeowner\u2019s policy relied on by State Farm cover the same subject matter as the first sentence of the standard policy, and provide for less coverage to innocent insureds than is mandated under the first sentence as construed by this Court in <em>Morgan, </em>the provisions of the homeowner\u2019s policy relied on by State Farm are \"inconsistent with the provisions\u201d of the standard policy and hence \"absolutely void.\u201d Thus, State Farm is liable to Lillian Roach\u2019s estate, insofar as fire insurance coverage is involved, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the inconsistent provisions were not contained in the policy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">State Farm contends that <em>Morgan </em>was incorrectly decided. There were two opinions in <em>Morgan. </em>The concurring opinion, like the opinion for the Court, permitted recovery by the innocent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>spouse.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We have considered State Farm\u2019s arguments, and the analysis set forth in <em>Morgan, </em>and are not persuaded to change the rule there set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman, supra, </em>is not implicated. The language there construed was \"an insured\u201d rather than \"the insured.\u201d The insurance policy in that case was not a fire insurance policy subject to the strictures of \u00a7 2832 establishing a standard policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">In the years following this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morgan, </em>the Legislature frequently amended the Insurance Code, but did not specifically respond to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morgan. </em>In 1990, the Legislature repealed \u00a7 2832, but may have, advertently or inadvertently, reenacted \u00a7 2832.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section 2833(2), added in 1990, requires that each fire insurance policy \"shall contain, at a minimum, the coverage provided in the standard fire policy under former section 2832.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Because the loss in the instant case occurred before the January 1, 1992, effective date of repeal of \"former \u00a7 2832,\u201d we need not and cannot now decide whether the coverage provided in the homeowner\u2019s policy issued by State Farm is less than the \"coverage provided in the standard fire policy under former section 2832\u201d as a result of the provisions relied on by State Farm stating in effect that an innocent insured may not recover for a loss intentionally caused by another insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">State Farm and amicus curiae Auto Club Group Insurance Company contend that barring recovery by innocent insureds is necessary to address the problems of affordability and cost control for the insurer and the consumer. State Farm asserts that when a home is destroyed by fire, State Farm usually incurs a net loss after the mortgage holder or loss payee is paid and any litigation is successfully defended. It contends that homeowner\u2019s insurance will become more affordable if the equity of innocent coinsureds is forfeited to fire insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao1\">Amici curiae on behalf of innocent coinsureds<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>contend that many cases of homeowners\u2019 arson are related to domestic violence, and an inability of the innocent spouse to recover insurance proceeds may increase the guilty party\u2019s incentive to commit arson.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We do not rest decision on any resolution of the merits of that policy debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">We have reviewed the case law in other jurisdictions and find support for the view set forth in <em>Morgan </em>in cases construing \"the insured\u201d where a standard policy is prescribed by the legislature in <em>Osbon v Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins Co, </em>632 So 2d 1158, 1160 (La, 1994); <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins Co v Dean, </em>212 Ga App 262, 265; 441 SE2d 436 (1994); <em>Hogs Unlimited v Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co, </em>401 NW2d 381, 384 (Minn, 1987); <em>Ponder </em>v <em>Allstate Ins Co, </em>729 F Supp 60 (ED Mich, 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">We recognize that courts in other jurisdictions have enforced against innocent insureds contractual provisions voiding policies for fraud, concealment, or intentional acts by \"an\u201d or \"any\u201d insured, but in none of these cases did the court advert to any conflict with a standard policy prescribing a provision voiding the policy because of the wrongful conduct of \"the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b571-6\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Boyle and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b571-7\">Griffin, J. I respectfully dissent.</judges>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Defendant State Farm\u2019s fire insurance policy precludes recovery by \"any insured\u201d if a coinsured has \"intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact\u201d; the Michigan standard policy precluded recovery by \"the insured.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See MCL 500.2832; MSA 24.12832. Plaintiff Borman argues on appeal that use of the term \"any insured\u201d in defendant\u2019s policy violates the legislative intent underlying the standardized stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>utory policy. The majority has adopted plaintiff\u2019s reasoning and holds that the policy must not be construed to deny coverage to an innocent co-insured for the intentional wrongs of another insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">However, I view this case from a different perspective. The real question is whether the statute, particularly MCL 500.2806(2); MSA 24.12806(2) and MCL 500.2832; MSA 24.12832, permitted modification of the statutorily mandated fire insurance policy so as to change the ambiguous term \"the insured\u201d to \"any insured,\u201d as well as to create a new policy exclusion for intentional acts of \"any person insured under the policy.\u201d Because the modifications reflected in the policy at issue are unambiguous and consistent with the statutory scheme, I would hold that the term \"any insured,\u201d as it is used in this policy, precludes recovery by an innocent coinsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Resolution of the question before us requires analysis of the relevant contract and statutory provisions. The policy at issue excludes coverage when \"any\u201d insured intentionally conceals or misrepresents material facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">Concealment or Fraud. This policy is void as to you and <em>any other insured, </em>if you or <em>any other insured </em>under this policy has intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance relating to this insurance, whether before or after a loss. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The policy also excludes coverage to \"any insured\u201d when another coinsured causes or procures a loss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">Intentional Acts. If you or <em>any person </em>insured under this policy causes or procures a loss to property covered under this policy for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>of obtaining insurance benefits, then this policy is void and we will not pay you or <em>any other insured </em>for this loss. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">MCL 500.2806; MSA 24.12806 required insurers that issue fire policies in Michigan to adopt the \"Michigan Standard Policy\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">(1) The printed form of a policy of fire insurance, as set forth in section 2832, shall be known and designated as the \"Michigan Standard Policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">(2) No policy or contract of fire insurance shall be made, issued or delivered by any insurer or by any agent or representative thereof, on any property in this state, unless it shall conform as to all provisions, stipulations, agreements and conditions, with such form of policy.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The origin of Michigan\u2019s standard policy can be traced to the establishment in New York of the National Board of Fire Underwriters, in the nineteenth century. Under the board\u2019s auspices, the first standard policy was drafted in 1886. Later, that policy became known as the \"old\u201d New York policy or the \"112 line\u201d policy. Since then, New York has drafted and adopted two new standard contracts: the 1926 \"200 line\u201d policy and the 1943 \"165 line\u201d policy. Most states (forty-two), including Michigan, have adopted the 1943 \"165 line\u201d policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It includes this pertinent provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">Concealment, fraud. This entire policy shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>void if, whether before or after a loss, <em>the insured </em>has wilfully concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance concerning this insurance or the subject thereof, or the interest of the insured therein, or in case of any fraud or false swearing by the insured relating thereto. [MCL 500.2832; MSA 24.12832.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">This fraud provision in the Michigan standard policy has been interpreted by this Court to allow recovery by an innocent coinsured despite the wrongdoing of another coinsured. <em>Morgan v Cincinnati Ins Co, </em>411 Mich 267; 307 NW2d 53 (1981). In <em>Morgan, </em>the plaintiff and her husband owned a home, as tenants by the entireties, that was insured by the defendant. The husband purposely set fire to the home, causing extensive damage. The insurer refused to pay the plaintiff, claiming that because she and her husband owned inseparable interests in the property as tenants by the entire-ties, the husband\u2019s fraud was imputed to the plaintiff. The insurer further argued that the standard policy at issue, which incorporated \"the insured\u201d language of \u00a7 2832, precluded coverage of the plaintiff. Applying \u00a7 2832 to the fire insurance policy, the <em>Morgan </em>Court resolved the ambiguity of the statutory term \"the insured\u201d in favor of the plaintiff and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">The insurer in this case would have us read this provision as if it stated \"[t]his entire policy shall be void if . . . <em>any </em>person <em>insured\u201d </em>has committed fraud. We believe such a reading is unwarranted, and hold that the provision voiding the policy in the event of fraud by <em>\"the insured\u201d </em>is to be read as having application only to the insured who committed the fraud and makes claim under the pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>icy. The provision has no application to any other person described in the policy as an insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\">Henceforth whenever the statutory clause limiting the insurer\u2019s liability in case of fraud by <em>the insured </em>is used it will be read to bar only the claim of an insured who has committed the fraud and will not be read to bar the claim of any insured under the policy who is innocent of fraud. <em>[Morgan, supra, </em>pp 276-277. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Obviously, <em>Morgan </em>did not address the effect of \u00a7 2832 or other provisions of the Insurance Code in the present context where more explicit and unambiguous policy language has been used. Rather, it dealt only with the limited situation in which the statutory language of \u00a7 2832 was set forth verbatim in an insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">We do not read this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morgan </em>as mandating coverage for all innocent coinsureds under all circumstances. Indeed, <em>Morgan </em>took pains to provide instruction concerning the use of unambiguous language in policy provisions governing innocent coinsureds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">We. no longer consider the application of the theory of implied suretyship appropriate in insurance law. <em>In Michigan limitations on recovery-under an insurance policy must be clearly stated in the contract. </em>The implication of a mutual obligation of suretyship among several insured persons is in effect a limitation on recovery by implication and not to be permitted under Michigan law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">Furthermore, since the provision quoted above does not expressly create a joint obligation of suretyship, to read the fraud provision as creating one would be contrary to the reasonable expectations of an insured. <em>An ordinary person seeing his or her name included in an insurance contract </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>without limiting language would suppose his or her interest to be covered. </em>It appears that the instant policy names \"Robert Morgan and Helen Morgan,\u201d without more, as the insured under the policy. <em>[Id., </em>p 277. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In response to <em>Morgan, </em>defendant, as well as many other insurers, have revised their fire policies to make the language unambiguous. As a result, defendant\u2019s policy includes an intentional act provision, and language in the fraud provision has been modified to make clear that it applies to \"any insured,\u201d rather than to \"the insured,\u201d thereby rectifying the <em>Morgan </em>concern that the \"the insured\u201d language was not sufficiently explicit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">When the language of an insurance policy is clear and unambiguous, the contract should be enforced. <em>Fresard v Michigan Millers Mutual Ins Co, </em>414 Mich 686, 693-694; 327 NW2d 286 (1982); <em>Raska v Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co, </em>412 Mich 355, 361-362; 314 NW2d 440 (1982). Here, the policy\u2019s language excluding coverage for the concealment or fraud by \"you or any other insured\u201d unambiguously excludes an insured, even an innocent one. This Court has already interpreted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>term \"any insured\u201d to include an innocent insured. Cf. <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman, </em>432 Mich 656, 692-700; 443 NW2d 734 (1989). See also <em>Allstate, supra, </em>p 748 (Cavanagh, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Moreover, while the insurance commissioner can reject insurance contracts that conflict with the statute, <em>Franklin Life Ins Co v Comm\u2019r of Ins, </em>159 Mich 636; 124 NW 522 (1910), the commissioner explicitly approved the instant policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Evidence of approval by the commissioner \"should be somewhat persuasive of its compliance with the statute.\u201d <em>Drogula v Federal Life Ins Co, </em>248 Mich 645, 648; 227 NW 692 (1929); <em>Progressive Mutual Ins Co v Taylor, </em>35 Mich App 633, 643; 193 NW2d 54 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Plaintiif maintains, nonetheless, that approval by the commissioner cannot overcome the \"intention of the language of the Legislature . . . .\u201d <em>Ponder v Allstate Ins Co, </em>729 F Supp 60, 62 (ED Mich, 1990). Our attention has been called to no evidence that the Legislature even contemplated whether an innocent coinsured could recover despite the wrongdoing of another insured. Instead, a reading of the entire statutory standard policy strongly suggests that the Legislature was concerned about the problem of fraud and the need to keep homeowner insurance affordable. We further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>note that in adopting the \"165 line\u201d Michigan standard policy, the Legislature provided no indication of intent to change the existing Michigan jurisprudence on the point here at issue. Before <em>Morgan, </em>an \"attempt to defraud the company by any one of the insured, by the making of false affidavits in relation to loss, is a complete bar to a recovery upon the policy.\u201d <em>Monaghan v Agriculture Fire Ins Co of Watertown, NY, </em>53 Mich 238, 254; 18 NW 797 (1884). Thus, we suggest that this Court should view approval by the commissioner as evidence of compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Additionally, this Court should look to the statutorily mandated policy itself, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">This policy is made and accepted subject to the foregoing provisions and stipulations and those hereinafter stated, which are hereby made a part of this policy, <em>together with such other provisions, stipulations and agreements as may be added hereto, </em>as provided in this policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">Added provisions. The extent of the application of insurance under this policy and of the contribution to be made by this Company in case of loss, and <em>any other provision or agreement not inconsistent with the provisions of this policy, may be provided for in writing added hereto, </em>but no provision may be waived except such as by the terms of this policy is subject to change. [MCL 500.2832; MSA 24.12832.
