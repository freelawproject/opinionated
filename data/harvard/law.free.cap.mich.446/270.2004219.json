She and Brian Krawczyk, a white male who worked as a welder in the same department, were members of the United Auto Workers Union Local No. 157, and were covered by a collective-bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">As a quality control measure, pursued with approval of the union, defendant required a group of six welders, including plaintiff and Mr. Krawczyk, to attend classes for four weeks at Weld Tech Welding Education Center.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A letter of un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>derstanding,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> signed by defendant and the union, provided that each of these employees was required to \"successfully conclude [the course of] training to be considered as qualified to retain seniority within the Welder\u2019s Classification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">On March 14, 1983, Mr. Krawczyk completed a segment of the course and took a welding test. His instructor advised defendant that Mr. Krawczyk had passed. However, after he had completed the course and returned to work, defendant was notified by Weld Tech that the earlier report was an error and that Mr. Krawczyk had actually failed a portion of the examination. As a result, Mr. Krawczyk lost his seniority within 'the classification and was laid off.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In the meantime, plaintiff had also taken the welding course at Weld Tech and passed. At that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>point, she stood higher on the seniority list than Mr. Krawczyk.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Mr. Krawczyk complained to the union, which in turn complained to defendant\u2019s management that if he had been timely informed of his failure, he could have retaken the test before completion of the course. Management determined that the treatment was unfair, and on April 12, 1983, Mr. Krawczyk was allowed to return to Weld Tech and retake the test. This time he passed and his seniority was reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Thereafter, on December 17, 1984, plaintiff and Mr. Krawczyk each applied for the same shift preference. According to defendant, the preference was awarded to Mr. Krawczyk in accordance with the collective-bargaining agreement because his seniority ranking was higher.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiff complained to the union, which refused to file a grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Plaintiff then filed this discrimination suit, claiming that a similarly situated white male employee with less qualifications and lower seniority was awarded the shift preference. While the group required to take the Weld Tech course included both blacks and whites, plaintiff asserts that all of the whites passed the test except one, Brian Krawczyk, and that all of the blacks failed the test except one, plaintiff* Carnell Betty. She further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>contends that black employees who failed also retook the test and passed; however, they were placed at the bottom of the seniority list.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">At the close of discovery, defendant moved for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(4), (8), and (10), and argued, inter alia, that plaintiff\u2019s discrimination claim was preempted by \u00a7 301 of the lmra.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The circuit court granted defendant\u2019s motion on the narrow ground of \u00a7 301 preemption and found it unnecessary to address the other issues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">On appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The panel majority opined that the \"question to be resolved is a factual one regarding the motivation of defendant, and not the legal one of interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement,\u201d citing <em>Hall v Kelsey-Hayes Co, </em>184 Mich App 277, 280; 457 NW2d 143 (1990).

At issue was whether a suit in state court seeking \"damages for business losses caused by [a union] strike\u201d could be decided by the application of state contract law. <em>Id. </em>at 97. Because resolution of the dispute turned on . the question whether the strike breached the collective-bargaining agreement, the Court held that \"incompatible doctrines of local law must give way to principles of federal labor law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102. In broad terms, the Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">The dimensions of \u00a7 301 require the conclusion that substantive principles of federal labor law must be paramount in the area covered by the statute. Comprehensiveness is inherent in the process by which the law is to be formulated under - the mandate of <em>Lincoln Mills, </em>requiring issues raised in suits of a kind covered by \u00a7 301 to be decided according to the precepts of federal labor policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>More important, the subject matter of \u00a7 301(a) \"is peculiarly one that calls for uniform law.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 103.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">While <em>Lucas Flour </em>made clear that a state action that alleges breach of a collective-bargaining agreement is preempted by \u00a7 301,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Court\u2019s subsequent task of delineating the extent to which \u00a7 301 displaces state-law claims when breach of a collective-bargaining agreement is not specifically alleged has proved to be more difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">In <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp v Lueck, supra </em>at 210, the Court observed that \"[i]f the policies that animate \u00a7 301 are to be given their proper range, . . . the pre-emptive effect of \u00a7 301 must extend beyond suits alleging contract violations.\u201d While acknowledging that some tort actions must be preempted to achieve the desired uniformity in the interpretation of labor contracts,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>took pains to explain that the reach of \u00a7 301 preemption has limits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\">In extending the pre-emptive effect of \u00a7 301 beyond suits for breach of contract, it would be inconsistent with congressional intent ... to preempt state rules that proscribe conduct, or establish rights and obligations, independent of a labor contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">Therefore, state-law rights and obligations that do not exist independently of private agreements, and that as a result can be waived or altered by agreement of private parties, are pre-empted by those agreements. <em>[Id. </em>at 212-213.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In resolving the case then before it, the <em>Lueck </em>Court articulated this standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">Our analysis must focus ... on whether the [state] tort action . . . confers <em>nonnegotiable </em>state-law rights on employers or employees <em>independent </em>of any right established by contract, or, instead, whether evaluation of the tort claim is <em>inextricably intertwined </em>with consideration of the terms of the labor contract. If the state tort law purports to define the meaning of the contract relationship, that law is pre-empted, [Id. at 213. Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">In <em>Lingle v Norge Div of Magic Chef, Inc, supra </em>at 413, the Supreme Court again emphasized the limits of \u00a7 301 preemption. In a unanimous decision, the Court ruled that \"application of state law is pre-empted by \u00a7 301 . . . only if such application requires the interpretation of a collective-bargaining agreement.\u201d The Court observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s retaliatory discharge claim under Illinois law required a factual determination regarding \"the conduct of the employee and the conduct and motivation of the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407. Because \"this purely factual inquiry . . . does not turn on the meaning of any provision of a collective-bargaining agreement,\u201d the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">[T]he state-law remedy in this case is \"independent\u201d of the collective-bargaining agreement in the sense of \"independent\u201d that matters for \u00a7 301 preemption purposes: resolution of the state-law claim does not require construing the collective-bargaining agreement. <em>[Id. </em>at 407.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">It has been suggested that development of the scope of preemption under \u00a7 301 has been driven, in part, by an effort to make certain that \" 'parties [are not allowed] to evade the requirements of \u00a7 301 by relabeling their contract claims as claims for tortious breach of contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>United Steelworkers of America v Rawson, </em>495 US 362, 369; 110 S Ct 1904; 109 L Ed 2d 362 (1990) (quoting <em>Lueck, supra </em>at 211).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Guided by these general principles and parameters, we turn now to an analysis of the issue before us \u2014 whether resolution of plaintiff\u2019s state civil rights claim requires interpretation of the collective-bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">We begin by focusing on the essential elements of the state-law claim advanced by plaintiff. She complains that a similarly situated, nonblack male <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>employee with less qualifications and lower seniority received special treatment by defendant during the testing process, in violation of her rights protected by the Michigan Civil Rights Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In order to establish a prima facie case of \"[d]isparate treatment\u201d race discrimination, a plaintiff \"must show that [she] was a member of the class entitled to protection under the act and that, for the same or similar conduct, [she] was treated differently than one who was a member of a different race.\u201d <em>Schipani v Ford Motor Co, </em>102 Mich App 606, 617; 302 NW2d 307 (1981) (citing <em>Pompey v General Motors Corp, </em>385 Mich 537; 189 NW2d 243 [1971]). Likewise, \"the essence of a sex discrimination civil rights suit is that similarly situated people have been treated differently because of their sex.\u201d <em>Radtke v Everett, </em>442 Mich 368, 379; 501 NW2d 155 (1993). See also <em>Marsh v Dep\u2019t of Civil Service (After Remand), </em>173 Mich App 72; 433 NW2d 820 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Plaintiff argues that resolution of her state discrimination claim turns on a factual determination regarding defendant\u2019s conduct and motivation in allowing Mr. Krawczyk to retake the welding test and in reinstating his seniority. Contending that her claim can be resolved without interpreting the collective-bargaining agreement, plaintiff posits that it is \"independent\u201d of the agreement and not preempted by \u00a7 301. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Highly instructive is a statement by the <em>Lingle </em>Court that acknowledges the unique character of a state discrimination claim:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>In the typical case a state tribunal could resolve either a <em>discriminatory </em>or retaliatory discharge claim without interpreting the \"just cause\u201d language of a collective-bargaining agreement. <em>[Lingle, </em>486 US 413. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Implicit is the recognition that claims under state statutes prohibiting discrimination often turn on issues of fact pertaining to the conduct or motive of the defendant, rather than on the interpretation of a collective-bargaining agreement. That is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">It is undisputed that Mr. Krawczyk had an earlier date of entry than plaintiff, and therefore more seniority within the welder\u2019s classification at the point when the Weld Tech course began on February 28, 1983. The parties have registered no disagreement concerning the terms or meaning of the collective-bargaining agreement as it relates to seniority, shift preference, or lay off. Although defendant seeks to emphasize that Mr. Krawczyk was awarded the shift preference because of a higher seniority ranking, the critical issue is whether the decisions to allow Mr. Krawczyk to retake the test and then to reinstate his seniority were based on racial or gender considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument that her claim is independent of the collective-bargaining agreement is strongly buttressed by the fact that she is asserting nonnegotiable state rights \u2014 secured by the Michigan Civil Rights Act. These are rights that apply to all employees, whether or not they belong to a union. Such rights cannot be waived or conditioned on success at the bargaining table.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">While acknowledging that this factor alone may not establish the independence of a state claim, the <em>Lingle </em>Court took note of the fact that \"most state laws that are not pre-empted by \u00a7 301 will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>grant nonnegotiable rights that are shared by all state workers . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408, n 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The jurisprudence of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is in accord. In <em>Smolarek v Chrysler Corp, </em>879 F2d 1326 (CA 6, 1989) (en banc), cert den <em>Chrysler Corp v Smolarek, </em>493 US 992 (1989), an eight-judge majority ruled that the particular claims presented under Michigan\u2019s Handicappers\u2019 Civil Rights Act (hcra), MCL 37.1101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.550(101) <em>et seq., </em>were not preempted by \u00a7 301. <em>Id. </em>at 1335. Seven judges dissented in part. Speaking through Judge Kennedy, they reasoned that because no right of accommodation is conferred upon a handicapped employee by the hcra, the accommodation sought by the plaintiffs in <em>Smolarek </em>was negotiable, and that to that extent such a claim is preempted by \u00a7 301. However, even the dissenting judges recognized that interpretation of a collective-bargaining agreement is not required in the typical case alleging race, sex, or age discrimination. Judge Kennedy explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">In race, sex, and age cases, interpretation of the collective bargaining contract is unnecessary. . . . The right to be free of race, sex, or age discrimination is independent of any ancillary right contained in a collective bargaining agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">Likewise, if an employee is terminated for a handicap unrelated to his ability to perform the functions of his job, interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement is unnecessary to his claim. The hcra has provided a nonnegotiable right to be free of this type of discrimination. <em>[Id. </em>at 1338 (Kennedy, J., dissenting in part).][<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Relying on <em>Lingle </em>and <em>Smolarek, supra, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit later held in <em>O\u2019Shea v Detroit News, </em>887 F2d 683 (CA 6, 1989), that a plaintiff\u2019s hcra discrimination claim was not preempted by \u00a7 301. Recognizing the nonnegotiability of certain rights under the hcra, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">Michigan employees have the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of age or handicap without regard to the collective bargaining agreement\u2019s language about an employee\u2019s rights. <em>[Id. </em>at 687.][<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Other federal courts have embraced the notion that state antidiscrimination statutes confer nonnegotiable rights that are independent of any collective-bargaining agreement. In particular, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, relying on <em>Lingle, </em>has ruled generally that state discrimination claims, whether based on age, race, handicap, religion, or national origin, are <em>not </em>preempted by \u00a7 301. See, e.g., <em>Ramirez v Fox Television Station, Inc, </em>998 F2d 743 (CA 9, 1993).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>In <em>Ramirez, </em>the court reasoned that a suit charging discrimination on the basis of national origin was not preempted by \u00a7 301 because the plaintiff asserted rights under the California Employment Act that are \" 'nonnegotiable\u2019 \u201d and \" 'cannot be removed by private contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 748, quoting <em>Cook v Lindsay Olive Growers, </em>911 F2d 233, 240 (CA 9, 1990). The <em>Ramirez </em>defendant also argued that the plaintiff\u2019s claim would require \"reference\u201d to the collective-bargaining agreement. However, the court rejected any suggestion that mere \"reference\u201d to a collective-bargaining agreement is the equivalent of \"interpretation\u201d of the agreement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">In <em>Rawson, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court focused on a different ground worthy of consideration in the \u00a7 301 analysis: the origin of the legal duty allegedly breached by the defendant. In that case, ninety-one miners were killed in an underground fire. Survivors of four deceased miners sued the United Steelworkers of America, claiming that the decedents\u2019 deaths were caused by negligent acts of the union. They alleged that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">members of the safety committee designated by the Union had been inadequately trained on mine safety issues . . . [and] had negligently performed inspections of the mine that it had promised to conduct, failing to uncover obvious and discoverable deficiencies. <em>[Id. </em>at 365.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The <em>Rawson </em>Court ruled that the state-law negligence claim was preempted by \u00a7 301 because the duty owed to the miners did not exist independent of the collective-bargaining agreement. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">This is not a situation where the Union\u2019s dele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>gates are accused of acting in a way that might violate the duty of reasonable care owed to every person in society. <em>[Id. </em>at 371.][<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We believe that this reasoning in <em>Rawson </em>reinforces plaintiff\u2019s argument in the instant case that her state civil rights claim is not dependent on the collective-bargaining agreement. Unlike the duty in <em>Rawson, </em>which was owed only to union members by virtue of the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement, the duty of this defendant to refrain from discriminating on the basis of race or gender is owed under the Michigan Civil Rights Act to <em>every </em>current and prospective employee, regardless of union status. Because the duty owed in this case does not stem from the collective-bargaining agreement, we find merit in plaintiff\u2019s contention that her claim is independent for purposes of \u00a7 301 preemption.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">On the other hand, defendant argues that resolution of plaintiff\u2019s claim requires interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>of the collective-bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We disagree. First, it is clear that Mr. Krawczyk was allowed by defendant to be retested to regain his seniority out of a perceived notion of fairness rather than reliance upon any provision of the collective-bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Indeed, the agreement and the letter of understanding are completely silent with respect to the treatment to be accorded an employee in Mr. Krawczyk\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">That defendant\u2019s conduct and motivation were not based on the agreement or letter of understanding was conceded by defendant\u2019s counsel at oral argument. In response to a question posed by Justice Boyle, defendant\u2019s counsel stated that the decision to allow Mr. Krawczyk to be retested was based solely on a notion of fairness, that, no provision in the letter of understanding referred to a welder\u2019s right to retake an unsuccessful test because such a situation was unanticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Moreover, even if we were to agree with defendant that portions of the collective-bargaining agreement, including the seniority provision, were relevant in determining the conduct and motives of defendant, this alone would not transform plaintiff\u2019s claim into a federal contract dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>within the ambit of \u00a7 301.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Supreme Court cautioned in <em>Lueck </em>that \"not every dispute concerning employment, or tangentially involving a provision of a collective-bargaining agreement, is pre-empted by \u00a7 301 . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211. The Court further explained in <em>Lingle, supra </em>at 409-410:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">[E]ven if dispute resolution pursuant to a collective-bargaining agreement, on the one hand, and state law, on the other, would require addressing precisely the same set of facts, as long as the state-law claim can be resolved without interpreting the agreement itself, the claim is \"independent\u201d of the agreement for \u00a7 301 pre-emption purposes.[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Finally, although in this case the collective-bargaining agreement includes a provision designed to protect employees from race and gender discrimination,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> this fact alone does not render plaintiff\u2019s state law claim \"dependent\u201d on the collective-bargaining agreement. As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Lingle, supra </em>at 412-413:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\">[T]he mere fact that a broad contractual protection against discriminatory \u2014 or retaliatory \u2014 discharge may provide a remedy for conduct that coincidentally violates state law does not make the existence or the contours of the state-law violation dependent upon the terms of the private contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Consequently, \"[p]arallel protection under the terms of the contract and under state discrimination law does not mean that the contract must be interpreted to resolve the state law claim.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Like the United States Supreme Court, we decline to rule that \u00a7 301 preempts plaintiff\u2019s state discrimination claim merely because the employer has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>agreed to comply with the statutory mandates of Michigan labor law.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In conclusion, plaintiff asserts a claim against her employer under the Michigan Civil Rights Act for damages as a result of an alleged violation of her nonnegotiable state right to be free from racial and gender-based discrimination in the workplace.

I disagree and accordingly join the majority\u2019s finding of no preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">At the outset, I note that the development of United States Supreme Court precedent in this area has at times seemed contradictory. Indeed, before 1987, the Court seemed to resolve the question whether a state-law claim is independent of the collective-bargaining agreement for purposes of preemption by asking \"whether evaluation of the [state-law] claim is inextricably intertwined with\u201d or \"substantially dependent\u201d on the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement. <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp v Lueck, </em>471 US 202, 213, 220; 105 S Ct 1904; 85 L Ed 2d 206 (1985). However, as demonstrated in <em>Lingle, </em>the Supreme Court seemed to have narrowed the gates of preemption by changing the focus to whether resolution of the state-law claim requires interpreting or construing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the collective-bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Lingle, supra </em>at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Nonetheless, while the test has undergone some refinement, the general approach to making this inquiry has not. In <em>Lueck, Lingle </em>and, most recently, <em>United Steelworkers of America v Rawson, </em>495 US 362; 110 S Ct 1904; 109 L Ed 2d 362 (1990), the Court found dispositive its analysis whether a prima facie case under state law requires a court to construe the collective-bargaining agreement, i.e., whether the elements of the underlying state-law claim necessitate construing the agreement. See <em>Lueck, supra </em>at 216-218; <em>Lingle, supra </em>at 406-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In <em>Lueck, </em>the Court considered the Wisconsin tort of bad-faith handling of an insurance claim. The Court determined that Wisconsin law</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">intrinsically relates to the nature and existence of the contract. <em>Hilker v Western Automobile Ins Co, </em>204 Wis 1, 13-16; 235 NW 413, 414-415 (1931). Thus the tort exists for breach of a \"duty devolved] upon the insurer by reasonable implication from the express terms of the contract,\u201d the scope of which, crucially, is \"ascertained from a consideration of the contract itself.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 216.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Moreover, the Court buttressed its conclusion by noting that under Wisconsin law \"the tort duty was derived from the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing found in every contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217._</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Rawson, </em>the plaintiffs \u2014 survivors of four deceased miners \u2014 brought a state-law suit against the union for negligently inspecting a mine where plaintiffs\u2019 decedents worked. In finding the claim preempted, the Court noted that \"the Union\u2019s representatives were participating in the inspection process pursuant to the provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement\u201d and under state law \"the agreement determined the nature and scope of the Union\u2019s duty. If the Union failed to perform a duty in connection with inspection, it was a duty arising out of the collective-bargaining agreement signed by the Union as the bargaining agent for the miners.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371. Indeed, the Court noted that this duty owed to these deceased workers was separate and distinct from \"a situation where the Union\u2019s delegates are accused of acting in a way that might violate the duty of reasonable care owed to every person in society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of this basis in state law, the Court found the claim preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">On the other hand, in <em>Lingle, </em>the Court found that the Illinois tort of retaliatory discharge for filing a worker\u2019s compensation claim does not require interpreting the collective-bargaining agreement. In examining the elements of the tort, the Court noted that plaintiff must show \"(1) he was discharged or threatened with discharge and (2) the employer\u2019s motive in discharging or threatening to discharge him was to deter him from exercising his rights under the Act or to interfere with his exercise of those rights.\u201d Accordingly, to maintain this suit, plaintiff did not have to rely on any provision of the collective-bargaining agreement, express or implied. \"Each of these purely factual questions pertains to the conduct of the employee and the conduct and motivation of the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407. Indeed, the Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>any possible defense, i.e., having a nonretaliatory reason for the discharge, would likewise not require construing any provision of the agreement because this also is merely a factual inquiry with regard to defendant\u2019s motivation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In the instant case, plaintiff\u2019s racial and sexual discrimination claim is strikingly similar to the tort in <em>Lingle. </em>To establish unlawful racial and sexual discrimination, plaintiff would have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that discrimination exists either by disparate treatment or intentional discrimination. See <em>Ruppal v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>163 Mich App 219, 226; 413 NW2d 751 (1987). To do so, plaintiff must prove that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">she was a member of a class entitled to protection under the statute and that, for the same or similar conduct, she was treated differently than a man [for sexual discrimination or a nonblack employee for racial discrimination]. The crux of a sexfual or racial] discrimination action is that similarly situated persons have been accorded different treatment because of their sex [or race]. <em>[Slayton v Michigan Host, Inc, </em>144 Mich App 535, 541; 376 NW2d 664 (1985) (citations omitted); <em>Jenkins v Southeastern Michigan Chapter, American Red Cross, </em>141 Mich App 785, 793-795; 369 NW2d 223 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">If plaintiff meets this burden, she has set forth a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination. Thus, the burden of production<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> then shifts to the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>natory reason for its actions. If the defendant is able to articulate such a reason, the plaintiff must then be given the opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons but were mere pretext for the discrimination. <em>[Slayton, supra </em>at 541-542. Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">In reviewing these elements, it is clear that the court will not have to interpret any express or implied provision of the collective-bargaining agreement. Unlike both <em>Lueck </em>and <em>Rawson, supra, </em>the dispositive inquiry under state law is not what the collective-bargaining agreement provides, but, as in <em>Lingle, </em>what was the motivation of defendant, i.e., discrimination or no discrimination. Moreover, as in <em>Lingle, </em>merely because defendant might claim in defense that its conduct was compelled by some implied fairness gleaned from the collective-bargaining agreement as a whole would not make the instant claim preempted. This would only help answer the factual question whether defendant was motivated by discrimination,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but would not require the court to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>legality of the decision under the collective-bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Indeed, this conclusion is buttressed by the realization that defendant\u2019s burden is only one of production rather than persuasion. After the plaintiff has set forth a prima facie case, Michigan courts place the burden of production on the defendant as a means of properly framing the dispositive issue, i.e., the motivation of the defendant, so that the plaintiff can then show that the purported defense was simply a pretext for discrimination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Once again, nothing in this inquiry would require an interpretation of the collective-bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Accordingly, because I agree that plaintiff\u2019s claim is not preempted under \u00a7 301, I join the majority\u2019s opinion and would remand to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\"> 29 USC 185(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\"> On remand from the United States Supreme Court for consideration in light of <em>Lingle, </em>the Supreme Court of Alabama noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">It appears that the <em>Lingle </em>Court shifted its analysis from the \"inextricably intertwined\u201d test to the \"interpreting the agreement\u201d test and thereby restricted the application of preemption. <em>[Reynolds Metals Co v Mays, </em>547 So 2d 518, 522 (Ala, 1989).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\"> In contrast, the factual inquiry in <em>Lueck, </em>as mandated by state law, required a finding of preemption because the factual inquiry necessarily focused on the terms of the agreement. In <em>Lingle, </em>however, the factual inquiry only focused on defendant\u2019s motivation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b372-10\"><em> </em>In 1 Larson, Employment Discrimination (2d ed), \u00a7 8.03[1], p 8-50, Professor Larson describes this not as a burden of persuasion, \u201cbut rather one of production of admissible evidence.\u201d Indeed, in <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v Burdine, </em>450 US 248, 254-255; 101 S Ct 1089; 67 L Ed 2d 207 (1981), the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. ... It is sufficient if the defendant\u2019s evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff. To accomplish this, the defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, the reasons for the plaintiff\u2019s rejection.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b373-6\"> At oral argument defendant could not indicate what particular provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement require interpretation in resolving this discrimination suit. Indeed, defense counsel conceded that nothing in the letter of understanding or the collective-bargaining agreement addressed whether Mr. Krawczyk should be permitted to retake the test. Moreover, defendant agrees that the letter of understanding and other provisions in the collective-bargaining agreement are plain and unambiguous. Thus, defendant\u2019s only argument linking this decision to the letter of understanding or the collective-bargaining agreement is some measure of fairness stem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ming from the fact that Mr. Krawczyk was initially informed that he had passed, but after further destructive testing on the welds, was later determined to have failed. Admittedly, resolution of this issue would require interpreting the agreement since defendant is essentially contending that the agreement created some implied right to this conduct. See <em>Lueck, supra </em>at 215. However, as indicated above, the court need not decide this issue as a matter of law because the focus of this suit is simply the factual inquiry whether defendant harbored an illicit or discriminatory motive to the detriment of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">If, however, this claim had implicated the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement as in both <em>Lueck </em>and <em>Bawson, </em>we would be without authority to simply conclude that neither the express nor the implied provisions of the contract provide for such conduct. If we did, we would be doing what we set out not to do, i.e., interpret the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">The assumption that the labor contract creates no implied rights is not one that state law may make. Rather, it is a question of federal contract interpretation whether there was an obligation under this labor contract to provide the payments in a timely manner, and, if so, whether Allis-Chalmers\u2019 conduct breached that implied contract provision. <em>[Lueck, supra </em>at 215.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In my view, the majority comes dangerously close to violating this principle when noting that \"the agreement and the letter of understanding are completely silent with respect to the treatment to be accorded an employee in Mr. Krawczyk\u2019s situation.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 287.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\"> \"It is <em>not </em>necessary to decide at the outset whether or not [the defendant\u2019s] interpretation of the agreement is correct as a matter of federal labor law.\u201d <em>Smolarek v Chrysler Corp, </em>879 F2d 1326, 1334 (CA 6, 1989). Indeed, in <em>O\u2019Shea v Detroit News, </em>887 F2d 683, 687 (CA 6, 1989), the court made the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">[T]he question of whether or not the plaintiff was discriminated against was separate from any possible defense the employer might have under the contract. All the plaintiff has to allege is that an action was taken against him because of a motive impermissible under the Act. It is irrelevant to the preemption question whether or not the employer can defend by showing it had the right under the collective bargaining agreement to do what it did. . . . The plaintiff\u2019s claim stands separate from this defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">We hold that <em>Lingle </em>and <em>Smolarek </em>save the plaintiff\u2019s claims from preemption. With respect to the discrimination claim, the right not to be discriminated against in employment decisions based on handicap or age is independent of the question of whether O\u2019Shea was demoted or not. The plaintiff in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>may try to show, for example, that the midnight shift was undesirable and that older or handicapped employees were assigned to it more often than younger or non-handicapped ones. The defendant could then defend by arguing that it had the right to transfer its employees in order to improve its paper, just as the defendants in <em>Lingle </em>and <em>Smolar\u00e9k </em>could argue that they had good cause to fire their employees there. The point is that Michigan employees have the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of age or handicap without regard to the collective bargaining agreement\u2019s language about an employee\u2019s rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">See also <em>Hall v Kelsey-Hayes Co, </em>184 Mich App 277, 280-281; 457 NW2d 143 (1990); <em>Welch v General Motors Corp, </em>922 F2d 287 (CA 6, 1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b375-9\"> See <em>Burdine, </em>n 4 <em>supra </em>at 255-256.
