Although the jury was instructed in general terms that its verdict must be unanimous, defendant\u2019s conviction of second-degree criminal sexual conduct was vacated by the Court of Appeals because the trial court refused to instruct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the jurors that unanimous agreement about a specific act of penetration is required for conviction. Because materially identical evidence was offered with respect to each of the alleged acts of penetration and there is no reason to believe the jury was confused or disagreed about the basis of defendant\u2019s guilt, we conclude that the trial court did not err, and we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Charging defendant with one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, the information alleged that \"on or about Jan, 1989,\u201d defendant \"[d]id engage in sexual penetration, to-wit: anal intercourse with the complainant, a person under 13 years of age, contrary to sec. 750.520 B (1) M.C.L.A.\u201d Complainant was ten years of age at the time of the alleged acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The complainant testified that in January 1989, she and her four siblings lived with their cousin, Joanne Burris, in a house in Detroit. Defendant and George White lived in the basement of the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Complainant stated that Ms. Burris was away from the home during the day for a week in January 1989 to cook at a church revival.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although she could not remember the specific date, the child recalled that on Monday morning during this week, she and defendant were alone in the home. Defendant allegedly approached complainant from behind while she was cleaning the living room and began fondling her breast and vagina. Defendant then began kissing her, whereupon he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>turned her around and pushed her against a wall. 'While holding her arms for approximately five minutes, the child believed defendant penetrated her anus with his penis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Complainant testified to a second similar sexual assault by defendant that allegedly occurred the next morning as she was cleaning her room. She stated that defendant approached her and again began fondling her breasts and vagina while trying to kiss her. After defendant turned the victim and forced her against a wall, she believed that defendant again penetrated her anus with his penis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The victim then testified to a third act of anal penetration by defendant that allegedly occurred the next day under similar circumstances. While the child was folding clothes in the dining room, defendant approached her, began fondling her breasts and vagina, then forced her against a wall. She testified that she then felt what she believed to be defendant\u2019s penis penetrate her anus.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Although these incidents allegedly occurred in January 1989, complainant did not inform Joanne Burris, her legal guardian, of the sexual assaults until Easter Sunday in March 1989, because she thought she would \"get[] in trouble.\u201d When, later that evening, Burris took the victim to the hospital, the examining physician found no medical evidence of sexual penetration. Defendant denied all the allegations, he did not testify, and the defense rested without calling any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">At the close of proofs, defense counsel requested the trial judge to give the following special instruction: \"Members of the jury, you must be unanimous as to which specific act of penetration occurred, if any, before you can find the Defendant guilty of esc in the first degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">While declining to give the requested instruction, the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">The evidence in this case must convince you, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the crime occurred on or about January, 1989, within the City of Detroit. The Defendant is charged with the crime of esc in the first degree. The Defendant pleads not guilty to this charge. To establish this charge, the Prosecution must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">First, that the Defendant, Ricky Cooks, engaged in a . . . specific sexual act which involves some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>actual entry into the anal opening of [the complainant\u2019s] body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\">It is alleged . . . that the sexual act was committed by a penetration of the Complainant[\u2019s] . . . body by the Defendant, Ricky Cooks\u2019 penis. Any such entry into the anal opening is enough.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The court explained the elements of several lesser offenses, including second-degree criminal sexual conduct,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and then instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">If you all have agreed upon one verdict, your foreperson should mark that verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">A verdict in a criminal case must be unanimous. In order to return a verdict, it is necessary that each of you agree upon that verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">The jury found defendant guilty of second-degree criminal sexual conduct. In an unpublished per curiam opinion,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, citing <em>People v Yarger, </em>193 Mich App 532, 537; 485 NW2d 119 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Thereafter, we granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal, \"limited to whether the Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court failed to instruct the jury properly with regard to its obligation to render a unanimous verdict.\u201d 444 Mich 875 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">While the Sixth Amendment of the federal constitution includes the right of an accused to a unanimous verdict in federal criminal prosecutions, see <em>Andres v United </em>States, 333 US 740; 68 S Ct 880; 92 L Ed 1055 (1948),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not mandate unanimous verdicts for convictions in noncapital criminal prosecutions in state courts. <em>Johnson v Louisiana, </em>406 US 356; 92 S Ct 1620; 32 L Ed 2d 152 (1972); <em>Apodaca v Oregon, </em>406 US 404; 92 S Ct 1628; 32 L Ed 2d 184 (1972). Thus, the right to a unanimous jury verdict in noncapital state criminal proceedings must be grounded in state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">At common law, civil as well as criminal defendants were entitled to unanimous jury verdicts. See <em>McRae v Grand Rapids, L &amp; D R Co, </em>93 Mich 399; 53 NW 561 (1892).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This right was preserved by the ratifiers of the original Michigan Constitution,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the current version of the state consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>tution maintains the unanimity requirement, albeit in criminal prosecutions only.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">In order to protect a defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict, it is the duty of the trial court to properly instruct the jury regarding the unanimity requirement. See, generally, <em>People v Liggett, 3</em>78 Mich 706, 714; 148 NW2d 784 (1967) (\"Defendant has a right to have a properly instructed jury pass upon the evidence\u201d). In this case, we must determine whether a general unanimity instruction to the jury was adequate in light of the pattern of conduct offered as evidence of a single charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In finding that the trial court erred in this case, and that reversal was required, the Court of Appeals relied exclusively on <em>Yarger, supra, </em>and reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">Error occurred, because the jury was not instructed that it must unanimously agree on which of the separate act(s) was proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">Under <em>Yarger, </em>defendant is entitled to a unanimity instruction. He asked for one to be given, but it was not given. If Yarger\u2019s holding has any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>meaning \u2014 and the <em>[People v Van Dorsten, </em>441 Mich 540, 543; 494 NW2d 737 (1993)] Court specifically declined to approve or disapprove <em>Yarger </em>\u2014 it must say that the failure to give a unanimity instruction is not always harmless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">Accordingly, we hold <em>Van Dorsten </em>to its facts and follow <em>Yarger </em>here to reverse.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Defendant agrees with the panel\u2019s application of <em>Yarger, </em>and points to the decisions in <em>People v Jenness, </em>5 Mich 305 (1858), and <em>People v Pottruff, </em>116 Mich App 367; 323 NW2d 402 (1982), as additional support for an affirmance of the Court of Appeals. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">After considering the arguments presented in this appeal and carefully reviewing the relevant federal and state authority available, we reach the conclusion that a specific unanimity instruction is not required in <em>all </em>cases in which more than one act is presented as evidence of the actus reus of a single criminal offense. The critical inquiry is whether either party has presented evidence that <em>materially </em>distinguishes any of the alleged multiple acts from the others.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In other words, where materially identical evidence is presented with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>respect to each act, and there is no juror confusion, a general unanimity instruction will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In this regard, <em>Yarger, Jenness, </em>and <em>Pottruff </em>are distinguishable from the case at bar. Whereas at least one of the alternative alleged acts in <em>Yarger, Jenness, </em>and <em>Pottruff </em>were supported or rebutted by a materially distinct piece of evidence, the evidence presented against defendant here was materially identical with regard to all three of the alleged acts of penetration. As indicated below, we find this distinction to be dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The decision in <em>United States v Gipson, </em>553 F2d 453 (CA 5, 1977), is considered a seminal ruling regarding the need for a specific unanimity instruction when evidence of multiple acts by a defendant are placed before a jury to support a single charged offense.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction of \"selling or receiving a stolen vehicle moving in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 USC 2313,\u201d on the ground that an improper jury instruction abridged the defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous jury verdict.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The court explained that the prohibited acts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>question constituted \"two distinct conceptual groupings; the first consisting of receiving, concealing, and storing, and the second comprised of bartering, selling, and disposing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458. The court then opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">[T]he two conceptual groupings are sufficiently different so that a jury finding of the actus reus . . . would not be \"unanimous\u201d if some of the jurors thought the defendant committed only an act in the first conceptual grouping while others believed he committed an act only in the second. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Because the challenged instruction did not separate the distinct acts of the \"housing of stolen vehicles\u201d versus the \"marketing of stolen vehicles\u201d in the minds of the jurors, the panel reversed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">The . . . instruction authorized the jury to return a guilty verdict despite the fact that some jurors may have believed that Gipson engaged in conduct only characterizable as receiving, concealing, or storing while other jurors were convinced that he committed acts only constituting bartering, selling, or disposing. Thus, . . . the jury was permitted to convict Gipson even though there may have been significant disagreement among the jurors as to what he did. <em>[Id. </em>at 458-459.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Recently, the United States Supreme Court addressed a somewhat related question in <em>Schad v Arizona, </em>501 US 624; 111 S Ct 2491; 115 L Ed 2d 555 (1991), in the context of determining the constitutionality of criminal statutes that provide alternative means of defining a criminal offense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>i.e., multitheory statutes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The <em>Schad </em>Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s murder conviction and, in the process, rejected a constitutional attack against an Arizona statute that alternatively defined the mens rea of first-degree murder as \"murder which is . . . wilful, deliberate or premeditated ... or which is committed ... in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate . . . robbery.\u201d 501 US 628, n 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In Schad, the defendant argued in the Supreme Court that the trial court\u2019s instruction, which \"did not require the jury to agree on one of the alternative theories of premeditated and felony murder,\u201d deprived him of his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict. 501 US 630. Because the jury in the defendant\u2019s trial agreed unanimously \"that [the defendant] murdered either with premeditation or in the course of committing a robbery,\u201d <em>id., </em>the <em>Schad </em>Court framed the issue in the following manner: \"whether it was constitutionally acceptable to permit the jurors to reach one verdict based on [sic] any combination of the alternative findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court answered this question in the affirmative. 501 US 645-646.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Although the \"conceptually distinct\u201d <em>Gipson </em>test was not utilized by the Supreme Court in <em>Schad, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>its application to the issue now before us by other federal courts has produced an analytical framework that we find instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">For example, in <em>United States v Duncan, </em>850 F2d 1104 (CA 6, 1988), cert den sub nom <em>Downing v United States, </em>493 US 1025 (1990), the government offered two unrelated false statements allegedly made by the defendant, \"that $115,000 of income received was a capital gain rather than ordinary income, and that [the defendant] had paid $8,800 in interest when he had not,\u201d as evidence of a single unlawful tax return. <em>Id. </em>at 1106. Relying on <em>Gipson, </em>the <em>Duncan </em>panel reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">[T]he jury in this case needed to agree on the willful falsity of one factually distinct false statement because the statements are \"conceptually distinct.\u201d Although both the interest deduction and the income characterization arose from the same transaction, the circumstances of their formulation and the proof bearing upon their willful falsity were distinct. . . . When distinct proof is required to establish distinct affirmative acts as elements of an offense, specific unanimity is necessary. <em>[Id. </em>at 1113.][<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>On the other hand, where the government has presented evidence of a series of materially indistinguishable acts, each of which would factually satisfy the actus reus element of the alleged criminal offense, numerous federal courts have declined to require a specific unanimity instruction. In <em>United States v Ferris, </em>719 F2d 1405, 1406 (CA 9, 1983), a case on which the prosecutor here relies, the defendant was convicted of one count of possession of controlled substances with intent to distribute. Because the prosecutor presented evidence of \"various acts of possession\u201d that allegedly occurred between November 20, 1980, and January 29, 1981, the defendant argued on appeal that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">the trial court deprived him of his constitutional right to a unanimous verdict by declining a prof-erred [sic] instruction that the jury must be in unanimous agreement on the precise act of possession with intent to distribute as alleged in Count i. [Id]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit disagreed and affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction. Id. at 1407. The court distinguished <em>Gipson, supra, </em>and noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">In the case before us, the various acts indicating knowing possession were not inconsistent with each other; and even if one set of jurors might have focused on one part of the transaction while another set focused upon a different part, it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>not follow that either set of jurors were in disagreement with the other. [Jd.][<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Similarly, in <em>United States v </em>Sutherland, 656 F2d 1181 (CA 5, 1981), cert den 455 US 949 (1982), three codefendants challenged their convictions of conspiracy to violate the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, 18 USC 1962(c), arguing, inter alia, \"that the [trial] court erroneously refused a requested instruction that required the jury to be unanimous as to the same overt acts that formed the basis of their verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1202. Noting that certain acts \" 'are sufficiently analogous to permit a jury finding of the actus reus element of the offense to be deemed \"unanimous\u201d despite differences among the jurors as to which of the . . . acts the defendant committed,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 1202 (quoting Gipson, <em>supra </em>at 458), the Court affirmed the defendants\u2019 convictions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">[T]he jury need not specifically have considered and agreed as to which of a large number of potential overt acts of bribery were established by the government. These acts were not distinguished in any significant respect and the evidence as to each is remarkably similar. Therefore this series of alleged acts comprises one \"conceptual group\u201d and the jury need not have unanimously agreed as to. which was proyen. [Id.][<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>In the light of <em>Gipson </em>and its progeny, it appears that federal trial courts must give a specific unanimity instruction to the jury if 1) the alternative acts presented as evidence are conceptually distinct or there are distinct proofs regarding each alternative, or 2) other factors are present that create a genuine possibility of juror confusion or disagreement. Where the government offers a series of similar acts as proof of the actus reus and there is no indication of juror confusion or disagreement, the general unanimity instruction is deemed sufficient. <em>Ferris, Sutherland, Duncan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The rule that a specific unanimity instruction is unnecessary when the government presents materially identical evidence to support each alleged act by a defendant is also recognized in state courts in the context of multiple incidents of sexual assault. For example, the Connecticut Supreme Court has adopted a \"continuing offense\u201d exception to the need for a specific unanimity instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>tion when alternative acts are presented as evidence of a single criminal offense.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In <em>State v Spigarolo, </em>210 Conn 359, 389; 556 A2d 112 (1989), the prosecution alleged in two counts of an information that the defendant unlawfully committed \"certain 'acts\u2019 likely to impair the health or morals of the victims.\u201d However, the prosecution \"identified six separate acts specifying the manner in which the defendant committed the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">On the appeal of his conviction, the defendant argued that he was \"denied . . . his constitutional right to a unanimous verdict,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 363, because the trial court instructed the jury that \"it is necessary that the State prove that only one of those acts [was] committed by the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389. The Connecticut Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\"Where a trial court charges a jury that the commission of any one of several alternative acts would subject a defendant to criminal liability, a unanimity charge on a specific act is required only if two conditions are met: (1) the alternative acts are conceptually distinct from each other; and (2) the state has presented supporting evidence on each alternative act.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 389 (quoting <em>State v </em>Bailey, 209 Conn 322, 334; 551 A2d 1206 [1988]).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Applying this standard to the record before it,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the <em>Spigarolo </em>court opined that a specific unanimity instruction was unnecessary and affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">The six specific acts . . . involved subjecting the victims to either active or passive participation in sexual activity .... Because the state was unable to specify with greater precision the times of the alleged incidents, it necessarily proceeded under a theory that the defendant\u2019s conduct was in the nature of a continuing offense. . . . Under these circumstances, the acts specified in the counts were not conceptually distinct within the meaning of <em>Gipson. [Id. </em>at 391-392.][<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The California courts have taken a similar approach.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In a case strikingly similar to the instant appeal, the defendant was convicted of \"committing a lewd act upon a child on and between March 1, 1983, and May 31, 1983.\u201d <em>People v Winkle, </em>206 Cal App 3d 822, 824; 253 Cal Rptr 726 (1988). The victim, who was six years old at the time of the alleged events, testified that she lived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>with her defendant uncle and his family during this period and claimed that he put his penis inside her vagina \"more than once a week.\u201d She stated that these acts occurred when she and her uncle \"were home alone, 'sometimes in the bathroom and sometimes in the bedroom,\u2019 \u201d and that the acts also occurred in the bathroom at the defendant\u2019s workplace. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">On appeal, the defendant argued that \"the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree on the underlying act forming the basis of a finding of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 825. The court disagreed and affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">After acknowledging the general applicability of a California standard jury instruction<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> to cases in which the information charges a single criminal offense, but evidence of multiple acts by defendant is produced at trial, the <em>Winkle </em>court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">[T]here is a \"continuous conduct exception\u201d to the need for a unanimity instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">The continuous conduct exception occurs in two circumstances \u2014 when the two offenses are so closely connected in time that they form part of one transaction or when the offense consists of a continuous course of conduct. <em>[Id. </em>at 826.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">The court concluded that \"because the victim was of a tender age at the time of the acts of molestation and because she testified about repeated incidents of the same act of sexual molesta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>tion, a unanimity instruction was unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 828.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Similarly, in <em>People v </em>Deletto, 147 Cal App 3d 458, 462; 195 Cal Rptr 233 (1983), the defendant was charged with \"oral copulation with a person under 14 years of age and 10 years younger than [the defendant].\u201d At trial, the victim testified that \"(1) defendant made oral contact with her genital area, and (2) defendant placed his penis in her mouth and ejaculated . . . during the summer of 1980 at the [same] residence[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">After reviewing the evidence, the <em>Deletto </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">This is not a case in which different witnesses testified as to one incident but not the other or where different items of real evidence were introduced to prove one act but not the other, so that the jury might have distinguished between the credibility of different witnesses or the weight to be given various items of real evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">The defense similarly provided the jury with no evidence that focused on one act but not the other. <em>[Id. </em>at 466-467.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Therefore, the court concluded that a unanimity instruction was not necessary because \"neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>defense evidence nor defense argument suggested even remotely to the jury that they could somehow distinguish between the two acts . . . testified to by the minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">We are persuaded by the foregoing federal and state authority that if alternative acts allegedly committed by defendant are presented by the state as evidence of the actus reus element of the charged offense, a general instruction to the jury that its decision must be unanimous will be adequate unless 1) the alternative acts are materially distinct (where the acts themselves are conceptually distinct or where either party has offered materially distinct proofs regarding one of the alternatives), or 2) there is reason to believe the jurors might be confused or disagree about the factual basis of defendant\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Against this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>backdrop, a clear distinction emerges between the decisions in <em>Yarger, Jenness, </em>and <em>Pottruff </em>(in which a specific unanimity instruction was mandated) and the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In <em>Yarger, </em>the defendant was charged with one count of third-degree criminal sexual conduct.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> At trial, the prosecution presented evidence of distinct types of penetration through testimony of the fifteen-year-old victim that she \"consensually performed fellatio on defendant . . . after which defendant penetrated her vagina with his penis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 534. The defendant impeached the victim\u2019s testimony in general with \"evidence of prior false accusations of rape and her earlier denials that any impropriety had occurred between them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the defense specifically impeached the allegation of vaginal penetration with the complainant\u2019s preliminary examination testimony at which she stated \"that she and defendant 'had intercourse,\u2019 but that 'nothing went inside\u2019 her and that defendant placed his penis 'by\u2019 her vagina.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The <em>Yarger </em>panel reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and reasoned: \"[A] possibility exists that, for example, six jurors were convinced that fellatio had occurred, but not intercourse, while the other six jurors held the opposite view.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">In <em>Jenness, </em>the defendant was charged with one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>count of committing incest with his niece. Although the information listed February 24, 1858, as the date of the alleged act, the niece testified at trial that she had sexual intercourse with the defendant \"on the 17th day of January, 1858, ... at her room in the Howard House, in the city of Detroit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307. She then testified about \"numerous acts of sexual intercourse between herself and [the defendant], at various places within and without the said city of Detroit, commencing in 1853.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308. The complainant\u2019s parents corroborated her claim that she had sexual intercourse with the defendant at various places during the preceding five years by testifying about \"[a]cts of improper and indecent familiarity between defendant and [the complainant], at various times before the commission of the alleged act at the Howard House.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308-309.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In its instructions to the jury, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">[T]hough the information alleges that the [defendant] had criminal connection with his niece, ... in this city, on the 24th day of February, time and place are immaterial, and the jury may find him guilty, if from the evidence they believe that the act was not committed at the Howard House, but was committed in some other place in the city of Detroit, within the period of six years prior to the time of filing this information. <em>[Id. </em>at 312.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Thus, the instruction allowed the jury to convict the defendant without requiring unanimity on any one of numerous acts of intercourse that allegedly occurred within and without the City of Detroit during a period of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">On appeal, this Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>This was subjecting the defendant to the risk of conviction upon a great number of acts, occurring at different times and places, against which he could not be expected to be prepared to defend; and yet an acquittal or conviction would be no bar to a future prosecution of any, except that at the Howard House. The jury can not be thus sent fishing for the charge which they are to try. <em>[Id. </em>at 328.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In <em>Pottruff, </em>the defendant was charged with, and convicted of, one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. The five-year-old victim testified at trial that the defendant forced her to perform fellatio and to submit to vaginal intercourse. In support of the allegation of vaginal penetration, the prosecution also produced expert medical testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Although the defendant apparently denied engaging in vaginal intercourse, he presented a separate defense with regard to the fellatio allegation. The defendant claimed that the zipper on his pants was broken and that the child \"grabbed his penis and put it in her mouth . . . because she saw her mother do it and she thought she would like to be like her mother.\u201d <em>Pottruff, supra </em>at 370. The panel granted defendant a new trial on other grounds, but noted in dicta:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">[S]ome jurors may have been convinced that defendant committed the act of fellatio while others may have been convinced only that vaginal penetration had occurred .... [TJhis problem can be avoided on retrial either by charging defendant with separate counts or by instructing the jury that they must find unanimously that defendant committed either one or the other of the acts .... <em>[Id. </em>at 375-376.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Unlike the proofs in <em>Yarger, Jenness, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number><em>Pottruff, </em>the evidence offered in this case to support each of the alleged acts of penetration was materially identical, i.e., the complainant\u2019s equivocal testimony of an anal penetration,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> occurring in the same house over an unspecified three-day period in January 1989, while only she and defendant were in the room. Thus, the multiple acts alleged by the prosecutor were tantamount to a continuous course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Furthermore, unlike the defendants in <em>Yarger </em>and <em>Pottruff, </em>defendant here did not present a separate defense or offer materially distinct evidence of impeachment regarding any particular act.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> He merely denied the existence of any inappropriate behavior. Thus, the sole task of the jury was to determine the credibility of the victim with respect to the pattern of alleged conduct. Because neither party presented materially distinct proofs regarding any of the alleged acts, the factual basis for the specific unanimity instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>mandated in <em>Yarger, Jenness, </em>and <em>Pottruff </em>was nonexistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Like the prosecutors in <em>Spigarolo </em>and <em>Winkle </em>the prosecutor here was unable to specify in the information the precise dates of the alleged penetrations, other than \"on or about Jan, 1989.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Unlike <em>Jenness, </em>the child victim then testified about identical incidents of anal penetration on three successive days, consistent with the charge in the information. Absent any indication of juror confusion or disagreement over the existence of any of the alternative acts, a specific unanimity instruction is not required on these facts.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">In conclusion, when the state offers evidence of multiple acts by a defendant, each of which would satisfy the actus reus element of a single charged offense, the trial court is required to instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree on the same specific act if the acts are materially distinct or if there is reason to believe the jurors may be confused or disagree about the factual basis of the defendant\u2019s guilt. When neither of these factors is present, as in the case at bar, a general instruction to the jury that its verdict must be unanimous does not deprive the defendant of his right to a unanimous verdict.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b608-6\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, Boyle, Riley, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-12\"> MCL 750.520b; MSA 28.788(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-10\"> However, Joanne Burris testified that she cooked for her church revival in November, not January, and that she was never away from the home in January 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\"> On cross-examination with respect to this incident, the victim admitted that she was \"not sure\u201d whether there was actual penetration and acknowledged that she did not feel any pain during the alleged penetration.

Indeed, the court in <em>Winkle, supra, </em>not only held that a specific unanimity instruction was not required in these circumstances, it concluded that such an instruction should not be given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvE3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Since at trial no attempt was made to distinguish the acts[,] . . . the jury had no basis on which to distinguish between the acts about which [the victim] testified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">In a situation in which a very young child testifies about a series of similar molestations without identifying any specific dates, the unanimity instruction should not be given as it would be confusing for the jury to be given an instruction requiring them to agree on a specific act, when there is no specific act for them to agree upon. . . .

See, e.g., <em>Winkle, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Although it would be impossible to articulate all factual variations of the instant record in which the alternative acts would be materially distinct, a specific unanimity instruction would clearly be necessary if, in regard to only one of the alleged incidents, the complainant testified about the existence of significant pain or defendant offered an alibi witness to rebut the allegation. See also <em>Schad, supra: </em>\"We would not permit ... an indictment charging that the defendant assaulted either x on Tuesday or y on Wednesday . . . .\u201d 501 US 651 (Scalia, J., concurring). Likewise, were defendant here charged in a one-count information with anal penetration of x on Tuesday or anal penetration of y on Wednesday and the trial court refused to instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree on which of the two acts defendant committed, we would not hesitate to overturn defendant\u2019s conviction to vindicate of his right to a unanimous verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b607-6\"> Because the complainant could not identify the specific dates of the three alleged incidents, the prosecutor was forced to \"proceed[] under a theory that the defendant\u2019s conduct was in the nature of a continuing offense.\u201d <em>Spigarolo, supra </em>at 391. We note that defendant actually benefited from this prosecutorial dilemma; had the complainant been able to specify with greater particularity the dates of the three alleged penetrations, the prosecutor might have charged defendant with <em>three </em>counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\"> Even if we were to conclude that the trial court erred in failing to give the requested specific unanimity instruction, reversal of the Court of Appeals decision would still be warranted. Because defendant was convicted of second-degree criminal sexual conduct, which does not require a showing of penetration, he was not prejudiced by failure to give the proffered instruction. Thus, any error that could be assigned to this omission did not result in a miscarriage of justice. See MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Moreover, because defendant did not object to the instructions given regarding second-degree criminal sexual conduct or request a specific unanimity instruction with respect to a particular act of sexual contact, he is not entitled to relief from conviction of this lesser included offense. \"The failure of the court to instruct on any point of law shall not be ground for setting aside the verdict of the jury unless such instruction is requested by the accused.\u201d MCL 768.29; MSA 28.1052.

Although the complainant could not specify the exact date of the assaults, she was able to describe three separate incidents occurring on consecutive days.

The jury deliberated briefly before finding the defendant guilty of the lesser offense of esc in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">State courts asked to decide the constitutional adequacy of an unanimity instruction in sexual molestation cases have adopted the approach set forth in <em>State v </em>Petrich, 101 Wash 2d 566; 683 P2d 173 (1984). In <em>Petrich, </em>the defendant was charged with one count of indecent liberties and one count of second-degree statutory rape. At trial, the thirteen-year-old complainant testified regarding numerous incidents of sexual contact over a-twenty-one-month period. At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, the defendant moved to compel the state to elect which offense was to be relied on for conviction, arguing that he was charged with only one count of each offense, but the evidence adduced at trial would support multiple charges. The court denied the motion, stating that the acts alleged were in the nature of a continuing offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The Supreme Court of Washington rejected the characterization of ongoing sexual abuse as a \"continuing offense\u201d because the evidence showed a series of separate and distinct acts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>To determine whether one continuing offense may be charged, the facts must be evaluated in a commonsense manner. In the present case, each described incident occurred in a separate time frame and identifying place. The only connection between the incidents was that the victim was the same person; this is not enough to call the offense one transaction. [.Petrich, <em>supra </em>at 571.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Having determined that the allegations were separate and alternative \"acts,\u201d the court proceeded to distinguish \"alternate means\u201d cases from \"alternate acts\u201d cases.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">[W]hen the State alleges alternative means of committing a single criminal act, this court has approved instructions that, although requiring unanimity in the verdict, did not require a unanimous determination of which of several alternative means was actually used to commit the crime, so long as substantial evidence supported each alternative. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">. . . This is not an \"alternative means\u201d case. The State charged petitioner with one count each of statutory rape and indecent liberties, but proceeded at trial to present evidence of numerous separate criminal acts. Petitioner argues that when the evidence shows several incidents which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>could form the basis of the one incident charged in the information, to ensure a unanimous verdict on the underlying crime, the State must tell the jury which act is relied on to convict. <em>[Id. </em>at 569-570.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">To guard against a compromise in a multiple acts case, the court set forth the following rule: When evidence introduced at trial indicates that several distinct criminal acts have been committed, and the defendant is charged with only one count of criminal conduct, jury unanimity must be protected in the following manner. The prosecutor may, in his discretion, elect the act upon which he will rely for conviction. Absent an election, the jury must be instructed that all twelve jurors must agree that the same underlying criminal act has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, thereby assuring that a conviction rests upon a unanimous verdict based on one criminal act. <em>Id. </em>at 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In fashioning the unanimity rule, the court was attentive to the nature of criminal sexual conduct charges involving children.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">These options [referring to the choice of prosecutorial election or a specific unanimity instruction] are allowed because, in the majority of cases in which this issue will arise, the charge will involve crimes against children. Multiple instances of criminal conduct with the same child victim is a frequent, if not the usual pattern. Note, <em>The Crime of Incest Against the Minor Child and the States\u2019 Statutory Responses, </em>17 J Fam Law 93, 99 (1978-79). Whether the incidents are to be charged separately or brought as one charge is a decision within prosecutorial discretion. Many factors are weighed in making that decision, including the victim\u2019s ability to testify to specific times and places. Our decision in this case is not intended to hamper that discretion or encourage the bringing of multiple charges when, in the prosecutor\u2019s judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ment, they are not warranted. The criteria used to determine that only a single charge should be brought, may indicate that the election of one particular act for conviction is impractical. In such circumstances, defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict will be protected with proper jury instructions. <em>[Petrich, supra </em>at 572-573.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Alaska adopted the rule set forth in <em>Petrich </em>to guard the fundamental right to a unanimous verdict in a multiple acts case. <em>State v Covington, </em>703 P2d 436 (Alas App, 1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Arizona similarly requires the prosecutor to elect one act among several or to provide a specific unanimity instruction. <em>State v Schroeder, </em>167 Ariz 47; 804 P2d 776 (1990).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">California and Colorado have formulated a different, but an equally protective, unanimity rule to assure valid and unanimous verdicts in multiple acts evidence sexual abuse prosecutions. In <em>People v Jones, </em>51 Cal 3d 294; 270 Cal Rptr 611; 792 P2d 643 (1990), the child complainant testified about frequent oral copulation at five separate locations, supporting four counts of child molestation. The ten year old was unable to specify the exact time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>place, or circumstances of the assaults occurring over a two-year period, typical of testimony offered in a molestation case. The jury was instructed that in order to convict the defendant of lewd conduct, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and the jury must \"unanimously agree on, 'the commission of the same specific act or acts constituting said crime within the time period alleged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In affirming the conviction, the Supreme Court of California stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">In [child molestation cases], although the jury may not be able to readily distinguish between various acts, it is certainly capable of unanimously agreeing that they took place in the number and manner described.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">In a case in which the evidence indicates the jurors might disagree as to the particular act defendant committed, the standard unanimity instruction should be given. [Citation omitted.] But when there is no reasonable likelihood of juror disagreement as to particular acts, and the only question is whether or not the defendant in fact committed <em>all </em>of them, the jury should be given a modified unanimity instruction which, in addition to allowing a conviction if the jurors unanimously agree on specific acts, also allows a conviction if the jury unanimously agrees the defendant committed <em>all </em>the acts described by the victim. <em>[Id. </em>at 321-322.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The Supreme Court of Colorado, adopting the rule and rationale of <em>Jones, </em>recommended that when circumstances of a particular case indicate a likelihood of juror disagreement about which acts the defendant committed, special verdicts are advisable to provide additional assurance that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>verdict is supported by unanimous jury agreement. <em>Thomas v People, </em>803 P2d 144, 154 (Colo, 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The foregoing rules strike an appropriate balance between the needs of the state and the rights of a defendant. The state is not hindered in successfully and fairly prosecuting child sex abuse cases. In the event that it is impractical to elect one of many acts testified, the prosecutor can choose not to elect a particular act. If the prosecutor does not elect, the jury must be instructed that it must unanimously agree on which specific act supports the charged crime. Unless the court requires a specific unanimity instruction, there is no assurance that the jurors unanimously found that the prosecutor proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which the defendant is charged. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 US 358; 90 S Ct 1068; 25 L Ed 2d 368 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">I disagree with the view that a specific unanimity instruction is required <em>only </em>when the various acts themselves are materially distinct. When the prosecution puts in evidence of separate and identifiably different instances of the same or similar criminal conduct, the court should be required to instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree on which of the several acts forms the basis of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The premise of the majority is the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <em>United States v Gipson, </em>553 F2d 453 (CA 5, 1977), concerning the need for a specific unanimity instruction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The majority view is derived from <em>Gipson </em>and its progeny. In <em>Gipson, </em>defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>was convicted under a statute that criminalized a number of different and possibly unrelated acts, characterized by the court as two distinct conceptual groupings. <em>Gipson, </em>involving an assessment of guilt based on acts of a different nature, is analytically distinct from the issue in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The instant case concerns evidence of repeated instances of the same criminal conduct offered to establish a single charge. The rule set forth in the majority opinion might be satisfactory and supported by federal law in appropriate cases; it is not applicable here and, most importantly, does not protect defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-10\"><em> </em>Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued April 7, 1993 (Docket No. 126607).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\"> MCL 750.520b; MSA 28.788(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b609-9\"> The jury was provided with a general unanimity instruction. <em>Ante, </em>p 509.

The continuous conduct exception only applies to those offenses where the statute defining the crime may be interpreted as applying to an offense that may be continuous in nature, such as failure to provide, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, driving under the influence, concealing stolen property, and criminal acts of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"A_n\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Multiple sex acts do not merge into a single continuing offense because the defendant can be convicted and punished for each separate act.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">The lead opinion cites an earlier California decision, <em>People v Winkle, </em>206 Cal App 3d 822; 253 Cal Rptr 726 (1988), <em>ante, </em>pp 521-522. <em>Winkle </em>did not apply the continuous course of conduct exception to uphold a conviction in the absence of a unanimity instruction. The victim\u2019s youth and the repeated incidents of the same act of molestation made the unanimity instruction unnecessary. The California Supreme Court disapproved of the rationale of <em>Winkle </em>in <em>People v Jones, </em>51 Cal 3d 294; 270 Cal Rptr 611; 792 P2d 643 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">The New York Court of Appeals rejected the continuing conduct exception to sexual abuse, because those crimes as defined in the Penal Law of New York \"punish the performance of a single act.\u201d <em>People v Keindl, </em>68 NY2d 410, 420-421; 509 NYS2d 790; 502 NE2d 577 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\"> The court of appeals reinstated the defendant\u2019s conviction of separate counts of lewd and lascivious acts and sexual assault.

Therefore, the trial court\u2019s error in not requiring the state to elect among incidents or, alternatively, in failing to provide a curative instruction, did not appreciably affect the verdict. <em>State v Covington (On Rehearing), </em>711 P2d 1183, 1185 (Alas App, 1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b613-9\"> Although the prosecutor failed to elect a single act on which to base a conviction, and a special unanimity instruction was given, any error was harmless.
