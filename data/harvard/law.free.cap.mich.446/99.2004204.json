We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Adrian and Lauren Dedes lived on the north side of Ten Mile Road in South Lyon. They traveled to school in a bus driven by defendant, Joan Shifford, which followed a route designed by Jeanne Asch, Director of Transportation of South Lyon Community Schools. The Dedes children\u2019s bus stop was located on top of a hill near their driveway, where they were to wait until their bus arrived, activated its flashers, and the driver waved the children across Ten Mile Road, a divided highway with a posted speed limit of fifty miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">On June 2, 1989, Adrian and Lauren Dedes were walking toward their bus stop when they were hit by a car. It is disputed whether the girls stepped into traffic or were behind the white line on the shoulder when they were struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">The plaintiffs, the parents of the children, brought negligence actions against the defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The plaintiffs assert that the children were conditioned to be anxious about missing their bus, which they were told would not wait if they were late in arriving at their bus stop. They allege that the location of the bus stop was unsafe because it required the children to cross a highly traveled major highway, and that a safer route could have been designed. Plaintiffs also assert that defendant Shifford changed the location where the children were to wait for the bus from the top of the hill to the gravel adjoining Ten Mile Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The defendants, in separate motions for summary disposition, argued that pursuant to MCL 691.1407(2)(c); MSA 3.996(107)(2)(c), they were immune from suit as governmental employees. With regard to defendant Asch, the trial court ruled that assuming arguendo Asch was grossly negligent, she was not \"the\u201d (meaning \"the sole\u201d) proximate cause of the injury. Regarding defendant Shifford, the trial court ruled that her conduct was also not \"the\u201d proximate cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The plaintiffs appealed. A divided Court of Appeals panel affirmed. The majority held that under the plain language of MCL 691.1407(2)(c); MSA 3.996(107)(2)(c), \"neither Asch\u2019s nor Shifford\u2019s alleged negligence could have been <em>the </em>proximate cause of the children\u2019s injuries.\u201d 199 Mich App 385, 391; 502 NW2d 720 (1983) (emphasis in original). The dissent disagreed and would not have literally applied the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The plaintiffs appealed and we granted leave to appeal, 444 Mich 902 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">\"The. . . employee\u2019s. . . conduct does not amount to gross negligence that is the proximate cause of the injury or damage. As used in this sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>division, 'gross negligence\u2019 means conduct so reckless as to demonstrate a substantial lack of concern for whether an injury results.\u201d MCL 691.1407(2)(c); MSA 3.996(107)(2)(c). Of the forty-seven words in this subsection of the government immunity from tort liability statute, the parties focus on one \"the,\u201d as in \"the proximate cause.\u201d The defendants contend that \"the proximate cause\u201d means \"the sole proximate cause.\u201d The plaintiffs argue that \"the proximate cause\u201d means \"a proximate cause.\u201d The question presented is, in the context of the governmental immunity statute, does \"the\u201d mean, \"the sole,\u201d \"a,\u201d or something else. The question is narrowly focused. The answer has profound consequences for the course of future litigation involving the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The defendants submit that the Legislature selected the phrase \"the proximate cause\u201d as part of an effort to protect governmental employees from tort liability. Thus, defendants urge, not only did the Legislature establish gross negligence as a higher barrier to employee liability, but it adopted a sole proximate cause standard to eliminate employee liability where there was any intervening or concurrent fault by the plaintiffs or another defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The plaintiffs respond by observing that if the Legislature intended to preclude liability even where gross negligence is shown, simply because the plaintiffs or another defendant was also negligent, and if it intended to overturn the doctrine of comparative negligence established in <em>Placek v Sterling Heights, </em>405 Mich 638; 275 NW2d 511 (1970), the legislative history would evidence that intent. We agree with the plaintiffs. The statute is ambiguous. Absent any indication of support for the defendants\u2019 position, other than the word \"the,\u201d we cannot conclude the Legislature in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>tended to take the drastic step of reestablishing contributory negligence and eliminating recovery when more than one tortfeasor contributes to the plaintiff\u2019s injury. Such a construction strains \"plain meaning\u201d analysis to the breaking point.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The defendants claim that the words of the statute, \"gross negligence that is the proximate cause of the injury\u201d are clear and unambiguous, and construction or interpretation is unnecessary and therefore, precluded. The asserted clarity in this case comes from the dictionary definition of the word \"the,\u201d as well as the common-law history surrounding the phrase, \"the proximate cause\u201d when used to instruct a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\"A general rule of statutory construction is that '[w]ords or phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rule of grammar and common usage,\u2019 \u201d <em>Duer v Newaygo Sheriff, </em>420 Mich 440, 445; 362 NW2d 698 (1984), cert den 471 US 1136 (1984), and \"[w]hat is 'plain and unambiguous\u2019 often depends on one\u2019s frame of reference.\u201d <em>Shiffer v Gibraltar Bd of Ed, </em>393 Mich 190, 194; 224 NW2d 255 (1974). The defendants contend that because \"the\u201d is a definite article while \"a\u201d is usually indefinite,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \"the\u201d preceding \"proximate cause\u201d demonstrates a clear intent to limit liability to only those circumstances in which the defendant is the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>proximate cause. This plain meaning argument is buttressed by authority from this Court that recognizes a distinction between the use of \"a proximate cause\u201d versus \"the proximate cause\u201d in jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The source of the surface appeal of the argument is an instructional issue involving proximate cause, of which the practicing bar is acutely aware. However, it cannot be safely assumed that every courtroom connotation is a part of the legislative culture. While to lawyers the phrase \"the proximate cause\u201d implies \"sole cause\u201d heresy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it is incorrect to conclude that therefore \"the\u201d means sole. \"The\u201d cause language is inappropriate because \"the\u201d is ambiguous and might be understood by the jury to mean either \"a\u201d cause or the \"sole\u201d cause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, where the proofs raise a question regarding whether more than one party\u2019s negligence caused the injury, and the jury is not instructed that there can be more than one proximate cause, reference to \"the\u201d and \"a\u201d proximate cause is instructional error. As we observed in <em>Kirby v Larson, </em>400 Mich 585, 607; 256 NW2d 450 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">While it is true that the instructions might have been interpreted to mean a proximate cause, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>also equally true that the jury might have contemplated otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Moreover, where used to describe the cause in fact of the injury, \"the\u201d and \"a\u201d are interchangeable and \"the\u201d does not mean \"sole.\u201d As noted by the author of the Restatement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">In many cases the question before the court is whether the actor\u2019s negligence was in fact <em>the cause </em>of the other\u2019s harm \u2014 that is, whether it had any effect in producing it \u2014 or whether it was the result of some other cause, the testimony making it clear that it must be one or the other, and that the harm is not due to the combined effects of both. [Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 431, comment b, p 429. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Finally, it is both common and grammatically correct usage, to employ \"the cause\u201d language to describe this cause and effect inquiry. Thus, for example, the standard jury instruction uses the phrase \"that <em>the </em>negligence of the defendant was a proximate cause of the [injuries/damages] to the plaintiff.\u201d SJI2d 16.02. Our precedent does not support the argument that where the jury is clearly instructed that cause in fact or law need not be the sole cause, the substitution of \"the\u201d for \"a\u201d is error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The common-law relationship between gross negligence and proximate cause introduces a further ambiguity that undermines the plain-meaning argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">In Michigan, gross negligence was the vehicle advanced to overcome the contributory negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>bar to recovery. In Cooley on Torts, gross negligence is explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">\"If, therefore, the defendant discovered the negligence of the plaintiff in time, by the use of ordinary care, to prevent the injury, and did not make use of such care for the purpose, he is justly chargeable with reckless injury, and cannot rely upon the negligence of the plaintiff as a protection. Or it may be said that in such a case the negligence of the plaintiff only put him in a position of danger, and was, therefore, only the remote cause of the injury, while the subsequently intervening negligence of the defendant was <em>the </em>proximate cause.\u201d <em>[Fike v Pere Marquette R Co, </em>174 Mich 167, 205; 140 NW 592 (1913), quoting Cooley, p 674. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Put another way, \"where the defendant, who knows, or ought, by the exercise of ordinary care, to know, of the <em>precedent negligence </em>of the plaintiff, by his <em>subsequent negligence </em>does plaintiff an injury,\u201d he is guilty of gross negligence and is the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, regardless of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence. <em>Gibbard v Cursan, </em>225 Mich 311, 319; 196 NW 398 (1923) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Although \"[t]he continued validity of this definition was recently questioned by this Court because of the abolition of contributory negligence as an affirmative defense in this state,\u201d <em>Malcolm v East Detroit, </em>437 Mich 132, 147; 468 NW2d 479 (1991),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> referring to <em>Burnett v City of Adrian, </em>414 Mich 448; 326 NW2d 810 (1982), it was the law in Michigan at the time of adoption of this statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Therefore, in the context of the common-law relationship between gross negligence and proximate cause, the statute\u2019s reference to \"the proximate cause\u201d may mean not that the government employee\u2019s conduct is the sole proximate cause, but the last proximate cause. The Legislature may have intended \"gross negligence that is the proximate cause of the injury\u201d to mean that in cases of the defendant\u2019s subsequent negligence, immunity is not available because the conduct is <em>the </em>proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> regardless of the plaintiff\u2019s preceding negligence or its degree.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">This understanding of \"the\u201d is inconsistent with defendants\u2019 contention that \"the\u201d means that any negligence of plaintiffs will defeat liability, irrespective of defendants\u2019 gross negligence. Adding to the confusion, gross negligence is not defined in the statute as it was at common law. Instead, the Legislature created a specific definition of the term in the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>MCL 691.1407(2)(c); MSA 3.996(107)(2)(c) provides, \"[a]s used in this subdivision, 'gross negligence\u2019 means conduct so reckless as to demonstrate a substantial lack of concern for whether an injury results.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The new definition seems to imply a rejection of the subsequent negligence requirement of common-law gross negligence and an adoption of what in the past has been confusingly called gross negligence,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but is instead more akin to \"wilful, wanton or reckless misconduct . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Gibbard, supra </em>at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Wilful, wanton, or reckless misconduct does not rely on the subsequent negligence justification of Michigan\u2019s common-law gross negligence to avoid the contributory negligence bar. Wilful, wanton, or reckless misconduct is different in kind, not in time. In <em>Gibbard, </em>the Court noted with approval the following description of such conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\"Although what is really reckless and wanton misconduct is sometimes spoken of as gross negligence, the expression is everywhere recognized as inaccurate and unfortunate, because it seems to imply a difference only of degree, whereas the whole doctrine that contributory negligence is no defense where the injury is the result of recklessness and wantonness is based upon the theory of a difference in kind. For the same reason, the phrase 'reckless and wanton negligence\u2019 has a misleading tendency. One who is properly charged with recklessness or wantonness is not simply more careless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>than one who is only guilty of negligence. His conduct must be such as to put him in the class with the wilful doer of wrong. The only respect in which his attitude is less blameworthy than that of the intentional wrongdoer is that, instead of affirmatively wishing to injure another, he is merely willing to do so. The difference is that between him who casts a missile intending that it shall strike another and him who casts it where he has reason to believe it will strike another, being indifferent whether it does so or not.\u201d <em>[Gibbard, supra </em>at 321, quoting <em>Atchison, T &amp; S F R Co v Baker, </em>79 Kan 183, 189-190 (98 P 804) (1908)[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The legislative development of the governmental immunity act tends to support the different in kind, not time, interpretation of statutory \"gross negligence.\u201d The operative section of original Senate Bill 465 (introduced October 2, 1985) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">(C) The officer\u2019s or employee\u2019s negligence does not amount to gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">While this provision suggested recovery under common-law gross negligence <em>or </em>wilful and wanton misconduct, SB 465 was amended on October 15, 1985, to state:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>An officer or employee of a governmental agency shall not be immune from tort liability where the gross negligence of the officer or employee is the proximate cause of an injury. For the purposes of this section, gross negligence means conduct so wanton or reckless as to demonstrate a lack of concern for whether an injury results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Although the definition found in the present statute no longer contains the word \"wanton\u201d and has added \"substantial\u201d before \"lack,\u201d the Legislature\u2019s rejection of the common-law definition raises the possibility that the difference is one of kind, not of time.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">It remains unclear from the language of the statute how the Legislature intended the new definition of gross negligence to affect its common-law companion, proximate cause. While Prosser and Keeton note that \"[s]ome courts have said that in such cases [involving wanton, willful or reckless conduct] the plaintiff\u2019s conduct is not the 'proximate cause\u2019 of the harm,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Michigan\u2019s common-law history regarding the relationship between wilful, wanton, and reckless conduct and proximate cause is unclear. The different in kind rationale based on \"the social condemnation attached to\u201d the tortious act, Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 65, p 462, has long foreclosed a defendant\u2019s ability to raise a contributory negligence defense to a claim of wilful, wanton, and reckless misconduct.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Curiously, in the wider common-law context, when \"the\u201d is examined, defendants\u2019 literal interpretation of MCL 691.1407(2)(c); MSA 3.996(107)(2)(c) might prevent it from pleading negligence on the part of others as an affirmative defense. The word \"the\u201d would thus require another abrogation of the current common law of Michigan, which recognizes a defendant\u2019s ability to claim comparative negligence on the part of the plaintiff. <em>Placek, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Having concluded that the plain-meaning approach is incapable of providing clear guidance regarding the meaning of MCL 691.1407(2)(c); MSA 3.996(107)(2)(c), we turn to the history of the statute.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That history provides no support for the defendants\u2019 claim that the Legislature intended the enormous, and unprecedented, impact the word \"the\u201d would have on Michigan\u2019s tort law, and in fact establishes that no importance was attached to the word \"the\u201d or \"proximate cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ae7\">The history of MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) demonstrates a desire by the Legislature to remedy the perceived vulnerability of government employees by elevating the level of negligence required to defeat immunity:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>The bill would extend immunity to governmental employees, however, who are rightfully angered and fearful of the ruling in <em>Ross </em>[v <em>Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567; 363 NW2d 641 (1984)] that protects the highest level of officials while leaving the backbone of government \u2014the worker \u2014 vulnerable. By creating a loophole through which plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys can slip, <em>Ross </em>actually threatens to subject governmental units to increased liability, by indemnification of liable employees. At the same time, the ruling threatens to inhibit employees in effectively performing their lawful duties. Thus, the bill would close the loophole and protect these employees as long as they acted within the scope of their authority and their actions did not amount to gross negligence, and the bill would make it clear that the <em>Ross </em>discretionary/ministerial test no longer applied. [SB 465-467, First Analysis, Senate Analysis Section, supporting argument, p 8, October 14, 1985.][<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">While the initial Senate bill did not mention proximate cause, the second Senate bill referred to gross negligence that was \"the\u201d proximate cause of the injury, bringing it in line with the language used in the House version. However, the bill summaries provided by the Senate and House Legislative Analysis offices differed in how they referred to proximate cause. In \"[t]he content of the bill\u201d section, the First and Second Analyses of the House bill noted: \"[t]he officer\u2019s or employee\u2019s negligence did not amount to gross negligence which was the proximate cause of an injury.\u201d The arguments for the provision, as stated above, do not mention the proximate cause language. Neither do the arguments against, which focus on the gross negligence standard. The Senate Bill Analyses, both of which were issued after the Senate bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>was amended to include the reference to proximate cause and a definition of gross negligence, observed in the \"[c]ontent\u201d section: \"[a]n officer or employee would not be immune, however, where his or her gross negligence was a proximate cause of an injury\u201d (p 4 in the First Analysis; p 4 in the Second Analysis). (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Again, neither the arguments in favor of nor against the bill mention proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The fact that the Senate Bill Analyses attached so little meaning to the word \"the\u201d preceding proximate cause that they substituted the word \"a\u201d in their explanation of the section is some evidence that the Legislature did not understand or intend the dramatic effect the use of the word \"the\u201d might have on Michigan\u2019s jurisprudence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Indeed, if the Legislature had such a sophisticated grasp of the connotations of \"a\u201d and \"the\u201d and the consequences for employee liability, there is no reason it could not have said \"sole\u201d proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">As proposed and enacted, the legislation protected employees and eliminated the <em>Ross </em>distinc- \u25a0 tion between ministerial and discretionary activities, extended protection to volunteers, raised the standard from negligence to gross negligence, and specifically defined gross negligence. All these purposes were noted and commented on as the bill took its final form. It defies common sense and the responsible exercise of our authority to conclude that the Legislature would have provided protection tantamount to eliminating liability without having commented on it._</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>We reject the notion that reestablishment of the contributory negligence bar to recovery was accomplished without anyone mentioning it in a Senate or House Analysis, or in the House or Senate Journal. While the establishment of a gross negligence threshold to liability was discussed, and is significant, it is of relatively minor consequence when compared to the reestablishment of common-law contributory negligence. Indeed, if the Legislature intended the barriers to liability claimed for the use of the word \"the,\u201d the gross negligence standard, for all practical purposes, would be redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">As significant as the reimposition of a complete bar to recovery if the plaintiff is slightly negligent is, it is relatively inconsequential when compared to the unprecedented abrogation of the common-law rule that \"[tjhere may be more than one proximate cause for the same injury, and the mere fact that some other cause co-operates with the negligence of the defendant to produce the injury for which suit is brought does not relieve him from liability.\u201d <em>Camp v Wilson, </em>258 Mich 38, 42; 241 NW 844 (1932). This long recognized fundamental tenet of tort law, under the defendants\u2019 reasoning, would be abolished in favor of a rule that would allow negligence on the part of another tortfeasor, no matter how slight, to relieve the governmental employee of all liability. Again, as with contributory negligence, the Legislature could have meant to modify the common law. It is almost inconceivable, however, that it would do so without anyone noticing.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">This is not a case in which the practical effect of a certain statutory provision was difficult to foresee at the time it was enacted, making legislative comment unlikely. MCL 691.1407(2); MSA 3.996(107)(2) was intended to limit the liability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>governmental employees. The construction of proximate cause advanced by the defendants would limit that liability enormously, much more so than the gross negligence standard. Yet it is the latter and not the former that received all of the attention. A silent legislative record often says very little about the meaning of a statute; but often is not always, and in this case the legislative silence is convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">These observations suggest that the protections allegedly erected by the word \"the\u201d rest on the proverbial slender reed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the plain meaning argument cannot carry the day. The meaning of \"the\u201d is not plain. More importantly, however, as this case illustrates, interpreting legislation is a practical problem rather than simply a dialectic exercise. As Justice Felix Frankfurter aptly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">\"The intrinsic difficulties of language and the emergence after enactment of situations not anticipated by the most gifted legislative imagination, reveal doubts and ambiguities in statutes that compel judicial construction. The process of construction, therefore, is not an exercise in logic or dialectic: The aids of formal reasoning are not irrelevant; they may simply be inadequate. The purpose of construction being the ascertainment of meaning, every consideration brought to bear for the solution of that problem must be devoted to that end alone. To speak of it as a practical problem is not to indulge a fashion in words. It must be that, not something else. Not, for instance, an opportunity for a judge to use words as 'empty vessels into which he can pour anything he will\u2019 \u2014 his caprices, fixed notions, even statesmanlike beliefs in a particular policy. Nor, on the other hand, is the process a ritual to be observed by unimaginative adherence to well-worn profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>sional phrases.\u201d <em>[LaGuire v Kain, </em>440 Mich 367, 398, n 24; 487 NW2d 389 (1992), quoting Frankfurter, <em>Some re\u00f1ections on the reading of statutes, </em>47 Col L R 527, 529 (1947).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In the end, when read in the context of the text of the statute, its purpose, background, and structure, we conclude that the interpretive force of the literal language is less significant than the force of other factors.

The Legislature intended to limit governmental employee liability to those situations in which the conduct at issue was substantially more than negligent. That is how we interpret the statute. The word \"the\u201d before \"proximate cause\u201d is not to be read to limit recovery if the plaintiff or another is also a cause of the accident. It is also not to be read to prevent a defendant from claiming comparative negligence as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-5\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\"> See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed), p 1324:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">The.

As the law-making branch of government, the Legislature is presumed to understand the meaning of the language it places into law, therefore, \"[statutory analysis necessarily begins with the wording of the statute itself.\u201d <em>Carr v General Motors Corp, </em>425 Mich 313, 317; 389 NW2d 686 (1986). Hence, each word is \"presumed to be made use of for some purpose,\u201d and \"so far as possible, effect must be given to every clause and sentence.\u201d <em>Univ of Michigan Bd of Regents v Auditor General, </em>167 Mich 444, 450; 132 NW 1037 (1911). Accordingly, the Court may not ignore, substitute or redefine language, <em>People v Crucible Steel Co of America, </em>150 Mich 563, 567; 114 NW 350 (1907), or assume that the Legislature inadvertently utilized one word or phrase instead of another. <em>Detroit v Redford Twp, </em>253 Mich 453, 456; 235 NW 217 (1931). This Court, therefore, must follow the unambiguous and clear dictate of a statute. <em>City of Lansing, supra </em>at 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Furthermore, the Legislature is presumed to use words that have been subject to judicial interpretation in the sense in which they have been interpreted. MCL 8.3a; MSA 2.212(1). See also <em>Kirkley v General Baking Co, </em>217 Mich 307, 316; 186 NW 482 (1922). If, however, \"the literal construction of a statute . . . would produce an absurd and unjust result\u201d the Court may deviate from such an interpretation to conform with the \"purposes and policies of the act in question.\u201d <em>Salas v Clements, </em>399 Mich 103, 109; 247 NW2d 889 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">These rules of statutory construction are especially appropriate in the instant case because Michigan strictly construes statutes imposing liability on the state in derogation of the common-law rule of sovereign immunity. See, e.g., <em>Detroit v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Putnam, 45 Mich 263, 265; 7 NW 815 (1881); <em>Johnson v Ontonagon Co Bd of Co Rd Comm\u2019rs, </em>253 Mich 465, 468; 235 NW 221 (1931). Moreover, \"[c]ourts should take care not to confuse their inquiries into immunity and negligence.\u201d <em>Canon v Thumudo, </em>430 Mich 326, 335; 422 NW2d 688 (1988).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">At issue in the instant case is the interpretation of the phrase \"the proximate cause.\u201d The majority finds that the language \"the proximate cause\u201d does not mean what it says. The majority holds that \"the proximate cause\u201d truly means \"a proximate cause.\u201d This interpretation of the phrase is in clear derogation of the phrase\u2019s plain and obvious meaning. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed), p 1324, for instance, defines \"the\u201d as \"[a]n article which particularizes the subject spoken of.\u201d The dictionary continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">\"Grammatical niceties should not be resorted to without necessity; but it would be extending liberality to an unwarrantable length to confound the articles 'a\u2019 and 'the.\u2019 The most unlettered persons understand that 'a\u2019 is indefinite, but 'the\u2019 refers to a certain object.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Thus, \"the proximate cause\u201d means \"the sole proximate cause\u201d and not merely \"any or a proximate cause.\u201d Nevertheless, the majority, refusing to join the most unlettered persons, reaches beyond the clear language of the statute to find a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>hidden and metaphysical meaning of this simple phrase. To defeat this clear meaning, the majority inconclusively delves into the common, law and legislative enactments, as well as silent legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Yet, the language \"is plain, unambiguous and not subject to different interpretation by 2 reasonable minds. It is clear, definite, and would be easily understood by even those not trained in the law. The language of this statute, therefore, leaves no room for judicial construction.\u201d <em>City of Lansing, supra </em>at 649. Nor does this interpretation lead to an \"absurd\u201d result. After all, historically the state immunized itself from all tort liability, that the Legislature would choose to permit liability only under strict circumstances is not absurd, but simply one of many solutions to a difficult and complex policy issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Not only does the majority ignore the obvious meaning of the phrase, it also ignores our previous interpretation of the exact language. The distinction between \"the proximate cause\u201d and \"a proximate cause\u201d was well recognized in Michigan at the time of the enactment of the legislation at issue. Indeed, this Court has long interpreted the phrase \"the proximate cause\u201d as one that is \"tantamount to an instruction that, before plaintiff could recover, he must show that defendant\u2019s negligence was 'the sole\u2019 proximate cause of the accident.\u201d <em>Sedorchuk v Weeder, </em>311 Mich 6, 10-11; 18 NW2d 397 (1945) (rejecting such a charge in a traditional negligence suit because it precluded the possibility that there might be more than one proximate cause).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Legislature itself has man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>dated that previously defined terms should be interpreted consistently with prior constructions of this Court. MCL 8.3a; MSA 2.212(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The majority\u2019s holding appears to be based on the conclusion that the Legislature could not have been so unwise as to have intended to limit liability in this fashion. Yet, the wisdom, fairness, or incongruity of the statute is not our concern. <em>Melia, supra </em>at 561. Furthermore, the majority\u2019s proposition that the lack of debate regarding the specific language at issue somehow makes clear language ambiguous, inverts statutory construction \u2014 only statutes ambiguous on their face justify judicial review of legislative history. After all, the clearest revelation of legislative intent is the actual language of the statute. To find that a silent legislative record somehow deletes clear language is simply too incredulous to rebut.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">If the Legislature acted unwisely in enacting the statute or failing to adequately debate its merits, the judiciary may not act to save the Legislature from its folly. As long as they do not violate the constitution, legislative controversies are to be resolved by the various democratic safeguards and checks in the constitution: ballot box,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> initia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>five,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> referendum,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or constitutional amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority, however, stifles and denigrates these processes by reaching beyond the plain language of the act and crafting a new statute reflective of its sensibilities.
