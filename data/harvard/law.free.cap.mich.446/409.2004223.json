Also present was her boyfriend, Cranston. Stegall expressed a desire to use cocaine. She said that Dunn offered to obtain cocaine, and returned about half an hour later carrying a garbage bag containing a large amount of cocaine. Stegall and Cranston claimed that the large quantity frightened Stegall.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">A relatively small quantity, less than fifty grams,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was transferred from the larger quantity by Cranston, Stegall, or Dunn into a small baggie that Stegall testified she gave to Cranston. Stegall gave Dunn a brown paper bag in which to store the larger quantity of cocaine, and supplied him with a syringe, a belt, and a spoon to administer the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">With Dunn\u2019s assistance, Stegall injected herself with liquified cocaine. Dunn injected himself, and experienced a violent drug reaction. His eyes were bulging, he was shaking, freezing, jumping, swinging at things that were not there, and running around the house.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Cranston and Stegall claimed that they left the apartment with her children and telephoned the police from a neighbor\u2019s home.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">When the police arrived, they were given permission to search Stegall\u2019s apartment. They seized the small baggie containing cocaine, but did not observe the larger bag of cocaine that was left, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Stegall or Cranston testified, in the middle of the bedroom floor. Stegall alerted the police to the bag of cocaine, whereupon they seized the bag. Fingerprints and a partial palm print on the large bag and the baggie could not be identified as belonging to Dunn, Stegall, or Cranston.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Dunn was arrested outside the apartment. A police officer testified that he was shaking, sweating, and barely able to stand. En route to the police station, Dunn said \"the stuff was mine, that they didn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201d Dunn identified \"they\u201d as Stegall and Cranston. Dunn added that \"he didn\u2019t want to get them in trouble, that they had nothing to do with it.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Another officer testified that he stayed with Dunn for a number of hours in the emergency room, and that Dunn spontaneously asked \"where is my cocaine[?]\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dunn did not, however, specify whether the \"stuff \u201d or \"my cocaine\u201d was the cocaine in the baggie or the cocaine in the larger bag or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Dunn initiated communication with the police several days after his arrest\u2019 in an effort to work out a plea bargain. The police indicated that they could not talk to the prosecutor about a plea bargain until they knew \"what information he had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Dunn said that he had been hired by a drug dealer in Florida to bring cocaine into this country from South America, that he obtained the drugs, that the drug dealer was still waiting for him to deliver the cocaine, and that he was willing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>help police set up a delivery in exchange for a plea bargain that would permit him to plead guilty of possession of under fifty grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Dunn was allowed to telephone the dealer in Florida, with police recording the telephone call. The police then believed that there might be some substance to what Dunn was saying,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and told him they would communicate with the prosecutor. Dunn was unable to arrange a meeting with the Florida dealer,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the negotiations for a plea bargain ended, and he was prosecuted for possession with intent to deliver 225 to 650 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Following a pretrial hearing, the circuit court ruled that Dunn\u2019s statements could be admitted in evidence. The police officers testified regarding the statements during the trial. The prosecutor emphasized Dunn\u2019s inculpatory statements during his closing argument.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">The Court of Appeals held that Dunn\u2019s statements were made in connection with an offer to plead guilty, and that their admission into evidence was violative of MRE 410.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">The Court of Appeals relied on its decision in <em>People v Oliver, </em>111 Mich App 734; 314 NW2d 740 (1981), which in turn relied on <em>United States v Robertson, </em>582 F2d 1356, 1366 (CA 5, 1978), in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, construed FRE 410, on which MRE 410 is based, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">The trial court must apply a two-tiered analysis and determine, first, whether the accused exhibited an actual subjective expectation to negotiate a plea at the time of the discussion, and, second, whether the accused\u2019s expectation was reasonable given the totality of the objective circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">We conclude, in agreement with the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that Dunn had a subjective expectation to negotiate a plea at the time of the discussion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>and that his expectation was reasonable given the totality of the objective circumstances. Shortly after his arrest, Dunn initiated communication with the detectives for the express purpose of negotiating a plea bargain with the prosecutor. The detectives encouraged him to talk so they could discuss the possibility of a plea with the prosecutor. With the information supplied by Dunn, the detectives went to the prosecutor and obtained a warrant for the second phone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Effective October 1, 1991, the rule was amended to provide that evidence of a statement made during plea discussions is not admissible against a defendant who was a participant in the plea discussions if the statement was \"made in the course of plea discussions <em>with an attorney for the prosecuting authority </em>which do not result in a plea of guilty or which result in a plea of guilty later withdrawn.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Dunn was convicted in 1989 before the amendment of MRE 410. The question whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>amendment should be retroactive has not been briefed or argued. We intimate no opinion respecting the admissibility at the retrial of the detectives\u2019 testimony concerning Dunn\u2019s statements during the plea discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">We turn to consideration of whether the error in admitting in evidence the testimony of the detectives concerning statements made by Dunn in connection with his offer to plead guilty of a lesser offense was harmless. We conclude, on de novo review of the whole record, that the error in admitting in evidence the testimony of the detectives concerning statements made by Dunn in connection with his offer to plead guilty to a lesser offense was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Dunn did not testify. Nothing contradicts the testimony of one of the officers that Dunn spontaneously asked, while in the emergency room, \"where is my cocaine[?]\u201d or of another officer who testified that, en route to the police station, Dunn said, in effect, that Stegall and Cranston \"didn\u2019t have anything to do with [the stuff\u201d] that the \"stuff\u201d was his, and that he \"didn\u2019t want to get them in trouble [because] they had nothing to do with it.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">The testimony erroneously admitted, that Dunn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>had stated that he obtained the cocaine \"from a location in Equador [sic] which is located in South America,\u201d and that he flew into Miami from out of the country back into the United States, was supposed to deliver the cocaine to someone else, but did not, portrayed Dunn as part of the South American drug trade, rather than simply as a person who might have known where in the Ypsilanti area to obtain drugs on short notice in the middle of the night. The inadmissible testimony concerning Dunn\u2019s admissions during plea bargaining thus cannot be characterized as merely cumulative of the testimony concerning his admissions at the hospital and en route to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Dunn\u2019s lawyer theorized and argued that Dunn went to the apartment to purchase the little baggie of cocaine found by the police, and that that was the cocaine to which he was referring when he said, \"where\u2019s my cocaine[?]\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Dunn\u2019s statements referring to \"stuff\u201d and \"it\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>did not specify a particular quantity of cocaine. But for the erroneous admission of Dunn\u2019s confession that he had imported the cocaine from Ecuador, the jurors could have reasonably concluded, giving Dunn the benefit of a reasonable doubt \u2014 as they were required to do \u2014 that Dunn\u2019s statements in the hospital and en route to the police station, might have referred to the cocaine in the baggie rather than the larger quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">While Stegall and Cranston\u2019s testimony identifying Dunn as the owner of the cocaine would, if believed by the jury, be sufficient to support his conviction, the jury might very well have refused to believe their testimony standing alone. Both had an obvious self-interest in exculpating themselves from responsibility for the cocaine found in the apartment that Stegall and Cranston shared.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">While Stegall and Cranston called the police, they gave bogus reasons for having done so. Dunn had overdosed on cocaine, and was going berserk in their apartment. The noise he was making, banging on the walls, and his appearance might have drawn the police to the apartment, even if Stegall and Cranston had not telephoned the police. Stegall and Cranston contradicted each other in a number of areas, conceded they had lied, and the jury might have disbelieved their testimony, attributing possession of the larger quantity and not just the cocaine in the baggie to Dunn, absent the inadmissible evidence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">In deciding if there was a reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>whether Dunn\u2019s statements referred to the cocaine in the baggie or the cocaine in the larger bag, the jury might, absent the inadmissible evidence that he had imported the cocaine from Ecuador, have taken into consideration that Dunn was delusional \u2014green heads popping out of the ground to kill him \u2014 when he made the admissions in the hospital and en route to the police station that did not specify, as did the confessional statement that he had imported the cocaine from Ecuador, a particular quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The prosecutor, in responding to Dunn\u2019s lawyer\u2019s argument that Dunn went over to the Ste-gall-Cranston apartment to buy cocaine, observed that, in contrast with the statements in the hospital and en route to the police station, the confessional statement that Dunn had imported the cocaine from Ecuador was made \"at the jail when he wasn\u2019t talking about green heads, when he wasn\u2019t under the affects of the drug, when he knew full well what he was doing.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-b\">Absent the inadmissible evidence that Dunn had imported the cocaine from Ecuador, the jury might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>have taken into consideration, in deciding whether it was Stegall or Cranston, rather than Dunn, who possessed the larger quantity, that the police did not observe the larger quantity in the bag that Stegall said was in the middle of the bedroom floor and found it only after Stegall alerted them to their oversight. The jury could reasonably have concluded that if the police did not see the bag containing the larger quantity on their first sweep through the bedroom, Dunn may not have seen it, and indeed only Stegall and Cranston were aware of the larger bag, and thus that Dunn was referencing the baggie rather than the larger bag of cocaine when he spoke of \"stuff\u201d and \"it\u201d to the police, and given Dunn the benefit of the doubt on the central question whether he possessed as much as 225 to 650 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The prosecutor, having relied on the greater reliability of Dunn\u2019s confessional statement concerning the importation of the larger quantity from Ecuador, can hardly be heard to contend that, absent the inadmissible evidence, the jurors might not have concluded that there was a reasonable doubt whether it was Dunn who possessed the larger quantity, or whether it was Stegall or Cranston \u2014 who had prevaricated in a number of areas \u2014who possessed the larger quantity of cocaine, and concluded that they could only decide beyond a reasonable doubt that Dunn possessed a smaller quantity, the quantity in the baggie.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The prosecutor emphasized the difference between the statements made to the officers in the hospital and en route to the police station and the statements made during plea bargaining, stating that \"you can\u2019t get a much better admission from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the Defendant that the cocaine was his\u201d than the statements made in the hospital and en route to the police station, \"except that we do have a <em>better admission </em>that the cocaine was his\u201d (emphasis added), and then referred to the statements made by Dunn during the plea discussions about importation of the cocaine, and that he had brought the cocaine in the suitcase to Ms. Stegall\u2019s house\u2014 statements that clearly acknowledge that it was he who possessed the larger quantity.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In <em>Arizona v Fulminante, </em>499 US 279; 111 S Ct 1246; 113 L Ed 2d 302 (1991), a majority of the United States Supreme Court, in opinions by Justices White and Kennedy, expressed the view that a full-confessional statement ordinarily is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>harmless, and was not harmless under the circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\"><em>A confession is like no other evidence. Indeed, \"the defendant\u2019s own confession is probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him. . . . </em>[T]he admissions of a defendant come from the actor himself, the most knowledgeable and unimpeachable source of information about his past conduct. <em>Certainly, confessions have profound impact on the jury, so much so that we may justi\u00f1ably doubt its ability to put them out of mind even if told to do so. \u201d Bruton v United States, </em>391 US [123, 139-140; 88 S Ct 1620; 20 L Ed 2d 476 (1968)] (White, J., dissenting). See also <em>Cruz v New York, </em>481 US [186, 195; 107 S Ct 1714; 95 L Ed 2d 162 (1987)] (White, J., dissenting) (citing <em>Bruton). While some statements by a defendant may concern isolated aspects of the crime or may be incriminating only when linked to other evidence, a full confession in which the defendant discloses the motive for and means of the crime may tempt the jury to rely upon that evidence alone in reaching its decision. </em>In the case of a coerced confession such as that given by Fulminante to Sarivola, the risk that the confession is unreliable, coupled with the profound impact that the confession has upon the jury, requires a reviewing court to exercise <em>extreme caution </em>before determining that the admission of the confession at trial was harmless. [Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">[T]he court conducting a harmless-error inquiry must appreciate the indelible impact a full confession may have on the trier of fact, <em>as distinguished, for instance, from the impact of an isolated statement that incriminates the defendant only when connected with other evidence. </em>If the jury believes that a defendant has admitted the crime, it doubtless will be tempted to rest its decision on that evidence alone, <em>without careful </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>consideration of the other evidence in the case. </em>[Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Often, as here, when the defendant confesses, there can be little doubt concerning his guilt. In light of Dunn\u2019s statements to the police officers during the plea discussions, there can be little or no doubt that he, rather than Stegall and Cranston, possessed the larger quantity of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The jury, absent the inadmissible testimony that Dunn had imported the larger quantity from Ecuador, might have decided that Dunn should not be convicted on the basis of Stegall or Cranston\u2019s testimony because of their self-interest, conflicting stories, and admissions that they had lied, and declined to convict Dunn of possession of 225 to 650 grams with intent to deliver.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Dunn\u2019s lawyer moved that he not be required to wear leg irons in the courtroom. The court denied the motion, indicating that because of the physical arrangement of the courtroom, the shackles should not be visible to the jury. If Dunn were to testify\u2014 he did not \u2014 the leg irons would be removed before he took the witness stand. Dunn\u2019s lawyer claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>at one point that a juror saw Dunn wearing the shackles while outside the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The record does not show, however, that any member of the jury saw or could see the leg irons, and, therefore, the record does not provide a basis for a finding that the use of leg irons deprived Dunn of a fair trial.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The rule is well-established in this and other jurisdictions<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> that a defendant may be shackled only on a finding supported by record evidence that this is necessary to prevent escape, injury to persons in the courtroom or to maintain order. In <em>People v Duplissey, </em>380 Mich 100, 103; 155 NW2d 850 (1968), this Court quoted with approval the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>following statement of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">\"Freedom from shackling and manacling of a defendant during the trial of a criminal case has long been recognized as an important component of a fair and impartial trial. 14 Am Jur, Criminal Law, \u00a7 132. Ordinarily such procedure should be permitted only to prevent the escape of the prisoner or to prevent him from injuring bystanders and officers of the court or to maintain a quiet and peaceable trial.\u201d [Quoting <em>Odell v </em>Hudspeth, 189 F2d 300, 302 (CA 10, 1951)[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The American Bar Association Standards of Criminal Justice provide that a defendant in a criminal case should not be subjected to physical restraint while in court unless the judge, for reasons entered on the record, finds such restraint \"reasonably necessary to maintain order.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The record contains no evidence that would support an order requiring that Dunn wear leg irons or otherwise be physically restrained after he entered the courtroom.

The big bag of cocaine, the one that Lori Stegall says is in this big paper bag in the middle of the floor, the cops couldn\u2019t miss it, nonsense.

Dunn\u2019s lawyer argued to the jury that a fourth person might have been involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b498-5\"> The prosecutor responded that it was ludicrous to suggest that Dunn went over to buy cocaine from Stegall, and that she would have turned over $40,000 worth of drugs to the police. But she did just that, whether it was her cocaine, Cranston\u2019s cocaine, or Dunn\u2019s cocaine. The prosecutor then said that her statements were supported by Dunn\u2019s statements during the plea discussions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">[And] <em>by this man himself, </em>not just in the police car, not just at the hospital, <em>but at the jail when he wasn\u2019t talking about green heads, when he wasn\u2019t under the affects of the drug, when he knew full well what he was doing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">He told Detective Lewis, he told Detective Sergeant Hall, the drugs are mine; I brought them into the country. There is no other reasonable conclusion. To suggest that Lori Stegall is the owner of the drugs is unreasonable.

He then referred to the statement in the hospital \"where\u2019s my cocaine[?]\u201d and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">You can\u2019t really get any more explicit than that; you can\u2019t get a much better admission from the Defendant that the cocaine was his, <em>except that we do have a better admission that the cocaine was his, </em>and that admission came to Detective Lewis and Detective Sergeant Hall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">The day after the Defendant was arrested, they went to the Washtenaw County Jail at his request to talk to him, and they advised him of his rights, and he told them at that time that the cocaine was brought into the country by him in a suitcase, and that he had brought it over to Ms. Stegall\u2019s house that day, and shared it with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">So we have three statements from the Defendant <em>two of which carry the very clear implication </em>that the cocaine was his.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\"><em>The third one is about as explicit as you can get, </em>that the Defendant admitted not only that the cocaine was his, but he had actually brought it to the country from Ecuador.

Because I would hold that defendant\u2019s statements to law enforcement officers are not inadmissible as a part of a plea negotiation, and that a remand is unwarranted because the evidence is admissible on remand, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Defendant Alex Dunn was convicted by a jury of possession with intent to deliver between 225 and 650 grams of cocaine, MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(ii); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(ii). He later pleaded guilty of being an habitual offender, second offense, MCL 769.10; MSA 28.1082. At issue is the admission of statements he made while in custody. Ypsilanti police detectives James Hall and Jeffrey Lewis met defendant after sheriff\u2019s detective Joe Hall informed them that defendant desired to reveal information in exchange for a \"deal\u201d on the pending charges. The officers testified that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>was advised of, and waived, his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights. Defendant asked that the charges be dropped to possession of fifty grams or less, and that he be guaranteed that offense without revealing any specific information. The police refused. The officers informed defendant that they were incapable of brokering any agreement because they did not possess the power to do so and that the consent of the prosecutor was necessary. Furthermore, they refused to convince the prosecutor of the benefits of a plea bargain without knowing what information he had to offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Nevertheless, defendant then admitted that he picked up a kilogram of cocaine in Peru or Ecuador, and planned to sell it in Florida. Because he became nervous in Florida, he flew to Georgia and then to Michigan with the cocaine. Defendant admitted that on the night of his arrest he arrived at a friend\u2019s residence, brought the cocaine, injected himself and his friend with cocaine, and overdosed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant suggested that he could \"set-up\u201d his contact in exchange for leniency, and even called the contact in the detectives\u2019 presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Lewis contacted the prosecutor who agreed to enter a plea agreement with defendant if he could tie the cocaine to the contact. Unfortunately for defendant, the contact was unreachable, and no plea agreement was reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Before trial, the court conducted a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the testimony of the police regarding defendant\u2019s admissions pursuant to MRE 408 and MRE 410. At the hearing, defendant verified that he initially requested that Joe Hall arrange a plea bargain and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>contacted Lewis and James Hall. Defendant also admitted that the detectives refused to grant a guarantee of plea bargain, and that he interrupted his <em>Miranda </em>warnings by stating that he would not give any information without a guarantee. He conceded that the officers refused to grant him a guarantee and notified him that they had to receive the prosecutor\u2019s approval. Defendant also verified the remainder of the detective\u2019s testimony. The trial court found the statements to be admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Defendant was convicted as charged and the Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction. The Court found that although defendant\u2019s statements at the jail were improperly admitted under MRE 410, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued April 14, 1992 (Docket No. 116674).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The majority, however, not only finds that the admission of the testimony was error, but finds its admission harmful and remands the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Plea bargaining \"is an essential component of the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Santobello v New York, </em>404 US 257, 260; 92 S Ct 495; 30 L Ed 2d 427 (1971); <em>United States v Ykema, </em>887 F2d 697, 699 (CA 6, 1989), cert den 493 US 1062 (1990). The United States Supreme Court has noted that properly administered, plea bargaining is to be encouraged because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">[i]t leads to prompt and largely final disposition of most criminal cases; it avoids much of the corrosive impact of enforced idleness during pretrial confinement for those who are denied release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>pending trial; it protects the public from those accused persons who are prone to continue criminal conduct even while on pretrial release; and, by shortening the time between charge and disposition, it enhances whatever may be the rehabilitative prospects of the guilty when they are ultimately imprisoned. <em>[Santobello, supra </em>at 261.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">To encourage plea agreements,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> MRE 410, at the time of the trial in the instant case, mandated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">Except as otherwise provided in this rule, evidence of a plea of guilty, later withdrawn, or a plea of nolo contendere, or of an offer to plead guilty or nolo contendere to the crime charged or any other crime, or of statements made in connection with any of the foregoing pleas or offers, is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding against the person who made the plea or offer.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">I join the majority\u2019s adoption of the standard enunciated in <em>United States v Robertson, </em>582 F2d 1356, 1366 (CA 5, 1978), and <em>People v Oliver, </em>111 Mich App 734, 756; 314 NW2d 740 (1981),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to determine whether admissions occurred during plea discussions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">The trial court must apply a two-tiered analysis and determine, first, whether the accused exhibited an actual subjective expectation to negotiate a plea at the time of the discussion, and, second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>whether the accused\u2019s expectation was reasonable given the totality of the objective circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The majority holds that, for the purposes of MRE 410, the admissions were part of an ongoing plea negotiation. The majority finds that defendant \"had a subjective expectation to negotiate a plea at the time of the discussion, and that his expectation was reasonable given the totality of the objective circumstances.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 415-416.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Yet, the consensus of courts considering the issue is that admissions in circumstances similar to the instant case are admissible evidence. In fact, courts have consistently held that statements made during requests to arrange plea agreements are admissible. See, e.g., <em>United States v Ceballos, </em>706 F2d 1198, 1203 (CA 11, 1983) (holding that an incriminatory letter written in the hope of obtaining a plea bargain was admissible because \"no plea negotiations were underway\u201d); <em>United States v Sebetich, </em>776 F2d 412, 422 (CA 3, 1985). Similarly, incriminatory statements are admissible if a defendant offers them after being forewarned by law enforcement officials that they lacked authority to complete a plea bargain. See, e.g., <em>Rachlin v United States, </em>723 F2d 1373, 1376-1377 (CA 8, 1983); <em>Ceballos, supra </em>at 1203; <em>Sebetich, supra </em>at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In <em>Sebetich, </em>for instance, the defendant made incriminating statements during a discussion with an fbi agent. The court admitted the statements, finding that because the defendant understood that the agent did not possess the authority to plea bargain and that no bargain would be struck during the discussion, any expectation of the defendant that he was in the course of plea negotiations was unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 421-422. In <em>United States v Keith, </em>764 F2d 263 (CA 5, 1985), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>defendant made incriminating admissions to law enforcement agents in the spirit of cooperation and with the hope for leniency. As in the instant case, the agents informed the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and told him that they could only \"recommend\u201d leniency and that the final plea bargaining authority rested with the United States Attorney. Utilizing <em>Robertson, </em>the court ruled that the statements were admissible because he did not \" 'exhibit[ ] an actual subjective expectation to negotiate a plea at the time of the discussion\u2019 <em>and </em>the 'expectation was [not] reasonable, given the totality of objective circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In parallel fashion, the court in <em>United States v Posey, </em>611 F2d 1389 (CA 5, 1980), found the defendant\u2019s statements admissible under <em>Robertson. </em>The defendant\u2019s statements occurred after he told a dea agent that he would like to \"cut a deal,\u201d the agent responded that he could only bring his cooperation to the attention of the prosecution, and the agent informed him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1390-1391. See also <em>United States v Gentry, </em>525 F Supp 17 (DC Tenn, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Hence, in the instant case, the majority\u2019s finding that defendant was engaged in plea negotiations when he admitted his criminal activity is simply untenable. The officers informed him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and explained that they were incapable of guaranteeing a plea agreement because any agreement would have to be negotiated and approved by the prosecuting attorney. Not unlike <em>Sebetich, Posey, </em>and <em>Keith, </em>defendant\u2019s purported belief that he had entered bona fide plea negotiations or that the statements made to law enforcement officials would not be used against him was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>simply unreasonable. When defendant agreed to provide the information under these circumstances, he bore the risk that a plea agreement would not be reached. In fact, his gamble was nearly successful in that a tentative plea agreement was reached. The people should not be punished because defendant\u2019s risk-taking failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Furthermore, a remand of this case is an empty gesture because recent amendments of MRE 410 permit the evidence at issue to be presented at trial. MRE 410 now bars statements made during plea negotiations only if the statements are made to attorneys. In the instant case, the officers in question were obviously not attorneys, and they disavowed any pretense of possessing the authority of a government attorney. The evidence at issue, therefore, is admissible on remand. <em>United States v Bernal, </em>719 F2d 1475, 1478 (CA 9, 1983); <em>Rachlin, supra </em>at 1376.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hence, the granting of a new trial is simply \"an empty gesture.\u201d <em>People v Sanford, </em>402 Mich 460, 498; 265 NW2d 1 (1978) (Ryan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Finally, I agree with the majority that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>court\u2019s requirement that defendant wear leg shackles was harmless because the record fails to disclose that any member of the jury actually saw the shackles. Thus, the remainder of the majority\u2019s discussion regarding the propriety of requiring shackles is unnecessary obiter dicta, and more appropriately addressed pursuant to the Court\u2019s administrative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b512-6\">Boyle and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-8\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b506-9\"> Defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with the crime in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\"> The purpose behind the exclusion of MRE 410 is that plea bargaining is to be encouraged to help achieve the effective administration of criminal justice and admissibility would discourage such bargaining. <em>[People v Oliver, </em>111 Mich App 734, 756; 314 NW2d 740 (1981).]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b508-10\"> Currently, MRE 410 prohibits the introduction of such evidence only if the statements are made to government attorneys.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b508-11\"> See also <em>People v Conte, </em>421 Mich 704, 744; 365 NW2d 648 (1984) (opinion of Williams, C.J.); <em>People v Manges, </em>134 Mich App 49, 59-60; 350 NW2d 829 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\"> The court also ruled that FRE 410 was inapplicable because it only applied to government attorneys, not law enforcement officers. <em>Id. </em>at 265.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b511-9\"> Nor is the admission of such testimony unconstitutional under the United States or Michigan Constitution\u2019s prohibition of ex post facto laws.
