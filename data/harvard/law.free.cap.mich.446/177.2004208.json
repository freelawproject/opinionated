More specifically, we must determine whether the Department of Natural Resources must compensate property owners for the destruction of beachfront property caused by the filtration of sand from the water because of the construction of a boat launch. We hold that while compensation is usually not necessary for the erosion of beach under the high-water mark caused by navigational improvements by the state, compensation is due for the destruction of plaintiffs\u2019 fast lands. Moreover, because defendant\u2019s unscientific construction of the boat launch unnecessarily caused the destruction of plaintiffs\u2019 beach, compensation must be awarded for the loss of the beach. Furthermore, we are presented with the scope of the trespass-nuisance exception to sovereign immunity. We hold that the filtration of sand <em>from </em>a bay that leads to the erosion of fast land does not fall within the exception. Hence, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in part and reinstate the damages awarded by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">In 1979, plaintiffs Robert and Gail Peterman purchased a parcel of lakefront property on the Old Mission Peninsula.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By early 1980, they had constructed a house on the property. An attractive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>feature of the property was its fifteen to twenty-foot-wide sandy beachfront. Despite plaintiffs\u2019 protests, during the spring and summer of 1980, defendant Michigan Department of Natural Resources constructed a boat-launch ramp on its property approximately thirty feet north of plaintiffs\u2019 property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To prevent the buildup of sand on the launch, facilitate boat launching, reduce ice damage to the ramp, and dissipate energy from waves, defendant installed jetties extending thirty feet into the bay on both sides of the ramp.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The jetties apparently worked so well that by August of the next year plaintiffs\u2019 beach had virtually disappeared. By October, plaintiffs had lost not only the beach, but a large tree, grass, and other fast land.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Meanwhile, the jetties accumulated hundreds of cubic yards of sand. Despite defendant\u2019s consistent removal of the sand collected on the jetties, defendant refused to replenish plaintiffs\u2019 shoreline. Plaintiffs eventually built a sea wall to prevent further erosion of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Meanwhile, plaintiffs filed suit in the Court of Claims in October 1981. Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint alleged intentional trespass, intentional damage, intentional interference with use of their property, nuisance, and a taking without just compensation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following a bench trial, the court found that defendant\u2019s jetties proximately caused the erosion of the shoreline by diverting sand from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>its natural path in the littoral drift by collecting it on the jetties. The court found that the north to south littoral drift, i.e., the natural flow of water and sand, would have replenished plaintiffs\u2019 shoreline absent the construction of the jetties and that the deprivation of the sand led to the property\u2019s erosion. The court also found that defendant\u2019s unscientific construction and design of the launch contributed to the loss of the property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court awarded $35,000 in damages, finding that amount to be the loss of the property\u2019s value due to the shoreline\u2019s erosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> finding that because the \"sand was diverted <em>from </em>plaintiffs\u2019 land,\u201d the \"facts do not constitute a 'trespass-nuisance.\u2019 \u201d The Court held that the trial court failed to decide whether there was a taking and that the issue, therefore, was not preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">This Court granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The Court of Appeals held that because the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>court failed to rule whether plaintiffs\u2019 property was unconstitutionally taken, the issue was not preserved for appellate review. Yet, the trial court awarded damages on the basis of the lost value of plaintiffs\u2019 land, which is the appropriate award for a taking action. While not labeling the cause of action specifically, the court appeared to have ruled on the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">In any event, assuming, arguendo, that the trial court failed to rule on the issue, plaintiffs should not be punished for the omission of the trial court. The Court of Appeals cited <em>Joe Dwyer, Inc v Jaguar Cars, Inc, </em>167 Mich App 672, 685; 423 NW2d 311 (1988), for the proposition that issues undecided by the trial court are not preserved for appeal. Yet, <em>Dwyer </em>involved a case in which the plaintiff failed to properly raise before the trial court the issue contested on appeal. Thus, <em>Dwyer </em>simply reiterates the time-honored rule that, absent unusual circumstances, issues not raised at trial may not be raised on appeal. See, e.g., <em>Franklin Mining Co v Harris, </em>24 Mich 115, 117 (1871); <em>In re Forfeiture of Certain Personal Property, </em>441 Mich 77, 84; 490 NW2d 322 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In the instant case, plaintiffs raised the issue below and pursued it on appeal. Thus, the issue is appropriately before this Court. Because of the interrelated nature of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the trial judge appeared to merge the two causes of action. The Court of Appeals could have addressed this problem by remanding the case for a separation of the actions or examining the actions separately itself. In the interest of judicial economy,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we address the major issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"AYs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"AT3\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\">Plaintiffs allege that defendant\u2019s actions constitute an unconstitutional taking of property without due process of law and without just compensation. Const 1963, art 10, \u00a7 2 provides: \"Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation therefor being first made or secured in a manner prescribed by law.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In other words, \"it can never be lawful to compel any man to give up his property, when it is not needed, or to lose it, whether needed or not, without being made whole.\u201d <em>Paul v Detroit, </em>32 Mich 108, 119 (1875).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The primary source for ascertaining the meaning of a constitutional provision is to determine its plain meaning as understood by its ratifiers at the time of its adoption. <em>Kearney v Bd of State Auditors, </em>189 Mich 666, 671; 155 NW 510 (1915).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This is so because \"[t]he constitution, although drawn up by a convention, derives no vitality from its framers, but depends for its force entirely upon the popular vote.\u201d <em>People v Blodgett, </em>13 Mich 127, 141 (1865) (Campbell, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Nevertheless, \"to clarify meaning, the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>stances surrounding the adoption of a constitutional provision and the purpose sought to be accomplished may be considered.\u201d <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405; 185 NW2d 9 (1971), citing Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (6th ed), p 81. This Court cannot properly protect the mandate of the people without examining both the origin and purpose of a constitutional provision, because provisions stripped of their context may be manipulated and distorted into unintended meanings. <em>Lockwood v Comm\u2019r of Revenue, </em>357 Mich 517, 557; 98 NW2d 753 (1959). Indeed, we must heed the intentions of the ratifiers because our constitution gains its authority from its ratification by the people \u2014 to do otherwise deprives them of the right to govern. See, e.g., <em>Carmen v Secretary of State, </em>384 Mich 443, 452; 185 NW2d 1 (1971).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u201d[E]ach State by virtue of its statehood has the right to exercise the power of eminent domain.\u201d <em>Loomis v Hartz, </em>165 Mich 662, 665; 131 NW 85 (1911). Justice Cooley explained the origin of this power:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">The eminent domain may be said to be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>rightful authority which exists in every sovereignty, to control and regulate those rights of a public nature which pertain to its citizens in common, and to appropriate and control individual property for the public benefit, as the public safety, necessity, convenience and welfare may demand. The authority springs from no contract or arrangement between the government and the citizen whose property may be appropriated, but it has its foundation in the imperative law of necessity, and is recognized, and may be defended and enforced, upon the ground that no government could perpetuate its existence and further the prosperity of its people, if the means for the exercise of any of its sovereign powers might be withheld at the option of individuals. <em>[People ex rel Trombley v Humphrey, </em>23 Mich 471, 474 (1871).][<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">From its very existence as a territory, Michigan has recognized that while exercising the power of eminent domain, the state may not deprive an individual \"of his property without due process of law, and without compensation.\u201d <em>Stock v Jefferson Twp, </em>114 Mich 357, 362; 72 NW 132 (1897). The provision, therefore, is one that has \"acquired a well-understood meaning, which the people must be supposed to have had in view in adopting them. We cannot understand these provisions unless we understand their history; and when we find them expressed in technical words, and words of art, we must suppose these words to be employed in their technical sense.\u201d 1 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (8th ed), p 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">As Justice Cooley explained, the purpose and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>history undergirding the provision<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> inherently limits the power of eminent domain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">The right being thus found to rest upon necessity, the power to appropriate in any case must be justified and limited by the necessity .... Any employment of the power for other purposes than to enable the government to exercise and give effect to its proper authority, effectuate the purpose of its creation and carry out the policy of its laws, could not be rested upon the justification and basis which underlie the power, and consequently would be wholly unauthorized and inadmissible. <em>[Humphrey, supra </em>at 474-475.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Thus, the state.m\u00e1y never \"take property under pretense of public benefit, which is not needed by the public, however much it may advance interests in which the public have no concern . . . .\u201d <em>Paul, supra </em>at 119. See also <em>Poletown Neighborhood Council v Detroit, </em>410 Mich 616, 670; 304 NW2d 455 (1981) (Ryan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Furthermore, to ensure the protections of this guarantee, the State of Michigan recognizes a cause of action, often referred to as an inverse or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>reverse condemnation suit, for a de facto taking when the state fails to utilize the appropriate legal mechanisms to condemn property for public use.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Hart v </em>Detroit, 416 Mich 488; 331 NW2d 438 (1982). The instant case is such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">At issue is the erosion of plaintiffs\u2019 beachfront property because of the construction of a boat launch and jetties that altered the littoral drift of the current thereby depriving plaintiffs\u2019 property of the sand that had previously nourished and replenished it. Defendant contends that because it never actually invaded plaintiffs\u2019 property, its destruction is not embraced within the Taking Clause. In other words, defendant contends that its actions did not unconstitutionally take plaintiffs\u2019 property because the erosion of the beachfront was an indirect consequence of defendant\u2019s actions. In fact, this Court has noted that \" '[a]ny proper exercise of the powers of government, which does not directly encroach upon the property of an individual, or disturb him in its possession or enjoyment, will not entitle him to compensation, or give him a right of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vanderlip v Grand </em>Rapids, <em>73 </em>Mich 522, 535; 41 NW 677 (1889), quoting Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (5th ed), p 671. Nevertheless, to ensure that the purpose of the provision is protected, this Court is reluctant to relieve the government of its duty to compensate a property owner unless the destruction of property is \"too remote, trivial or uncertain\u201d to deprive a claim of merit. <em>Grand Rapids Booming Co v </em>Jarvis, 30 Mich 308, 325 (1874).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Furthermore, because \" '[t]he constitutional provision is adopted for the protection of and security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>to the rights of the individual as against the government/ . . . the term 'taking\u2019 should not be used in an unreasonable or narrow sense.\u201d <em>Pearsall v Eaton Co Bd of Supervisors, </em>74 Mich 558, 561; 42 NW 77 (1889). Hence, this Court has long held that \"[t]he right of exclusion or the right of complete possession and enjoyment is one of the essential elements of property in land.\u201d <em>Vanderlip, supra </em>at 533.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, a physical intrusion on the property itself is not required for a \"taking\u201d to have occurred. See, e.g., <em>Thom v State Hwy Comm\u2019r, </em>376 Mich 608; 138 NW2d 322 (1965); <em>Bott v Natural Resources Comm, </em>415 Mich 45, 81, n 43; 327 NW2d 838 (1982). As Justice Campbell explained for the Court, to deprive a property owner of enjoyment of property \" 'is to deprive him of the property itself, wholly or to the extent of the mischief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vanderlip, supra </em>at 537, quoting <em>Koopman v Blodgett, </em>70 Mich 610, 619; 38 NW 649 (1888). See also <em>Electro-Tech v H F Campbell Co, </em>433 Mich 57, 88-89; 445 NW2d 61 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Taking has been found, therefore, when the state has eliminated access to property, <em>Ranson v Sault Ste Marie, </em>143 Mich 661, 670-671; 107 NW 439 (1906); <em>Big Rapids v Big Rapids Furniture Mfg Co, </em>210 Mich 158, 175; 177 NW 284 (1920), or made the usual access to plaintiffs\u2019 land very difficult. <em>Thom, supra </em>at 627 (Souris, J.). Similarly, damage to property caused by a nearby nuisance maintained by the state is compensable, <em>Buckeye Union Fire Ins Co v Michigan, </em>383 Mich 630; 178 NW2d 476 (1970), as are damages arising from the removal of \"lateral support of adjacent grounds to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the injury of their owners.\u201d <em>Buskirk v </em>Strickland, 47 Mich 389, 391-392; 11 NW 210 (1882). In fact, inverse condemnation may occur even without a physical taking of property, where the effect of a governmental regulation is \"to prevent the use of much of plaintiffs\u2019 property ... for any profitable purpose.\u201d <em>Grand Trunk W R Co v Detroit, </em>326 Mich 387, 392-393; 40 NW2d 195 (1949).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXX\">In short,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\" '[a]ny injury to the property of an individual which deprives the owner of the ordinary use of it is equivalent to a taking, and entitles him to compensation. So a partial destruction or diminution of value of property by an act of government, which directly and not merely incidentally affects it, is to that extent an appropriation.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Vanderlip, supra </em>at 534, quoting <em>Broadwell v City of Kansas, </em>75 Mo 213, 218 (1881).][<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>In the instant case, the trial court found that defendant\u2019s actions were the proximate cause of the destruction of plaintiffs\u2019 beachfront property. Assuming that defendant did not directly invade plaintiffs\u2019 land, it undoubtedly set into motion the destructive forces that caused the erosion and eventual destruction of the property. Defendant was forewarned that the construction of the jetties could very well result in the washing away of plaintiffs\u2019 property, and the evidence reveals that the destruction of plaintiffs\u2019 property was the natural and direct result of the defendant\u2019s construction of the boat launch. The effect of defendant\u2019s actions were no less destructive than bulldozing the property into the bay. <em>Jarvis, supra </em>at 325 (finding that \"consequential\u201d damages were compensable because they were \"as clearly the direct, natural and necessary result of the acts complained of, as would be the piling of logs or the erection of a house up on the same land\u201d). Defendant, therefore, may not hide behind the shield of causation in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Defendant, however, also contends that it need not compensate plaintiffs because its actions occurred to improve the navigation of the state\u2019s waterways.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">This Court has long recognized \"that 'riparian rights are property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bott, supra </em>at 80 (citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>omitted).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Normally, \"riparian owners have a right to the enjoyment of the natural flow of the stream with no burden or hindrance imposed by artificial means.\u201d <em>Koopman, supra </em>at 616. Similarly, \"[t]he riparian owner has the exclusive use of the bank and shore . . . .\u201d <em>Hilt v Weber, </em>252 Mich 198, 226; 233 NW 159 (1930). The general rule in Michigan regarding the ownership of the bed of a body of water has been noted by Professor Bartke:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">[T]he title to submerged lands under the Great Lakes and the straits connecting them, but not the rivers, is in the State of Michigan in trust for the people. On the other hand, the title to subaqueous land under all the other navigable waters, including the rivers connecting the Great Lakes, is in the riparian owners. [Bartke, <em>Navigability in Michigan in retrospect and prospect, </em>16 Wayne L R 409, 421 (1970).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Moreover, with regard to any riparian owner, this Court has long held that \"the right to acquisitions to land, through accession or reliction, is itself one of the riparian rights.\u201d <em>Hilt, supra </em>at 218. Hence, the \"title of the riparian owner follows the shore line under what has been graphically called 'a moveable freehold.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Court has elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">\"Upon the subject of accretions, we understand the law to be that additions to the land of a littoral proprietor by the action of the water, which are so gradual as to be imperceptible, be- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>' come a part of the land, and belong to the owner of the land, but, when not so, they belong to the State. So, if, by the imperceptible accumulation of soil upon the shore of an island belonging to a grantee of the government, or by reliction, it should be enlarged, such person, and not the State, would be the owner; but if an island should first arise out of the water, and afterwards become connected to that of the private proprietor, it would not thereby become the property of such person, but would belong to the State.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at <em>221, </em>quoting <em>People </em>v <em>Warner, </em>116 Mich 228, 239; 74 NW 705 (1898).][<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">As property, riparian rights are protected by limits of the power of eminent domain. <em>Ryan v Brown, </em>18 Mich 196, 208 (1869); <em>Bott, supra </em>at 80-81. While it may be true that \"public control of the lake shores is necessary to insure opportunity for pleasure and health of the citizens in vacation time, to work out the definite program to attract tourists begun by the State and promising financial gain to its residents, and to conserve natural advantages for coming generations,\u201d the state may do so only \"by gift, negotiation, or, if necessary, condemnation. There is no duty, power, or function of the State, whatever its claimed or real benefits, which will justify it in taking private property without compensation.\u201d <em>Hilt, supra </em>at 224. See also <em>Garth Lumber &amp; Shingle Co v Johnson, </em>151 Mich 205, 208; 113 NW 591 (1908).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Nevertheless, riparian rights are not absolute. From the time Michigan was a territory, the public\u2019s interest in the navigable waters has been recognized. Hence, defendant correctly notes that plaintiffs\u2019 riparian rights are subject to the naviga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>tional servitude retained by the State of Michigan.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The State of Michigan holds in trust the navigable waters of the state in behalf of its citizens, and riparian owners hold \"the right to use and enjoy\u201d their riparian property \"subject to the public right of navigation . . . .\u201d <em>Hall v Alford, </em>114 Mich 165, 167; 72 NW 137 (1897).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Hence, \"[t]he public, through their proper authorities, have always the right to restrain any encroachments which may be injurious to the public right, and to compel the removal of any obstruction or impediment, as well as to punish the oifender, to the same extent as if the bed of the lake were vested in the State.\u201d <em>Grand Rapids v Powers, </em>89 Mich 94, 110; 50 NW 611 (1891). Furthermore, the state may enact certain measures in furtherance of this trust \u2014 including the fundamental power to improve the navigability of such waterways on behalf of recreation and commerce. See, e.g., <em>Nedtweg </em>v <em>Wallace (On Rehearing), </em>237 Mich 14, 24-25; 211 NW 647 (1927) (Sharpe, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Perhaps, more important for our purposes, damage to riparian properties arising from navigational improvements are often not compensable takings. This is so because the title of such property is held subordinate to the public\u2019s right to navigate and the state\u2019s authority to improve navigation. <em>Hilt, supra </em>at 225 (\"Riparian rights are property, for the taking or destruction of which by the State compensation must be made, unless the use has a real and substantial relation to a paramount trust purpose\u201d). In other words, riparian owners hold a limited title to their property that is subject to the power of the state to improve navigation. Thus, damages that would otherwise be compensable are not because they arose during the exercise of the state\u2019s authority to improve navigation. <em>Id.; Miramar Co v Santa Barbara, </em>23 Cal 2d 170, 172-173; 143 P2d 1 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Our Court of Appeals has also observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">there has been a reluctance to award compensation in cases involving injury caused by activities in aid of navigation. This reluctance seems grounded on the enormous commercial importance of navigation coupled with the almost limitless consequences that may flow from navigational improvements. Courts have hesitated to award compensation lest the costs of navigational improvements become prohibitive and seriously impede commerce. <em>[Tamulion v State Waterways Comm, </em>50 Mich App 60, 68; 212 NW2d 828 (1973).][<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Furthermore, Michigan\u2019s power over navigation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\"is limited by the superior power of the general Government to secure the uninterrupted navigability of all navigable streams within the limits of the United States. In other words, the jurisdiction of the general Government over interstate commerce and its natural highways vests in that Government the right to take all needed measures to preserve the navigability of the navigable water courses of the country even against any State action.\u201d <em>[McMorran Milling Co v C H Little Co, </em>201 Mich 301, 308; 167 NW 990 (1918).][<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In the instant case, plaintiffs claim that the deprivation of sand caused by defendant\u2019s construction of the boat ramp and jetties deprived them of their property without compensation. Undoubtedly, plaintiffs, as littoral owners, possessed a propriety interest in \"the uninterrupted flow of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>sand carried to [their] land by the . . . 'current in [its]\u2019 natural state . . . <em>Miramar Co, supra </em>at 173. Yet, the interruption was caused by the State of Michigan while it was exercising its power to improve navigable waters<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> by constructing the boat launch.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Generally, an individual \"has no such right as against the state. Littoral rights must give way to any use of the tide lands and water flowing over them that serves the public right of navigation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In <em>Miramar Co, </em>the State of California constructed a breakwater that prevented the replenishment of the plaintiff\u2019s beaches three miles down the ocean coast with sand. Not unlike the instant case, the plaintiff filed suit, claiming the subsequent loss of the beaches as a compensable taking. Justice Tray nor explained the holding of the California Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">[T]he enjoyment of [the natural littoral drift including sand accretions] did not constitute a right to its perpetuation, for plaintiff\u2019s littoral rights were always subordinate to the state\u2019s right to improve navigation. The duration of the sandy accretions depended entirely upon the continuation of the littoral right, which from the beginning was subject to termination by the state. The withdrawal of the sandy accretions, constituting the damage to the plaintiff\u2019s land, was an incidental consequence of the state\u2019s use of the public domain for a public interest that was at all times superior to private littoral rights. There has therefore been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>no taking or damaging of private property .... <em>[Id. </em>at 176.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Thus, \"the generally recognized rule [is] that riparian or littoral owners are not entitled to compensation for erosion damage\u201d created by navigable improvements by the state or federal governments. <em>Tamulion, supra </em>at 69.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Yet, plaintiffs observe that they have lost much fast land. In fact, simply because the state is acting to improve navigation does not grant it the power to condemn all property without compensation. <em>Ryan, supra </em>at 211. Indeed, neither this Court nor the United States Supreme Court has , ever \"held that the navigational servitude creates a blanket exception to the Takings [sic] Clause . . . .\u201d <em>Kaiser Aetna v United States, </em>444 US 164, 172; 100 S Ct 383; 62 L Ed 2d 332 (1979). To the contrary, Michigan law has long held that \"the limit of the public\u2019s right is the ordinary high water mark of the river. This means that the ownership of fast land is unqualified and not burdened with a public right.\u201d Bartke, <em>supra </em>at 432.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> See also <em>Jarvis, supra </em>at 318-321 (holding that the public right of navigation was confined to the stream itself and that its boundary was the line of ordinary high water); <em>Hall, supra </em>at 167-168 (noting that land above the high-water line could not be taken without just compensation and due process); <em>Baumgartner v Sturgeon River Boom Co, </em>120 Mich 321, 322; 79 NW 566 (1899). Federal law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>concurs. See, e.g., <em>United States v Willow River Power Co, </em>324 US 499, 509; 65 S Ct 761; 89 L Ed 1101 (1945); <em>United States v Twin City Power Co, </em>215 F2d 592, 599 (CA 4, 1954) (\"the government does not own or have any servitude over the adjacent fast lands\u201d).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \"Consequently, when fast lands are taken by the Government, just compensation must be paid.\u201d <em>United States v Rands, </em>389 US 121, 123; 88 S Ct 265; 19 L Ed 2d 329 (1967).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In fact, \"an actual taking of fast land which is in part accomplished or accompanied by erosion and deprivation of access is no less demanding of compensation because of these methods or incidents of taking.\u201d <em>Tamulion, supra </em>at 69. This is so because \"[t]here must also be horizontal limits to the 'bed\u2019 of [a waterway]; otherwise, the navigational servitude would extend infinitely in all directions and swallow up any claim for 'just compensation\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Owen v United States, </em>851 F2d 1404, 1410 (CA Fed, 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">For example, the permanent washing away of fast land and a house on the property caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>increased river velocity as the result of government construction is well within the scope of the Taking Clause because there are no \"valid distinctions between the undermining and permanent loss of fast land (and a house) due to government-caused erosion and the permanent flooding of fast land due to government improvements to navigation found to be compensable by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1415.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In the instant case, fast lands as well as the shoreline were taken as a consequence of defendant\u2019s actions. The record reveals that a large tree, grass, and other portions of plaintiffs\u2019 upland property were swept away once the immediate beachfront was lost. Such property was evidently above the high-water mark of the property and constituted fast lands. Defendant\u2019s failure to comply with condemnation proceedings and compensate for those losses, therefore, constituted an unconstitutional taking of property without due process and just compensation. <em>Id.; Tamulion, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Furthermore, while the general rule is that only the loss of fast lands must be compensated, plaintiffs suggest that because the loss of the beach below the high-water mark was unnecessary to construct the boat launch, the navigational servi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tude does not insulate the state from a duty to pay compensation. Indeed, the trial court found that defendant\u2019s unscientific construction and design of the jetties proximately caused the destruction of plaintiffs\u2019 beach. As an unnecessary taking of property, defendant\u2019s actions violated the strict dictates of the constitutional guarantee that private property may be taken only when necessary for public purposes. <em>Humphrey, supra </em>at 474-475; <em>Paul, supra </em>at 119. As Justice Cooley observed, \"[t]he moment the appropriation goes beyond the necessity of the case, it ceases to be justified on the principles which underlie the right of eminent domain.\u201d 2 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (8th ed), p 1147. Thus, \"[wjhen a part only of a man\u2019s premises is needed by the public, the necessity for the appropriation of that part will not justify the taking of the whole, even though compensation be made therefor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, to legitimately exercise the power of eminent domain, the government must actually need to take the property.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">As the United States Supreme Court has more recently elaborated, property may only be taken when there exists an \"essential nexus\u201d between the taking and a legitimate state interest, and when there is \"rough proportionality\u201d between the manner of the taking and actual state interest involved. <em>Dolan v City of Tigard, </em>512 US _, _; 114 S Ct 2309, 2319; 129 L Ed 2d 304 (1994).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> While generally the navigational trust permits the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>state to improve waterways without compensating for nonfast lands, the trust does not grant blanket authority to destroy private property \u2014 the loss of the property must be necessary or possess an essential nexus to the navigational improvement in question.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> In the instant case, no essential nexus existed between the construction of the boat launch and the utter destruction of plaintiffs\u2019 beach.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The taking of the property served no public interest because the ramp could have been built without destroying plaintiffs\u2019 property.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Thus, we affirm the trial court\u2019s award of damages for the loss of plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Plaintiffs also allege that defendant\u2019s actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>constitute a compensable trespass-nuisance. Defendant counters that it is immune from liability for such injuries. Section 7 of the Governmental Tort Liability Act, MCL 691.1407(1); MSA 3.998(107)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">Except as otherwise provided in this act, all governmental agencies shall be immune from tort liability in all cases wherein the government agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Section 7, therefore, provides \"broad immunity from tort liability to governmental agencies whenever they are engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function . . . .\u201d <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567, 595; 363 NW2d 641 (1984).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> A governmental function is \"an activity which is expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620. See also <em>Pawlak v Redox Corp, </em>182 Mich App 758; 453 NW2d 304 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In the instant case, there is no question that defendant was engaged in a governmental function by constructing the launch ramp and jetties. MCL 299.3; MSA 13.3 directs defendant to \"provide and develop facilities for outdoor recreation . . . .\u201d Similarly, the department is authorized to \"acquire, construct, and maintain harbors, channels, and facilities for vessels in the navigable waters lying within the boundaries of the state of Michigan.\u201d MCL 281.504(a); MSA 3.534(4)(a).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Furthermore, the state has a strong interest in improving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>its navigable waters. See, e.g., <em>Collins v Gerhardt, </em>237 Mich 38; 211 NW 115 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Governmental immunity, however, is not absolute. Some state action that results in proprietary damages has been historically recognized as compensable despite general governmental immunity statutes to the contrary. Indeed, \"[i]t is well settled that a municipality has no more right to invade or cause the invasion of private property than an individual.\u201d <em>Onen v Herkimer, </em>172 Mich 593, 597; 138 NW 198 (1912). After all, \" '[w]hat difference can it possibly make as to the commission of an illegal act, whether a man acts on behalf of thousands or on behalf of himself only?\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney General ex rel Wyoming Twp v Grand Rapids, </em>175 Mich 503, 539; 141 NW 890 (1913), quoting <em>Spokes v Banbury Bd of Health, </em>1 L Rep Eq 42 (1865).<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The government, therefore, \"cannot excuse its tortious taking of private property by invoking the shibboleth of governmental function.\u201d <em>Defnet v </em>Detroit, 327 Mich 254, 258; 41 NW2d 539 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Hence, \"a direct trespass upon, or the interference with the use or enjoyment of, land that results from a physical intrusion caused by, or under the control of, a governmental entity\u201d constitutes compensable injury. <em>Hadfield v Oakland Co Drain Comm\u2019r, </em>430 Mich 139, 145; 422 NW2d 205 (1988) (Brickley, J.).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Often referred to as the trespass-nuisance exception to governmental immunity, this Court more precisely defined the exception \"as trespass or interference with the use or enjoyment of land caused by a physical intrusion that is set in motion by the government or its agents and resulting in personal or property damage. The elements may be summarized as: condition (nuisance or trespass); cause (physical intrusion); and causation or control (by government).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169. See also <em>Li v Feldt (After Remand), </em>434 Mich 584, 594; 456 NW2d 55 (1990).<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Perhaps the clearest trespass-nuisance is the permanent placement of an object on plaintiffs\u2019 property against the will of the plaintiff. See, e.g., <em>Rogers v Kent Bd of Co Rd Comm\u2019rs, </em>319 Mich 661, 667; 30 NW2d 358 (1948) (finding a steel post left in the ground after the expiration of a license to do so a trespass negating governmental immu-</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>nity); <em>Defnet, supra </em>at 258 (finding an active sewer under the plaintiffs\u2019 house a trespass negating governmental immunity). Yet, because of its invasion of a citizen\u2019s propriety interests, \"it matters not that the continuity thereof was long or short in point of calendar time.\u201d <em>Herro v Chippewa Co Rd Comm\u2019rs, </em>368 Mich 263, 273; 118 NW2d 271 (1962). Hence, a trespass-nuisance has also been found to arise from flooding,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> pollution,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> or the production of sickening odors.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Similarly, invasions of property arising from the construction of buildings that cause the deviation of the normal flow of precipitation onto an individual\u2019s land may be the basis of liability. <em>Ferris v Detroit Bd of Ed, </em>122 Mich 315, 318; 81 NW 98 (1899).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Furthermore, such nuisances may be halted by . the issuance of an injunction. See, e.g., <em>Wyoming Twp, supra </em>at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">While \"[t]he Taking Clause of the constitution rests at the foundation of the trespass-nuisance exception,\u201d <em>Li, supra </em>at 594, n 10,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> the two actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>are distinct and the constitutional provision should not be confused with the assertion of the trespass-nuisance exception . . . Hadfield, <em>supra </em>at 165, n 10 (Brickley, J.). Hence, the damages awarded for a trespass-nuisance may not necessarily mirror or be incorporated within the damages awarded for taking property.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">In the instant case, defendant claims that it never physically invaded plaintiffs\u2019 property. The Court of Appeals agreed and held that because \"sand was diverted <em>from </em>plaintiffs\u2019 land\u201d that there was no trespass-nuisance. Plaintiffs contend that by filtering out sand from the water that reached their property, the property became invaded by purer water, which otherwise would not have existed. Yet, by its very definition, the extraction of sand from the water was not an invasion of plaintiffs\u2019 property. Unlike flooding, steel posts, sewers, or pollution, defendant had added nothing to plaintiffs\u2019 land. There has been no trespass. Thus, defendant\u2019s action cannot constitute a trespass-nuisance. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals with regard to the trespass action.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">In the instant case, we are presented with the scope of the constitutional guarantee that property shall not be taken by the state for public purposes without due process and just compensation. More specifically, we must determine whether the Department of Natural Resources must compensate property owners for the destruction of beachfront property caused by the filtration of sand from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>water because of the construction of a boat launch. We hold that while compensation is usually not necessary for the erosion of beach under the high-water mark caused by navigational improvements by the state, compensation is due for the destruction of plaintiffs\u2019 fast lands. Moreover, because defendant\u2019s unscientific construction of the boat launch unnecessarily caused the destruction of plaintiffs\u2019 beach, compensation must be awarded for the loss of the beach. Furthermore, we are presented with the scope of the trespass-nuisance exception to sovereign immunity. We hold that the filtration of sand <em>from </em>a bay that leads to the erosion of fast land does not fall within the exception. Hence, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in part and reinstate the damages awarded by the trial court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-5\">Levin, Brickley, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-9\"> For those with a cartographer\u2019s penchant for perfection, the peninsula is located on the eastern arm of Grand Traverse Bay, approximately four miles north of Traverse City.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\"> While defendant owned several hundred feet of bayfront property, it refused to select an alternative site.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\"> The jetties were composed of large stone piles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\"><em> </em>Fast land is property that is \"above the high-water mark of\u201d the stream, river, or other body of water that abuts the property. 26 Am Jur 2d, Eminent Domain, \u00a7 192, p 873.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b259-11\"> Plaintiffs also alleged that the heavy machinery utilized during the construction of the launch damaged their home.

The voluminous photographic exhibits submitted by both parties indicate a substantial erosion which occurred subsequent to the installation of the groins/jetties by the dnr in the fall of 1980. This Court finds the Plaintiff\u2019s beach erosion and the presence of cobbles, stones and rocks which are distinctly present only at the Plaintiff\u2019s property adjacent to the dnr launch site is compelling evidence that the groins/jetties are the proximate cause of said erosion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b260-11\"> Unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued June 17, 1992 (Docket No. 117895), slip op at 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b260-12\"> 444 Mich 863 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\"> See MCR 7.316.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\"> Similarly, the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides: \"nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just .compensation.\u201d The federal guarantee is applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Electro-Tech v H F Campbell Co, </em>433 Mich 57, 67, n 11; 445 NW2d 61 (1989).

See, e,g., Treanor, <em>The origins and original significance of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, </em>94 Yale L J 694, 695-701 (1985). Nevertheless, the newly formed republic became increasingly hostile to governmental infringement of property rights as states seized loyalist lands, suspended or remitted debts and the collection of taxes, printed inflationary paper money, and delayed legal enforcement of property rights. To address these abuses was born the requirement that government may not take private property for public use without just compensation. The principle was first introduced into our law at the federal level in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, and was ratified along with the Bill of Rights in the Fifth Amendment in 1791. The principle, therefore, is \"as much a part of the Bill of Rights as the First Amendment or Fourth Amendment\u201d and the property rights protected by it should he protected accordingly. <em>Dolan v City of Tigard, </em>512 US _, _; 114 S Ct 2309, 2320; 129 L Ed 2d 304 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\"> MCL 213.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 8.1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> Accordingly, \" ' \u201cwhere real estate is actually invaded by superinduced water, earth, sand or other material, ... it is a taking within the meaning of the Constitution.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Herro v Chippewa Co Rd Comm\u2019rs, </em>368 Mich 263, 275; 118 NW2d 271 (1962), quoting <em>Jarvis, supra </em>at 324, quoting <em>Pumpelly v Green Bay Co, </em>80 US (13 Wall) 166, 181; 20 L Ed 557 (1872).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b268-8\"> See also <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co v Mahon, </em>260 US 393, 415; 43 S Ct 158; 67 L Ed 322 (1922) (\"while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking\u201d); <em>Lucas v South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 US _; 112 S Ct 2886, 2892-2895; 120 L Ed 2d 798 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">After all, \"[t]he police power of the Legislature in this State is not omnipotent.

Any invasion of property rights to further the navigable trust must be tempered with the requirement that the actual means of the invasion was necessary or possessed an essential nexus to further the trust. Hence, the building of a dam that deprives a landowner of access to a navigable water will often not constitute a compensable taking because the deprivation of the access is the necessary consequence of building the dam and possessed an essential nexus to the navigable trust.

Thus, contrary to Justice Griffin\u2019s suggestion, the situation in <em>Rands </em>is not analogous to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Nor does the building of the jetties in an unscientific manner possess a real and substantial relation to the navigational servitude. Justice Griffin concludes that because the purpose of the jetties furthers navigation that there existed a real and substantial relation to the navigable servitude. Yet, the facts reveal otherwise.

The right of an individual to the occupation and enjoyment of his premises is exclusive, and the public authorities have no more liberty to trespass upon it than has a private individual. If the corporation sends people with picks and spades to cut a street through it without first acquiring the right of way, it is liable for a tort; but it is no more liable under such circumstances than it is when it pours upon his land a flood of water by a public sewer so constructed that the flooding must be a necessary result. The one is no more unjustifiable, and no more an actionable wrong, than the other. Each is a trespass, and in each instance the city exceeds its lawful jurisdiction. A municipal charter never gives and never could give authority to appropriate the freehold of a citizen without compensation, whether it be done through an actual taking of it for streets or buildings, or by flooding it so as to interfere with the owner\u2019s possession.

I respectfully disagree because it is clear that <em>Dolan </em>does not control the resolution of this issue in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">In <em>Dolan, </em>the plaintiff landowner sought a permit from the city to redevelop her business site.

However, on appeal, the United States Supreme Court framed the issue before it as a question left unresolved by its decision in <em>Nollan v California Coastal Comm, </em>483 US 825; 107 S Ct 3141; 97 L Ed 2d 677 (1987): \"[W]hat is the required degree of connection between the exactions imposed by the city and the projected impacts of the proposed development.\u201d <em>Dolan, </em>129 L Ed 2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In <em>Dolan, </em>the Supreme Court opined that the conditions imposed by the city satisfied the mandate of <em>Nollan, </em>i.e., that an essential nexus existed between legitimate state interests and the permit conditions exacted by the city. <em>Dolan, </em>129 L Ed 2d 318. However, the Court concluded that the conditions imposed constituted an uncompensated taking because the degree of exactions did not bear the necessary relationship \u2014 a \"rough proportionality\u201d \u2014 to the projected effect of the plaintiff\u2019s proposed development:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">We think a term such as \"rough proportionality\u201d best encapsulates what we hold to be the requirement of the Fifth Amendment.

[129 L Ed 2d 320.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Respectfully, I submit that <em>Dolan </em>does not control the instant case for several reasons. First, <em>Dolan </em>is a land use restriction case, and its analy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>sis is clearly confined to such a context. <em>Dolan </em>does not purport to alter the entire landscape of all taking jurisprudence; rather, it represents an extension of the scrutiny mandated by <em>Nollan </em>in determining the constitutionality of conditions attached by a governmental agency to the granting of a land use permit. That <em>Dolan </em>is inapposite as applied to this case is underscored by the fact that the majority ignores, and does not even apply, the \"rough proportionality\u201d prong on which <em>Dolan </em>turned.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Second, and even more important, the property at issue in <em>Dolan </em>was purely private property. In the case before us, title to the nonfast property is held by the state, albeit in trust for the people and subject to the subordinate interests of riparian owners. Compared to the purely private property at stake in <em>Dolan, </em>the state obviously has a much greater interest in the nonfast property at issue in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 interests here are more akin to the property interests in <em>United States v Rands, </em>389 US 121; 88 S Ct 265; 19 L Ed 2d 329 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In <em>Rands, </em>the United States Supreme Court held in a unanimous opinion that a riparian owner\u2019s right of access to navigable waters is not property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">[The] power to regulate navigation confers upon the United States a \"dominant servitude,\u201d which extends to the entire stream and the stream bed below ordinary high-water mark. The proper exercise of this power is not an invasion of any private property rights . . . for the damage sustained does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>not result from taking property from riparian owners within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment but from the lawful exercise of a power to which the interests of riparian owners have always been subject. Thus, without being constitutionally obligated to pay compensation, the United States may change the course of a navigable stream, or otherwise impair or destroy a riparian owner\u2019s access to navigable waters .... [389 US 123. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In my opinion, plaintiffs\u2019 right to compensation under the Fifth Amendment of the federal constitution for the erosion of nonfast property is controlled by <em>Rands, </em>not <em>Dolan. </em>Accordingly, I would hold that plaintiffs are not entitled to compensation under the federal constitution for the erosion of their nonfast beach.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Even if relief is not available under the federal constitution, plaintiffs could still seek compensation under the Michigan Constitution, which also proscribes the taking of private property without just compensation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">In determining whether the compensable taking of a riparian owner\u2019s right has occurred, this Court in <em>Hilt v Weber, </em>252 Mich 198, 225; 233 NW 159 (1930), articulated the following standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">Riparian rights are property, for the taking or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>destruction of which by the State compensation must be made, <em>unless the use has a real and substantial relation to a paramount trust purpose. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The <em>Hilt </em>standard has been relied upon by this Court<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and by our Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, <em>Hilt </em>is quoted with approval by the majority. <em>Ante </em>at 192, n 19.
