A comparison of MCL 600.6304; MSA 27A.6304 to its legislative roots, the Uniform Comparative Fault Act and House Bill No. 5154, confirms the Court of Appeals conclusion that the statute does not allow for such factfinder consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b140-16\">This action for a declaratory judgment was com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>menced by the mdot against the owners<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and driver<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of, and parents<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of two children who were passengers in, a pickup truck that collided with a truck driven by an mdot employee. The parents had filed an action in the Court of Claims against the mdot in January, 1989, which was consolidated with this action for a declaratory judgment some time after this action was commenced in October, 1989. The owners and driver settled with the parents without suit by paying insurance limits of $50,000 to one child and $4,000 to the other child.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The mdot seeks a declaration in this action determining the percentages of fault of the owners and driver \"in causing the accident and any damages which may be awarded in the Court of Claims, and limiting the liability\u201d of the mdot for damages to the parents in the Court of Claims action to that percentage authorized by \u00a7 6304.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The circuit court granted summary disposition, dismissing this action, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. The mdot argued that it, the nonsettling tortfeasor, is entitled under \u00a7 6304 to have the percentages of fault of the owners and driver, the settling tortfeasors, determined by the trier of fact, with the nonsettling tortfeasors\u2019 liability limited to its \"calculated percentage of fault.\u201d The Court of Appeals ruled against the mdot, stating that \u00a7 6304 \"does not require the trier of fact to ascertain the percentages of fault of joint tortfeasors who have settled with the injured party and are not parties to a lawsuit between the injured party and the remaining tortfeasor.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The Court of Appeals focused on the language of \u00a7 6304, which it said \"provides that in a personal injury action 'involving fault of more than 1 party to the action,\u2019 the trier of fact shall determine the 'percentage of the total fault of all the parties regarding each claim as to each plaintiff, defendant, and third-party defendant.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aj\">The Court of Appeals reasoned that the \"plain language\u201d of \u00a7 6304 \"refers to 'parties\u2019 to the action,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the owners and driver were not parties to this action, and concluded that the circuit court was not required to determine their percentages of fault. The Court of Appeals observed that an earlier version of the 1986 tort reform act provided that \"a percentage of the total fault would be made not only among parties to the action, but also among persons who had been released from liability,\u201d but that language was deleted from the final version of the act. The Court of Appeals said that this change in the bill was \"persuasive evidence that the Legislature did not intend the result argued by the mdot.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">THE UNIFORM COMPARATIVE FAULT ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">On August 5, 1977, the National Conference on Uniform State Laws adopted the Uniform Comparative Fault Act (ucfa). The ucfa attempted to comprehensively resolve a number of major issues relating to comparative fault, including how it is defined, its use in apportioning damages, the role of contribution, and how a prior release affects all of the above. Because our Legislature\u2019s effort at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tort reform, \u00a7 6304, is loosely based on a blend of \u00a7 2 and \u00a7 5 of the ucfa, with a dash of governmental immunity thrown in for good measure, a discussion of the uniform statute\u2019s workings provides insight into the workings of the Michigan statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Section 1 of the ucfa \"states the general principle, that a plaintiff\u2019s contributory fault does not bar his recovery, but instead apportions damages according to the proportionate fault of the parties.\u201d (Section 1, comment.) In a nutshell, \u00a7 1 establishes a pure comparative fault system, eliminating the older concept of contributory negligence as a bar to recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Section 2 is the most important portion of the ucfa for our purposes, because it served as a template for the Michigan statute. Section 2 (apportionment of damages) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">(a) In all actions involving fault of more than one party to the action, including third-party defendants and persons who have been released under Section 6, the court, unless otherwise agreed by all parties, shall instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories or, if there is no jury, shall make findings, indicating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">(1) the amount of damages each claimant would be entitled to recover if contributory fault is disregarded; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">(2) the percentage of the total fault of all of the parties to each claim that is allocated to each claimant, defendant, third-party defendant, and person who has been released from liability under Section 6. For this purpose the court may determine that two or more persons are to be treated as a single party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">(b) In determining the percentages of fault, the trier of fact shall consider both the nature of the conduct of each party at fault and the extent of the causal relation between the conduct and the damages claimed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>(c) The court shall determine the award of damages to each claimant in accordance with the findings, subject to any reduction under Section 6, and enter judgment against each party liable on the basis of rules of joint-and-several liability. For purposes of contribution under Sections 4 and 5, the court also shall determine and state in the judgment each party\u2019s equitable share of the obligation to each claimant in accordance with the respective percentages of fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">(d) Upon motion made not later than [one year] after judgment is entered, the court shall determine whether all or part of a party\u2019s equitable share of the obligation is uncollectible from that party, and shall reallocate any uncollectible amount among the other parties, including a claimant at fault, according to their respective percentages of fault. The party whose liability is reallocated is nonetheless subject to contribution and to any continuing liability to the claimant on the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Subsections (a) and (b) explain the role of the trier of fact in apportioning damages. Under (a), the factfinder <em>shall </em>decide (1) the amount of damages the claimant<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> would be entitled to if contributory fault is not considered, and (2) the percentage of total fault of all of the parties to each claim. Subsection (b) explains that when determining the percentages of fault, the factfinder shall consider both the conduct of the parties at fault and the causal relation between the conduct and damages claimed. Both (a) and (b) note that the fault of \"person[s] who [have] been released under Section 6\u201d is to be considered when the factfinder makes its findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The comments on UCFA \u00a7 2 help explain how (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>and (b) work. First, the \"limitation to parties to the action means ignoring other persons who may have been at fault with regard to the particular injury but who have not been joined as parties.\u201d At first this limitation seems to run contrary to the express language of (a) regarding persons who have been released under \u00a7 6. However, although not entirely clear from the comment, the statute seems either to define the released persons as parties<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or contemplates that they were at one time parties to the action. Under either interpretation, the hypothetical example makes it clear that released tortfeasors are considered by the fact-finder and their fault is established. The limitation on parties is intended to force both plaintiffs and defendants to join anyone who may be liable, so that the judgment later rendered by the court is as complete as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The comments on \u00a7 2(a) and (b) also explain that the \"total of the several percentages of fault for the plaintiff and all defendants, as found in the special interrogatories, should add up to 100%.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A73\">Although out of order, it is appropriate here to focus on \u00a7 6 to the ucfa, because it. figures so prominently in both the determination of fault and the concepts of reallocation. Section 6 (effect of release) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">A release, covenant not to sue, or similar agreement entered into by a claimant and a person liable discharges that person from all liability for contribution, but it does not discharge any other persons liable upon the same claim unless it so provides. However, the claim of the releasing person against other persons is reduced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>amount of the released person\u2019s equitable share of the obligation, determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Section 6 discharges a released person from all contribution and then reduces the releasing person\u2019s claim against the remaining defendants by the released person\u2019s equitable share. By contrast, Michigan\u2019s release statute, MCL 600.2925d; MSA 27A.2925(4) reduces a plaintiff\u2019s damages claim by the monetary amount of settlement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">When a release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith to 1 of 2 or more persons liable in tort for the same injury or the same wrongful death:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">(a) It does not discharge any of the other tortfeasors from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless its terms so provide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">Ob) It reduces the claim against the other tortfeasors to the extent of any amount stipulated by the release or the covenant or to the extent of the amount of the consideration paid for it, whichever amount is the greater.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">(c) It discharges the tort-feasor to whom it is given from all liability for contribution to any other tort-feasor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">This difference is significant. Under the ucfa, the plaintiff absorbs the losses from a settlement that is lower than the released party\u2019s percentage of fault. Under \u00a7 2925d, the remaining defendants absorb the cost. A hypothetical .example in the comment on \u00a7 6 helps to illustrate the difference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-12\">A was injured through the concurrent negligence of B, c and d. His damages are $20,000. A settles with b for $2,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-14\">The trial produces the following results:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>A, 40% at fault (equitable share, $8,000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\">B, 30% at fault (equitable share, $6,000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">C, 20% at fault (equitable share, $4,000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">D, 10% at fault (equitable share, $2,000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">A\u2019s claim is reduced by b\u2019s equitable share ($6,000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">A absorbs the difference between b\u2019s equitable share and the settlement, in the hypothetical example, $4,000. By comparison, under \u00a7 2925d, only $2,000 would be subtracted from a\u2019s total damages, increasing the total damages owed by the other defendants by their proportion of fault. The full effect of this difference will also be addressed later in the opinion. For present purposes, the important point is that under the ucfa, the percentage of fault of settling defendants is determined by the factfinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">UCFA \u00a7 2(c) directs the court to determine the award of damages to each claimant, subject to any reduction under \u00a7 6, which reduces the plaintiff\u2019s damages by the equitable share of any released party. The judge enters judgment against each party liable on the basis of rules of joint and several liability. The judge then determines and states in the judgment, for purposes of contribution under \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5, each party\u2019s equitable share of the obligation to the plaintiff in accordance with their respective percentages of fault. While a judgment of joint and several liability would not be entered against settling defendants who are released under \u00a7 6, it appears from the hypothetical example in that section, that the percentage of fault of those defendants is also stated in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">Section 2(c) represents one of the major policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>choices made by the drafters of the ucfa. While the plaintiff\u2019s equitable share and any released parties\u2019 equitable shares (which are imputed to the plaintiff) are subtracted from the total amount of damages, the plaintiff is free to pursue any liable defendant for the entire remaining amount as determined under subsection (a)(1). While at first glance the use of joint and several liability in a comparative fault statute seems counterintuitive, the contribution rules found in \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5, and the reallocation provisions found in subsection 2(d), substantially limit the recovery of a plaintiff at fault or who has assumed an equitable share of fault through settlement. The use of joint and several liability appears to serve at least two obvious purposes under the ucfa: (1) wholly innocent plaintiffs receive full compensation, and (2) plaintiffs at fault receive the majority of their money, although they remain subject to the risks of reallocation and certain forms of contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The effect on defendants of the ucfa\u2019s use of joint and several liability is tempered by subsection 2(d), which provides that \"[u]pon a motion made not later than one year after judgment,\u201d the court shall determine if part or all of a party\u2019s equitable share of the judgment is uncollectible. If it is, the court shall reallocate any uncollectible amount among the other parties, including a claimant at fault, according to their respective percentages of fault. The party whose share is reallocated still remains subject to contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Under the ucfa, \"[rjeallocation takes place among all parties at fault. This includes a claimant who is contributorily at fault. It avoids the unfairness both of the common-law rule of joint and several liability, which would cast the total risk of uncollectibility on the solvent defendants, and a rule abolishing joint and several liability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>which would cast the total rule of uncollectibility on the claimant,\u201d comment on \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Sections 4<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 5 delineate the right to, and enforceability of, contribution under the ucfa. These provisions, along with the right to reallocation, are intended to modify the traditional effect of joint and several liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Section 4 (right of contribution) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>(a) A right of contribution exists between or among two or more persons who are jointly and severally liable upon the same indivisible claim for the same injury, death, or harm, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or any of them. It may be enforced either in the original action or by a separate action brought for that purpose. The basis for contribution is each person\u2019s equitable share of the obligation, including the equitable share of a claimant at fault, as determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">(b) Contribution is available to a person who enters into a settlement with a claimant only (1) if the liability of the person against whom contribution is sought has been extinguished and (2) to the extent that the amount paid in settlement was reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Section 4(a) allows the right to contribution to be exercised whether or not a judgment has been recovered against any or all of the parties. Importantly, the right may be enforced in the original action, using as a basis the equitable shares as determined by the factfinder and judge under \u00a7 2 of the ucfa.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Section 4(b) even allows a party who has settled with the plaintiff to offset his losses by seeking contribution if the liability to the plaintiff of the person against the contribution is sought has been extinguished<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and to the extent the amount paid in settlement was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The short comment on \u00a7 4 recognizes that \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5 and 6 of the ucfa are meant to replace the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act (1955), the primary difference in \u00a7 4 being the use of proportionate fault rather than pro-rata shares as the basis of contribution._</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Section 5 (enforcement of contribution) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">(a) If the proportionate fault of the parties to a claim for contribution has been established previously by the court, as provided by Section 2, a party paying more than his equitable share of the obligation, upon motion, may recover judgment for contribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">(b) If the proportionate fault of the parties to the claim for contribution has not been established by the court, contribution may be enforced in a separate action, whether or not a judgment has been rendered against either the person seeking contribution or the person from whom contribution is being sought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">(c) If a judgment has been rendered, the action for contribution must be commenced within [one year] after the judgment becomes final. If no judgment has been rendered, the person bringing the action for contribution either must have (1) discharged by payment the common liability within the period of the statute of limitations applicable to the claimant\u2019s right of action against him and commenced the action for contribution within [one year] after payment, or (2) agreed while action was pending to discharge the common liability and, within [one year] after the agreement, have paid the liability and commenced an action for contribution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Thus, \u00a7 5, like \u00a7 4, relies on the judgment of proportionate fault made pursuant to \u00a7 2 to effectuate contribution. Accordingly, \u00a7 5(a) allows a party to recover on motion against parties whose equitable shares have been established. This feature of the ucfa, like reallocation, appears to promote efficiency by encouraging parties at the outset to include in the action any person or entity who may be liable, so that the entire action can be handled in the same action. Under the ucfa, the plaintiff can sue and pick the defendant he wishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>to collect from, that defendant can force contribution, and then reallocation when someone cannot pay, all before any money changes hands. Even in the case of a wholly innocent plaintiff, who is not subject to reallocation or contribution, the ucfa allows the defendants to settle matters without delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Section 5(b) permits contribution to be enforced in a separate action and \u00a7 5(c) sets limits on when contribution may be commenced.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">There remain two parts of the comment on \u00a7 6, earlier discussed, that relate to contribution and merit discussion. First, the comment displays another policy choice made by the drafters of the ucfa:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The question of the contribution rights of tortfeasors a and b against tortfeasor c, who settled and obtained a release or covenant not to sue admits of three answers: (1) a and b are still able to obtain contribution against c, despite the release, (2) A and B are not entitled to contribution unless release was given not in good faith but by way of collusion, and (3) the plaintiff\u2019s total claim is reduced by the proportionate share of c. Each of the three solutions has substantial disadvantages, yet each has been adopted in one of the uniform acts. The first solution was adopted by the 1939 Uniform Contribution Act. Its disadvantage is that it discourages settlements; a tortfeasor has no incentive to settle if he remains liable for contribution. The second solution was adopted by the 1955 Contribution Act. While it theoretically encourages settlements, it may be unfair to the other defendants and if the good-faith requirement is conscientiously enforced settlements may be discouraged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">The third solution is adopted in this Section. Although it may have some tendency to discourage a claimant from entering into a settlement, this solution is fairly based on the proportionate-fault principle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The alternatives do not mention the position adopted in Michigan, namely, that the plaintiff\u2019s total claim is reduced by the amount of money paid. MCL 600.2925d(b); MSA 27A.2925(4)(b). The obvious reason for this omission, is that \u00a7 2925d does not contemplate a comparative fault system. More will be said on this subject in discussing Michigan\u2019s attempt at tort reform.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Another comment on \u00a7 6 relevant to contribution serves as a reminder that a plaintiff who settles absorbs the entire equitable share of the individual released:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">A reallocated share of contribution, as provided in Section 2(d), comes within the meaning of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>phrase, and the discharge of the released person under this Section applies to that liability as well. Since the claim is reduced by the amount of the released person\u2019s equitable share, the increased amount of that share as a result of the reallocation is charged against the releasing person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">HOUSE BILL NO. 5154</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The version of \u00a7 6304 found in House Bill No. 5154 is based, in large part on the language of \u00a7 2 of the ucfa. However, in the process of evolution toward the form of the act as eventually adopted, changes began to emerge that indicate that the Michigan Legislature was making different policy choices than the drafters of the ucfa.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">HB 5154 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">Sec. 6304. (1) In a personal injury action involving fault of more than 1 party to the action, including third-party defendants and persons who have been released from liability pursuant to section 2925d, the court, unless otherwise agreed by all parties to the action, shall instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories or, if there is no ' jury, shall make findings indicating both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">(a) The total amount of each claimant\u2019s damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">(b) The percentage of the total fault of all of the parties regarding each claim as to each claimant, defendant, and third-party defendant and person who has been released from liability pursuant to section 2925d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-13\">(2) In determining the percentages of fault under subsection (l)(b), the trier of fact shall consider both the nature of the conduct of each party at fault and the extent of the causal relation between the conduct and the damages claimed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>(3) The court shall determine the award of damages to each claimant in accordance with the findings under subsection (1), subject to any reduction under section 2925d(b) or 6303, and enter judgment against each party except that judgment shall not be entered against a person who has been released from liability pursuant to section 2925d. Except as provided in subsection (4), a person shall not be required to pay damages in an amount greater than his or her relative degree of fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">(4) Upon motion made not later than 1 year after judgment is entered, the court shall determine whether all or part of a party\u2019s equitable share of the obligation is uncollectible from that party, and shall reallocate any uncollectible amount among the other parties, including a claimant at fault, but not including a person who has been released from liability pursuant to section 2925d, according to their respective percentages of fault as determined under subsection (1). A party shall not be required to pay a percentage of any uncollectible amount which exceeds that party\u2019s percentage of fault as determined under subsection (1). The party whose liability is reallocated continues to be subject to contribution and to any continuing liability to the claimant on the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The only substantive difference between parts (1) and (2) of the HB 5154 version of \u00a7 6304 and parts (a) and (b) of UCFA \u00a7 2 is the language relating to released parties. House Bill 5154 called for the factfinder to consider parties released pursuant to \u00a7 2925d, and the ucfa called for consideration of those released pursuant to \u00a7 6. To fully understand what this difference means, it is necessary to review the state of the law at the time HB 5154 was proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In <em>Mayhew v Berrien Co Rd Comm, </em>414 Mich 399; 326 NW2d 366 (1982), this Court considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>facts and arguments similar to those presented today. In that case, the defendant road commission argued that this Court\u2019s adoption of comparative negligence in <em>Placek v Sterling Heights, </em>405 Mich 638; 275 NW2d 511 (1979), and the Legislature\u2019s adoption of the same concept for products liability in MCL 600.2949; MSA 27A.2949 implicitly modified the statutory method for setting off a settlement amendment. The defendant argued that \"comparative fault must apply to all tortfeasors, including settling tortfeasors, which means that plaintiff\u2019s total damage recovery must be reduced by the settler\u2019s proportionate share of fault rather than the value of the settlement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405. We rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments on both statutory and public policy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The unanimous Court in <em>Mayhew, supra </em>at 405, began by noting that, while the defendants\u2019 \"argument is not without logic,\u201d it must fall to legislative intent; \"when the Legislature, by 1982 PA 147, amended \u00a7 2925b and did not amend \u00a7 2925d of the contribution between joint tortfeasors section of the Revised Judicature Act, the Legislature gave this Court a strong signal that it intended \u00a7 2925d to remain viable rather than be superseded by inference by <em>Placek </em>or the products liability comparative negligence statute.\u201d <em>Mayhew, supra </em>at 410. Section 2925d defined, both at the time of <em>Mayhew </em>and HB 5154,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the effect of a release or covenant not to sue. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">When a release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith to 1 of 2 or more persons liable in tort for the same injury or the same wrongful death:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">(a) It does not discharge any of the other tortfeasors from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless its terms so provide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>(b) It reduces the claim against the other tortfeasors to the extent of any amount stipulated by the release or the covenant or to the extent of the amount of the consideration paid for it, whichever amount is the greater.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">(c) It discharges the tort-feasor to whom it is given from all liability for contribution to any other tort-feasor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">We concluded that the statute provides \"that the total share of damage liability of non-settling tortfeasors should be the entire amount of damages minus the value of the settlement rather than minus the proportionate share of fault of the settling tortfeasor\u201d interpretation, finding this construction \"consistent with the ever-important policies of (1) encouraging settlements and (2) assuring that a plaintiff is fully compensated for the injuries sustained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407, 411-412.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\"><em>Mayhew </em>was the state of the law at the time HB 5154 was proposed. Under subsection (1) of that bill, the <em>Mayhew </em>prohibition against consideration by the factfinder of the fault of settling tortfeasors was eliminated. However, as subsection (3) illustrates, \u00a7 2925d survived untouched, apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>with the <em>Mayhew </em>interpretation of that section likewise intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Subsection (3) represents another dramatic shift from the ucfa, although again much of the language is similar. Under subsection (3), after the factfinder determines the degree of fault of all tortfeasors under subsection (1), the judge is to determine the award of damages to each plaintiff, subject to any reductions under \u00a7 2925d and MCL 600.6303; MSA 27A.6303.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This language is nearly identical to that found in UCFA \u00a7 2(c). However, at the point at which the ucfa imposes judgment on the basis of joint and several liability, and directs the judge to state in the judgment the fault of all of the parties for contribution purposes, subsection (3) takes a different tack and directs that, except as provided in the following subsection (4), a person shall not be required to pay damages in an amount greater than the relative degree of fault. Subsection (3) also announces that a judgment shall not be entered against anyone released under \u00a7 2925d.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The effect of subsection (3) is to almost entirely eliminate joint and several liability, replacing it with a slightly diluted form of comparative fault. Whereas the ucfa used contribution and reallocation to ameliorate the harsh effects of joint and several liability, HB 5154, although it still uses reallocation under subsection (4), shifts most of the risks of obtaining a judgment onto the plaintiff, thereby avoiding joint and several liability.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">While a complete interpretation of HB 5154 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>unnecessary for present purposes, some conclusions can be drawn. Taken as a whole, HB 5154 would have rewritten much of Michigan\u2019s personal injury damages law.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The bill would have explicitly done away with the portion of the <em>Mayhew </em>holding that prevented a jury from considering the fault of settling tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Although not as clear, it also appears that the House bill provided nonsettling tortfeasors with a double setoff. Section 2925d is still utilized in the House bill, and subsection (3) allows the settlement figure to reduce the total damages as calculated under subsection (1). In this respect, the bill appears to contemplate a joint and several system along the lines of <em>Mayhew. </em>However, the bill goes on to limit the amount a party must pay to its relative degree of fault. This limitation is sensible in a system like the ucfa, which does not set off the settling parties\u2019 percentage of fault. The monetary value of the settlement is not considered. However, by reducing the total damages for settlement money received pursuant to \u00a7 2925d, and by limiting a nonsettling tortfeasor\u2019s liability to his percentage of fault relative to all tortfeasors including those that have settled, the House bill seems to attribute both the money <em>and </em>the fault of the settling tortfeasors to the plaintiff. If this is the correct interpretation of what the bill intended, HB 5154 would discourage settlement, not promote it.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Finally, HB 5154 would have eliminated joint and several liability in all cases, regardless of the negligence of the plaintiff, and replaced it with a system in which the plaintiff assumed the entire risk of nonpayment, tempered only by the possibility of reallocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">MCL 600.6304; MSA 27A.6304</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The version of \u00a7 6304 before us in the present case still contains much of the language originally found in the ucfa. It also includes many of the modifications found in HB 5154. However, the statute as adopted incorporates several policy decisions that distinguish it from its predecessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">At the time of adoption, \u00a7 6304 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">(1) In a personal injury action involving fault of more than 1 party to the action, including third-party defendants, the court, unless otherwise agreed by all parties to the action, shall instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories or, if there is no jury, shall make findings indicating both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">(a) The total amount of each plaintiff\u2019s damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">(b) The percentage of the total fault of all of the parties regarding each claim as to each plaintiff, defendant, and third-party defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">(2) In determining the percentages of fault under subsection (l)(b), the trier of fact shall consider both the nature of the conduct of each party at fault and the extent of the causal relation between the conduct and the damages claimed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-13\">(6) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and subsection (7), upon motion made not later than 6 months after a final judgment is entered, the court shall determine whether all or part of a party\u2019s share of the obligation is uncollectible from that party, and shall reallocate any uncollectible amount among the other parties according to their respective percentages of fault as determined under subsection (1). A party shall not be required to pay a percentage of any uncollectible amount which exceeds that party\u2019s percentage of fault as determined under subsection (1). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>party whose liability is reallocated shall continue to be subject to contribution and to any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">(7) Notwithstanding subsection (3), a governmental agency, other than a governmental hospital or medical care facility, shall not be required to pay a percentage of any uncollectible amount which exceeds the governmental agency\u2019s percentage of fault as determined under subsection (1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Subsections (1) and (2) of \u00a7 6304 are almost identical to the ucfa and HB 5154, with one very important omission: they do not include a reference to released parties. Whereas UCFA \u00a7 2(a)(2) referred to \"the total fault of all of the parties to each claim that is allocated to each claimant, defendant, third-party defendant, <em>and person who has been released from liability under Section 6\u201d </em>and HB 5154 \u00a7 6304(l)(b) referred to \"the total fault of all of the parties regarding each claim as to each claimant, defendant, and third-party defendant <em>and person who has been released from liability pursuant to Section </em>2925d,\u201d \u00a7 6304 as enacted only refers to \"the total fault of all of the parties regarding each claim as to each plaintiff, defendant, and third-party defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) While this omission implies that the Legislature did not intend the fault of settling tortfeasors to be considered, the mdot argues that there are other subsections of \u00a7 6304 that suggest the opposite intent. These arguments will be addressed as they appear in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Subsection (3) has no counterpart in either the ucfa or HB 5154. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">If it is determined under subsections (1) and (2) that a plaintiff is not at fault, subsections (5) and (6) shall not apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">This subsection represents an apparent policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>choice on the part of the Legislature to protect plaintiffs who are wholly without fault. Under the \"pure\u201d form of comparative fault contemplated by HB 5154, even an entirely innocent plaintiff, a plaintiff who was in no way negligent, had to bear the risk of nonrecovery. This was in stark contrast to the ucfa, in which joint and several liability imposed that risk on defendants. As adopted, subsection (3) of \u00a7 6304<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> protects the innocent plaintiff through the use of joint and several liability, at least with regard to nongovernmental defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Subsection (3) is important for another reason. It confirms that \u00a7 2925d still means what <em>Mayhew </em>said it meant, \"the total share of damage liability of non-settling tortfeasors should be the entire amount of damages minus the value of the settlement . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407. Because subsection (3) contemplates joint and several liability, the traditional \u00a7 2925d setoff is operative. While it could still be argued that \u00a7 2925d has been impliedly changed by the tort reform legislation to contemplate proportional fault, the complete lack of any language countering this Court\u2019s rejection of this argument in the joint and several setting, makes the argument that \u00a7 2925 has been changed by implication unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Subsection (5) is the foundation for the government\u2019s argument that the fault of settling parties is to be considered by the factfinder.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">The court shall determine the award of damages to each plaintiff in accordance with the findings under subsection (1), subject to any reduction under sections 2925d and 6303, and enter judgment against each party, including a third-party defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>dant, except that judgment shall not be entered against a person who has been released from liability pursuant to section 2925d. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), a person shall not be required to pay damages in an amount greater than his or her percentage of fault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">The section is identical in language to subsection (3) in HB 5154 in all but one respect.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It applies only when the plaintiff is at fault, and contains some language that seems to imply that more than just nonsettling tortfeasors are considered by the factfinder. The mdot contends that the phrase \"except that judgment shall not be entered against a person who has been released from liability pursuant to section 2925d,\u201d indicates a legislative intent that the factfinder is to consider released parties in the calculation of fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The context in which \u00a7 6304 was adopted must be remembered. <em>Mayhew </em>was the governing law, and its interpretation of comparative fault precluded factfinder consideration of the fault of settling tortfeasors. Our decision was based on both \u00a7 2925d, which was not, and has not, been amended, and the public \"policies of (1) encouraging settlements and (2) assuring that a plaintiff is fully compensated for injuries sustained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411-412. The language of HB 5154 explicitly allowed the factfinder to consider the fault of released parties and would have undone that portion of <em>Mayhew </em>that did not allow for such consideration. However, \u00a7 6304 as adopted, does not. In light of the case law and legislative history, it is too great a stretch to conclude that the ambiguous language in subsection (5) was intended to accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>plish all that the specific, but eliminated, language found in the House bill would have accomplished.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">As a whole, \u00a7 6304 as enacted appears to be an attempt to take a less drastic approach to tort reform than was proposed in HB 5154.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> When a plaintiff is not at fault, the risk of nonrecovery falls on the defendant, and the plaintiff recovers under joint and several liability. When the plaintiff is at fault, the fault of the nonsettling defendants is apportioned among all the parties to the action, who pay according to that fault. This interpretation is consistent with this Court\u2019s interpretation in <em>Mayhew </em>of \u00a7 2925d. The total judgment is reduced only by the settlement amount and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>problem of double setoff seemingly suggested in HB 5154 is avoided.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmance of the trial court\u2019s ruling of no actual controversy arguably should have precluded it from reaching the substantive merits. However, because the trial court had jurisdiction to decide the merits, see <em>Allstate Ins Co v Hayes, </em>422 Mich 56; 499 NW2d 743 (1993), the efforts and energy of the parties and this Court weigh in favor of the efficiency of deciding the issue in the instant action.

In brief, it would appear that at the time it was enacted, and for purposes of this case, \u00a7 6304(6) was only applicable in cases involving a plaintiff at fault. While its language is similar to HB 5154, it has reduced the time in which to make a reallocation motion to six months and has deleted the language \"including a claimant at fault, but not including a person who has been released from liability pursuant to section 2925d,\u201d found in subsection (4) of the House bill. It is unnecessary to speculate how this deletion affects reallocation. Suffice it to say that if the Legislature had intended by the reference to \u00a7 2925d in subsection (5) to suggest that the fault of settling parties is to be considered by the factfinder, it did not choose to do so in subsection (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The mdot also relies on subsection (7) to support its argument that the fault of all tortfeasors is to be considered by the factfinder. Like subsections (3) and (4), subsection (7) does not appear in the House bill or the ucfa. The mdot argues that because the government is not required to pay a percentage of an uncollectible amount greater than its percentage of fault, notwithstanding subsection (3), the factfinder must consider the fault of settling tortfeasors. While the Legislature\u2019s exact intent in drafting subsection (7) can only be guessed, what is clear is that the apparent attempt to somehow limit governmental liability is far from the forthright indication of legislative intent that is normally necessary to overrule settled precedent. That being the case, it is unnecessary to further interpret a subsection that is inapplicable under these facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b164-9\"> The mdot\u2019s argument that the factfinder is not required to apportion damages so that one hundred percent of the fault is accounted for among the parties is rejected. The argument is inconsistent with the conclusion that the Legislature intended to modify the decision <em>Mayhew </em>rather than overrule it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\"> Left for another day is the question how subsections (6) and (7) of \u00a7 6304 as originally enacted are to be applied. In a case involving multiple party defendants and an innocent plaintiff, it could be argued that subsection (7) directs that the government\u2019s overall liability be limited to its degree of fault plus any reallocation. Note that recent amendments of \u00a7 6304 will further complicate the question because the statute as amended does not change the referenced numbers in subsection (3). The Legislature now seems to be applying both reallocation subsections regardless of the plaintiff\u2019s fault. While the significance of reallocation in general is questionable in situations in which joint and several liability applies under the statute, it is for the Legislature to address this situation, not the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b165-10\"> However, the Bergdolls and Thrasher were properly dismissed at the outset because the mdot failed to state a claim.

The owners and driver settled with the parents without suit by paying insurance limits of $50,000 to one child and $4,000 to the other child.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The mdot seeks a declaration in this action determining the percentages of fault of the owners</p>\n<p id=\"AKO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>and driver \"in causing the accident and any damages which may be awarded in the Court of Claims, and limiting the liability\u201d of the mdot for damages to the parents in the Court of Claims action to that percentage authorized by \u00a7 6304.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The circuit court granted summary disposition, dismissing this action, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. The mdot argued that it, the nonsettling tortfeasor, is entitled under \u00a7 6304 to have the percentages of fault of the owners and driver, the settling tortfeasors, determined by the trier of fact, with the nonsettling tortfeasors\u2019 liability limited to its \"calculated percentage of fault.\u201d The Court of Appeals ruled against the mdot, stating that \u00a7 6304 \"does not require the trier of fact to ascertain the percentages of fault of joint tortfeasors who have settled with the injured party and are not parties to a lawsuit between the injured party and the remaining tortfeasor.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AsU\">The Court of Appeals focused on the language of \u00a7 6304, which it said \"provides that in a personal injury action 'involving fault of more than 1 party to the action,\u2019 the trier of fact shall determine the 'percentage of the total fault of all the parties regarding each , claim as to each plaintiff, defendant, and third-party defendant.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AY5\">The Court of Appeals reasoned that the \"plain language\u201d of \u00a7 6304 \"refers to 'parties\u2019 to the action,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the owners and driver were not parties to this action, and concluded that the circuit court was not required to determine their percentages of fault. The Court of Appeals observed that an earlier version of the 1986 tort reform act provided that \"a percentage of the total fault would be made not only among parties to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>action, but also among persons who had been released from liability,\u201d but that language was deleted from the final version of the act. The Court of Appeals said that this change in the bill was \"persuasive evidence that the Legislature did not intend the result argued by the mdot.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A__\">We agree with the reasoning of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Subsection (1) of \u00a7 6304, by its terms, applies only to a personal injury action \"involving fault of more than 1 <em>party </em>to the action.\u201d Subsection (1) further provides that the judge shall instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories or, if there is no jury, the judge shall make findings concerning the \"percentage of the total fault of all of the <em>parties </em>regarding each claim as to each <em>plaintiff, defendant, and third-party </em>defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Subsection (2) provides that in making that determination, the trier of fact shall consider \"the conduct of each <em>party </em>at fault.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Subsection <em>(5) </em>provides that the court shall determine the award of damages to each plaintiff \"in accordance with the findings under <em>subsection (1),\u201d </em>and enter judgment against \"each <em>party, including a third-party </em>defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Although an earlier version of the 1986 tort reform act would have provided, as observed by the Court of Appeals, that a percentage of the total fault would be allocated not only among \"parties\u201d to the action, but also among \"persons\u201d who had been released from liability, and the language adverting to such \"persons\u201d was removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>before the bill was enacted, subsection (5) continues to refer to \"person[s],\u201d stating \"that judgment shall not be entered against a <em>person </em>who has been released from liability pursuant to section 2925d. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), a <em>person </em>shall not be required to pay damages in an amount greater than his or her percentage of fault.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Subsection (6) provides for reallocation of any uncollectible amount of the judgment \"among the other parties\u201d according to their percentage of fault as determined under subsection (1), and subsection (7) provides that a governmental agency, other than a governmental hospital, \"shall not be required to pay a percentage of any uncollectible amount which exceeds the governmental agency\u2019s percentage of fault as determined under subsection (1).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The mdot argues that the retention of the word \"person\u201d in the last clauses of subsection (5) and the language of subsection (7) limiting the liability of an agency other than a governmental hospital to the \"percentage of fault as determined under subsection (1),\u201d indicates a legislative purpose to limit the mdot\u2019s liability to its percentage of fault determined after taking into consideration the percentages of fault of the tortfeasors who settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The apparent reason for retention of the word \"person,\u201d rather than \"party,\u201d in the penultimate sentence of subsection (5) is that the apparent purpose was to provide that a judgment shall not be entered against either a party or a person who had not been a party released from liability pursuant to \u00a7 2925d. Similarly, in stating in the very next sentence that \"a <em>person </em>shall not be required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>to pay damages in an amount greater than his or her percentage of fault\u201d (emphasis added), the Legislature, in all likelihood, was simply continuing the idiom of the immediately preceding clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">The term \"person\u201d means and includes, in this context, a party to the action. The use of the word \"person\u201d rather than \"party\u201d in this one sentence of subsection (5) cannot reasonably be read to have changed all the preceding references to \"party\u201d or \"parties\u201d to mean \"party/parties\u201d <em>and </em>\"other persons\u201d who are tortfeasors although not a party/ parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The statement in subsection (7) that an agency other than a governmental hospital \"shall not be required to pay a percentage <em>of any uncollectible amount </em>which exceeds the governmental agency\u2019s percentage of fault as determined under subsection (1)\u201d (emphasis added), cannot properly be read as stating also that such an agency\u2019s percentage of fault shall be determined under subsection (1) after taking into consideration the percentage of fault of settling tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The limitation set forth in subsection (7) bars only efforts to collect \"any uncollectible amount\u201d from an agency other than a governmental hospital. Rather than stating, as the mdot urges, that the agency\u2019s percentage of fault shall be determined after taking into consideration the percentages fault of settling tortfeasors, subsection (7) says only that the agency\u2019s percentage of fault shall be \"as determined under subsection (1).\u201d Subsection (1) provides for jury and judge findings concerning only the percentages of fault of parties to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Returning to the mdot\u2019s argument based on the last sentence of subsection (5), it is especially noteworthy that subsection (5) \"does not apply\u201d if it is determined, under subsections (1) and (2), that the plaintiff is not at fault. The plaintiffs in the instant underlying action are the parents of minor children who were riding as passengers in the pickup truck. It is unlikely that any percentage of fault would be allocated by a jury or judge to the child passengers. If the jury finds that neither child passenger was at fault, subsection (5) \u2014 stating that \"a person shall not be required to pay damages in an amount greater than his or her percentage of fault\u201d \u2014 \"shall not apply.\u201d In such event, the mdot\u2019s argument based on that sentence would \"not apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The mdot\u2019s argument might indeed \"apply\u201d if the .jury or a judge finds that a percentage of the total fault should be allocated to the plaintiff. Under the circumstance that \u00a7 6304 so clearly states that the sentence in subsection (5) so heavily relied on the mdot \"does not apply\u201d if the trier of fact finds that the plaintiff is not at fault, we do not think that the Legislature contemplated that the trier of fact would, in a case in which it decided that some percentage of fault should be allocated to the plaintiff, then be asked to reconsider the percentages of fault allocated to the plaintiff and the other nonsettling defendant or defendants after taking into consideration the percentages of fault of settling tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">We have considered the other arguments advanced by the mdot, but they do not persuade us to reach a different conclusion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The Court of Appeals concluded its opinion with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">We believe the trial court properly dismissed the mdot\u2019s action for a declaratory judgment. The mdot is not entitled to contribution from Thrasher and the Bergdolls; therefore, there exists no \"actual controversy\u201d sufficient to maintain an action for a declaratory judgment pursuant to MCR 2.605. [196 Mich App 320, 324-325; 493 NW2d 457 (1992).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The circuit judge dismissed this action for a declaratory judgment for the same reason, namely, the mdot is not entitled to contribution from Thrasher and the Bergdolls. The circuit judge and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the Court of Appeals were both right in concluding that there was no actual controversy between the mdot and Thrasher and the Bergdolls, but they were also both wrong in concluding that this action for a declaratory judgment should be dismissed because there was no actual controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">There was and is an actual controversy between the mdot and the Johnstons. Paragraph 9 of the complaint<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> sufficiently states the mdot\u2019s claim that it is entitled to a determination under \u00a7 6304 of Thrasher\u2019s and Bergdolls\u2019 fault in order to apply the provisions of \u00a7 6304 to any judgment that might be rendered against the mdot in favor of the Johnstons.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The relief sought, entry of a declaratory judgment limiting the liability of the mdot for damages to the Johnstons in the Court of Claims action to the \"percentage authorized by MCLA 600.6304,\u201d is the relief that the mdot sought by bringing the declaratory judgment action, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>it has asserted it is entitled to at a trial of the Court of Claims action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The circuit court had jurisdiction under the pleadings framed by the mdot to enter a declaratory judgment deciding the actual controversy between the mdot and the Johnstons. Although there was no \"actual controversy\u201d between the mdot and Thrasher/Bergdolls, there was and is manifestly an \"actual controversy\u201d between the mdot and the Johnstons. The Johnstons have the requisite adverse interest. There is nothing \"hypothetical\u201d about the controversy between the mdot and the Johnstons.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">There is no reason, the matter having been fully briefed and argued in the Court of Appeals, with decision adverse to the mdot in a reported opinion, with briefs on the meritorious question from the Attorney General in behalf of the mdot and from counsel for the Johnstons, and an amicus curiae brief in support of the position of the mdot, with full argument in this Court, to say to the parties that they should go through this drill again before the Court of Appeals or the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">While the Court of Appeals might be seen as having erred in opining with regard to the meaning of \u00a7 6304, after it had decided that the circuit judge correctly dismissed the action because of the absence of an actual controversy, since it is clear that the Court of Appeals also erred in concluding that there was no actual controversy, its error was \"harmless\u201d \u2014 a concept with which this Court is familiar, and applies with great regularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">It is clear that while, as set forth in <em>Hayes, supra, </em>p 74, the determination whether to enter a declaratory judgment \"is ordinarily a matter en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>trusted to the sound discretion of the court,\u201d neither the circuit court nor the Court of Appeals has discretion to decline to enter a declaratory judgment where the need therefor, as in <em>Hayes </em>and here, is apparent. This Court, in <em>Comm\u2019r of Revenue v Grand Trunk W R Co, </em>326 Mich 371, 375; 40 NW2d 188 (1949), said that a circuit judge does not have discretion to refuse to adjudicate a controversy concerning the interpretation of a state tax statute brought in good faith by a state official in the public interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">The declaration of rights statute [1929 PA 36], permits the exercise of judicial discretion in determining the existence of an \"actual controversy.\u201d Such discretion, however, does not extend to refusal to adjudicate a controversy concerning the interpretation of a State tax statute brought in good faith by a State official in the public interest. The declaratory judgment statute is \"remedial, and is to be liberally construed and liberally administered with a view of making the courts more serviceable to the people.\u201d See section 7 thereof. As said in <em>City of Muskegon Heights v Danigelis, </em>253 Mich 260, 265 (73 ALR 696) [235 NW 83 (1931)]: \"If the act is to serve at all, it must be permitted to serve in this instance.\u201d <em>[Comm\u2019r of Revenue, supra.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The mdot similarly sought an interpretation of \u00a7 6304 in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">We join in affirmance of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b176-9\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-5\"> 1986 PA 178.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\"> (1) In a personal injury action involving fault of more than 1 party to the action, including third-party defendants, the court, unless otherwise agreed by all parties to the action, shall instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories or, if there is no jury, shall make findings indicating both of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">(a) The total amount of each plaintiff\u2019s damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">(b) The percentage of the total fault' of all of the parties regarding each claim as to each plaintiff, defendant, and third-party defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">(2) In determining the percentages of fault under subsection (l)(b), the trier of fact shall consider both the nature of the conduct of each party at fault and the extent of the causal relation between the conduct and the damages claimed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">(3) If it is determined under subsections (1) and (2) that a plaintiff is not at fault, subsections (5) and (6) shall not apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">(4) Subsections (5) and (6) shall not apply to a products liability action, as defined in section 2945.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">(5) The court shall determine the award of damages to each plaintiff in accordance with the findings under subsection (1), subject to any reduction under sections 2925d and 6303, and enter judgment against each party, including a third-party defendant, except that judgment shall not be entered against a person who has been released from liability pursuant to section 2925d.
