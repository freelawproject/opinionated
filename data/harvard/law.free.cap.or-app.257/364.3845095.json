He assigns error solely to the trial court\u2019s admission of statements that he contends were unlawfully elicited after he had invoked the right to remain silent. The state remonstrates that defendant\u2019s invocation was equivocal. The state argues, in the alternative, that, even if defendant\u2019s statement constituted an unequivocal invocation of his right to remain silent, the interrogating officer\u2019s interactions with defendant after that invocation were constitutionally permissible. We conclude that defendant unequivocally asserted his right to remain silent and that the interrogating officer\u2019s questions following that assertion violated defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination. Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court erred in admitting defendant\u2019s statements; we further determine that the erroneous admission of defendant\u2019s statements was not harmless, and, thus, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">We explained the applicable standard of review in <em>State v.

Terry, </em>333 Or 163, 172, 37 P3d 157 (2001), <em>cert den, </em>536 US 910 (2002). The question of what transpired during a custodial interrogation is a question of fact for the trial court, and we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by evidence in the record, although \u2018we assess anew whether th[ose] facts suffice to meet constitutional standards.\u2019 <em>James, </em>339 Or at 481.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">(Brackets in <em>Holcomb.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>We state the material facts consistently with those standards. On December 23, 2009, Hillsboro police officers, who were investigating a robbery in which defendant was a suspect, stopped an SUV that defendant was driving. At the scene of the stop, after defendant was handcuffed and taken into police custody, an officer read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in Spanish from a prepared card to defendant, who did not speak English. Defendant indicated that he understood his rights. The police then transported defendant to the Hillsboro Police Department, where detectives G\u00e1nete and Hahn would interview him. G\u00e1nete again advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights in Spanish,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from a prepared card, translated by G\u00e1nete as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">\u201cIt is my [duty] to inform you before you make a declaration: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law or a judicial tribunal. You have the right to speak to an attorney and to [have him or her] present during the interrogation. If you do not have the funds to contract an attorney, the Court will assign one to you without cost.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">After G\u00e1nete had advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights \u2014 defendant\u2019s second <em>Miranda </em>warning that day\u2014 G\u00e1nete inquired whether defendant understood those rights. Defendant replied, \u201cI have a question. Do I have to answer your questions?\u201d G\u00e1nete explained that defendant \u201cdid not have to answer any questions or talk to [G\u00e1nete] if he chose [not] to.\u201d Defendant then asked, \u201cWhy did mister call the police?\u201d G\u00e1nete insisted that defendant needed first to understand the <em>Miranda </em>warnings before they could discuss the events that led to defendant being in police custody. At that point, \u201cto help [defendant] understand,\u201d G\u00e1nete \u201ctook each right line by line and asked if he understood each right.\u201d During that process, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">G\u00e1nete: \u201cAnything you say may be used against you in a court of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">Defendant: \u201cI don\u2019t understand what this means.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">G\u00e1nete: \u201cWhat is it that you don\u2019t understand?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Defendant: \u201cAnything I say can be used against me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">G\u00e1nete: \u201cThat\u2019s correct. Anything you say can be used against you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">Defendant: \u201c/ <em>won\u2019t answer any questions.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">G\u00e1nete \u201cdidn\u2019t accept [the italicized statement] as unequivocally [defendant] saying, T don\u2019t want to talk to you.\u2019\u201d Instead, G\u00e1nete interpreted defendant\u2019s statement \u201cas a question that he was pondering to me from lack of understanding.\u201d G\u00e1nete asked defendant, <em>\u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t want to talk to me at all? You just want me to go away?\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Defendant responded, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t talk to you if I don\u2019t understand what this right means because you\u2019re telling me I have the right to remain silent. I don\u2019t understand what this means.\u201d As G\u00e1nete began to repeat, \u201cAnything you say can be used against you,\u201d defendant interrupted, \u201cPardon. I\u2019m not trying to be disrespectful. How can I say this? Anything I say can be used against me. It\u2019s like I\u2019m lying?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">At that point, G\u00e1nete felt that defendant was \u201ckind of hung up on this right,\u201d so G\u00e1nete decided to move on to the remaining warnings pertaining to defendant\u2019s right to counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant indicated that he understood his right to counsel. G\u00e1nete then asked if defendant understood his rights, with the exception of \u201canything you say can be used against you.\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Because he thought that defendant might understand the statement if he read it himself, G\u00e1nete inquired about defendant\u2019s education. Defendant responded that he had gone to school through sixth grade and that he could read Spanish. G\u00e1nete then gave defendant the <em>Miranda </em>warning card and asked him to read it aloud, which defendant did. The following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">Defendant: \u201cTt is my duty to inform you before you make a declaration: You have the right to remain silent.\u2019 [pause] You can just ask questions then?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>G\u00e1nete: \u201cIf you tell me that you wish to remain silent, I can\u2019t question you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">Defendant: \u201cNow I understand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">(Brackets in original.) G\u00e1nete further explained, to defendant that there is a significant difference between wanting to speak with him and agreeing to speak with him. G\u00e1nete also told defendant that he \u201cmay choose to answer or not answer specific questions, and that was fine.\u201d This exchange followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">G\u00e1nete: \u201cDo you understand your rights?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">Defendant: \u2018Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">G\u00e1nete: \u201cDo you understand the <em>Miranda </em>warning card you read?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">Defendant: \u2018Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">G\u00e1nete: \u201cDo you want to speak with me freely?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-11\">Defendant: \u2018Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">G\u00e1nete then questioned defendant about the reported robbery, and defendant made the statements that are the subject of this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">In a pretrial motion, the state requested a hearing on the admissibility of statements made by defendant. ORS 135.037. At that hearing, defendant argued that the statements that he made after his statement, \u201cI won\u2019t answer any questions,\u201d were obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>and, thus, must be suppressed. Specifically, defendant contended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-14\">\u201c[T]he conversation never should have continued after [defendant] said, \u2018I won\u2019t answer any questions.\u2019 That was him exercising his right to remain silent. And, for that reason, despite the fact that upon further prodding, [defendant did] agree to speak with the detective, I\u2019d ask that his statements not be admitted for <em>Miranda </em>violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">The state, for its part, contended that defendant had not unequivocally invoked his right to remain silent. Rather, in the state\u2019s view, defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cI won\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>answer any questions,\u201d was, \u201cas the detective indicated, not an assertion of a right in the context of the conversation that was taking place, but rather a statement by defendant of questioning what those rights were.\u201d The state argued that, because that statement was \u201cequivocal,\u201d G\u00e1nete was permitted to ask questions to clarify defendant\u2019s intent\u2014 and that, ultimately, defendant understood and voluntarily waived his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The trial court agreed with the state\u2019s position that defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cI won\u2019t answer any questions [,] * * * was posed as a quandary,\u201d and \u201cdefendant didn\u2019t quite understand what was going on at the time.\u201d The court observed that it did not believe that G\u00e1nete \u201cwas trying to manipulate defendant in the situation\u201d and noted that G\u00e1nete \u201cspent a lot of time with defendant making sure he understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d The court continued, \u201cThe question is then did defendant waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights or was this comment, T won\u2019t answer any questions,\u2019 an unequivocal exercise of his <em>Miranda </em>rights? And that\u2019s where I say I think in the totality of the facts that it\u2019s not an unequivocal exercise of rights.\u201d Accordingly, the court determined that Ganete\u2019s ensuing questions \u2014 including, \u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t want to talk to me at all?\u201d and \u2018You just want me to go away?\u201d \u2014 did not violate defendant\u2019s rights and allowed defendant\u2019s subsequent statements to be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Defendant testified at trial and the state impeached him by pointing to material inconsistencies between defendant\u2019s trial testimony and his statements during interrogation. Specifically, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s questions during cross-examination, highlighting those inconsistencies, defendant admitted that he had \u201clied\u201d to G\u00e1nete during the interrogation. The prosecution\u2019s case was predicated on the testimony of the robbery complainants, who recounted defendant\u2019s purported criminal conduct. Thus, an assessment of defendant\u2019s credibility was essential to the jury\u2019s consideration \u2014 indeed, in closing, the prosecutor told the jury that, \u201cif you believe the victims in this case, the defendant is guilty * * *. If you believe the defendant, then he is not guilty.\u201d The jury found defendant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Defendant appeals his convictions, challenging the admission of the statements that he made in response to interrogation. Defendant contends, as he did before the trial court, that he had unequivocally invoked his right to remain silent when he said that he would not answer any questions, and, thus, his subsequent statements should have been suppressed. Defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s \u201cfinding\u201d that his statement \u201cI won\u2019t answer any questions\u201d was not an unequivocal invocation of his right to remain silent was not supported by the evidence, and that \u201cpolice cannot avoid the <em>Miranda </em>requirements by choosing whether to accept a defendant\u2019s statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The state responds that defendant did not unequivocally invoke his right to remain silent; rather, \u201cdefendant was attempting to understand his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d In any event, the state argues, even if defendant had unequivocally invoked his right to remain silent, \u201cG\u00e1nete was entitled to continue to explain defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d Put differently, and in perhaps a more nuanced way, the state contends that the \u201cclarification about whether defendant understood his rights\u201d was not \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d and, therefore, Ganete\u2019s continued questioning of defendant did not violate his right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In <em>State v. </em>Harding, 221 Or App 294, 300-01, 189 P3d 1259, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 503 (2008), we outlined the applicable inquiry for assessing whether an accused\u2019s right against self-incrimination was violated during custodial interrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cUnder Article I, section 12, police must stop interrogation when a suspect in police custody unequivocally invokes the right to remain silent. <em>State v. Meade, </em>327 Or 335, 339, 963 P2d 656 (1998). However, police may reinitiate contact with a defendant who has invoked that right, give new <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and obtain a valid waiver of the right after a reasonable period of time has elapsed. <em>State v. Holcomb, </em>213 Or App 168, 174, 159 P3d 1271, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 224 (2007) (citing <em>State v. Rowe, </em>79 Or App 801, 805-06, 720 P2d 765, <em>rev den, </em>302 Or 86 (1986)). When a suspect makes an equivocal invocation of the right to silence, police are required to ask follow-up questions to clarify what the suspect meant before proceeding with interrogation. <em>[State </em>v.] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>Charboneau, </em>323 Or [38,] 54, [913 P2d 308 (1996)]. In determining whether a defendant\u2019s statement is an unequivocal or equivocal invocation, or neither, we view the statement in light of the totality of the circumstances at and preceding the time that it was made, \u2018to ascertain whether a reasonable officer in the circumstances would have understood that defendant was invoking his rights.\u2019 <em>Holcomb, </em>213 Or App at 176.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Applying those principles, and with the parties\u2019 arguments so joined, we first must determine whether a reasonable officer in the circumstances would have understood defendant\u2019s statement \u2014 \u201cI won\u2019t answer any questions\u201d \u2014 to be an unequivocal invocation of defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. As explained, if defendant\u2019s statement was equivocal, then the officer was permitted \u2014 indeed, required if the interrogation was to continue \u2014 to ask follow-up questions to clarify defendant\u2019s intent. If, however, defendant unequivocally invoked, the scope of the officer\u2019s subsequent statements to defendant is much narrower. The state\u2019s secondary, alternative argument requires us to examine the contours of that proscription.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">We first conclude that defendant\u2019s statement \u2014 \u201cI won\u2019t answer any questions\u201d \u2014 was an unequivocal invocation of his right to remain silent. The words that defendant used were unambiguous; that is, they were susceptible to only one reasonable understanding \u2014 an unqualified declaration that defendant would not answer any questions. Ganete\u2019s contrary understanding \u2014 that defendant\u2019s words, immediately after G\u00e1nete reiterated that \u201c[a]nything you say can be used against you,\u201d were a \u201cquestion\u201d inviting further inquiry \u2014 was not reasonable. <em>See State v. Dahlen, </em>209 Or App 110, 118, 146 P3d 359, <em>modified on recons, </em>210 Or App 362, 149 P3d 1234 (2006) (\u201cA reasonable officer would interpret [the] defendant\u2019s words consistently with their ordinary meanings and would not understand the defendant to say something he did not actually say.\u201d); <em>see also State v. Kell, </em>303 Or 89, 99, 734 P2d 334 (1987) (citing <em>Connecticut v. Barrett, </em>479 US 523, 529, 107 S Ct 828, 93 L Ed 2d 920 (1987) (\u201cInterpretation is only required where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the defendant\u2019s words, understood as ordinary people would understand them, are ambiguous.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Further, we agree with defendant that \u201cpolice cannot avoid the <em>Miranda </em>requirements by choosing whether to accept a defendant\u2019s statement.\u201d Here, the trial court improperly relied on Ganete\u2019s unreasonable decision not to accept defendant\u2019s unambiguous statement as an unequivocal invocation of his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Nor can any of the interaction between G\u00e1nete and defendant serve to render defendant\u2019s unequivocal invocation retroactively equivocal. Again, the determination of whether a statement is \u201can unequivocal or equivocal invocation\u201d is based exclusively on \u201cthe totality of the circumstances <em>at and preceding the time that it was made.\u201d Harding, </em>221 Or App at 301 (emphasis added); <em>accord Smith v. Illinois, </em>469 US 91, 98-99, 105 S Ct 490, 83 L Ed 2d 488 (1984) (explaining that \u201c[u]sing an accused\u2019s subsequent responses to cast doubt on the adequacy of the initial request <em>itself </em>is *** intolerable,\u201d because \u201c[n]o authority, and no logic, permits the interrogator to proceed * * * on his own terms and as if the defendant had requested nothing, in the hope that the defendant might be induced to say something casting retrospective doubt on his initial statement that he wished to speak through an attorney or not at all\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original)). Here, nothing that preceded defendant\u2019s invocation \u201ccasts any doubt\u201d on the meaning and effect of defendant\u2019s declaration. Accordingly, the trial court erred in characterizing defendant\u2019s declaration as, at best, an equivocal invocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">As we explained earlier, our analysis does not end with the conclusion that defendant unequivocally invoked his right to remain silent. The state contends that, even in the face of such an invocation, an officer is permitted to complete the <em>Miranda </em>warning and to ask questions aimed at determining whether defendant understands his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">It may well be that, even after an unequivocal invocation, an officer may continue to advise an accused of the remaining <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Nevertheless, we need not resolve that question here because, in all events, G\u00e1nete did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>not limit himself to merely completing the reiterated advice of <em>Miranda </em>rights. Rather \u2014 and without <em>any </em>intervening voluntary reinitiation on defendant\u2019s part \u2014 G\u00e1nete asked defendant questions pertaining to his invocation. Specifically, Ganete\u2019s questions \u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t want to talk to me at all?\u201d and \u2018You just want me to go away?\u201d were the sorts of \u201cclarifying\u201d questions permissible only with respect to an <em>equivocal </em>invocation. <em>See, e.g., Charboneau, </em>323 Or at 54. Such \u201cfollow up\u201d is expressly precluded with respect to unequivocal invocations. <em>State v. Isom, </em>306 Or 587, 593, 761 P2d 524 (1988) (explaining that Article I, section 12, requires that, upon an unequivocal invocation, \u201cquestioning not only \u2018should\u2019 but must cease\u201d). The continuation of the interaction, which flowed from Ganete\u2019s constitutionally precluded questioning, culminated in defendant\u2019s agreement to answer Ganete\u2019s questions regarding his possible criminal involvement. That is, defendant\u2019s ultimately inculpatory statements were the product of the constitutional violation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Finally, we must assess whether that error was harmless. Or Const, Art VII (Amended), \u00a7 3 (\u201cIf the supreme court shall be of opinion, after consideration of all the matters thus submitted, that the judgment of the court appealed from was such as should have been rendered in the case, such judgment shall be affirmed, notwithstanding any error committed during the trial[.]\u201d); <em>see Holcomb, </em>213 Or App at 182-83 (analyzing whether erroneous admission of the defendant\u2019s statements required reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions, even in the absence of any party arguments regarding harmlessness). In assessing harmlessness, the pertinent inquiry is \u201cwhether there was little likelihood that the error affected the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). As noted, 257 Or App at 369, admission of the challenged statements provided the state an opportunity to impeach defendant in a case in which defendant\u2019s credibility was vital to his defense. Thus \u2014 and the state does not contend otherwise \u2014 the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>those statements was not harmless. <em>See, e.g., State v. Irons, </em>162 Or App 512, 524, 987 P2d 547 (1999) (holding that erroneous admission of evidence tending to affect \u201cthe jury\u2019s all-important assessment of credibility\u201d was not harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\"> Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in pertinent part, \u201cNo person shall * * * be compelled in any criminal prosecution to testify against himself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-10\"> Ganete\u2019s exchange with defendant occurred entirely in Spanish.
