Employer argues that the board erred in concluding that its September 2008 denial of claimant\u2019s combined condition was \u201cprocedurally invalid because it denied a combined condition in the absence of an acceptance of such a condition.\u201d <em>See Croman Corp. v. Serrano, </em>163 Or App 136, 140-41, 986 P2d 1253 (1999) (under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) and ORS 656.262(6)(c), a combined condition \u201cmust have been accepted before it may be denied\u201d). More specifically, employer asserts that its September 2008 denial letter functioned as <em>both </em>an acceptance and a denial, <em>see Stockdale v. SAIF, </em>192 Or App 289, 291, 294-95, 84 P3d 1120 (2004) (stating that \u201can employer or insurer may issue a single letter to notify a claimant that it is both accepting and denying compensation for a combined condition\u201d), and argues that the board erred in requiring that the letter include so-called \u201cmagic words\u201d such as \u201caccept a combined condition.\u201d On review for substantial evidence and errors of law, ORS 656.298(7); ORS 183.482(8), we conclude that the board correctly determined that employer failed to accept claimant\u2019s combined condition before denying it and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The relevant facts are as follows. On August 29, 2007, while working as a bus driver for employer, claimant suffered injuries to her lower back and left hip when her \u201cseat lost air out of it and went to the floor\u201d and the replacement bus provided by employer was ill-suited to her short stature, causing further injury by forcing her to stretch unnaturally to reach the pedals and controls. She subsequently sought and received medical treatment and underwent an independent medical examination (IME) performed by Dr. Carr. On January 29, 2008, after reviewing Carr\u2019s IME report, employer accepted claimant\u2019s injury claims for \u201clumbar/sacroiliac strains and left trochanteric bursitis.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>However, claimant had \u201ca significant history of preexisting low back and hip problems [,]\u201d having been treated just nine days prior to the work-related accident for \u201clow back and hip pain extending into her leg[.]\u201d She had not fully disclosed that information to Carr and, thus, employer accepted claimant\u2019s above-mentioned injury claims with limited knowledge regarding the extent of her history of similar symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Upon learning more about claimant\u2019s preexisting conditions after obtaining additional medical information and facilitating another IME, employer sent claimant a letter dated September 24, 2008. That letter stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">\u201cDear [claimant]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\u201cYour injury of August 29, 2007 has been accepted as a disabling lumbar/sacroiliac strains [sic] and left trochanteric bursitis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">\u201cMedical evidence indicates that you had pre-existing conditions relating-to these body parts and that your injury of August 29, 2007 combined with these pre-existing conditions to require treatment and cause disability. The medical evidence also establishes that the original accepted injury has resolved and is no longer the major contributing cause of any claimed need for treatment or disability. The report issued by Dr. John Swanson as the result of the independent medical examination of September 3, 2008 supports this statement and your attending physician Lori Gross, MD has concurred with the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">\u201cWe are therefore denying the compensability of your current conditions involving the left hip and low back as not being compensably related to your accepted injury and not arising out of and in the course of employment with [employer].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Claimant requested a hearing, which was conducted on July 31, 2009, before an administrative law judge (ALJ). At the conclusion of that hearing, the ALJ set aside employer\u2019s denial of claimant\u2019s combined condition, reasoning that employer\u2019s denial included neither \u201ca statement that it accepted a combined condition\u201d nor any language sufficient \u201cto establish a combined condition acceptance.\u201d The ALJ therefore determined that \u201cemployer did not accept a combined condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>prior to denying the combined condition. Consequently, the denial is invalid and will be set aside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Employer requested review by the board, which, on September 21, 2011, issued a final order affirming the ALJ \u2014 -likewise concluding that \u201cemployer\u2019s denial [was] procedurally invalid because [employer] had not first issued a written acceptance of a combined condition.\u201d The board acknowledged employer\u2019s argument that \u201cits [September 2008] \u2018denial\u2019 letter also contained an implied acceptance of a combined condition.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) However, the board reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">\u201cWith respect to a combined condition, the letter does not contain the term \u2018accept\u2019 or other like-terms that would establish such a combined condition acceptance. Rather, [employer\u2019s September 2008] letter indicates the acceptance of an initial injury, the <em>existence </em>of a \u2018combined condition,\u2019 and the <em>denial </em>of a combined condition. Acknowledging the existence of a \u2018combined condition,\u2019 however, is not equivalent to <em>accepting </em>such a condition [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">(Emphases in original.) Employer sought judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">On review, employer reprises its argument that its September 2008 denial letter to claimant functioned as <em>both </em>an acceptance and denial of the combined condition claim. As noted, employer primarily asserts that the board improperly required that it \u201cembellish its [purported] acceptance with specific words, such as \u2018accept a combined condition.\u2019\u201d In advancing that argument, employer relies on <em>Columbia Forest Products v. Woolner, </em>177 Or App 639, 645-47, 34 P3d 1203 (2001), in which we stated that \u201cspecific words\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>so-called \u201cmagic words\u201d) are not necessary \u201cto signify the acceptance of a combined condition\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is no statute that prescribes a particular manner for acceptance of a combined condition.\u201d Claimant responds by noting that, although \u201cspecific words\u201d are not required, \u201cthe law requires that an injured worker be notified in some manner of an acceptance!.]\u201d Echoing the board\u2019s reasoning, she contends that employer\u2019s September 2008 denial letter merely acknowledged employer\u2019s prior acceptance of claimant\u2019s initial injury claims, acknowledged the existence of a combined condition that arose at some unspecified time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>and then denied compensability of that vaguely defined combined condition \u2014 ultimately failing to \u201cprovide notice of any acceptance\u201d of the combined condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">We first clarify the applicable standard of review. Employer raises two assignments of error; however, they are effectively identical aside from the standards of review invoked. In employer\u2019s first assignment of error, it challenges the board\u2019s conclusion as a matter of law on the basis of the board\u2019s purported requirement that employer use \u201cspecific\u201d or \u201cmagic\u201d words. In employer\u2019s second assignment of error, it contends that the board\u2019s order is not supported by substantial evidence. We address those assignments of error together, because, as claimant correctly points out, \u201calthough couched as an assignment alleging an error of law, [employer\u2019s first assignment of error] boils down to the assertion that the evidence <em>[(i.e., </em>the denial letter)] should have led the Board <em>to find as fact </em>that [employer] had accepted claimant\u2019s combined condition.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See Woolner, </em>177 Or App at 646 (\u201cThe scope of an employer\u2019s acceptance has <em>always </em>been an issue of fact.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.)); <em>SAIF v. Tull, </em>113 Or App 449, 454, 832 P2d 1271 (1992) (\u201c[Wjhether an acceptance occurs is an issue of fact.\u201d); <em>Garcia v. Boise Cascade Corp., </em>309 Or 292, 295, 787 P2d 884 (1990) (noting that we review the board\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence and that \u201csubstantial evidence supports a finding when the record, viewed as a whole, permits a reasonable person to make the finding\u201d). Accordingly, the question before us is simply whether the board\u2019s order \u2014 namely, its evaluation of the scope (and thus the legal effect) of the September 2008 denial letter \u2014 is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Applying that standard, we agree with claimant and conclude that substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s finding that employer\u2019s September 2008 denial letter did not constitute an acceptance of claimant\u2019s combined condition and that employer did not otherwise accept claimant\u2019s combined condition before denying it. Consequently, we conclude that the board correctly determined that the September 2008 denial was \u201cprocedurally invalid because [employer] had not first issued a written acceptance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>of a combined condition\u201d as required by ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) and ORS 656.262(6)(c). <em>Croman Corp., </em>163 Or App at 140-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">As noted, in advancing its argument, employer relies heavily on <em>Woolner, </em>and, indeed, in that case we unambiguously stated that \u201ca notice of acceptance that fails to employ the <em>specific words </em>\u2018combined condition\u2019 is not \u2014 for that reason alone \u2014 insufficient as a matter of law to constitute an acceptance of a combined condition * * * \u201d 177 Or App at 647 (emphasis added). At issue in <em>Woolner </em>was the scope of the employer\u2019s acceptance \u2014 that is, whether that acceptance included acceptance of a combined condition rather than injury claims alone. <em>Id. </em>at 643-45. We stated that \u201cevidence need not consist of\u2018magic words [,]\u2019\u201d ultimately holding that the claimant was incorrect in contending that the employer had failed to accept a combined condition merely because it did not \u201cembellish its acceptance with specific words\u201d\u2014 namely, the words \u201ccombined condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Employer\u2019s reliance on <em>Woolner </em>as a basis for reversal is inapposite here. Employer\u2019s September 2008 denial letter\u2019s deficiency is not limited to its failure to use \u201cmagic words\u201d to convey its purported acceptance of claimant\u2019s combined condition, and, in any event, the board acknowledged Woolner\u2019s holding and did not rest its finding as to the letter\u2019s scope solely on employer\u2019s failure to use \u201cspecific\u201d language. Rather, the board correctly reasoned that \u201c[acknowledging the existence of a \u2018combined condition[]\u2019 *** is not equivalent to <em>accepting </em>such a condition[.]\u201d (Emphasis in original.) That is, the board reasoned that the letter must have \u201cboth acknowledged and accepted\u201d claimant\u2019s combined condition using language that, at minimum, \u201cinformed claimant that [employer] had <em>accepted the combined condition\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) As claimant correctly notes in addressing employer\u2019s contention that the board ran afoul of the principles set forth in <em>Woolner, </em>the board \u201cdid not require that [employer] accept a combined condition in any particular manner. Instead, the Board looked at the language that purportedly accepted the combined condition *** and held that this evidence did not establish the acceptance of a combined condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Specifically, although it acknowledged the existence of a combined condition, the letter did not (1) specify the particular combined condition purportedly being accepted, nor the preexisting conditions being relied upon as the basis for employer\u2019s identification of an unspecified combined condition; (2) demarcate the date on which claimant\u2019s work injury combined with those unspecified preexisting conditions; or (3) specify when the combined condition became compensable. <em>See </em>ORS 656.262(6)(b)(A) (notice of acceptance must \u201c[s]pecify what conditions are compensable\u201d). Nor did the letter state that it was modifying the earlier notice of acceptance under ORS 656.262(6)(b)(F) (notice of acceptance \u201cshall *** [b]e modified *** from time to time as medical or other information changes a previously issued notice of acceptance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Rather, employer\u2019s letter merely gave rise to an inference that claimant\u2019s unspecified (both substantively and temporally) combined condition must have been accepted because it was ultimately denied. Such an inference is not enough to transform an otherwise vague denial of a combined condition into the predicate acceptance of that condition required by law. <em>See </em>ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B); ORS 656.262(6)(c); <em>Croman Corp., </em>163 Or App at 140-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In sum, in addition to lacking any language (\u201cspecific\u201d or otherwise) indicating acceptance of a combined condition, the letter as a whole did not contain any indication that employer was accepting a combined condition \u2014 failing to state even the nature of the combined condition or when it arose. The board\u2019s finding to that effect is supported by substantial evidence, and, based on that finding, the board correctly concluded that employer\u2019s denial was procedurally invalid. Accordingly, we affirm the board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-6\"> That acceptance rescinded an initial denial issued on October 26, 2007, in which employer \u2014 prior to the IME \u2014 stated that \u201cinsufficient evidence exist [ed] to justify that [claimant\u2019s] lower back condition [was] the result of a work related injury o[r] disease.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
