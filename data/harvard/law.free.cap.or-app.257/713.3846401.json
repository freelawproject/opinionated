Under the Public Employees Collective Bargaining Act (PECBA), public employees have the right to bargain collectively \u201cwith their public employer on matters concerning employment relations.\u201d ORS 243.662. The definition of \u201cemployment relations\u201din ORS 243.650(7) circumscribes the matters that are \u201cmandatory\u201d for bargaining; matters that are excluded from the definition of employment relations are permissive subjects of bargaining. <em>Portland Fire Fighters\u2019 Assoc. v. City of Portland, </em>245 Or App 255, 264, 263 P3d 1040 (2011) (citing <em>Salem Police Employees Union v. City of Salem, </em>308 Or 383, 390-91, 781 P2d 335 (1989)). <em>See also Assn. of Oregon Corrections Emp. v. State of Oregon, </em>353 Or 170, 176, 295 P3d 38, (2013) (\u201c[A] public employer commits an unfair labor practice under ORS 243.672(1)(e) if it refuses to bargain with respect to matters that are included within, and not excluded by, the definition of\u2018employment relations.\u2019 Those matters are referred to as \u2018mandatory\u2019 subjects of bargaining.\u201d). It is an unfair labor practice for a public employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>or its designated representative, and, likewise, for a public employee or a labor organization or its designated representative, to \u201c [r] efuse to bargain collectively in good faith\u201d over mandatory subjects of bargaining. ORS 243.672(1)(e) (public employer); ORS 243.672(2)(b) (public employee/labor organization).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\">In 2007, the legislature amended the definition of employment relations in ORS 243.650(7) to provide that, for strike-prohibited employees, such as the corrections employees in this case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">\u2018\u201cemployment relations\u2019 includes <em>safety issues that have an impact on the on-the-job safety of the employees </em>or staffing levels that have a significant impact on the on-the-job safety of the employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Or Laws 2007, ch 141, \u00a7 la; ORS 243.650(7)(f) (emphasis added). Under the previous version of the statute, only \u201csafety issues\u201d that had \u201ca <em>direct and substantial effect on the on-the-job safety of public </em>employees\u201d were included in the definition of \u201cemployment relations.\u201d See ORS 243.650(7)(f) (2005) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Applying the amended statute for the first time, the board here concluded that the association\u2019s training proposal did not involve a \u201csafety issue\u201d because it did not, \u201cdirectly and unambiguously address [ ] a matter related to strike-prohibited employees\u2019 workplace safety.\u201d The correctness of that conclusion is the central issue on judicial review. Based on our review of the text, context, and legislative history of the 2007 amendments to ORS 243.650(7), we agree with the board\u2019s conclusion that it must be apparent from the face of a proposal itself \u2014 that is, \u201cdirectly\u201d and without reference to extrinsic evidence \u2014 that the proposal involves a \u201csafety issue.\u201d However, the board\u2019s introduction of a requirement of \u201cunambiguousness\u201d to the statute is not supported by its text, context, or history and, indeed, is contradicted by the expressed intention of the legislature. Thus, as we explain below, we conclude that the subject of a proposal is a \u201csafety issue\u201d for purposes of ORS 243.650(7)(f) if it would reasonably be understood, on its face, to directly address a matter related to the on-the-job safety of strike-prohibited employees. We further conclude that the proposal at issue here does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>not meet that standard; therefore, we affirm the decision of the board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">These facts are undisputed. The association, which is the exclusive representative for a bargaining unit of county corrections employees, and the county were parties to a collective bargaining agreement effective July 1, 2004, through June 30,2010. In August 2008, the parties amended and extended that agreement; the amended agreement was effective August 14, 2008, and continues through June 30, 2014. In accordance with an addendum that allowed the parties to \u201creopen\u201d certain articles of the 2008-2014 agreement\u2014 including two each of the parties\u2019 choosing \u2014 the parties began \u201climited reopener\u201d bargaining on March 26,2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The association identified Article 17, \u201cCorrections Service and Training Achievement Program\u201d as one of the articles that it wanted to modify, and it submitted a formal proposal, which, among other things, sought to add the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">\u201c5. Training. The Sheriff will establish training requirements for Corrections Deputies and Corrections Sergeants. <em>Beginning in the second year of this agreement, all sworn employees shall receive a minimum of forty (40) hours of approved training per year, of which at least twenty (20) hours shall be DPSST-approved training. </em>The employee shall participate in training, including firearms training, at times set by the Sheriff or his designees. Employees participating in any required training during off-duty hours shall be compensated at the overtime rate for time spent in training, or may be permitted to flex hours with the approval of their supervisor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">(Emphasis added; boldface and underscoring omitted.) The county declared that the proposal for a guaranteed 40 hours of training each year (set out in italics above) was a permissive subject of bargaining and refused to bargain over it. The association nonetheless included that proposal in its final offer submitted to the state conciliator under ORS 243.712(2)(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Each party filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the board. The association contended that the county had violated its duty to bargain in good faith under ORS 243.672(1)(e) by refusing to negotiate about the proposal. The county contended that it had no duty to bargain over the proposal, because it was \u201cpermissive\u201d rather than \u201cmandatory,\u201d and, consequently, the association had violated its good-faith bargaining obligation under ORS 243.672(2)(b) by including the proposal in its final offer to the state conciliator. <em>See Amalgamated Transit Union, Division 57 v. Rogue Valley Transportation District, </em>16 PECBR 559, 588, <em>order on recons, </em>16 PEBCR 707 (1996) (a party violates duty to bargain in good faith by including a permissive subject in its final offer over the objections of the other party). The board ruled in favor of the county on both complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\">The board first considered the meaning of \u201csafety issues\u201d as used in ORS 243.650(7)(f), which, again, provides, as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\">\u201cFor employee bargaininginvolving employees covered by ORS 243.736,[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] \u2018employment relations\u2019 includes <em>safety issues that have an impact on the on-the-job safety of the employees[.]\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">(Emphasis added.) After considering the text and context, the legislative history offered by the association, and the rationale of the board\u2019s prior cases interpreting the pre2007 version of the statute, the board concluded that \u201cthe subject of a proposal is a \u2018safety issue\u2019 if the proposal <em>directly and unambiguously addresses a matter related to </em>strike-prohibited employees\u2019 workplace safety.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Applying that test, the board determined that, in this case, because the connection between training and safety was not apparent from the proposal\u2019s text, but only after considering extrinsic evidence of the \u201cintent\u201d of the proposal, the subject of the proposal was not a \u201csafety issue.\u201d Having so concluded, the board did not reach the question whether the proposal fulfilled what it considered the second criterion for determining whether a subject is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>mandatory under ORS <em>243.650(7)(f) </em>\u2014 \u201ci.e., whether it impacts strike-prohibited employees\u2019 on-the-job safety.\u201d The board also determined that the subject of the proposal was, instead, \u201cassignment of duties,\u201d which is excluded from the definition of \u201cemployment relations\u201d under ORS 243.650(7)(g).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, the board concluded, the county did not violate its good-faith bargaining obligation in refusing to bargain over the proposal and the association violated its obligation by including it in its final offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">The chair of the board, Gamson, dissented. Gamson contended, among other things, that the majority misinterpreted the association\u2019s proposal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In Gamson\u2019s view, the proposal\u2019s reference to <em>\u201cDPSST-approved </em>training\u201d is a term of art in the law enforcement industry, the meaning of which, under <em>Yogman v. Parrott, </em>325 Or 358, 362-63, 937 P2d 1019 (1997), is properly determined by looking to outside sources\u2014 in this case, evidence in the record \u2014 to determine what the proposal means on its face. That evidence, Gamson asserted, establishes that DPSST training for corrections officers \u201cso obviously involve [s] officer safety that no argument is necessary to establish the point.\u201d According to Gamson, with that understanding of the term \u201cDPSST-approved training,\u201d and considering the disputed provision in the context of the association\u2019s proposal as a whole, including its reference to firearms training, the proposal does, in fact, on its face concern safety, and the majority erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">On review, the association\u2019s first, and primary, contention is that the board erred in interpreting \u201csafety issue,\u201d as used in ORS 243.650(7)(f), \u201cto include only proposals [that] \u2018directly and unambiguously\u2019 address matters related to workplace safety.\u201d The association argues that the ordinary meaning of the terms \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cissue\u201d \u2014 as well as the statute\u2019s reference to \u201cissue\u201d rather than \u201csubject,\u201d which appears elsewhere in ORS 243.650(7) \u2014 evidence the legislature\u2019s intention that \u201csafety issues\u201d be understood to sweep more broadly than is allowed under the \u201csubject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>inquiry\u201d that the board used. Further, according to the association, the board\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with its prior cases, which the association contends stand for the proposition that a proposal is a safety issue simply if it \u201cconcerns\u201d safety. And, in the association\u2019s view, the legislative history \u201cclear[ly]\u201d and \u201cunequivocal[ly]\u201d supports its reading of the statute that training is a \u201csafety issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\">The county responds that the board\u2019s interpretation is correct, given the ordinary meaning of the word \u201csafety,\u201d the board\u2019s prior interpretation of the phrase \u201csafety issues\u201d as used in the pre-2007 version of the statute (which there is no indication the legislature intended to change in 2007), the legislative history of the 2007 amendments, and what it asserts is this court\u2019s deference, in the absence of contrary legislative intent, to the board\u2019s \u201cexpertise in regard to its rulings relating to policy-based formulation of rules.\u201d We agree with the county, but only to a point.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The association contends, in part, that the ordinary meaning of the words \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cissue\u201d lead to the conclusion that a \u201csafety issue\u201d is a \u201cmatter in dispute between two parties that relates to freedom from exposure to danger,\u201d a broader standard than that articulated by the board. That position, however, is not borne out by the relevant statutory context.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Vsetecka v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>337 Or 502, 508, 98 P3d 1116 (2004) (\u201cOrdinarily, * * * text should not be read in isolation but must be considered in context.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)). Context includes other provisions of the same and related statutes, <em>see Hale v. Klemp, </em>220 Or App 27, 32, 184 P3d 1185 (2008) (\u201cWhen we examine the text of the statute, we always do so in context, which includes, among other things, other provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>statute of which the disputed provision is a part.\u201d), as well as prior versions of the statute, <em>see Krieger v. Just, </em>319 Or 328, 336, 876 P2d 754 (1994) (\u201c[Wlording changes adopted from session to session are a part of context of the present version of the statute being construed.\u201d). <em>See also Montgomery v. City of Dunes City, </em>236 Or App 194, 199, 236 P3d 750 (2010) (\u201cChanges in the text of a statute over time are context for interpreting the version at issue in a given case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">The history of the statute is particularly informative in this case. Before 1995, the definition of \u201cemployment relations\u201d did not specifically address safety issues; rather, the board decided whether a safety-related bargaining proposal was an \u201cother condition of employment\u201d \u2014 and, therefore, \u201cemployment relations\u201d subject to mandatory bargaining under what is now ORS 243.650(7)(a)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 by weighing the effect of the bargaining proposal on management prerogatives against the effect of the proposal on employment conditions of the affected employees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the board here explained it, citing, among other cases, <em>Salem Police Employees Union v. City of Salem, </em>8 PEBCR 6642, 6647 (1984), \u201c[i]f the proposal or policy had a greater effect on workers\u2019 safety than on management prerogatives, we concluded [that] the subject was safety\u201d and, therefore, a \u201ccondition of employment\u201d subject to mandatory bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Then, in 1995, the legislature passed Senate Bill (SB) 750, which, among other changes, added several new paragraphs to ORS 243.650(7), further defining \u201cemployment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>relations.\u201d As particularly relevant here, SB 750 added paragraph (f), which provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-3\">\u201c(f) For all other employee bargaining except school districts, \u2018employment relations\u2019 expressly excludes staffing levels and safety issues (except those staffing levels and safety issues which have a direct and substantial effect on the on-the-job safety of public employees)!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Or Laws 1995, ch 286, \u00a7 1. Consequently, after the enactment of SB 750, except with respect to school-district bargaining, only safety issues that had \u201ca direct and substantial effect on the on the job safety of public employees\u201d were included in the definition of \u201cemployment relations\u201d (and therefore subject to mandatory bargaining); otherwise, they were expressly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">In 2007, the legislature revisited subsection (7)(f). Specifically, and as relevant here, Senate Bill (SB) 400 amended ORS 243.650(7) as follows (additions are indicated in bold; deletions are bracketed in italics):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">\u201c(f) For employee bargaining involving employees covered by ORS 243.736, \u2018employment relations\u2019 includes safety issues that have an impact on the on-the-job safety of the employees or staffing levels that have a significant impact on the on-the-job safety of the employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\"><em>\u201c[(f)] </em>(g) For all other employee bargaining except school <em>[districts] </em>district bargaining and except as provided in paragraph (f) of this subsection, \u2018employment relations\u2019 excludes staffing levels and safety issues (except those staffing levels and safety issues <em>[which] </em>that have a direct and substantial effect on the on-the-job safety of public employees), scheduling of services provided to the public, determination of the minimum qualifications necessary for any position, criteria for evaluation or performance appraisal, assignment of duties, workload when the effect on duties is insubstantial, reasonable dress, grooming, and at-work personal conduct requirements respecting smoking, gum chewing, and similar matters of personal conduct at work, and any other subject proposed that is permissive under paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Or Laws 2007, ch 141, \u00a7 la. Thus, in 2007, the legislature created, by amendment to paragraph (f) of subsection (7), a separate rule for bargaining involving employees covered by ORS 243.736 \u2014 that is, strike-prohibited employees \u2014 and essentially retained, in new paragraph (g), the pre-2007 rule for all other employee bargaining except school-district bargaining. And, under the new rule for strike-prohibited employees, a \u201csafety issue\u201d need only have <em>\u201can impact,\u201d </em>rather than <em>\u201ca direct and substantial effect\u201d </em>on the employees\u2019 on-the-job safety, in order to be subject to mandatory bargaining, ORS 243.650(7)(f), whereas the \u201cdirect and substantial effect\u201d test continued to apply to other employee bargaining, ORS 243.650(7)(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Significantly, in enacting the 2007 amendments, the legislature retained the phrase \u201csafety issues\u201d from the pre2007 version of the rule \u2014 both in establishing the new rule that applied to bargaining for strike-prohibited employees and in continuing the existing rule for other employee bargaining. Consequently, as the parties recognize, the board\u2019s construction of that phrase in prior cases is important context in determining the meaning of the 2007 amendments. <em>See, e.g., State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 99, 261 P3d 1234 (2011) (\u201cAlthough, in the abstract, there is nothing that precludes the legislature from defining the same terms to mean different things in the same or related statutes, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we ordinarily assume that the legislature uses terms in related statutes consistently.\u201d); <em>Mastriano v. Board of Parole, </em>342 Or 684, 693, 159 P3d 1151 (2007) (\u201c[W]e generally presume that the legislature enacts statutes in light of existing judicial decisions that have a direct bearing on those statutes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Before turning to those cases, however, we first dispose of the association\u2019s argument (echoing Gamson\u2019s dissent) that the board misinterpreted the statute by analyzing whether the <em>subject </em>of a proposal is safety, because paragraph (f) \u2014 unlike some other portions of subsection (7)\u2014 does not expressly use the word \u201csubject.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">As discussed above, 257 Or App at 715-16, subsection (7) defines \u201cemployment relations,\u201d which, in turn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>determines whether a matter \u2014 in this case, a \u201csafety issue\u201d \u2014 is a mandatory <em>subject </em>of collective bargaining. <em>See Salem Police Employees Union, </em>308 Or at 391 (\u201cUnder Oregon statutes a public employer and represented public employees must bargain about <em>subjects </em>within the definition of \u2018employment relations.\u2019 While the law does not prohibit bargaining about any other <em>subject </em>as well, the rights and duties extend only so far as does the statutory definition.\u201d (Emphasis added.)). Given that understanding, the fact that the legislature did not repeat the word \u201csubject\u201d in paragraph (f) does not, as the association contends, lead to the conclusion that the legislature intended a different analytical approach to apply with respect to safety. Indeed, the legislature, in describing the scope of \u201cemployment relations\u201d throughout subsection (7), did not consistently repeat the word \u201csubject\u201d as the referent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But, read as a whole, it is clear that that is what the legislature intended. There is nothing in the context or, as discussed below, in the legislative history of the provision, to indicate that the legislature intended a distinction based on that inconsistent usage.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In short, we reject the association\u2019s assertion that the phrase \u201csafety issues\u201d is intended to invoke a broader inquiry than if the legislature had specifically referred to safety as a \u201csubject\u201d rather than an \u201cissue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\">Having resolved that issue, we turn to the board\u2019s decisions applying the pre-2007 version of ORS 243.650(7)(f). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>As noted, the county contends that those cases support the board\u2019s understanding that, for a proposal to involve a \u201csafety issue\u201d under the present version of subsection (7)(f), it must directly and unambiguously address a matter related to workplace safety. The association argues that the cases do not support such a narrow, \u201cfour corners\u201d reading of the proposal, but instead demonstrate that a proposal need only <em>\u201cconcern </em>safety\u201d to be considered a \u201csafety issue\u201d under the statute. (Emphasis added.) And, in the association\u2019s view\u2014 as amplified at oral argument \u2014 a proposal \u201cconcerns\u201d safety if it could \u201cconceivably\u201d relate to safety. According to the association, it is the second prong of the statute \u2014 the one the board did not reach, viz., whether the proposal \u201cimpacts\u201d workplace safety \u2014 that serves to narrow the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">We begin with <em>Roseburg Firefighters Association, IAFF Local 1110 v. City of Roseburg, </em>17 PECBR 611 (1998) <em>(Roseburg). </em>One of the issues before the board in <em>Roseburg </em>was whether the city had a duty to bargain its decision to reduce minimum staffing levels in the city fire department. As relevant here, the city contended that the issue was \u201cstaffing\u201d and, thus, a \u201cpermissive\u201d subject of bargaining, while the association argued that the issues were \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cworkload,\u201d which, before the 1995 enactmentofSB 750, were \u201ctypically found to be mandatory bargaining subjects.\u201d Id. at 629. The board concluded, however, that it was essentially immaterial whether the subject was staffing or, instead, safety and workload, because, under ORS 243.650(7)(f), as amended by SB 750 (1995), \u201cboth staffing and safety are now expressly permissive, unless they have a direct and substantial effect on the on-the-job safety of public employees,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 629 (internal quotation marks omitted), and the evidence in the record did not meet that test, <em>id. </em>at 631.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number><em>Roseburg </em>provides limited contextual guidance as to the meaning of \u201csafety issue\u201d because the board did not need to reach that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\">However, the board did note that, even without the \u201cdirect and substantial\u201d test added by the SB 750 (1995) amendments, it was \u201cdoubtful that [the] Board would have found the subject of the Association\u2019s proposals to be safety,\u201d because, as in one of its pre-SB 750 cases, <em>Polk County v. Polk County Deputy Sheriff\u2019s Association, </em>6 PECBR 4641 (1981), \u201cthe Association\u2019s proposal on its face addresses only staffing levels\u201d and \u201cdoes not address safety.\u201d <em>Roseburg, </em>17 PECBR at 630 n 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The next case, <em>Federation of Oregon Parole and Probation Officers v. Washington County, </em>19 PECBR 411 (2001) <em>(FOPPO), </em>involved the county\u2019s implementation of a policy that prohibited employees from carrying firearms while on duty and from carrying firearms while on county property while either on or off duty. The county argued, in part, that, although \u201cthe policy concerns the subject of employee safety,\u201d bargaining was permissive, rather than mandatory, under the board\u2019s earlier precedent. <em>Id. </em>at 416. The board \u201cagree [d] with the County that the policy concerns safety.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 426. Among other things, the board noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">\u201c[t]he policy states that it is intended to protect employees from physical harm that could result from accidental or intentional discharge of firearms while the employees are on duty or when they are off duty but on County premises. It is also intended to minimize the potential for intimidation that might occur with firearms present on County property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-6\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, in <em>FOPPO, </em>it was evident from the policy itself that it directly and unambiguously affected a matter related to safety \u2014 minimizing the risk of harm associated with firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Service Employees International Union Local 503, Oregon Public Employees Union v. State of Oregon, Department of Administrative Services, and the Homecare Commission, </em>20 PECBR 144 (2002), the board did not resort to extrinsic evidence to determine whether the subject of the union\u2019s proposal, which would have required the public employer to pay its home-care workers for Hepatitis A and B immunizations if they requested them, was safety (as well as health benefits). Rather, the board stated, \u201cThe subject of the proposal may also be characterized as concerning safety, since it seeks to provide protection to workers from serious infectious diseases to which they could be exposed on the job.\u201d Id. at 158. The board concluded that, regardless of the label attached \u2014 health benefits or safety \u2014 the policy was mandatory for bargaining. <em>Id. </em>at 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Finally, in <em>SEIU Local 503, OPEU v. State of Oregon, Oregon State Hospital, </em>20 PECBR 189 (2003), SEIU alleged that implementation of a policy discontinuing the use of steel handcuffs to restrain patients at the Oregon State Hospital (OSH) required bargaining. The board agreed with the administrative law judge that \u201cthe record does not establish that the ban on steel handcuffs had a direct and substantial effect on employee safety, and that [SEIU\u2019s] complaint should be dismissed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190. The board described the \u201cprecise question\u201d before it as \u201cwhether the ban on this particular method of restraint \u2014 steel handcuffs \u2014 increases the risk of injury to employees at OSH <em>so that it has a direct and substantial effect on employee safety\u201d Id. </em>at 195 (emphasis added). Thus, although the board also stated, \u201cThe <em>record in this case </em>demonstrates that patient assaults, and the use of patient seclusion and restraint procedures, are safety issues for both patients and staff,\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphasis added), we understand that it did so in the context of answering that question \u2014 that is, whether the ban had a direct and substantial effect on employee safety \u2014 not the predicate question whether the subject of the policy was a safety issue \u2014 and concluded that it did not.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Although admittedly not overwhelming, we conclude that the board\u2019s earlier pronouncements provide contextual support for the board\u2019s interpretation in this case that, for a proposal or policy to present a \u201csafety issue\u201d under ORS 243.650(7)(f), it must be plain from the proposal itself that it addresses a matter of workplace safety.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\">We turn to the legislative history surrounding the enactment of the 2007 amendments to ORS 243.650(7)(f). As noted, the association contends that the legislative history \u201cunequivocally]\u201d supports its position that the legislature intended training to be considered a safety issue subject to mandatory, rather than permissive, bargaining and is \u201cultimately dispositive\u201d in its favor. For that proposition, the association relies heavily on a colloquy between Senators Prozanski and Devlin on the floor of the Senate, in which Prozanski, a co-sponsor and the carrier of the bill in the Senate, responded to a series of questions involving examples of issues that would <em>not </em>be subject to mandatory bargaining under the then-existing law, as a way of demonstrating the need for a change.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In particular, the association points to the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\">\u201c[Sen Devlin:] I\u2019m representing correctional employees at a county facility. We\u2019re concerned because of some of the issues that we\u2019ve had relative to dealing with people that are incarcerated with mental illness. I would like to see there be more training for us dealing with mental illness issues. I want to bring it up in bargaining. What\u2019s your response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">\u201c[Sen Prozanski:] My response would be [that] as the employer I have the, I guess the opportunity to say yes or no to that. I would say no as an employer because I am not required under the current statute to allow any discussions to take place at the collective bargaining table as it pertains to safety</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>ijc <em>tfc </em>^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">\u201c[Sen Devlin:] Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues. I think we\u2019ve had a demonstration here about why this issue should be moved from permissive to mandatory. * * * There are a lot of red herrings in this particular bill. None of those really * * * are substantive. The real issue is that prior to 1995 when * * * public safety employees could bargain on safety related issues, none of these horror stories ever occurred. * * * This is something that should be put back on the table.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Audio Recording, Senate Floor Debate, SB 400, Mar 7, 2007, at 47:35 (statements of Sen Floyd Prozanski and Sen Richard Devlin), http://www.leg.state.or.us/listn/archive/ archive.2007s/SENATE-200703071059.ram (accessed July 25, 2013).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, the association argues, \u201cthe legislature appears to have explicitly considered the subject that is under dispute in this matter \u2014 corrections officer training\u2014 and explicitly passed the bill to ensure that training is a mandatory subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Although we agree with the association that a floor statement by the bill\u2019s carrier can be revealing as to the legislature\u2019s intention in enacting a bill, see, <em>e.g., Crooked River Ranch Water Company v. PUC, </em>224 Or App 485, 492, 198 P3d 967 (2008), in our view, the quoted exchange cannot bear the weight that the association ascribes to it here. The most that can be gleaned from that exchange is that the senators contemplated that training \u201crelative to dealing with people [who] are incarcerated [and suffer from] mental illness\u201d would be considered a safety issue. It does not indicate that the legislature intended the principle to apply to a generic, open-ended training proposal. Indeed, even without that legislative history, it is easy to imagine that a proposal for training corrections officers on interacting with mentally ill inmates would be considered a \u201csafety issue\u201d under the standard we articulate here \u2014 that is, it would be apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>from its face that it addresses a matter related to workplace safety. But that type of targeted proposal is not what the board was confronted with in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\">Several labor unions \u2014 the Oregon State Fire Fighters Council, Oregon American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, Oregon Service Employees International Union, Local 503, and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Council 75 \u2014 filed a brief <em>amici curiae, </em>also urging us to reverse the board\u2019s decision. Presenting a more detailed legislative history of SB 400, <em>amici </em>argue that, \u201cby continuing to focus on the definition of\u2018safety issues,\u2019 and whether a proposal raises something that on its face is a safety issue, the [b]oard misses the point of the [2007] legislative changes,\u201d which was to broaden the scope of safety issues that could be mandatory subjects of bargaining.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">It is beyond dispute that the purpose of SB 400 was to expand the scope of safety and staffing matters that are subject to mandatory bargaining. As <em>amici </em>emphasize, there was repeated testimony by proponents of SB 400 that it was designed to increase the ability of strike-prohibited employees to force employers to bargain over safety issues that affect the on-the-job safety of those employees, an ability that had been restricted with the passage of SB 750 in 1995. However, it appears that the legislature accomplished that goal by requiring only that a proposal have \u201can impact\u201d on safety to be a mandatory subject of bargaining, rather than the heightened \u201cdirect and substantial effect\u201d standard that had been in effect since 1995. Senator Prozanski, who, as noted, was a co-sponsor of SB 400, emphasized in committee that the bill was intended to obligate employers to discuss safety issues and to \u201cactually get us back to where we were pre-1995\u201d \u2014 that is, before SB 750, under which \u201csafety and staffing issues were not included in the definition of employment relations and therefore were no longer a mandatory bargaining issue unless they have a direct and substantial effect [on the] on-the-job safety of public employees.\u201d Audio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Recording, Senate Committee on Commerce, SB 400, Feb 7, 2007, at 1:00:11, 59:20 (statement of Sen Prozanski), http:// www. leg. state. or.us/listn/archive/ar chive.2007 s/S C OM-200702071505.ram (accessed July 25, 2013). There is nothing in the extensive legislative history to indicate that the legislature intended to change the initial inquiry used by the board to determine whether a proposal presents a \u201csafety issue\u201d in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The closest the legislature came to addressing that question occurred during a discussion of amendments to the bill offered \u2014 and ultimately adopted \u2014 by the House Committee on Business and Labor.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As introduced, and initially passed by the Senate, SB 400 would have amended subsection (f) to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">\u201cFor employee bargaining involving employees covered by ORS 243.736, \u2018employment relations\u2019 includes staffing levels and safety issues that have a <em>potential </em>impact on the on-the-job safety and the workload of the employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">SB 400, \u00a7 1 (emphasis added). However, when SB 400 reached the House Committee on Business and Labor, proponents offered amendments to address concerns that had been raised in the Senate by employers that the use of the word \u201cpotential\u201d to modify \u201cimpact\u201d was overly broad and would require bargaining over anything that could <em>conceivably </em>be considered to affect safety. Among other changes, the amendments deleted the modifier \u201cpotential\u201d in favor of, simply, \u201can impact.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Bill File, House Committee on Business and Labor, Mar 14, 2007, House Amendments to Senate Bill 400; Audio Recording, House Committee on Business and Labor, Mar 14, 2007, at 7:30 (statement of Brian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>DeLashmutt, representing the Oregon Council of Police Associations, the Oregon State Police Officers\u2019 Association, the Association of Oregon Corrections Employees, and the Federation of Oregon Parole and Probation Officers), http://www.leg.state.or.us/listn/archive/archive.2007s/HBL200703141445.ram (accessed July 25, 2013). As a proponent of the amendment, Brian DeLashmutt, explained, in that way, the bill</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-3\">\u201ccould still accomplish what we need to have accomplished, protecting the employees, giving them * * * the rights to be able to bargain over safety and staffing but not putting an undue hardship on the employers and opening what I guess they explained as [a] Pandora\u2019s box about potential safety issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 8:42. Cautioning that the term \u201csafety\u201d by itself \u2014 that is, without the modifier \u201cpotential\u201d \u2014 was subject to possible misinterpretation by the board, he further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">\u201cAnd I think in layman\u2019s terms what we\u2019re trying to accomplish here is a standard in which <em>any reasonable person, who would be the employee, the employer, or an arbiter, would come to the conclusion that the issue has a relationship to safety. </em>In straightforward language that\u2019s what we\u2019re attempting to accomplish by deleting potential but leaving the word safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 8:57 (emphasis added). Later, in response to a question by Representative Vicki Berger as to what he meant by the board possibly misinterpreting the word \u201csafety,\u201d DeLashmutt clarified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">\u201c [A] 111 was trying to portray to you is that <em>we don\u2019t want to have silence on the word \u2018potential\u2019 being left out so that anybody believes that really the intent of the legislature was that we go back to an after the fact standard, that you have to have an accident, an occurrence that actually happens, that injures somebody before you\u2019re required to bring that issue up. </em>And that\u2019s why I was trying to think in my mind, in plain language, the reasonable * * * person kind of standard. And included in that, obviously I believe the employers and the employees and potentially, at the final end, the arbitrator, would use the standard as a reasonable person and they\u2019re the final judge of that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 12:56 (emphasis added). Representative Holvey, vice-chair of the committee, confirmed that understanding. <em>Id. </em>at 14:01 (statement of Rep Paul Holvey) (\u201c[W]e mean the plain language * * * that somebody with a reasonable look at this would say this affects safety and therefore should be able to be talked about rather than having to look back after somebody\u2019s dead and say, well maybe this is a safety issue now. So I think that is the intent of this legislation * * * to make sure that we are looking at safety issues that a reasonable person would consider a safety issue.\u201d). The chair of the committee agreed, adding, \u201cWhether you support this or not any reasonable person is going to interpret that these issues are directly related to and have a relationship with the subject matter of safety. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14:46 (statement of Rep Mike Schaufler). Representative Rosenbaum concurred with the comments of both Representative Holvey and Chair Schaufler, <em>id. </em>at 15:28 (statement of Rep Diane Rosenbaum), and the \u201cdash 5\u201d amendments were adopted by the committee. <em>See </em>SB 400 (2007)-A Engrossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Thus, from that discussion, it is apparent that the legislature wanted to ensure that the amendments not be understood, on one end of the spectrum, to require an after-the-fact assessment before something would be considered a \u201csafety issue\u201d or, on the other end, to include matters that involved merely \u201cpotential\u201d safety issues. Instead the legislature sought to draw a middle ground, expressing its intention that employers be required to bargain over proposals that were <em>reasonably understood </em>to involve safety issues.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> And, it is based on that legislative history that we take issue with the board\u2019s announced standard. Although nothing about the legislative history indicates that the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>anticipated consideration of anything other than a \u201cfour corners\u201d reading of a proposal itself to determine whether it involves a \u201csafety issue\u201d \u2014 which is consistent with the board\u2019s requirement that the proposal \u201cdirectly\u201d address safety \u2014 it is also clear that the legislature intended that that determination be based on a common sense, reasonable person, reading of the proposal. In our view, introducing the notion of \u201cambiguity\u201d (or, more precisely, the lack thereof), as the board also did, is inconsistent with that stated intention and establishes a more demanding standard than the legislature intended to impose.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Although it may be a fine distinction, in light of the clear legislative intention to be <em>inclusive </em>in expanding the scope of safety issues subject to mandatory bargaining, it also is an important one.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\">In sum, we agree with the board\u2019s interpretation of the statute, but only to a point. Rather, we conclude, from the text, context, and legislative history of the statute that a matter involves a safety issue for purposes of ORS 243.650(7)(f) if it would reasonably be understood, on its face, to directly address a matter related to the on-the-job safety of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">We evaluate the association\u2019s proposal according to that standard. The association contends that, because the proposal \u201cspecifically references training approved by the state agency charged with conducting public safety training\u201d it is apparent, from its face, that the proposal directly addresses a matter of on-the-job safety.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In other words, the association\u2019s basic premise is that, simply due to the <em>nature </em>of DPPST \u2014 whose function is to, among other things, provide standards, certification, accreditation, and training for public safety personnel, <em>see generally </em>ORS 181.610 to 181.714 \u2014 the association\u2019s proposal that at least 20 of the 40 hours of proposed annual training be \u201cDPSST-approved training\u201d is necessarily identifiable, on its face, as presenting a safety issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>We disagree. Even assuming there is a principle that would enable us to look to the evidence in the record to determine the meaning of the term \u201cDPSST-approved,\u201d as Gamson reasoned in his dissent, see 257 Or App at 719, that evidence does not support the association\u2019s premise that training approved by DPSST is <em>necessarily </em>safety training.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Rather, that evidence only establishes that DPSST-approved training <em>could </em>involve safety, not that it <em>would </em>involve safety.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As the county points out, not all of the training courses offered by DPSST are safety related; for example, even among the list of DPPST \u201ccorrections\u201d courses are topics such as \u201cSex Offender Registration,\u201d \u201cCorrectional Law,\u201d \u201cLegal Issues in Jails &amp; Prisons,\u201d and \u201cMethods of Enhancing Jail Revenue.\u201d Thus, the generic reference to \u201cDPSST-approved training,\u201d at most, indicates the <em>possibility </em>that some training required by the proposal would involve safety training. And that runs afoul of the legislature\u2019s intention \u2014 discussed above, 257 Or App at 731-32 \u2014 that employers not be required to bargain over issues that have the potential to affect safety. In other words, accepting the association\u2019s reasoning would expand the scope of \u201csafety issues\u201d subject to mandatory bargaining beyond what the legislature expressly intended to permit under ORS 243.650(7)(f). In short, we conclude that the association\u2019s training proposal cannot, on its face, reasonably be understood to directly address a matter related to the on-the-job safety of corrections employees. Given that conclusion, we, like the board, do not reach the second part of the statutory <em>inquiry </em>\u2014 viz., whether the proposal has \u201can impact on the on-the-job safety of employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">In a final assignment of error, the association argues, in the alternative, that, even if bargaining the proposal is not <em>per se </em>mandatory under ORS 243.650(7)(f), it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>nonetheless mandatory under ORS 243.650(7)(a) and (c).\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As we understand that argument, the association contends that the proposal, even if it does not present a safety issue, is nonetheless mandatory for bargaining as an \u201cother condition of employment\u201d under ORS 243.650(7)(a), because, under the balancing test established in ORS 243.650(7)(c), the effect of the proposal on employees\u2019 conditions of employment (referring to risk and increased overtime) is greater than \u201cthe theoretical limitation on [management\u2019s prerogative for] assignment caused by reduced dollars.\u201d What the association fails to acknowledge, let alone address, either in its opening brief or its reply brief, is that the board \u2014 after concluding that the proposal was not <em>per se </em>mandatory under ORS 243.650(7)(f) \u2014 concluded that the proposal concerned \u201cassignment of duties,\u201d which is <em>expressly excluded </em>from the definition of \u201cemployment relations\u201d under ORS 243.650(7)(g)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and thus not subject to the balancing test in ORS 243.650(7)(c) at all.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>See Assn. of Oregon Corrections Emp., </em>353 Or at 176 (\u201cmatters that are included within, and not excluded by, the definition of \u2018employment relations\u2019\u201d are mandatory subjects of bargaining). Because the board\u2019s conclusion in that regard is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>unchallenged, we reject the association\u2019s final assignment of error without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">In summary, we conclude that the association\u2019s proposal that sworn corrections employees \u201cshall receive a minimum of forty (40) hours of approved training per year, of which at least twenty (20) hours shall be DPSST-approved training\u201d was not a \u201csafety issue\u201d subject to mandatory bargaining under ORS 243.650(7)(f). Further, we reject the association\u2019s argument that bargaining over the proposal was mandatory by application of ORS 243.650(7)(a) and (c).
