J.</author>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In this action on a promissory note, plaintiffs sought to recover damages from defendants based on defendants\u2019 failure to make all payments due under the note. Defendants responded, in part, that a settlement agreement entered into before plaintiffs initiated litigation \u201csatisfied and extinguished the promissory note.\u201d The case was tried to the court, which entered a general judgment in favor of defendants based on its conclusion that the settlement agreement constituted \u201ca substituted contract which replaced the Promissory Note and discharged any obligation under the Promissory Note.\u201d Plaintiffs appeal, asserting that the trial court erred in concluding that the settlement agreement was a substituted contract. Defendants, on cross-appeal, contend that the trial court erred when, in the general judgment, it dismissed without prejudice a claim that was not included in the operative complaint. For the reasons explained below, we affirm on appeal and, on cross-appeal, reverse and remand for entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings if they are supported by any competent evidence. <em>See Allco Enterprises v. Goldstein Family Living Trust, </em>183 Or App 328, 330, 51 P3d 1275 (2002). We recount the facts consistently with those findings and with the court\u2019s ruling. In 2004, Clarence Rucker (Clarence) loaned defendants a sum of money and defendants signed a promissory note. Although defendants made some payments on the note, at some point they failed to pay as agreed. Clarence sought payment, and in response defendants asserted that they should receive an offset for care they had provided to Clarence. Thereafter, the parties agreed to participate in mediation, which Judge Douglas Mitchell facilitated as mediator. During the mediation, the parties reached a settlement that they then recorded in the courtroom. Defendants were to pay Clarence $35,000 within 180 days, and that promise would be secured by a trust deed on property owned by defendants. If that amount was not paid in 180 days, then \u201ca confession of judgment [would] be recorded for $50,000.00\u201d in favor of Clarence. Each party to the settlement was asked whether the agreement as recorded accurately represented what they had assented to and each answered in the affirmative. Clarence, in particular, stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>to the court that he considered the agreement to be \u201cpretty good.\u201d The parties also agreed that if \u201cany glitches\u201d came up in putting together the documents relating to the deal, Judge Mitchell would have the power to resolve those issues. The parties later signed a written agreement that reflected the understanding of the parties flowing from the settlement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Clarence died shortly after signing the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Sometime after Clarence\u2019s death, his estate distributed the original promissory note to plaintiffs. In their amended complaint, plaintiffs sought to collect on the note. Defendants, as an affirmative defense, alleged that the parties\u2019 settlement agreement replaced the promissory note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201cOn or about January 24, 2008, Clarence * * * and Defendants made, executed and entered into a Settlement Agreement which fully paid, satisfied and extinguished the promissory note [that is] the subject of Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint, and Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint should be dismissed. Such Settlement Agreement has superseded, replaced and extinguished the promissory note and should be fully enforced by the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The case was eventually tried to the court. Plaintiffs asserted that \u201call the settlement agreement created was an \u2018executory accord,\u201d\u2019 and, therefore, there was no intent to discharge the note until the agreement was fully performed. Defendants responded that \u201cClarence and [defendants] intended the settlement agreement to be a replacement contract extinguishing the obligations under the promissory note[.]\u201d Ultimately, the court found for defendants, concluding that the settlement agreement was a substituted contract that extinguished the promissory note and became the operative agreement between the parties. On reconsideration, the court adhered to that ruling, noting that \u201cthe written settlement agreement merely reduced to writing a settlement in which both parties actively participated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>was placed on the record in Court before [Judge] Mitchell. An enforceable settlement agreement came into being the day the parties placed the settlement on the record.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court entered a general judgment providing that \u201c[a]n enforceable Settlement Agreement came into being the day the parties placed the settlement on the record before [Judge] Mitchell\u201d and \u201c[t]he Settlement Agreement was not an executory accord. It was a substituted contract which replaced the Promissory Note and discharged any obligation under the Promissory Note.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, it dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claim on the promissory note with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in concluding that the settlement agreement was a substituted contract that replaced the promissory note. According to plaintiffs, the agreement arrived at during the mediation \u201cwas not intended to be a final agreement between the parties.\u201d According to plaintiffs, \u201c[t]here is simply no evidence to show that the parties intended the mediation agreement to discharge the promissory note without full performance by defendants of the terms they agreed to at the mediation.\u201d In other words, plaintiffs assert that the parties intended only an executory accord rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>a substituted contract, as found by the trial court. Defendants counter that the parties to the settlement agreement intended it \u201cto be a replacement contract extinguishing the obligations under the promissory note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">\u201cAn executory accord is an agreement for the future discharge of an existing claim by a substituted performance.\u201d <em>McDowell Welding &amp; Pipefitting v. US Gypsum Co., </em>345 Or 272, 281, 193 P3d 9 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). It does not immediately discharge the underlying claim, but \u201cmerely suspends it\u201d pending full performance. <em>Id. </em>at 282. \u201cA substituted contract differs from an executory accord in that the parties intend that entering into a new agreement will immediately discharge the underlying obligation. A substituted contract discharges the underlying obligation * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283 (footnote and citations omitted). Whether a new agreement is a substituted contract operating as an immediate discharge or is an executory accord depends on the intent of the parties. The \u201cintent to substitute the new promise for the original liability must be clearly shown.\u201d <em>Savelich Logging v. Preston Mill Co., </em>265 Or 456, 463, 509 P2d 1179 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument centers on what Clarence intended: They assert that the oral and written agreements were not intended to substitute for the promissory note and, specifically, that Clarence \u201cwould not intend to swap a promissory note for a larger sum for an unsecured promise of a lesser sum and it is apparent from the mediated agreement that he did not so intend.\u201d Here, as noted, the trial court disagreed with that argument. It concluded that the settlement agreement was indeed intended to operate as a substituted contract and to immediately discharge the obligation on the promissory note. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion; the parties\u2019 clear intent to enter into a substituted contract (rather than an executory accord) is reflected in their agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Here, as discussed above, the parties participated in mediation with Judge Mitchell during which they agreed to resolve their disputes regarding the amounts due under the promissory note and for the care defendants provided to Clarence. After reaching an agreement, they went into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the courtroom, recorded that agreement, and stated their intention to abide by it. Later, a written memorialization of the agreement was prepared and that document, which was signed by Clarence before his death (and, on an unspecified date, by defendants), stated that the parties had \u201creached a settlement and resolution of all claims between the parties\u201d and that the document was \u201cintended to memorialize such agreement.\u201d It provided a remedy in the event that defendants defaulted on the agreement and further stated that the parties, by their agreement, \u201cmutually release, acquit and forever discharge one another *** from any and all claims * * * arising from or in any way related to the monies loaned or advanced from Clarence to [defendants] and for support services and advances made from [defendants] to Clarence.\u201d Thus, we conclude that it is clear that the parties intended their settlement to extinguish the obligation on the promissory note and replace it with the substituted terms of the settlement agreement. Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 assignment of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">We turn next to defendants\u2019 assignment of error on cross-appeal. They argue that the trial court erred in ruling on a matter that was not before it. In particular, in the general judgment, the court dismissed without prejudice a claim that had been pleaded in the original complaint but was not included in plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint. Plaintiffs counter that, \u201c[u]nder the relatively new judgment statute, ORS 18.082(3), any claim that is not expressly recited is presumed to be \u2018dismissed with prejudice unless the judgment provides that the dismissal is without prejudice.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For that reason, plaintiffs contend, the trial court \u201cproperly revised the proposed judgment to dismiss the former * * * claim on the settlement * * * without prejudice.\u201d As explained below, we agree with defendants that the trial court erred when it purported to resolve a claim that was not part of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The original complaint in this case was filed by the personal representative of the Clarence\u2019s estate, and included two claims: an action on the promissory note and a claim based on the parties\u2019 settlement agreement. Later, by stipulation of the parties, the court entered an order that the estate \u201cbe removed as Plaintiff, and the distributive beneficiaries of the promissory note in said estate\u201d be substituted as plaintiffs. Furthermore, the new plaintiffs were permitted to file an amended complaint. Plaintiffs then filed their amended complaint, which contained a single claim relating to the promissory note; unlike the original complaint, it included no claim related to the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">After trial, defendants submitted a form of judgment to which plaintiffs objected asserting, in part, that the \u201comission of reference to the original, alternate claim on the settlement [was] critical\u201d because, \u201c[a]bsent a deliberate disposition of the old settlement claim,\u201d the operation of ORS 18.082(3) would cause that claim to be dismissed with prejudice. During the hearing regarding the form of judgment, plaintiffs acknowledged that, at trial, the claim * * * before the Court in the pleadings was only the claim on the Promissory Note.\u201d Nonetheless, they sought to have the judgment reflect a disposition of the claim on the settlement agreement from the original complaint. Defendants opposed inclusion of a dismissal without prejudice of the settlement claim in the general judgment, arguing that the claim was \u201cnot a claim that is before the court\u201d and that it was improper for plaintiffs to seek a ruling from the court on a claim that was not part of the case. The court ultimately included a resolution of the settlement claim in the general judgment, stating that \u201cCount 2 of the original complaint, which asserted defendants\u2019 alleged breach of the Settlement Agreement, is dismissed without prejudice.\u201d As noted, on appeal,' defendants contend that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of that claim without prejudice in the general judgment was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">When a pleading is amended before trial, \u201cit shall be done by filing a new pleading, to be called the amended pleading, or by interlineation, deletion, or otherwise. Such amended pleading shall be complete in itself, without reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>to the original or any preceding amended one.\u201d ORCP 23 D. \u201cThe effect of filing [an] amended complaint is to supersede the original pleading.\u201d <em>Balboa Apartments v. Patrick, </em>351 Or 205, 212, 263 P3d 1011 (2011). Thus, when plaintiffs filed the amended complaint in this case, that amended pleading completely replaced and superseded the prior pleading. At that point it was, functionally, as if the claim on the settlement agreement had never existed. Plaintiffs\u2019 only request for relief in the action after the filing of the amended complaint was their claim on the promissory note.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, only that claim should have been included in the judgment. It was error for the court, in the judgment, to resolve a claim that was not in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Affirmed on appeal; on cross-appeal, reversed and remanded for entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\"> One of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions on appeal is that the trial court\u2019s finding that the \u201cwritten settlement agreement merely reduced to writing a settlement in which both parties actively participated\u201d is \u201cjust plain wrong.\u201d However, at the trial in this case, the court asked plaintiffs whether the settlement agreement \u201cthat was drafted up\u201d reflected \u201cthe understanding of the parties flowing from th[e] settlement conference.\u201d Plaintiffs agreed that it did. In view of plaintiffs\u2019 exchange with the trial court on that point, we reject their argument and_do_not address it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-5\"> Plaintiffs argue on appeal that, because no case had been filed at the time of the mediation, the court improperly characterized the parties\u2019 agreement as having been placed \u201con the record.\u201d However, during the trial, plaintiffs themselves referred on numerous occasions to the agreement of the parties having been placed \u201con the record.\u201d They asked Judge Mitchell, who testified at the trial, questions relating to that issue: \u201cSo, you went back and forth on the mediation then until you got an agreement and then that is what was put on the record, is that right?\u201d Judge Mitchell agreed that that characterization was correct. They also asked him, \u201cWhen the parties reached an agreement, in your eyes, you went in to open Court where you could then record what they agreed, isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d Again, Judge Mitchell agreed. Later, the court asked plaintiffs whether \u201cthere was an oral agreement on the record\u201d and plaintiffs represented to the court that there was, indeed, such an \u201coral agreement on the record.\u201d Accordingly, we reject without further discussion plaintiffs\u2019 argument regarding the court\u2019s characterization of the settlement as having been \u201con the record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b570-6\"> We note that plaintiffs contend that the trial court improperly departed from the pleadings when it ruled based on the oral agreement. In particular, they argue that, in their affirmative defense, defendants referenced the written agreement, dated January 24, 2008, and therefore the trial court could not consider the oral agreement in its ruling. We reject that argument without further discussion except to note again that the trial court considered the written agreement to be a memorialization of the parties\u2019 understanding reached at the mediation. <em>See </em>257 Or App at 547 n 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-5\"> ORS 18.082(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">\u201cUpon entry of a general judgment, any request for relief in the action that is not decided by the general judgment or by a previous limited judgment, that has not been incorporated into the general judgment under subsection (2) of this section, or that cannot be decided by a supplemental judgment, is dismissed with prejudice unless the judgment provides that the dismissal is without prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b574-5\"> We note that ORS 18.005(16) defines the term \u201crequest for relief\u201d as \u201ca claim, a charge in a criminal action or any other request for a determination of the rights and liabilities of one or more parties in an action that a legal authority allows the court to decide by a judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
