PERB, </em>239 Or App 284, 293, 246 P3d 5 (2010) <em>(Afzal I), </em>we reversed and remanded a final order in which the Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB) had denied claimant\u2019s request for a disability retirement allowance on the ground that he had failed to show that he was unable to perform any work for which he was qualified. <em>See </em>ORS 238.320(3) (conditioning eligibility for a disability retirement allowance on the claimant being \u201cunable to perform any work for which qualified\u201d); OAR 459-015-0040(1) (\u201cThe burden of proof for entitlement to a disability retirement allowance is upon the applicant.\u201d). On remand, PERB reached the same conclusion as it had in its initial order, again denying claimant\u2019s request for benefits. Claimant seeks judicial review of PERB\u2019s order on remand, asserting that the order is flawed for two reasons. First, claimant contends that the order on remand relied on the same reasoning that we rejected in <em>Afzal I. </em>Second, claimant argues that the order on remand is not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree with claimant on both points and, for the reasons set forth below, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">We take the following facts from PERB\u2019s findings and the record, in part as we summarized them in <em>Afzal I. </em>Claimant worked for Multnomah County for many years, most recently as a community justice manager. In that position, claimant planned and approved arrests, detainments, and searches; he also actively participated in arrests. In addition, claimant held meetings with department members, management, staff, and outside partners. In a job description he submitted to the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS), claimant described his duties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201cManage, direct, evaluate and coordinate and prioritize a multifunction work unit. Manage delivery of community justice services. *** Manage and direct lead workers in operation of the work unit and flow of work. Manage the lead worker to help in staff training and assignments. Collaborate and form partnerships with other entities and represent the department in public meetings and multi agency taskforces. Respond to community groups and formulate plans to resolve issues. This position is responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>for unit and office budgets. Head and organize safety committees. This position also requires program development and implementation of programs. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">As claimant testified, before working for the county, he had worked in fast food restaurant management and also for a security department. Claimant held a bachelor\u2019s degree in administrative justice and psychology, and he also had completed some post-graduate coursework.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">While employed as a community justice manager, claimant developed a physical impairment, primarily in his left leg, and he subsequently resigned from his position with the county. We summarized those events in <em>Afzal I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">\u201cFrom October 2002 through January 2008, claimant saw an internist, Dr. Frank Fric, to address symptoms that were causing him to have problems at work, including dizziness, heaviness in the head, unstable gait, and weakness. By early 2006, claimant\u2019s symptoms had progressed to the point that they began to cause more noticeable complications at work. Claimant\u2019s colleagues expressed concern about changes in his decision-making ability and attention to detail. He often seemed confused, fatigued, and inattentive; on several occasions he nodded off during meetings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">\u201cAlso in 2006, claimant developed physical complications, including walking with a limp and dragging his left leg. * * * He began seeing neurologist Dr. Bruce Bell on May 22, 2006. After that initial visit, Bell opined that claimant could have \u2018some sort of unusual dystonia or possible early Parkinson disease to explain the gait problems. He may have a mild seizure disorder.\u2019 Claimant\u2019s internist, Fric, also noted in a subsequent visit that claimant\u2019s condition had worsened, developing into \u2018basically uncontrollable non-symmetric movements of the entire body, arms, legs. Observing him sitting in [a] chair, he is moving up and down on the chair, almost sliding off.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">\u201cAfter resigning from his position as a community justice manager on December 8, 2006, he and his wife, from February 2007 through December 2007, operated a business selling watches and clocks from a cart inside a shopping mall. Claimant worked at the cart for a short time but had to stop because he was having problems focusing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>staying alert. He was also having difficulty standing and otherwise being able to physically assist customers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">239 Or App at 287 (brackets in <em>Afzal I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Claimant applied to PERS for disability retirement benefits in January 2007, listing his condition as \u201cParkinson\u2019s \u2014 dopamine sensitive dystonia.\u201d At the request of PERS, claimant\u2019s internist, Fric, provided a medical report stating that he was uncertain whether claimant would be able to perform any work for which he was qualified. Neurologist Bruce Bell also provided PERS with medical information, identifying claimant\u2019s condition as \u201cParkinson\u2019s.\u201d In March 2007, Bruce Bell opined that claimant\u2019s physical impairments left him unable to return to his former job because he could not \u201crespond rapidly from a physical point of view to anything that may come up.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bruce Bell also reported, however, that, if claimant \u201chad some sort of sedentary work which did not require stress, he might be able to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Later in 2007, neurologist Lynne Bell performed an independent medical examination of claimant. She, too, reported that claimant\u2019s primary difficulty related to his left leg and ambulation, and she opined that claimant had a \u201cfunctional gait disorder.\u201d Lynne Bell also noted that the \u201cshaking of the hands\u201d that claimant initially exhibited \u201cdisappeared with distracting maneuvers [,]\u201d and that she suspected \u201ca psychogenic component\u201d to claimant\u2019s condition. Lynne Bell concluded that, based on claimant\u2019s \u201ccurrent clinical presentation, he would be capable of performing a desk job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">In September 2007, PERS denied claimant\u2019s application for disability retirement benefits. Claimant sought a hearing, and PERS referred his request to the Office of Administrative Hearings, which assigned an administrative law judge (ALJ) to hear his claim. Before the hearing took place, another neurologist, William Herzberg, reported that claimant suffered from two conditions \u2014 seizure disorder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>and dystonia (a neurological movement disorder) \u2014 and would not be able to return to his position with Multnomah County.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">After a June 2008 hearing, the ALJ issued a proposed order recommending that claimant\u2019s request for disability benefits be denied. PERB then issued a final order in which it adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact and, ultimately, agreed with the ALJ that claimant was not entitled to a disability retirement allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">That first final order focused, at least nominally, on whether claimant had met his burden of proving that he no longer was able to perform any work for which he was qualified. A statute and several administrative rules govern that analysis. Under ORS 238.320(1), to establish eligibility for a disability retirement allowance, a claimant must be \u201cmentally or physically incapacitated for an extended duration * * * and thereby unable to perform any work for which qualified])]\u201d OAR 459-015-0001(1) defines \u201cany work for which qualified\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">\u201cA job, not necessarily the last or usual job, which the applicant for a disability retirement allowance:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">\u201c(a) Is physically and psychologically capable of performing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">\u201c(b) Has, or may obtain with reasonable training the knowledge, skills and abilities, to perform the job.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">To determine whether a claimant is unable to perform any work for which qualified, PERB must consider six factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-11\">\u201c(A) Previous employment experience;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-12\">\u201c(B) Formal education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-13\">\u201c(C) Formal training;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-14\">\u201c(D) Transferable skills;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-15\">\u201c(E) Age; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-16\">\u201c(F) Physical or mental impairment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-17\">OAR 459-015-0010(4)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>PERB\u2019s assessment of those factors is aided by information provided by the claimant, who must submit at least one medical report \u201cresulting from a physical examination, documenting how the injury or disease incapacitates\u201d him or her. OAR 459-015-0010(2). In addition, where the claim is based on a neurological condition, the claimant must submit at least one report from a \u201ctreating or consulting neurologist or neurosurgeon.\u201d OAR 459-015-0010(3)(c)[.] The claimant bears the burden of proving entitlement to a disability retirement allowance. OAR 459-015-0040(1). PERB \u201cis not required to prove whether the applicant is or is not eligible for a disability retirement allowance.\u201d OAR 459-015-0005(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">In its initial order, PERB denied claimant\u2019s request for a disability retirement allowance based on its determination that claimant had failed to \u201cpresent at least one report from a treating neurologist to support his claim that his injury or disease incapacitates him to such an extent that he is incapable of performing <em>any </em>work for which qualified, as required by ORS 238.320.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) As we explained in <em>Afzal I, </em>however, ORS 238.320(3) does not require a claimant to submit a physician\u2019s report opining that the claimant is incapable of performing any work for which he or she is qualified; rather, the statute simply specifies that the claimant must be incapacitated to that extent in order to qualify for a retirement disability allowance. 239 Or App at 292; <em>see </em>ORS 238.320(3). And, to the extent that the administrative rules require claimants to submit medical reports that include specific information about their disabilities, claimant met that obligation here. <em>See Afzal I, </em>239 Or App at 292 (citing OAR 459-015-0010(2), (3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Our decision to remand PERB\u2019s order was based on PERB apparently having denied benefits based <em>solely </em>on the absence of a statement by a neurologist that claimant was incapable of performing any work for which he was qualified \u2014 a statement that, as we explained, is required neither by ORS 238.320(3) nor by the related administrative rules. <em>Id. </em>at 292-93. Instead, we held, PERB needed to consider all pertinent factors, as specified in OAR 459-015-0010(4)(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>in assessing whether claimant had carried \u201chis burden * * * to show that he was unable to do <em>any </em>work for which he was qualified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293 (emphasis in original). Because we could not tell from PERB\u2019s order whether it had considered all of those factors, the order \u201clack[ed] substantial reason justifying its denial of disability allowance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we reversed the order and remanded it to PERB for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">On remand, PERB again denied claimant\u2019s application for a retirement disability allowance. However, in accordance with our holding in <em>Afzal I, </em>PERB\u2019s order on remand included new analysis related to the OAR 459-015-0010(4)(a) factors (employment experience, education, training, transferable skills, age, and physical or mental impairment):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">\u201cAt 44 years old, [claimant] is relatively young. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Administrative Justice and in Psychology and has completed some post-graduate coursework. He has dystonia of the lower extremities, particularly in his left leg which impairs his ability to ambulate in a rapid manner. But this physical impairment does not preclude him from other, more sedentary, tasks and duties. His prior work experience as a manager brings with it extensive job skills, including the ability to manage, direct, evaluate and coordinate and prioritize a multifunction work unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">\u201c[Claimant] has experience heading committees, developing and implementing programs, and overseeing program budgets. These skills are not unique to work as a parole officer or to managing parole officers. These skills are transferable to other management positions, some of which may be \u2018desk jobs\u2019 [claimant] could perform. These management positions could include, but are not limited to, working for a corporation or state agency that could offer job-specific training to [claimant]. [Claimant] did not present a vocational evaluation, expert medical opinions, or any other evidence to support a conclusion that he is not qualified for this type of management-related work * * *. Moreover, there is no medical evidence to support a conclusion that [claimant] suffers from a cognitive impairment that would preclude him from performing this type of managerial work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u201c[Claimant] failed to present expert medical evidence to support a conclusion that his physical impairment prevents him from performing sedentary work. Considering his age, his formal education, his formal training, his transferable skills, and his physical impairment, [claimant] has not demonstrated that h[e] is unable to perform any work for which otherwise qualified. For these reasons, [claimant] is not entitled to a disability retirement allowance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">On judicial review, claimant asserts that PERB\u2019s order on remand \u201ccontains the same errors and leap of logic based on a lack of foundation this Court addressed\u201d in <em>Afzal I. </em>More specifically, we understand claimant to be arguing (1) that PERB again erred by relying on the neurologists\u2019 reports as a basis for denying his claim, and (2) that the order on remand lacks substantial evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> PERB responds that its order was not contrary to our prior opinion. PERB also asserts that substantial evidence in the record supports its conclusion that claimant had failed to establish that he was precluded from all work for which he was qualified. In making that argument, PERB observes that claimant had the burden of proving his qualification for a disability retirement allowance. We address claimant\u2019s arguments in turn, reviewing PERB\u2019s order for substantial evidence and reason, as well as for errors of law. <em>SAIF v. Ramos, </em>252 Or App 361, 363, 287 P3d 1220 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Claimant first argues that PERB\u2019s order on reconsideration repeats the reasoning that we rejected in <em>Afzal I. </em>According to claimant, PERB \u201crelied upon the same two medical statements [from neurologists Bruce Bell and Herzberg] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>to again * * * conclude [that he] did not prove his inability to work.\u201d As noted, in its initial order, PERB determined that claimant had not presented at least one report from a neurologist that supported his claim that he could not perform any work for which he was qualified. Thus, PERB at least implicitly found that the reports from Bruce Bell and Herzberg were insufficient to establish that claimant could not perform sedentary work. As explained above, our remand in <em>Afzal I </em>was based on PERB\u2019s error in relying <em>solely </em>on its conclusion about the lack of a supporting neurology report as a basis for denying claimant\u2019s application for benefits. 239 Or App at 291-93. In the order on remand, PERB reiterated its observations about the reports from Bruce Bell and Herzberg. More significantly \u2014 at least from claimant\u2019s perspective \u2014 PERB also repeated verbatim the sentence that prompted our remand in <em>Afzal </em>I: \u201c[Claimant] did not present at least one report from a treating neurologist to support his claim that his injury or disease incapacitates him to such an extent that he is incapable of performing <em>any </em>work for which qualified, as required by ORS 238.320.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Notwithstanding PERB\u2019s repetition of the offending sentence, we conclude that the order on remand is supported by substantial reason. The order on remand is not actually based \u2014 as the initial order appeared to be \u2014 on the absence of a neurologist\u2019s report stating that claimant is unable to perform any work for which he is qualified. Rather, the order on remand reflects PERB\u2019s consideration of the six factors in OAR 459-015-0010(4)(a): employment experience, education, training, transferable skills, age, and physical or mental impairment. On remand, PERB explained that, in deciding whether claimant could perform a desk job, it had considered</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\u2022 claimant\u2019s previous management experience;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">\u2022 claimant\u2019s bachelor\u2019s degree in administrative justice and psychology and his completion of some postgraduate coursework;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">\u2022 claimant\u2019s skills in, among other things, managing people, heading committees, developing and implementing programs, and overseeing budgets, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>were \u201cnot unique to work as a parole officer or to managing parole officers\u201d and therefore were transferable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">\u2022 claimant\u2019s \u201crelatively young\u201d age (44 years old); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">\u2022 claimant\u2019s limitations, as well as evidence that those limitations did not \u201cpreclude him from other, more sedentary, tasks and duties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Thus, PERB considered the factors that OAR 459-015-0010(4)(a) requires it to take into account. PERB\u2019s repetition of the sentence about the neurologists\u2019 reports appears, in context, to be nothing more than an unfortunate artifact from the original order. Because PERB\u2019s new rationale for denying claimant\u2019s claim is based on all of the OAR 459-015-0010(4)(a) factors, and not solely on the neurologists\u2019 reports, we find that artifact to have little significance. Phrased in the terms that claimant uses in his brief, PERB\u2019s order on remand does not impermissibly rely on the reasoning that we rejected in <em>Afzal I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">That brings us to claimant\u2019s second argument, in which he contends that the order on remand is not based on substantial evidence. Claimant\u2019s argument starts from a flawed premise \u2014 that the record must include \u201csubstantial evidence of an ability to work.\u201d Based on that premise, he complains in his opening brief that the record does not include, for example, a vocational evaluation establishing that he can perform certain types of desk jobs. But, as explained above, claimant bore the burden of showing that he could not perform any work for which he was qualified; PERB did not bear the burden of showing the converse. OAR 459-015-0005(2); OAR 459-015-0040(1). Thus, the record need not include substantial evidence showing that claimant <em>can </em>work; all it need contain is substantial evidence supporting PERB\u2019s determination that claimant did not meet his burden of proving that he <em>cannot </em>work. For that reason, the absence of a vocational evaluation undercuts claimant\u2019s argument, rather than supporting it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>And the record on remand does include substantial evidence supporting PERB\u2019s determination that claimant did not establish that his impairment prevents him from performing sedentary work for which he would be qualified. The record, viewed as a whole, supports PERB\u2019s findings that claimant is relatively young, that he could benefit from job-specific training, that his prior experience managing people is transferable to other jobs requiring that skill, and that his management background generally qualifies him for other management positions. The record also includes substantial evidence, like the report from Lynne Bell, that supports PERB\u2019s finding that claimant does not suffer from any cognitive impairment that would prevent him from performing management work. Those findings rationally lead to PERB\u2019s ultimate determination that claimant failed to show that he was unable to perform any work for which he was qualified and, therefore, was not entitled to a disability retirement allowance. Thus, the order on remand is supported by substantial evidence and reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\"> Bruce Bell reiterated that opinion in late 2007, reporting that claimant was \u201c100% disabled and * * * unable to perform the work of his previous job due to the difficulty of using his left foot.\u201d Bruce Bell concluded that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that claimant \u201cwill be able to return to\u201d the job with the county.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\"> In <em>Afzal I, </em>we expressed our agreement with claimant\u2019s argument that he \u201cwas not required to \u2018eliminate the universe\u2019 of desk jobs.\u201d 239 Or App at 293. Citing that statement, claimant also argues that PERB erred on remand by \u201conce again requiring [him] to carry a burden disproving a universe of jobs[.]\u201d Claimant reads too much into a single sentence from <em>Afzal I. </em>Our statement that claimant was not required to \u201c\u2018eliminate the universe\u2019 of desk jobs\u201d must be read together with our explanation that claimant did have the burden of \u201cproffering sufficient evidence under <em>all </em>the criteria in OAR 459-015-0010, to show that he was unable to do <em>any </em>work for which he was qualified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphases in original). In that context, our observation that claimant was not required to \u201celiminate the universe\u201d of possible desk jobs meant only that claimant did not have the burden of proving that negative <em>in the abstract. </em>That is, although claimant was not required to establish that <em>no </em>desk job exists (anywhere, of any type) that he could perform, he was required to prove that he generally could not perform jobs within the <em>specific </em>universe of desk jobs that he is qualified to perform, taking into account the OAR 459-015-0010(4)(a) factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\"> Although claimant acknowledges in his reply brief that PERB \u201cmay not be required to obtain evidence from a vocational expert,\u201d he still insists that the order on remand is not supported by substantial evidence because the record does not include specific evidence of possible \u201calternative employment.\u201d As we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>explained, it is claimant\u2019s burden to establish that such alternative employment does not exist, not PERB\u2019s burden to prove that it does.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
