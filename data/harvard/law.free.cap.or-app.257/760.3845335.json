ORS 426.005(1)(e). In his first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to advise him of the possible results of the proceedings, as required by ORS 426.100(1)(c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that we should exercise our discretion to correct the error as plain error. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (court has discretion to correct an error of law apparent on the record). In a second assignment of error, appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to support involuntary commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The state concedes that the trial court committed reversable error in not advising appellant of the potential consequences of the proceeding. We agree. As we have previously held, \u201cto comply with ORS 426.100(1), a trial court in a civil commitment proceeding must either advise the allegedly mentally ill person directly regarding those rights or conduct an examination on the record to determine whether a valid waiver of the right to be advised has been knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>State v. S. J. F., </em>247 Or App 321, 324, 269 P3d 83 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Neither of those circumstances occurred here. Moreover, a trial court\u2019s failure to so advise or examine the mentally ill person is plain error, which we have exercised our discretion to correct. <em>Id; see also id. </em>at 325 (explaining that \u201cplain error review of violations of ORS 426.100(1) is justified by the nature of civil commitment proceedings, the relative interests of the parties in those proceedings, the gravity of the violation, and the ends of justice\u201d). For the reasons expressed in <em>S. J. F., </em>we exercise our discretion to correct the error in this case as well. Because we reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the judgment on that basis, we do not address appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-6\"> ORS 426.100(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">\u201cAt the time the allegedly mentally ill person is brought before the court, the court shall advise the person of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-8\">\u2021\u2021\u2021\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-9\">\u201c(c) The possible results of the proceedings [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
