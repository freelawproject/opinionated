We reject defendant\u2019s first assignment of error without discussion and write only to address his second assignment of error, in which he asserts that the trial court erred in admitting \u201cmedical records including a lab report of defendant\u2019s [blood alcohol content]\u201d over his hearsay objection. In particular, he asserts that, although medical records may, in appropriate circumstances, be admitted under an exception to the hearsay rule, here, \u201cthe state did not establish a foundation for the admission of the records under a hearsay exception.\u201d <em>See </em>OEC 802 (hearsay is not admissible unless an exception applies). The state concedes that \u201cthe medical records constituted hearsay and that the state failed to demonstrate that the records fell within a hearsay exception\u201d and that the case must be reversed and remanded for a new trial. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
