Such a \u201ccombined condition\u201d is compensable \u201conly if, so long as and to the extent that the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause\u201d of the disability or the need for treatment of the combined condition. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board issued an order that set aside employer\u2019s denial of claimant\u2019s claim for combined conditions, ruling that employer had not met its burden of proving that claimant\u2019s otherwise compensable injury no longer was the major contributing cause of his disability and need for treatment. On employer\u2019s petition for judicial review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The issue we address on review is a legal one, and we briefly describe the facts solely to provide context for our discussion. Claimant slipped at work and injured his right foot in early 2008. Employer accepted a claim for a nondisabling foot strain later that year. In January 2009, after receiving new medical evaluations, claimant submitted a claim for two new foot conditions: a navicular fracture and avascular necrosis (AVN) of the navicular bone in his right foot, both of which predated his work injury. Employer denied those conditions in a document titled \u201ccombined condition denial,\u201d and claimant requested, and was granted, a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">After that hearing, the ALJ issued an opinion and order addressing what he described as employer\u2019s \u201cdenial of [claimant\u2019s] additional medical condition claims for a right foot navicular fracture and [AVN] in the navicular bone.\u201d The ALJ found that claimant\u2019s \u201cdisability and need for treatment for the AVN and the fracture was caused at least in material part by his injury.\u201d Consequently, the ALJ ruled, claimant had established that he had an \u201cotherwise compensable injury,\u201d that is, that his work-related injury \u201cwas at least a material cause of the disability and need for treatment for the AVN and fracture.\u201d <em>See Hopkins v. </em>SAIF, 349 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Or 348, 351, 245 P3d 90 (2010) (\u201cTo establish a 'compensable injury,\u2019 the worker must prove that a work-related injury is a material contributing cause of a disability or need for treatment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">However, because the ALJ also found that claimant had preexisting arthritis, he considered the possible applicability of ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B), which specifies when \u201ccombined conditions\u201d are compensable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">\u201cIf an otherwise compensable injury combines at any time with a preexisting condition to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment, the combined condition is compensable only if, so long as and to the extent that the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">It is undisputed that claimant\u2019s arthritis is a \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d for purposes of ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B). It also is undisputed that claimant\u2019s AVN and navicular fracture had not been diagnosed or treated prior to claimant\u2019s work injury. Consequently, neither of those conditions is a \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d for purposes of that statute, even though they pre-dated claimant\u2019s injury. <em>See </em>ORS 656.005(24)(a) (defining \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The ALJ found, based on medical evidence in the record, that claimant\u2019s preexisting degenerative arthritis contributed to <em>some </em>degree to his disability and need for treatment. Therefore, the ALJ determined, claimant had a combined condition that consisted of \u201cthe preexisting arthritis and the injury.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ALJ then analyzed whether employer had met its burden of proving, under ORS 656.266(2)(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>that claimant\u2019s \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d was no longer the major contributing cause of his disability and need for treatment of the combined condition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finding no persuasive evidence that claimant\u2019s preexisting arthritis made a <em>significant </em>contribution to his disability and need for treatment \u2014 as compared to the contribution from the injury itself \u2014 the ALJ concluded that employer had not proved that the otherwise compensable injury no longer was the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s disability and need for treatment. Accordingly, the ALJ set aside employer\u2019s denial of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Employer sought review before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board, presenting a two-part argument. First, employer argued that claimant\u2019s AVN and navicular fracture <em>also </em>contributed to his combined condition, which did not comprise only arthritis and the work injury. Second, employer argued that the pertinent comparison, for purposes of the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d analysis, was between the work injury and <em>all </em>other contributors to claimant\u2019s disability and need for treatment, not just those contributors that qualified as \u201cpreexisting conditions.\u201d Thus, employer argued, the board should determine whether claimant\u2019s work injury remained the major contributing cause of his disability and need for treatment when compared to the contributions from both claimant\u2019s arthritis <em>and </em>his AVN and navicular fracture.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The board adopted the ALJ\u2019s factual findings but departed, somewhat, from his legal analysis. Like the ALJ, the board started from the premise that a combined condition has only two components: the \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d and a statutorily defined \u201cpreexisting condition.\u201d Unlike the ALJ, however, the board determined that the \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d in this case was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>the work injury itself; instead, the board stated, the AVN and navicular fracture each constituted an otherwise compensable injury. The board concluded that those otherwise compensable injuries combined with claimant\u2019s preexisting arthritis to form two combined conditions: (1) arthritis plus the AVN and (2) arthritis plus the navicular fracture. Applying the combined-condition analysis, the board concluded that employer h\u00e1d not met its burden of proving that the \u201cotherwise compensable injuries\u201d \u2014 as the board viewed it, the AVN and navicular fracture \u2014 no longer were the major contributing cause of those combined conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-4\">\u201cWith respect to the combined right foot navicular fracture and degenerative arthritis condition, the employer does not identify, nor have we located, medical evidence that would establish that the otherwise compensable navicular fracture is not the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s disability/need for treatment for the combined fracture/ arthritis condition. Likewise, we are unable to locate expert medical evidence establishing that the otherwise compensable [AVN] is not the major contributing cause of the combined necrosis/arthritis condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">On review before this court, employer acknowledges that the board correctly analyzed the claim as involving a combined condition, given the preexisting arthritic degeneration in claimant\u2019s injured foot. Employer also acknowledges that it had the burden of proving that claimant\u2019s otherwise compensable work injury no longer was the major contributing cause of his disability and need for treatment. Nonetheless, employer argues, the board erred by failing to consider <em>all </em>of the conditions that contributed to claimant\u2019s foot problem when it conducted the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d analysis, including those aspects of the AVN and navicular fracture that predated claimant\u2019s work injury (and, therefore, could not be considered part of the \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d). According to employer, the board should have compared the contribution of claimant\u2019s \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d to the contributions from claimant\u2019s arthritis, his AVN, <em>and </em>his navicular fracture to determine whether\u2014 absent those latter three contributions \u2014 the otherwise compensable injury remained the major contributing cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>the disability and need for treatment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In response, claimant urges us to adopt the board\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The parties\u2019 competing positions can be reduced to mathematical equations. Claimant contends \u2014 and the board ruled \u2014 that a \u201ccombined condition\u201d consists <em>only </em>of the \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d (OCI) and a statutory \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d (PEC) that combines with it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-5\">Combined condition = OCI + PEC</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Moreover, according to both claimant and the board, that equation governs the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d analysis. In other words, to determine whether \u201cthe otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition [,]\u201d ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B), one need compare only the contributions of the otherwise compensable injury and the preexisting condition to see which is greater<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">OCI &gt; PEC</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-8\">\n<em>or</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-9\">OCI &lt; PEC</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Employer disagrees. In its view, the combined condition also includes any other conditions that somehow contribute to the worker\u2019s identified medical problem, even though they do not qualify as preexisting conditions under ORS 656.005(24)(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-11\">Combined condition = OCI + PEC + other conditions</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">Accordingly, employer argues, those other conditions also figure into the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>OCI &gt; (PEC + other conditions)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APeH\">\n<em>or</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-4\">OCI &lt; (PEC + other conditions)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Employer contends that the board erred in this case because it did not consider the other <em>conditions </em>\u2014 i.e., claimant\u2019s pre-work-injury AVN and navicular fracture \u2014 when determining whether claimant\u2019s otherwise compensable injury remained the major contributing cause of his disability and need for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">We disagree. Our analysis begins with the text and context of ORS 656.005(7), which, albeit obliquely, defines the term \u201ccombined condition.\u201d <em>See State v. Bassett, </em>234 Or App 259, 265, 228 P3d 590, <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 461 (2010) (in construing a statute, \u201cwe examine the text and context of the statute, as well as any legislative history offered by the parties that, in the court\u2019s determination, is pertinent\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-7\">\u201c(7)(a) A \u2018compensable injury\u2019 is an accidental injury * * * arising out of and in the course of employment requiring medical services or resulting in disability or death * * * subject to the following limitations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-9\">\u201c(B) If an otherwise compensable injury combines at any time with a preexisting condition to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment, the combined condition is compensable only if, so long as and to the extent that the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Under that statute, a \u201ccombined condition\u201d is created when \u201can otherwise compensable injury\u201d combines \u201cwith a preexisting condition to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment.\u201d Nothing in the statute suggests that other conditions also may be part of the \u201ccombined condition.\u201d To the contrary, the statute embodies, in narrative form, the equation we have used to describe the board\u2019s position: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>combined condition = OCI + PEC. Certainly, subsection (7)(a)(B) of the statute could be more explicit on that point if, for example, it were divided into two sentences, like so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-4\">\u2022 If an otherwise compensable injury combines at any time with a preexisting condition to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment, the worker has a \u201ccombined condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-5\">\u2022 That \u201ccombined condition\u201d is compensable only if, so long as and to the extent that the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause, and so on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">We view ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) as nothing more (or less) than a consolidation of those two ideas. Thus, we agree with the board that a \u201c\u2018combined condition\u2019 consists of two components: (1) \u2018an otherwise compensable injury\u2019; and (2) a statutory \u2018preexisting condition.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The question remains whether only the \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d and the statutory \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d figure into the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d analysis. Under ORS 656.266(2)(a), once the worker has established the existence of an otherwise compensable injury, the employer has the burden of proving that the combined condition is, nevertheless, not compensable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-8\">\u201c(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, for the purpose of combined condition injury claims under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) only:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-9\">\u201c(a) Once the worker establishes an otherwise compensable injury, the employer shall bear the burden of proof to establish the otherwise compensable injury is not, or is no longer, the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">Significantly, the statute does not require an analysis, in some generalized sense, of what has caused the claimant to become disabled or need treatment. Rather, the statute more precisely requires identification of the major cause of the disability or need for treatment <em>of the combined condition, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>suggesting that the board should compare only the contributions of the component parts of the combined condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">That suggestion is confirmed by ORS 656.262(6)(c), which specifies that an employer\u2019s initial acceptance of a combined condition does not necessarily preclude the employer from later denying the combined condition \u201cif the otherwise compensable injury ceases to be the major contributing cause of the combined * * * condition.\u201d Interestingly, that statute does not exactly mirror ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) and ORS 656.266(2)(a), which are phrased in terms of whether the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause <em>of the disability or need for treatment </em>of the combined condition. Instead, ORS 656.262(6)(c) refers simply to whether the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the combined condition itself. Thus, the legislature appears to equate \u2014 at least for some purposes\u2014 the contributing causes of the disability or need for treatment of the combined condition with the contributing causes of the combined condition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">That equivalence confirms that the legislature intended the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d analysis to include only those contributing factors that make up the combined condition itself, i.e., the otherwise compensable injury and the statutory preexisting condition. Thus, the question posed by ORS 656.266(2)(a) is whether the employer has met its burden of proving that the otherwise compensable injury is no longer the major contributing cause as compared to any contribution from the preexisting condition. Other conditions that neither are encompassed within the \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d nor are statutory \u201cpreexisting conditions\u201d play no part in the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In arguing to the contrary, employer relies heavily on our decision in <em>Bowen v. Fred Meyer Stores, </em>202 Or App 558, 123 P3d 367 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 140 (2006). In that case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>we explained that \u201c[t]he universe of potential contributing causes for purposes of assessing the major contributing cause of a condition in the context of an occupational disease claim is <em>not </em>limited to \u2018preexisting conditions\u2019 as defined in ORS 656.005(24)(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563 (emphasis in original). Instead, we held, \u201cin determining the major contributing cause of a condition in the context of an occupational disease claim, the relative contribution of <em>all contributing causes </em>must be considered, and persuasive medical opinion must explain why a particular work exposure or injury contributes more to the claimed condition than all other causes or exposures combined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563-64 (emphasis in original). Here, employer argues that the <em>Bowen </em>holding \u201capplies equally to the major cause analysis for combined injury conditions specified in ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">We reject employer\u2019s contention that <em>Bowen </em>applies in the \u201ccombined condition\u201d context. Occupational disease claims \u2014 the type of claim at issue in <em>Bowen </em>\u2014 are governed in part by statutes that do not apply to industrial injury claims, including ORS 656.802. Under that statute, a worker who brings an occupational disease claim has the burden of proving \u201cthat employment conditions were the major contributing cause of the disease.\u201d ORS 656.802(2)(a). Unlike the statutes that define \u201ccombined conditions,\u201d which specify that they consist <em>only </em>of otherwise compensable injuries and statutory preexisting conditions (as explained above), ORS 656.802 (2)(a) does not limit the scope of conditions that may contribute to an occupational disease. It follows that, as we held in <em>Bowen, </em>all potentially contributing causes must be considered when determining whether employment conditions were the major contributing cause of an occupational disease. <em>See also Smothers v. Gresham Transfer, Inc., </em>332 Or 83, 133, 23 P3d 333 (2001) (announcing similar rule, also in the context of an occupational disease case). That holding does not apply, however, to a \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d analysis that is based on a different statute \u2014 like ORS 656.007(a)(B) \u2014 that <em>does </em>define and limit the components that make up the subject condition (here, a combined injury condition).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Employer also points to other combined-condition cases in which we have stated that \u201ceach cause\u201d or \u201call causes\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>must be considered in conducting the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d analysis. To the extent that our opinions in those cases could be read to suggest that conditions other than preexisting conditions or the \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d matter in that analysis, however, those statements were <em>dicta. </em>For example, in <em>Dietz v. Ramuda, </em>130 Or App 397, 882 P2d 618 (1994), <em>rev dismissed, </em>321 Or 416 (1995), the claimant suffered a heart attack after being exposed to smoke at work. He filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, which the employer denied. The board upheld that denial on the basis that the claimant had failed to prove that the exposure to smoke was the major contributing cause of his heart attack.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On judicial review, the claimant argued that, as a matter of law, the evidence allowed only one conclusion: that the smoke exposure precipitated his heart attack and, therefore, his work activities necessarily were the major contributing cause of that heart attack. <em>Id. </em>at 400-01. This court rejected claimant\u2019s argument, holding that, \u201calthough work activities that precipitate a claimant\u2019s injury or disease may be the major contributing cause, that is not necessarily always true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401. We continued: \u201cUnder ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B), the relative contribution of <em>each cause, </em>including the precipitating cause, must be evaluated under the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401-02 (emphasis added). But in <em>Dietz, </em>the only potential causes at issue were the work-related smoke exposure and the claimant\u2019s previously diagnosed coronary artery disease, which was a preexisting condition. Accordingly, our statement about \u201ceach cause\u201d referred only to the claimant\u2019s otherwise compensable injury and his preexisting condition; it is not a holding that <em>other </em>conditions also weigh into the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d analysis in industrial injury cases that involve combined conditions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Somewhat similarly, in <em>Bailey v. Reynolds Metals, </em>153 Or App 498, 504, 959 P2d 84, <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 432 (1998), we described the process for determining whether a work injury was the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d of the need for treatment of a combined condition as involving a comparison of the work injury to \u201cthe preexisting condition <em>and other nonwork-related </em>causes.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In <em>Bailey, </em>however, the issue before this court was whether \u201cthe provisions of ORS chapter 656 requiring different treatment of workers who have preexisting conditions violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits an employer from discriminating against an individual because of that person\u2019s disability.\u201dId. at 501-02 (citation omitted). The claimant argued that the ADA preempted ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) and ORS 656.005(24) (defining preexisting conditions) because those provisions required her to carry a greater burden of proof (\u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d) to obtain compensation than would be required of an industrial-injury claimant who lacked preexisting conditions. We rejected that argument, holding that the \u201cdifferent treatment of workers with preexisting conditions is a meaningful distinction based on reasonable factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504. Our statement that the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d analysis takes into account \u201cother nonwork-related causes\u201d was unnecessary to that holding. Indeed, no such other causes appear to have contributed to the <em>Bailey </em>claimant\u2019s combined condition. Because our statement about \u201cother nonwork-related causes\u201d in <em>Bailey </em>was <em>dictum </em>that was not expressly based on any statutory construction, it does not influence our interpretation of ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) or our view of the factors to be considered in the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d analysis in industrial-injury combined-condition cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">To recap: We conclude that a \u201ccombined condition,\u201d as defined in ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B), consists only of the \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d and any statutory preexisting conditions. That combined condition is compensable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>\u201conly if, so long as and to the extent that the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition\u201d as compared to the contributions from the preexisting conditions that are components of the combined condition. ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">That conclusion leads us to affirm the board\u2019s order. There may be some question in this case about what properly should be viewed as claimant\u2019s \u201cotherwise compensable injury.\u201d The ALJ and the board approached that aspect of the analysis differently; the ALJ determined that claimant\u2019s work injury itself was his \u201cotherwise compensable injury,\u201d but the board determined that claimant\u2019s \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d was his AVN and navicular fracture (presumably as they manifested post-injury). We need not address that issue, however, as employer does not assign error to the board\u2019s description of claimant\u2019s otherwise compensable injury. Rather, the only question before us is whether the board should have considered factors <em>other than </em>the \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d and preexisting condition of arthritis when it determined the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s combined condition. As we have explained, the board correctly declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-8\"> For purposes of initial industrial injury claims, the term \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d is defined to include \u201cany injury, disease, congenital abnormality, personality disorder or similar condition\u201d that meets three criteria: (1) the condition \u201ccontributes to disability or need for treatment,\u201d (2) except for claims in which the preexisting condition is arthritis or arthritic condition, \u201cthe worker has been diagnosed with such condition, or has obtained medical services for the symptoms of the condition,\u201d and (3) that diagnosis or treatment preceded the work injury. ORS 656.005(24)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b819-9\"> Earlier in the opinion and order, the ALJ had suggested that claimant might have combined conditions that consisted of the work injury, the arthritis, <em>and </em>the AVN and navicular fracture. Ultimately, however, the ALJ determined that the combined condition did not include the AVN or the fracture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b820-6\"> ORS 656.266(2)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-7\">\u201cNotwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, for the purpose of combined condition injury claims under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) only:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-8\">\u201c(a) Once the worker establishes an otherwise compensable injury, the employer shall bear the burden of proof to establish the otherwise compensable injury is not, or is no longer, the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b822-13\"> Employer also argues that the board erred by interpreting \u201cthe phrase \u2018arthritis or arthritic conditions\u2019 in ORS 656.005(24)(a)\u201d \u2014 the definition of \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d for purposes of industrial injuries \u2014 \u2019\u2019too narrowly.\u201d According to employer, the AVN and navicular fracture themselves qualified as arthritic conditions under that statute. We reject that argument without further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b822-14\"> This case does not require us to address whether an \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d can be the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d of a combined condition if its contribution to the combined condition is equal to the contribution from a preexisting condition, so we decline to reflect that theoretical circumstance in our equations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b823-11\"> The parties have not offered any legislative history for our consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b825-7\"> We acknowledge that, as a matter of medical fact, the major contributing cause of a need for treatment of a combined condition may not always be the same as the major contributing cause of the combined condition itself. <em>See SAIF v. Nehl, </em>149 Or App 309, 313, 942 P2d 859 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>326 Or 389 (1998) (drawing that distinction). But the legislature\u2019s use of both those phrases in the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d statutes helps demonstrate that \u2014 for purposes of determining what <em>is </em>the combined condition and what \u201ccounts\u201d in determining its major contributing cause \u2014 only the component parts of the combined condition itself, <em>i.e., </em>the otherwise compensable injury and the preexisting condition, matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b827-4\"> Under the statutes then in effect, the claimant had the burden of proving the compensability of his claim. <em>See </em>ORS 656.266 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b827-5\"> Our opinion in <em>Allied Waste Industries, Inc. v. Crawford, </em>203 Or App 512, 125 P3d 794 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 80 (2006), includes similar <em>dictum., </em>stating unnecessarily (and incorrectly) that, \u201cto establish that a work injury is the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of a combined condition, the evidence must demonstrate that the work injury contributed more to the disability or need for treatment than did <em>all other nonwork related causes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The Supreme Court has made a similar error, again in <em>dictum. See Schuler v. Beaverton School District No. 48J, </em>334 Or 290, 296-97, 48 P3d 820 (2002) (stating, in a case involving only a work injury and a preexisting condition, that, \u201c[t]o <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>show that an \u2018otherwise compensable injury is * * the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition,\u2019 a claimant must show that the otherwise compensable injury contributed more to the need for treatment than all other causes combined\u201d (ellipses in original)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
