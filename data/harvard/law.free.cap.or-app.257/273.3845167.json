The trial court imposed a 30-year minimum sentence without the possibility of parole or work release and a 20-year minimum period before petitioner could seek parole review. He now seeks review of a decision by the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision (the board) denying his request to change the terms of his confinement to a 30-year term. The board concluded that petitioner failed to carry his burden of proving that he was likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable period of time. Petitioner contends that he provided sufficient evidence that he was capable of rehabilitation in a short period of time and, therefore, the board\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. In addition, petitioner contends that the board failed to provide substantial reasoning for its conclusions. In our review under ORS 183.482(8)(c), we conclude that the board\u2019s final order is supported by substantial evidence and substantial reason. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">In 1987, petitioner was drinking at a tavern. Petitioner recounted that, after several patrons left the bar, he engaged in an argument with the victim, the bartender, about whether petitioner also had to leave. Petitioner then followed the victim behind the bar, the victim kicked petitioner in the leg, and, in response, petitioner stabbed the victim with a pair of scissors. After stabbing the victim, petitioner then took money from the register and left the tavern. The victim later died from a stab wound to the heart. According to petitioner, he turned himself in to the police but initially denied committing the murder, blaming the stabbing on an unnamed accomplice. Petitioner later entered a guilty plea and was convicted of one count of aggravated murder. At the time of the murder, petitioner was 33 years old and was on parole in California for robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In 2009, the board held a murder review hearing as to petitioner\u2019s sentence. The sole issue at the hearing, pursuant to ORS 163.105 (2), was whether petitioner was likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The board considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>material related to his crimes, court documents, and records from the Oregon Department of Corrections. At the time of his conviction, petitioner had a juvenile and an adult criminal record in California over a period of 18 years for several theft, robbery, assault, and burglary offenses, some of which he had committed during periods of probation or parole. While incarcerated, petitioner received at least eight disciplinary reports for the following misconduct: \u201cAssault IV\u201d \u201cDisobedience I,\u201d \u201cContraband III,\u201d \u201cAssault III,\u201d \u201cDisobedience II,\u201d \u201cDisrespect I,\u201d and \u201cForgery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">According to petitioner, he received certificates in a number of treatment, educational, and vocational programs: Cognitive Self-Change I and II, Breaking Barriers, Journeyman Upholstery, Alcoholics Anonymous, Freedom Road, and Lifers Speaking Panel. Petitioner admitted to having a drug and alcohol problem in the past, but he no longer participated in Alcoholics Anonymous. Petitioner also has been employed in various positions throughout his 20 years of confinement, but he rarely made any deposits of his earnings .in his inmate account.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">At the hearing, Carol Dixon, petitioner\u2019s wife, testified as to her relationship with petitioner. She explained that she had met petitioner while he was incarcerated and married him in 2003. When asked about their relationship, she explained that they have a lot in common, including their faith in God. She requested that the board release petitioner on parole, partly, because she is physically disabled and, consequently, needs his assistance \u201cto get around.\u201d When asked by the board whether petitioner has the ability to be rehabilitated, she explained that petitioner does have the ability to be rehabilitated because of the support he receives from his family and his faith. She stated that, if petitioner were released, she would financially support him and is able to do so because she currently works two jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Petitioner also testified at the hearing. The board asked petitioner to explain the sequence of events that led to his conviction. In response, petitioner explained that, on the night of the murder, he was drinking at a tavern when the bartender, the victim, told him to leave, which led to an argument between the two of them. Petitioner stated that as the victim walked away, in his \u201cparanoid state,\u201d he followed the victim behind the bar and stabbed him with a pair of scissors. Despite a statement in the Parole Analyst Report (PAR) that the victim\u2019s ring was stolen, petitioner denied stealing the victim\u2019s ring before leaving the bar. He admitted that he had fabricated the allegation that an unnamed accomplice committed the murder, but he explained that his attorney advised him to do so. When asked by the board to explain why petitioner followed the victim instead of leaving the bar, he responded by stating, \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t like myself.\u201d And when asked why petitioner could not have used some lesser degree of force to defend himself, he responded that he was a different person back then and that he could not explain what he felt at the time because he was under the influence of alcohol and rage and was not thinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\">Petitioner then described to the board his plan upon release. Petitioner stated that he intends to reside with his wife at her home in Idaho and would like to counsel or mentor at-risk youth. He also explained that he has secured employment at a barbershop owned by Niehoff, his wife\u2019s good friend. The board asked several questions related to the financial dynamic between petitioner and his wife, namely, why his wife had deposited approximately $1,700 in his inmate account in 2007. In response, petitioner explained that he had not asked for the money from his wife, and she had gifted the money to him. And, in response to the board\u2019s concern that his wife worked two jobs even though she had some physical disability, petitioner stated that \u201cshe work[s] two jobs because she want[s] to. Now, if she don\u2019t want to she don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The board also heard testimony in support of petitioner\u2019s release from petitioner\u2019s sisters; Hughes, Carol Dixon\u2019s daughter from another marriage; Niehoff; and Pastor Ross, Carol Dixon\u2019s pastor. In addition, the board received written statements of support for petitioner from individuals, some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>of whom also testified at the hearing, including one from a member of the Ohio Justice Commission and one from a friend of petitioner. In general, those individuals described petitioner as a changed person due to his committed Christian faith and his wife\u2019s support.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In its final order, the board concluded that petitioner failed to meet his burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable time. Relying on OAR 255-032-0020, which outlines criteria for the board to use in determining whether petitioner is likely to be rehabilitated, the board\u2019s ultimate conclusion was based on findings related to his employment history; his maturity, stability, and demonstrated responsibility; his prior criminal history; his conduct during periods of probation or parole; his mental or emotional disturbance, deficiency, condition, or disorder; his parole plan; and the likelihood that he would conform to the conditions of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The board found that petitioner lacked maturity, stability, and demonstrated responsibility that would promote his conformity to a law-abiding life based on four facts. First, the board found that petitioner\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with statements in the PAR. Despite a statement in the PAR to the contrary, petitioner denied stealing the victim\u2019s ring and claimed that he only stole money from the cash register.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, the board found that petitioner\u2019s testimony at the hearing demonstrated \u201cminimal ability or willingness to reflect on his crime\u201d and minimization of his crime. Third, the board was troubled by petitioner\u2019s 18-year history of robberies, armed robberies, assault with a deadly weapon, and other crimes, some of which occurred during periods of parole and probation. For the board, that history demonstrated \u201cextremely poor performance while on probation and parole\u201d and indicated that, even at the age of 33 when he murdered the victim, and despite numerous incarcerations, petitioner was incapable of foreseeing the serious consequences of his conduct. Lastly, the board found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>that the financial dynamic between petitioner and his wife showed that he lacked \u201cmotivation, maturity, or a sense of responsibility,\u201d which would be needed for him to succeed during supervision. The board also viewed his responses to the board\u2019s questions regarding his wife\u2019s employment and financial support as demonstrating \u201ca strong sense of selfishness and self-centeredness\u201d and that he lacked \u201cempathy for his wife\u2019s efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\">The board also found that the testimony of Pastor Ross, Hughes, and Neihoff regarding whether petitioner would likely be rehabilitated was not persuasive. The board accorded little weight to those witnesses\u2019 testimony because they \u201chad little direct contact with [petitioner] and appear to base their beliefs regarding [his] rehabilitative capacity on their affection for [Carol] Dixon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Petitioner timely sought administrative review by the board. In his review request, petitioner alleged that the board\u2019s \u201cfindings and conclusions are not based upon consideration of the whole record and as supported by[,] and in accordance with, reliable, probative and substantial evidence.\u201d The board granted petitioner\u2019s request for administrative review but denied petitioner\u2019s request for relief. In its order, the board explained that, having considered all the evidence in the record, it adhered to the findings and conclusions in its final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">On judicial review, petitioner renews his arguments that the board\u2019s findings of fact lacked substantial evidence. In addition, petitioner argues that the board\u2019s conclusions are not supported by substantial reason. For the following reasons, we conclude that the board\u2019s order is supported by both substantial evidence and substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">On substantial evidence review, we must determine whether a reasonable person could make the findings that the board made, ORS 183.482(8)(c), and we do not substitute our own view of the evidence for the board\u2019s view of the evidence. <em>See </em>ORS 183.482(8)(c) (\u201cSubstantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>Murphy v. Board of Parole, </em>241 Or App 177, 183, 250 P3d 13, <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 571 (2011). Under ORS 163.105(2)(a), petitioner has the burden to prove that he was capable of rehabilitation. Thus, we examine the record to determine if there was substantial evidence for a reasonable person to conclude that petitioner did not meet his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Petitioner argues that he provided more than enough evidence to prove that he is likely to be rehabilitated as required by ORS 163.105(2)(a). For purposes of parole, the board determines whether an inmate is likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable time by considering the criteria set out in OAR 255-032-0020:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">\u201c(1) The inmate\u2019s involvement in correctional treatment, medical care, educational, vocational or other training in the institution which will substantially enhance his/ her capacity to lead a law-abiding life when released;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201c(2) The inmate\u2019s institutional employment history;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201c(3) The inmate\u2019s institutional disciplinary conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">\u201c(4) The inmate\u2019s maturity, stability, demonstrated responsibility, and any apparent development in the inmate personality which may promote or hinder conformity to law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">\u201c(5) The inmate\u2019s past use of narcotics or other dangerous drugs, or past habitual and excessive use of alcoholic liquor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-10\">\u201c(6) The inmate\u2019s prior criminal history, including the nature and circumstances of previous offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-11\">\u201c(7) The inmate\u2019s conduct during any previous period of probation or parole;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-12\">\u201c(8) The inmate does/does not have a mental or emotional disturbance, deficiency, condition or disorder predisposing them [sic] to the commission of a crime to a degree rendering them [sic] a danger to the health and safety of the community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-13\">\u201c(9) The adequacy of the inmate\u2019s parole plan including community support from family, friends, treatment providers, and others in the community; type of residence, neighborhood or community in which the inmate plans to live;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>\u201c(10) There is a reasonable probability that the inmate will remain in the community without violating the law, and there is substantial likelihood that the inmate will conform to the conditions of parole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-3\">Petitioner\u2019s challenge addresses each criterion set out in OAR 255-032-0020. In contending that he has met his burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is likely to be rehabilitated, he asserts that his testimony and testimony of other witnesses in support of his release deserved more weight than was given by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The board, however, contends that petitioner\u2019s argument does not provide a basis to reverse its final order. According to the board, petitioner has failed to argue that a \u201creasonable person\u201d could not make the same finding as the board made, but rather incorrectly focuses his argument on whether there was ample \u201cunrebuttable\u201d evidence to justify ruling in his favor as to each criterion in OAR 255-032-0020.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Weems/Roberts v. Board of Parole, </em>347 Or 586, 602-03, 227 P3d 671 (2010) (\u201cThe fact that a reasonable person could also draw a contrary inference, or that reasonable persons might differ in their assessment of the strength of the inference * * * does not mean that the board\u2019s implicit finding in that regard is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d). The board argues that petitioner is, essentially, requesting that this court reweigh the evidence, which is impermissible given our standard of review. <em>See Murphy, </em>241 Or App at 184 (\u201c\u2018[Substantial evidence review does not entail or permit the reviewing tribunal to reweigh or to assess the credibility of the evidence that was presented to the factfinding body.\u2019\u201d (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted; brackets in original.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We agree with the board that the issue is not, as petitioner frames it, whether petitioner provided more than enough evidence to support a conclusion that he had proved that he was likely to be rehabilitated. Rather, the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>inquiry is whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the board\u2019s contrary conclusion that petitioner did not carry his burden to prove that he was likely to be rehabilitated. The board\u2019s ultimate conclusion was primarily based on its findings related to petitioner\u2019s criminal and parole history and his maturity, stability, and responsibility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We address the evidence as to each of those findings in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Regarding petitioner\u2019s criminal history and conduct on parole, criteria in OAR 255-032-0020(6) and (7), the board had evidence that, over a period of 18 years before he murdered the victim and robbed the victim and the bar, petitioner had engaged in a pattern of committing theft, robbery, armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and burglary offenses, some of which he had committed during periods of probation or parole. The board found that, at the time of the murder, petitioner was unable to foresee the consequences of his criminal conduct, despite his multiple incarcerations, and his criminal record was \u201cpersuasive evidence\u201d that he was not capable of rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Petitioner acknowledges that he has a significant criminal history. He argues, however, that his criminal history should not weigh heavily against a finding that he is capable of rehabilitation because those convictions occurred more than 20 years ago and preceded the positive changes he has made since his confinement: his vocational training, his involvement with the church, and his lack of recent disciplinary reports.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>We reject petitioner\u2019s argument that evidence of his criminal history cannot be \u201cpersuasive\u201d because his unlawful conduct occurred 20 years ago. In 1985, the board promulgated OAR 255-032-0020, which included both a petitioner\u2019s criminal history and conduct during periods of parole or probation as factors in determining whether the petitioner is likely to be rehabilitated, even though the petitioner\u2019s criminal conduct would have occurred at least 20 years before the parole review hearing. <em>See </em>ORS 163.105(2) (1985), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 1987, ch 158, \u00a7 23 (providing that a defendant convicted of aggravated murder is not eligible for a parole review hearing until the petitioner completes a 20-year minimum period of confinement). Because the review of a petitioner\u2019s criminal history and conduct during periods of parole will always involve conduct at least 20 years old in light of the 20-year minimum-term requirement before a review, we conclude that the board was permitted to assess the import of petitioner\u2019s history of criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\">We also disagree with petitioner\u2019s contention that, because, in his view, he had made some positive personality changes during his confinement, the board\u2019s findings regarding the import of his criminal history are not supported by substantial evidence. Again, according to our standard of review, we must determine whether a reasonable person <em>could </em>make the same finding that the board made. In its order, the board expressly found that petitioner lacked \u201cmaturity, stability, demonstrated responsibility, and character development that would promote his conformity to a law-abiding life,\u201d factors in OAR 255-032-0020(4). Because those findings are supported by substantial evidence, as we next discuss, we reject petitioner\u2019s argument. As a result, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the board findings related to OAR 255-032-0020(6) and (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">As noted, the board explained that its findings regarding OAR 255-032-0020(4) were based on evidence of (1) inconsistencies between petitioner\u2019s testimony and the information contained in the PAR; (2) petitioner\u2019s inability or unwillingness to reflect on his crime and his minimization of his crime during his testimony; (3) petitioner\u2019s criminal history; and (4) petitioner\u2019s lack of financial responsibility. Petitioner challenges all four bases in support of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>board\u2019s finding that he lacked maturity, stability, or demonstrated responsibility that would promote his conformity to a law-abiding life.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Petitioner first challenges the board\u2019s finding that he lacked maturity or responsibility based on its determination that he had only minimal ability or willingness to reflect on his crime and was minimizing his crime. According to petitioner, he adequately recounted the events that led to the murder and took full responsibility for his conduct. When asked to explain why he stabbed the victim, petitioner explained that he had stabbed the victim because he \u201cwasn\u2019t thinking\u201d and instead acted under the influence of alcohol and rage. He contends that his inability to \u201cjustify\u201d the crime was therefore reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">After a review of the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s finding that petitioner minimized his crime. A reasonable factfinder could conclude on this record that what prompted petitioner to engage the victim, a stranger to petitioner, was petitioner\u2019s intent to rob the bar, and when the victim resisted, he murdered the victim. The board repeatedly asked petitioner to explain why his argument with the victim escalated to his use of deadly force, instead of his use of some lesser degree of force, and, in response, petitioner stated that he could not describe what he felt at the time. Although petitioner was apologetic and took full responsibility for his conduct, and repeatedly stated that he was now a changed man, a reasonable person could find \u2014 based on his pattern of robbery, his actual robbery of the bar and, it appears, the victim as well, and his inability or unwillingness to explain the reasons why he murdered the victim, other than alcohol and anger \u2014 that petitioner was unwilling or unable to reflect on his crime and to acknowledge its genesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Petitioner next challenges the board\u2019s finding that he lacked maturity or responsibility based on his financial dynamic with his wife. Petitioner argues that the board unreasonably found that he lacked maturity or financial responsibility based on evidence that his wife deposited $ 1,700 into his inmate account in 2007. According to petitioner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>he explained to the board that he did not need the $1,700 and that his wife merely gave the money to him. And because the board did not expressly ask him whether he was grateful for her gifts, petitioner argues that the record does not support the board\u2019s other finding that he lacked \u201cempathy for his wife\u2019s efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\">Petitioner does not dispute that he made few deposits of his own earnings into his inmate account. Although petitioner testified that he did not request that his wife give him money, petitioner relied on contributions from his wife, who worked two jobs even though she has health problems. And when the board asked petitioner whether it was fair for his wife to work two jobs, considering her health issues, he stated that she works two jobs \u201cbecause she want[s] to.\u201d Regardless of whether petitioner asked his wife for the money, we conclude that it was reasonable for the board to infer that petitioner lacked financial responsibility because he depended on his wife\u2019s contributions rather than saving his own earnings and that petitioner lacked maturity in light of his answers. As a result, the board\u2019s finding that petitioner lacked maturity, stability, and financial responsibility is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we conclude that the board did not err in determining that petitioner failed to carry his burden that he was likely to be rehabilitated in a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">We now turn to whether the board\u2019s ultimate conclusion is supported by substantial reason. We first address whether the board is required to provide an explanation of its reasoning in its order. According to petitioner, the great weight of the evidence in the record conflicts with the board\u2019s ultimate conclusion, which, in his view, is not sufficiently explained. Petitioner relies, <em>inter alia, </em>on <em>Castro v. Board of Parole, </em>232 Or App 75, 220 P3d 772 (2009), for the proposition that the board\u2019s orders must be supported by substantial reason. In response, the board contends that the \u201csubstantial reason\u201d requirement in <em>Castro </em>does not apply to this case. The board distinguishes <em>Castro </em>by noting that the board\u2019s order in that case was governed by ORS 144.335(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>In <em>Castro, </em>the court concluded that ORS 144.335(3) and, in turn, ORS 183.482(8)(c) require that the board include in its orders an explanation of its reasoning sufficient to allow appellate review. 232 Or App at 82-85. The board points out that its order was made pursuant to ORS 163.105, not ORS 144.335(3), and, therefore, that <em>Castro </em>is inapplicable. Although we agree with the board that ORS 144.335(3) is not at issue, the board overlooks that ORS 163.105, the governing statute, requires that the board\u2019s orders be supported by substantial reason.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">In relevant part, ORS 163.105 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of ORS chapter 144 and ORS 421.450 to 421.490:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\u201c(5) The board\u2019s final order shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law. The findings of fact shall consist of a concise statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings as to each contested issue of fact and as to each ultimate fact required to support the board\u2019s order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Thus, the requirements of ORS 163.105(5) apply to the board\u2019s order, \u201c[njotwithstanding the provisions of ORS chapter 144.\u201d <em>See State v. Milburn, </em>205 Or App 205, 214, 134 P3d 969 (2006) (noting that the function of a \u201cnotwithstanding clause\u201d is to indicate an exemption from the enumerated provisions to which the clause refers). Stated differently, for parole consideration in aggravated murder cases, the requirements of ORS 163.105(5) control instead of those in ORS 144.335(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The statutory language in ORS 163.105(5) is nearly identical to the language found in ORS 183.470(2), a provision of the Oregon Administrative Procedures Act that generally requires final agency orders to include findings of fact and conclusions of law and to articulate a rational connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>between the two.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Drew v. PSRB, </em>322 Or 491, 500, 909 P2d 1211 (1996) (\u201c[A]gencies also are required to demonstrate in their opinions the <em>reasoning </em>that leads the agency from the <em>facts </em>that it has found to the <em>conclusions </em>that it draws from those facts.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)). We conclude that ORS 163.105(5) similarly requires that the board\u2019s orders be supported by substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\">Before we review whether the order in this case comported with the requirements of ORS 163.105(5), we pause to address the board\u2019s contention that we should not review petitioner\u2019s argument that the order lacks substantial reason, because he did not assert it below. <em>See Ayres v. Board of Parole, </em>194 Or App 429, 435-36, 97 P3d 1 (2004) (noting that a \u201cparty must present the particular challenges it intends to raise on judicial review first to the administrative body whose review must be exhausted\u201d). According to the board, petitioner\u2019s administrative review request stated only that he had exceeded the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable time, not that the board\u2019s order lacked substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">We conclude that petitioner properly raised his substantial reason argument. In his administrative review request, petitioner contended that the board\u2019s <em>findings </em>and <em>conclusions </em>were not based upon consideration of the whole record. That challenge implicitly includes a substantial reason argument. \u201cWhere a petitioner argues that an order is not supported by substantial evidence, a court will also review the order for substantial reason to ensure that the order articulates the reasoning that leads from the facts found to the conclusions drawn.\u201d <em>Salosha, Inc. v. Lane County, </em>201 Or App 138, 143, 117 P3d 1047 (2005); <em>see Simpson v. Board of Parole, </em>237 Or App 661, 663, 241 P3d 347 (2010) (holding that the standard of review in ORS 183.482(8)(c) for substantial evidence in the record also requires that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>board\u2019s conclusions \u201cbe supported by substantial reason, <em>i.e., </em>its conclusions must reasonably follow from the facts found\u201d); <em>accord Drew, </em>322 Or at 499-500 (following \u201ca long and consistent line of decisions from the Court of Appeals\u201d and holding that, \u201cin addition to the statutory requirement that findings be supported by substantial evidence, agencies also are required to demonstrate in their opinions the reasoning that leads the agency from the facts that it has found to the conclusions that it draws from those facts\u201d (emphasis omitted)). Because petitioner in his administrative review request contended that the board\u2019s conclusions were not supported by the record, he adequately asserted his substantial reason argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">We now address whether the board\u2019s ultimate conclusion is supported by substantial reason. Petitioner contends that two of the board\u2019s conclusions lack substantial reason: (1) that petitioner lacked maturity, stability, and responsibility; and (2) that petitioner\u2019s employment record was \u201cundermine [d]\u201d by his wife\u2019s financial contributions to his inmate account.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In response, the board argues that its order \u201cconnected the dots between petitioner\u2019s evidence and the criteria\u201d set out in OAR 255-032-0020 to determine whether petitioner was likely to be rehabilitated. We agree with the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The board\u2019s ultimate conclusion is supported by substantial reason. This is not a case where the board failed to provide sufficient detail or explanation in support of its conclusions sufficient for appellate review. <em>Cf. Castro, </em>232 Or App at 85-86 (holding that the board stated a mere conclusion \u2014 \u201c\u2018[biased on the doctor\u2019s report and diagnosis, coupled with all the information that the board is considering,\u2019 it is reasonably probable that petitioner would violate his parole or a law\u201d \u2014 and did not provide an adequate explanation sufficient for judicial review). Here, for each of its findings, the board identified the particular facts and the particular criteria on which it relied in support of its conclusion that petitioner did not meet his burden of proving that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>was capable of being rehabilitated. Nor do we consider this case to be one where the evidence weighs overwhelmingly in petitioner\u2019s favor. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 84 (noting that substantial reason does not exist when the \u201c\u2018credible evidence apparently weighs overwhelmingly in favor of one finding\u2019\u201d and the board makes another finding without providing an explanation). As such, the board\u2019s order is adequately supported by substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\"> Under ORS 163.105(2) (1987), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 1989, ch 720, \u00a7 1,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">\u201c[a]t any time after 20 years from the date of imposition of a minimum period of confinement pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Board of Parole, upon the petition of a prisoner so confined, shall hold a hearing to determine if the prisoner is likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable period of time.

According to petitioner, his criminal history is a separate criterion and cannot also support a finding that he lacked maturity, stability, and responsibility. In addition, he asserts that, because OAR 255-032-0020(4) is written in the present tense, the board cannot rely on conduct that occurred over 20 years ago to support a finding that, at the time of the hearing, he lacked maturity or responsibility. We conclude that the text of OAR 255-032-0020(4) does not preclude the board from considering petitioner\u2019s past conduct, including his criminal history, along with other evidence, to infer that he is presently immature or irresponsible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\"> In its brief, the board incorrectly asserts that its order was governed by ORS 163.115(f), which provides the requirements for murder review hearings. However, in its order, the board stated that the review hearing was conducted pursuant to ORS 163.105. We agree with the board\u2019s order that ORS 163.105 governed petitioner\u2019s review hearing because he was convicted of aggravated murder, not murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b308-5\"> Under ORS 183.470(2),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">\u201cA final order shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law.
