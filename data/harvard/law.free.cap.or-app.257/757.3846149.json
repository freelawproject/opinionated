He argues that the trial court plainly erred in failing to merge the guilty verdicts on those counts into a single conviction for second-degree assault. Defendant\u2019s two convictions were based on ORS 163.175(1)(a), which provides that a person commits second-degree assault if the person \u201c[intentionally or knowingly causes serious physical injury to another[,]\u201d and ORS 163.175(1)(b), which provides that the crime is committed if the person \u201c[intentionally or knowingly causes physical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon [.]\u201d He argues that the counts should have merged because, similarly to ORS 164.405, which defines a single crime of second-degree robbery, <em>see State v. White, </em>346 Or 275, 211 P3d 248 (2009) (so concluding), the text, context, and legislative history of ORS 163.175 reflects that the legislature intended to create a single crime of second-degree assault, and, therefore, ORS 163.175(1)(a) and (b) are not separate statutory provisions for purposes of the merger statute. <em>See </em>ORS 161.067(1) (\u201cWhen the same conduct or criminal episode violates two or more statutory provisions and each provision requires proof of an element that the others do not, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are separate statutory violations.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The state concedes that ORS 163.175(1)(a) and (b) are the same statutory provision for purposes of ORS 161.067(1) and, therefore, merger was required. Consistently with the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>White, </em>we agree with and accept the state\u2019s concession. We also agree with defendant and the state that the error was \u201capparent on the record,\u201d ORAP 5.45(1), and, for the reasons expressed in <em>State v. Ryder, </em>230 Or App 432, 435, 216 P3d 895 (2009), we exercise our discretion to correct it. <em>See also State v. Hathaway, </em>207 Or App 716, 717, 143 P3d 545, <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 254 (2006) (noting that both the Supreme Court and this court have consistently exercised discretion to address plainly erroneous failures to merge convictions). Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>reverse and remand for entry of a single judgment of conviction for second-degree assault and for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">Convictions on Counts 1 and 2 reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a single conviction for second-degree assault and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-6\"> The other provisions of ORS 161.067 are also inapplicable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
