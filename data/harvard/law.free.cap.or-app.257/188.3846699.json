We further conclude that we are unable to review the reasonableness of the board\u2019s award of penalty-related attorney fees of $1,500 under ORS 656.262(11), because the board did not explain why it awarded less than $8,325, the amount that claimant requested. Finally, we affirm the board\u2019s ruling that claimant is not entitled to attorney fees under ORS 656.382(1) for services at the hearing and board levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Claimant suffered a compensable occupational disease. Employer issued a notice of closure awarding claimant 54 percent scheduled permanent partial disability (PPD) for each hand. Claimant requested reconsideration, and an order on reconsideration increased the award of PPD to 82 percent for each hand. On July 25,2006, before the order had become final, claimant waived his right to appeal the order and sought a lump sum payment of the award pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>to ORS 656.230(1) (2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Claimant requested the lump sum payment by transmitting a form to employer as provided in OAR 436-060-0060 (2006).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Employer had 14 days to respond to claimant\u2019s request for lump sum payment. Employer did not respond by either paying the benefits or presenting the matter to the director within 14 days, as provided in ORS 656.230(1) and OAR 436-060-0060 (2006). Claimant filed a request for hearing on August 22, 2006, and employer paid the lump sum award in full eight days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Claimant continued to pursue the hearing and sought a determination that employer had unreasonably delayed payment of compensation and that, as a result, claimant was entitled to a penalty and attorney fees, pursuant to ORS 656.262(11)(a) and ORS 656.382(1). The ALJ and the board rejected claimant\u2019s contention, concluding that, because the order on reconsideration had not yet become final at the time of claimant\u2019s request for a lump sum payment, and because <em>employer </em>had not waived <em>its </em>right to appeal the award, ORS 656.230(1) and OAR 436-060-0060 (2006) did not require employer to respond within 14 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>In <em>Cayton v. Safelite Glass Corp., </em>231 Or App 644, 220 P3d 1190 (2009), we reversed the board. We rejected the board\u2019s and the employer\u2019s interpretation of ORS 656.230(1) and OAR 436-060-0060 (2006), and held that an employer\u2019s obligation to process a request for lump sum payment under ORS 656.230(1) is triggered either when the appeal period expires or when the <em>claimant </em>waives the right to appeal the order on reconsideration, and that an employer\u2019s obligation to process the lump sum payment request does not also depend on the employer\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal the order. We reasoned that the statute\u2019s reference to a waiver of the right to appeal the \u201cadequacy\u201d of the award logically applies to a claimant, because only a claimant would complain that an award is inadequate. <em>Id. </em>at 650-51. In view of our conclusion that ORS 656.230(1) and OAR 436-060-0060 (2006) were applicable and that, under those provisions, employer was required to respond to claimant\u2019s request within 14 days, we remanded the case to the board for reconsideration of claimant\u2019s request for the assessment of penalties and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Before this court, claimant sought attorney fees for having prevailed on judicial review. We held, by unpublished order, that claimant had prevailed on appeal. We made a conditional award of $8,236.25 in appellate attorney fees for services on review. We stated, further, that, if claimant finally prevailed on remand through a determination that employer acted unreasonably in resisting payment of compensation, \u201cORS 656.388 allows him to request attorney fees for services before every prior forum, as authorized by ORS 656.382.\u201d We conditioned the actual award of attorney fees for services on review on the ultimate outcome of the case on remand. ORAP 13.10(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">\u201cIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that claimant is awarded costs and disbursements in the amount of $448.33 and, contingent on the outcome of the remand, is entitled to an award of appellate attorney fees in the amount of $8,236.25.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>On remand, the board reconsidered whether employer\u2019s conduct gave rise to a penalty under ORS 656.262(11)(a). A claimant is entitled to a penalty under ORS 656.262(11)(a) \u201c[i]f the insurer or self-insured employer unreasonably delays or unreasonably refuses to pay compensation.\u201d In addressing that question, the board cited the correct legal standard as set forth in our case law \u2014 that is, whether, when it failed to make the payment, employer had a legitimate doubt as to its liability. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Argonaut Insurance Company, </em>93 Or App 588, 591, 763 P2d 408 (1988) (applying that standard to attorney fee awards under what is now ORS 656.262(11) and under ORS 656.382(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The board rejected claimant\u2019s contention that employer had unreasonably <em>refused </em>to pay claimant\u2019s award in a lump sum. The board reasoned that, before this court\u2019s prior opinion in this case, <em>Cayton, </em>231 Or App at 650 (holding that the provision in ORS 656.230(1) for a waiver of the right to appeal the adequacy of the award does not apply to employers), employer had a legitimate doubt as to its obligation to make tbe lump sum payment before the 30-day appeal period had expired under ORS 656.268(6)(g). Thus, the board concluded, employer\u2019s <em>refusal </em>to make the lump sum award within 14 days of claimant\u2019s request was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The board concluded, however, that employer\u2019s failure, within 14 days of claimant\u2019s request, to either submit claimant\u2019s lump sum application to the director or to pay the lump sum was an unreasonable <em>delay </em>in the payment of compensation, ORS 656.262(11), reasoning that employer could have had no legitimate doubt that, if it disagreed with claimant\u2019s request, employer was required to refer claimant\u2019s request for lump sum payment to the director by August 8, 2006, within 14 days of claimant\u2019s request, as required by ORS 656.230(1). Employer never referred tbe matter to the director. Instead, employer waited until August 30, eight days after claimant filed the request for hearing, to pay the full amount of claimant\u2019s award. For employer\u2019s unreasonable conduct in failing to act, the board assessed a penalty under ORS 656.262(11) equal to 10 percent of the \u201camounts then due\u201d at the time of the unreasonable conduct, claimant\u2019s unpaid award as of August 8, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ORS 656.262(11) provides that when an employer unreasonably refuses to pay or <em>delays </em>payment of compensation, the worker is entitled to a penalty \u201cplus any attorney fees assessed under this section.\u201d In addition to the penalty, the board, on remand, concluded that claimant\u2019s attorney was entitled to a penalty-related attorney fee of $1,500, to be paid by employer. The board relied on OAR 438-015-0110(1) and (2), which required the board to consider the benefit to claimant, the result achieved, and the time devoted by claimant\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Claimant\u2019s attorney sought reconsideration of the board\u2019s order on remand, requesting additional attorney fees as had been ordered by this court, and additional attorney fees under ORS 656.382(1) and ORS 656.388(1), for services provided at the hearing level and before the board on review and on remand. As support, claimant submitted to the board this court\u2019s order awarding attorney fees on appeal contingent on the outcome of the case on remand, and specifically cited this court\u2019s statement that, if claimant finally prevailed on remand, ORS 656.388(1) \u201callows him the request attorney fees for services provided before every prior forum as authorized by ORS 656.382.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The board rejected claimant\u2019s contention that he was entitled to an award of attorney fees above $1,500. Emphasizing the phrase \u201cas authorized by ORS 656.382,\u201d the board reasoned that this court\u2019s order only allowed claimant to <em>request </em>fees as authorized by that statute, but did not require an award of fees if the board determined that attorney fees were not authorized by the statute. The board further concluded that claimant is not entitled to attorney fees under ORS 656.382(1) for services in obtaining a penalty or attorney fees, and that the board lacked authority to award additional fees to claimant\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">On judicial review, in his third and fourth assignments of error, claimant challenges the board\u2019s determination that employer did not unreasonably <em>refuse </em>to pay compensation, and asserts for that reason that there are really two bases for an award of attorney fees \u2014 a refusal and a delay \u2014 thereby justifying an additional attorney fees award. We reject that contention. It is undisputed that employer did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>not timely make a lump sum payment of claimant\u2019s benefits, but there is no evidence on this record of a refusal to pay compensation. In fact, before making the lump sum payment as requested, employer had made a monthly installment payment of benefits. Claimant is not entitled to penalty-based attorney fees under ORS 656.262(11)(a) based on a <em>refusal </em>to pay compensation. We reject claimant\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Claimant contends in his first assignment that because he finally prevailed, the board was required to award claimant appellate attorney fees, as well as attorney fees for services at every level of review pursuant to ORS 656.382(1) and ORS 656.388(1). Claimant asserts that the board has misinterpreted our order to only permit claimant to <em>request </em>fees under ORS 656.382(1), but not to require the board to actually award fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We agree with claimant that he is entitled to appellate attorney fees for services provided on review in our prior opinion in <em>Cayton. </em>As noted, we ordered an award of appellate attorney fees of $8,236.25, <em>contingent on claimant prevailing on remand. </em>The June 4, 2010, appellate judgment, which is part of this record, states: \u201cAppellate attorney fees in the amount of $8,236.25 awarded contingent on the outcome on remand.\u201d In light of claimant having finally prevailed before the board on remand, this court\u2019s order requires an award to claimant of appellate attorney fees of $8,236.25 for services on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">However, as our order expressly stated, it only related to attorney fees for services performed before this court. Although we stated in the order awarding attorney fees that claimant could <em>request </em>attorney fees for services performed at other levels, that statement did not require the board to award attorney fees for services at all other levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">We further conclude that the board correctly held that no additional attorney fees are authorized. As noted, the board assessed a 10 percent penalty based on employer\u2019s delay in payment of claimant\u2019s benefits. In addition, employer was ordered to pay a penalty-related attorney fee of $1,500, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ORS 656.262(11), because employer delayed the payment of compensation. But, as we have concluded, there is no evidence in this record of a refusal to pay compensation. Employer never denied that it owed claimant benefits for permanent partial disability and never challenged claimant\u2019s right to compensation under the director\u2019s order on reconsideration. Employer\u2019s only failing was in not timely making a lump sum payment as requested by claimant or in not referring claimant\u2019s request for a lump sum payment to the director within the 14 days required by ORS 656.230(1). The board correctly characterized that failing as a \u201cdelay\u201d in payment of compensation. We have held that a delay in payment of compensation can constitute a resistance to payment of compensation. <em>See Tri-Met, Inc. v. Wolfe, </em>192 Or App 556, 86 P3d 111 (2004). However, we reject claimant\u2019s contention that because employer\u2019s conduct constituted both a \u201cdelay\u201d of and \u201cresistance\u201d to payment of attorney fees, claimant was entitled to two separate awards of attorney fees \u2014 an award pursuant to ORS 656.262(11) and a separate award for the same conduct under ORS 656.382(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Furthermore, contrary to claimant\u2019s contention, claimant\u2019s ultimate success on remand in securing the assessment of a penalty and attorney fees under ORS 656.262(11) does not mandate an attorney fees award for services <em>at all levels </em>of review under ORS 656.382(1). \u201cCompensation\u201d includes \u201call benefits, including medical services, provided for a compensable injury to a subject worker or the worker\u2019s beneficiaries by an insurer or self-insured employer pursuant to this chapter.\u201d ORS 656.005(8). It is well settled that penalties and attorney fees are not \u201ccompensation,\u201d and that attorney fees are not awarded for prevailing on an issue of penalties and attorney fees. <em>Saxton v. SAIF, </em>80 Or App 631, 633, 723 P2d 355, <em>rev den, </em>302 Or 159 (1986); <em>Dotson v. Bohemia, Inc., </em>80 Or App 233, 236, 720 P2d 1345, <em>rev den, </em>302 Or 35 (1986); <em>Bahler v. Mail-Well Envelope Co., </em>60 Or App 90, 93, 652 P2d 875 (1982). Accordingly, claimant\u2019s success in obtaining a penalty and attorney fees under ORS 656.262(11) for employer\u2019s delay in payment of compensation does not mandate an award of attorney fees under ORS 656.382(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Finally, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Schoch v. Leupold &amp; Stevens, </em>325 Or 112, 934 P2d 410 (1997), claimant challenges the board\u2019s reduction of his request for penalty-related attorney fees of $8,325 to $1,500. Claimant contends that the board failed to make findings in support of a reduction in the requested attorney fees. The board stated that it had considered the factors set forth in OAR 438-015-0010(4) and had given primary consideration to the results achieved and the time devoted to the case in setting the attorney fees at $1,500. We agree with claimant that the board\u2019s findings are inadequate to allow this court to review the reasonableness of the board\u2019s award. <em>Schoch, </em>325 Or at 119-20 (when a claimant submits a specific statement of services or a specific objection to a fees award, the board must do more than simply describe the factors it has considered and then posit reasonable attorney fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Remanded for an award of $8,236.25 in appellate attorney fees for services on judicial review and for reconsideration of penalty-related attorney fees under ORS 656.262(11); otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-6\"> ORS 656.262(11)(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u201cIf the insurer or self-insured employer unreasonably delays or unreasonably refuses to pay compensation, or unreasonably delays acceptance or denial of a claim, the insurer or self-insured employer shall be liable for an additional amount up to 25 percent of the amounts then due plus any attorney fees assessed under this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-8\"> ORS 656.382(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">\u201cIf an insurer or self-insured employer refuses to pay compensation due under an order of an Administrative Law Judge, board or court, or otherwise unreasonably resists the payment of compensation, except as provided in ORS 656.385, the employer or insurer shall pay to the claimant or the attorney of the claimant a reasonable attorney fees ***.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b212-5\"> ORS 656.230(1) was amended in 2007.
