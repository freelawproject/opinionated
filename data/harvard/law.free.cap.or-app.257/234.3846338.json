They also sought to enjoin defendant from interfering with the easement and damages for defendant\u2019s interference. Defendant denied that plaintiffs have such an easement or, if they do, that defendant has interfered with it. Defendant also counterclaimed for a determination that, if plaintiffs have an easement, it is subject to reasonable restrictions. The trial court determined that, pursuant to the terms of a written easement agreement, plaintiffs have an easement over defendant\u2019s property, but that they cannot use an existing road over defendant\u2019s property for that purpose and, instead, must build a new road in a different location at their own expense. The trial court also declined to award attorney fees to either party. Defendant appeals, contending that she is the prevailing party and entitled to attorney fees under the terms of the easement agreement. Plaintiffs cross-appeal, asserting that, under the unambiguous terms of the easement agreement, they are entitled to use the existing road on defendant\u2019s property for access to the northwestern part of their property. We agree with plaintiffs\u2019 argument on cross-appeal and therefore reverse the trial court and remand, obviating the need to address defendant\u2019s appeal concerning attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Plaintiffs have asked the court to exercise its discretion to review the record <em>de novo. </em>ORS 19.415(3); ORAP 5.40(8). <em>See Knight v. Nyara, </em>240 Or App 586, 248 P3d 36 (2011) (claim for declaration of rights under easement and injunction subject to <em>de novo </em>review under ORS 19.415(3) (2007)); <em>Hammond v. Hammond, </em>246 Or App 775, 777, 268 P3d 691 (2011) (quiet-title actions are equitable in nature). We have agreed to do so in exceptional cases. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals will exercise its discretion to try the cause anew on the record or to make one or more factual findings anew on the record only in exceptional cases.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the trial court based its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ruling on findings that are not supported by the evidence in the record and, further, that a correct outcome in this case is dependent on additional findings that the trial court did not make, we exercise our discretion to review <em>de novo, </em>deferring to the trial court\u2019s credibility judgments insofar as they are based on demeanor. <em>Uwimana and Gwangano, </em>209 Or App 693, 696, 149 P3d 257 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">We summarize the facts, which are largely undisputed, based on our <em>de novo </em>review of the record. Plaintiffs and defendant own neighboring parcels in rural Jackson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>County. Defendant\u2019s parcel is 40 acres. It is improved with a house in its northeastern corner and is landlocked. Defendant\u2019s only access to her property is through a road on plaintiffs\u2019 property. Rugged terrain prevents plaintiffs from reaching the northwestern 200 acres of their property by vehicle, except through defendant\u2019s property. Thus, defendant\u2019s access to her property must be through plaintiffs\u2019 property, and plaintiffs\u2019 access to the northwestern corner of their property must be through defendant\u2019s property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">At one time, both plaintiffs\u2019 and defendant\u2019s property were held in common ownership. In 1989, Patricia and Steven Cutler owned the entire 320 acres, and lived at the homesite currently owned by plaintiffs, to the east of what is now defendant\u2019s property. In 1990, the Cutlers partitioned the property to carve out a 40-acre parcel and obtained conditional approval for a homesite from Jackson County. The conditional approval described the location for the approved homesite. In 2000, the Cutlers sold the 280-acre parcel to plaintiffs\u2019 predecessors, the Furrows, and retained the 40-acre parcel, later sold to defendant, for the purpose of development as a homesite.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Currently, a private roadway runs through both parcels. Its path is irregular and it begins generally at an eastern boundary of plaintiffs\u2019 property, and runs generally in a southwesterly direction to the eastern boundary of defendant\u2019s property, where defendant has placed a gate. Aerial maps in evidence dating from 1969 show that from that point, the road continues north to the location of defendant\u2019s house. Additionally, more recent maps shows that from the gate installed by defendant, a new road \u2014 defendant\u2019s driveway \u2014 splits to the west of the roadway and heads in a northwesterly direction to her homesite. But the roadway itself also continues north to defendant\u2019s homesite and passes defendant\u2019s home on its eastern side. The trial court referred to the portion of the roadway from plaintiffs\u2019 home-site to defendant\u2019s homesite as the \u201cAdams Road.\u201d From defendant\u2019s homesite, the roadway continues north through the northeastern corner of defendant\u2019s property and into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>northwestern portion of plaintiffs\u2019 property, along the top of a ridge. The trial court referred to this portion of the roadway as the \u201cRidge Road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">It is undisputed and the trial court found that, although aerial photos dating back at least to 1969 show the described roadway in its present locations (with the exception of defendant\u2019s driveway), at the time the Cutlers acquired their property in 1989 and when they sold the 280-acre parcel to the Furrows in 2000, the roads to the west of plaintiffs\u2019 homesite and on defendant\u2019s property were in a state of disrepair \u2014 rutted, overgrown with shrubs \u2014 and for the most part impassable by vehicles larger than a motorcycle. In fact, the roads had fallen into such disrepair that Patricia Cutler \u2014 a party to the disputed easement agreement\u2014 testified that, other than the access road to the Cutler\u2019s homesite, there were <em>no </em>roads on the property at the time she lived there. The trial court found Patricia Cutler, who testified by telephone, to be a credible witness, but it is not clear whether that credibility determination was demeanor based. In any event, Patricia Cutler\u2019s testimony regarding the absence of roads is inconsistent with the overwhelming evidence in the record that there were many roads over the property but that they were mostly impassable due to rutting and overgrowth of Manzanita. Accordingly, we give her testimony concerning the absence of roads less weight than did the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Before closing on the 2000 sale to the Furrows, the Cutlers and Furrows executed an easement entitled \u201cPrivate Roads Maintenance and Access Agreement.\u201d The agreement, drafted by the Cutlers, provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\u201cTHIS DECLARATION of agreement is made this 9 [th] day of August, 2000, by Steven Cutler and Patricia Cutler, husband and wife and William Furrow and Laurellyn M. Furrow, husband and wife, hereinafter called Declarants, for themselves, their heirs, personal representatives, successors, grantees and assigns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201cA. WHEREAS, the Declarants are the owners of land located in Jackson County, Oregon, <em>over which a private road and logging roads </em>are currently located, and which are more particularly described as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u201cDeclarants hereby grant each other non-exclusive easements allowing unrestricted ingress and egress <em>across all existing roads (logging, main roads and any others) as well as any roads that may be built in the future, </em>including the right to improve those roads and add services at their own expense to permit future development of the declarants\u2019 lands which may be allowed and approved by the City, County or state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">\u201cB. WHEREAS, the parties desire to utilize the private roads for common ingress and egress to their respective properties and to maintain same according to the terms and provision thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">\u201cC. NOW, THEREFORE, Declarants hereby declare that the private roads herein described shall be subject to the following conditions which are for the purpose of protecting the value and desirability of, and which shall run with, the real property owned by the Declarants and described herein, and shall be binding upon all parties having any right, title, or interest in such real property or any part thereof, including their heirs, personal representatives, successors, grantees, and assigns, and same shall enure to the benefit of each owner of such properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">\u201c1. Declarants are the owners of the real property set forth in Exhibits \u2018A\u2019 and \u00a3B\u2019 attached hereto and incorporated herein, and hold title thereto as set forth in said Exhibits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201c2. Each of the Declarants, as owners, shall have a right of way and easement of ingress and egress over and across the private roads herein described, which shall be appurtenant to and pass with the title to each of their respective parcels as herein described, subject to the provisions herein contained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">\u201c3. The private roads shall be used for ingress and egress purposes only and shall not be obstructed by any owner for any purpose, unless with prior written consent of all owners. <em>The present improved private road is presently graded and graveled and is utilized as a road </em>and shall be maintained and repaired in a similar condition for such purpose. This shall not preclude any rights granted and created in Paragraph \u00a3A\u2019 above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">\u201c4. The expenses of maintaining and repairing the private roads shall be paid in an amount that is proportionate to the declarants [\u2019] use of said private roads.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u00ab* * * * \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">\u201c6. In the event suit, or action, or appeal thereof, is brought in the premises of this Declaration, the losing party or parties shall pay the prevailing party or parties reasonable attorney fees as determined by the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">(Emphasis added.) The agreement attached the descriptions of the two parcels, as well as a description of other property owned by the Cutlers that was contiguous to the Furrows\u2019 property and through which the Furrows had access to their parcel, but there were no descriptions of any roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In 2002, the Cutlers hired Elvis Offenbacher to build access to the 40 acres parcel and a pad for a homesite. Offenbacher testified that he \u201crebuilt\u201d the section of the existing Adams Road between the homesite on the 280-acre parcel and the eastern boundary of the 40-acre parcel, and that he also built a new road, or driveway, \u201cfrom the saddle\u201d on Adams Road (the location of defendant\u2019s gate) to a pad for a homesite. The evidence shows that the pad that Offenbacher excavated was either on or immediately west of the roadway and some 500 feet to the north and 140 feet to the east of the homesite location that had been approved by the county in 1990 and that was subsequently reapproved by the county when defendant applied for her building permit in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The Cutlers sold the 40-acre parcel to defendant in late 2003, and in 2004, defendant built a house on the pad that had been excavated by Offenbacher, not at the location approved by the county. The pad and, ultimately, the house, were constructed almost on or immediately west of the roadway as it travels north toward the northwestern portion of plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">In September 2006, after defendant\u2019s house had been completed, the Furrows sold the 280-acre parcel to plaintiffs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When they purchased the property, plaintiffs believed that the \u201cPrivate Roads Maintenance and Access Agreement\u201d gave them access to the northwestern portion of their property through defendant\u2019s property, including the new road or driveway, and they used it, passing on motorbikes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>and all-terrain vehicles along the rebuilt portion of the roadway and through defendant\u2019s property, as well as next to her house on the new road built by Offenbacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Before plaintiffs moved onto their property, defendant had experienced a break-in and, for security reasons, in January 2007, she placed an unlocked gate across the road at the eastern boundary of her property. Plaintiffs objected to the gate, asserting that it interfered with their unrestricted access to the easement road. Defendant has also landscaped her property in a way that plaintiffs claim further interferes with their use of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint sought a declaration that they have an easement along the roadway shown on a 2001 aerial photo for unrestricted ingress and egress across defendant\u2019s property to their property and sought to enjoin defendant from interfering with plaintiffs\u2019 use of the roadway, as well as damages of $2,000 for past interference. Notably, plaintiffs\u2019 claim is based on an easement that they allege they have on the roadway as shown on an aerial map from 2001 (Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 5), including that portion of the road \u201crebuilt\u201d by Offenbacher in 2002. Plaintiffs have not asserted an easement over the new road constructed by Offenbacher in 2002 to the west of the old road, which defendant describes as her driveway. In fact, plaintiffs expressly contend that the roadway over which they claim an easement \u2014 the road at issue \u2014 was in existence at the time of the execution of the easement agreement. In the alternative, plaintiffs requested a determination that they have an implied easement for access to the northwestern part of their property. Defendant denied that plaintiffs have an easement across her property and filed a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment, seeking to impose restrictions on plaintiffs\u2019 use of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The trial court put considerable effort into this case, including a view of the property. In a thorough opinion, the court concluded that the \u201cPrivate Roads Maintenance and Access Agreement\u201d was ambiguous with respect to what the parties intended and what they considered to be \u201cexisting roads.\u201d The court made these findings based on evidence presented at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u201cThe road that generally runs by [plaintiffs\u2019] homesite in a westerly direction to [defendant\u2019s] homesite will be called the Adams Road; the road that runs north of [defendant\u2019s] homesite will be called the Ridge Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">\u201c1. The Adams Road and Ridge Road were most likely built in the 1940s and 1950s as part of logging operations in the area. Thereafter, these roads fell into disrepair and in large part became impassable by motor vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">\u00abifc \u00edj\u00ed \u00edj; ifi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">\u201c3. In 1999, the Cutlers hired Realtor Horton to advise them about developing their properties * * *. Realtor Horton advised them that they needed to (1) draft an easement that would provide access to [defendant\u2019s] property and (2) build an access road from what is now [plaintiffs\u2019] home-site to what is now defendant\u2019s homesite. In 1999 Realtor Horton could not drive up what appeared to be a trail between [plaintiffs\u2019] homesite and [defendant\u2019s] homesite.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\u201c4. The Cutlers lived at [plaintiffs\u2019] homesite until the year 2000. At that time, Patricia Cutler testified that the road did not continue past [plaintiffs\u2019] homesite up to [defendant\u2019s] homesite. No vehicular traffic could travel from [plaintiffs\u2019] homesite to [defendant\u2019s] homesite at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\u201c5. In 1990, the Cutlers proceeded to obtain approval from the County to establish a homesite on [defendant\u2019s] property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">\u201c6. In 2000, the Cutlers sold the 280-acre *** lot to the Furrows. At or around the time of that sale, Steven and Patricia Cutler entered into an easement agreement with William and Laurellyn Furrow. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">\u201c7. In 2002, the Cutlers hired Elvis Offenbacher to build a road between [plaintiffs\u2019] homesite and [defendant\u2019s] homesite. At that time, Offenbacher described the access to [defendant\u2019s] homesite from [plaintiffs\u2019] homesite as a \u2018trail,\u2019 which could not be used by motor vehicles to access [defendant\u2019s] homesite.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">\u201c8. From 2000, when Mr. Furrow purchased [plaintiffs\u2019] lot, until 2002 when the access road was built up to [defendant\u2019s] homesite, William Furrow indicated that he was never able to drive up the access path to [defendant\u2019s] homesite but always walked the path.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u201c9. In October 2003, [defendant] purchased the 40-acre lot from the Cutlers. At that time, the pad for the homesite had been created along with an access road to the homesite from [plaintiffs\u2019] homesite.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Based on its findings, the court reached these conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">\u201cA. The Adams Road and the Ridge Road, as described above, appear to originally have been old logging roads built in the 1940s and 1950s. Over time, roads deteriorated and became generally impassable by motor vehicles. Certain portions of those roads, principally the Ridge Road, were improved by contracts with the City of Jacksonville to service fuel breaks in the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">\u201cB. When the subject easement was signed on August 9, 2000, the path between [plaintiffs\u2019] homesite and [defendant\u2019s] homesite was not a road that could be traveled on with a motor vehicle. A road for vehicular traffic was built in 2002 by the Cutlers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">As noted, the trial court concluded that the easement was ambiguous, specifically with respect to the meaning of the term \u201cexisting road.\u201d Based on evidence of the circumstances surrounding the easement\u2019s execution, the court concluded that, because they were not developed for vehicular travel, the Adams and Ridge Roads were not \u201cexisting roads\u201d at the time of the execution of the easement. The court found that, although the Cutlers and the Furrows contemplated that the easement would provide reasonable access across the 40-acre parcel to the northwestern corner of what is now plaintiffs\u2019 property, they \u201ccould not have intended to create an easement for the benefit of the owner of the [280-acre parcel] that would pass directly through the homesite location that the Cutlers had created on [defendant\u2019s] property.\u201d The necessary consequence of the trial court\u2019s analysis was that plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the easement agreement did not encompass the use of the roadway across defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The trial court nonetheless concluded that plaintiffs had an easement over defendant\u2019s property for access to the northwestern corner of their property, even if it could not be over the existing roads. Relying on the easement\u2019s provision granting access to \u201croads that may be built in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>future,\u201d the trial court concluded that the original parties to the easement \u2014 the Cutlers and the Furrows \u2014 \u201cintended to create reasonable access across [defendant\u2019s] lot to the northwest portion of [plaintiffs\u2019] lot, if it could not be secured in other places.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Although no party had requested it, based on the judge\u2019s view of the property and his own experience building roads, the court found that no other reasonable access to the northwest corner could be secured in other places, so plaintiffs could have reasonable access to the northwest corner of their property through defendant\u2019s property on a new road that the court authorized plaintiffs to build at a location different from the existing roadway, to the west of defendant\u2019s homesite, and \u201cas far away from the residence established by [defendant] as possible.\u201d The court declared that plaintiffs could build the road on defendant\u2019s property in conformance with these requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">\u201cThe road surface at the time of installation shall be no wider than 12 feet with right-of-way extending 4 feet on both sides of the road surface for a total of 20 feet. The right-of-way is intended to accommodate fuel breaks, installation of utilities and the widening of the road, all as approved by appropriate government agencies, to accommodate use of this easement for the development of Plaintiffs\u2019 property to the north of Defendant\u2019s property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The court explained that, once installed, the road would fix the location for plaintiffs\u2019 easement for access across defendant\u2019s property. The court further determined that the road would be subject to a maximum speed limit of 15 miles per hour and that \u201c[p]laintiffs and their invitees should make every reasonable effort to restrict use of the easement to daylight hours, but in no case shall the road be used before 5:00 a.m. or after 11:00 p.m. unless exigent or emergency circumstances exist that would justify such use.\u201d Having determined that plaintiffs were entitled to an easement on a road to be built at a different location, the trial court did not address plaintiffs\u2019 contention that defendant\u2019s landscaping has encroached upon their easement on the existing roadway or defendant\u2019s counterclaim seeking the imposition of reasonable restrictions on plaintiffs\u2019 use of an easement on the existing roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Defendant\u2019s appeal is limited to the question whether the trial court erred in determining that defendant was not entitled to attorney fees. On cross-appeal, plaintiffs contend that the trial court misconstrued the easement agreement\u2019s reference to \u201cexisting roads (logging, main roads and any others)\u201d to mean only roads that are drivable by a motor vehicle. In plaintiffs\u2019 view, the easement covers <em>any </em>existing road, even one that is not currently passable by motor vehicle. Plaintiffs assert further that the trial court erred in effectively extinguishing their easement over the existing roadway through defendant\u2019s property and in requiring them to construct a new road at their own expense. Because we agree with plaintiffs, we do not reach the other issues raised on appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The construction of an express easement is a question of law. <em>Bloomfield v. Weakland, </em>224 Or App 433, 199 P3d 318 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 115 (2009); <em>Kell v. Oppenlander, </em>154 Or App 422, 426, 961 P2d 861 (1998). As we recently said in <em>Knight, </em>240 Or App at 595, in construing an easement, the court seeks to discern the nature and scope of the easement\u2019s purpose to give effect to that purpose in a practical manner. To determine an easement\u2019s purpose, the court first looks to the words of the easement, viewing them in the context of the entire document. If the words clearly express the easement\u2019s purpose, the analysis ends. In giving effect to an easement\u2019s purpose, general principles of reasonableness control. <em>Id. </em>If the court determines that the easement is ambiguous, the court looks to relevant surrounding circumstances for evidence of the original parties\u2019 intent, including consideration of the easement\u2019s purpose and the manner in which the parties used the easement. <em>Tipperman v. Tsiastsos, </em>327 Or 539, 544-45, 964 P2d 1015 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">With due respect to the trial court, in our view, although the easement\u2019s provisions are exceptionally broad, they are also clear and unambiguous, so the trial court should not have relied on the circumstances surrounding the document\u2019s execution to determine the meaning of \u201cexisting roads.\u201d <em>Fendall v. Miller, </em>99 Or 610, 619, 196 P 381 (1921) (the court will look beyond the wording of the instrument only where there is an uncertainty or ambiguity). By written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>agreement, the declarants noted that they were owners of property \u201cover which a private road and logging roads\u201d are located. The declarants gave mutual nonexclusive easements for ingress and egress \u201cacross all existing roads (logging, main roads and <em>any </em>others) as well as any roads that may be built in the future.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The roads are not to be \u201cobstructed by any owner for any purpose, unless with prior written consent to all owners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">The easement agreement does not limit its scope to improved roads. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">\u201cThe private roads shall be used for ingress and egress purposes only and shall not be obstructed by any owner for any purpose, unless with prior written consent of all owners. The present improved private road is presently graded and graveled and is utilized as a road and shall be maintained and repaired in a similar condition for such purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Thus, the easement agreement makes reference to multiple \u201cprivate roads,\u201d and also refers to \u201c[t]he present improved private road\u201d that \u201cis presently graded and graveled and is utilized as a road.\u201d Viewed in its entirety, the agreement reflects that, at the time of the document\u2019s execution, the parties were aware that there were multiple roads on the property, but that there was only one road that was improved, graded and graveled and used as a road. The unambiguous implication is that the easement\u2019s reference to \u201cexisting roads\u201d includes unimproved roads that are not graded or graveled or used as roads.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Thus, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the easement\u2019s reference to \u201cexisting roads\u201d means only roads that were drivable at the time of the easement\u2019s execution is not consistent with the easement\u2019s express terms. Nor is it consistent with the trial court\u2019s own finding as to the easement\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>purpose \u2014 to provide access to the 40-acre parcel \u2014 or with the parties\u2019 own use of the easement for that purpose. For access to the 40-acre parcel, the Cutlers rebuilt Adams Road on the Furrows\u2019 (and now plaintiffs\u2019) property, which was largely impassable at the time of the execution of the agreement. Thus, consistent with our conclusion that the easement includes unimproved roads as \u201cexisting roads,\u201d as well as with the parties\u2019 use of the easement, the only supported finding is that Adams and Ridge Roads are encompassed within the easement\u2019s reference to \u201cexisting roads.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Despite the trial court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs do not have an easement over defendant\u2019s property on existing roads, the trial court did conclude that plaintiffs have an easement for a road across defendant\u2019s property for access to the northwestern portion of their property. As noted, defendant\u2019s home is on or immediately adjacent to Ridge Road, which plaintiffs have been using for access to and from the northwestern 200 acres of their property. The trial court concluded that plaintiffs can no longer use that road across defendant\u2019s property, because the original parties to the easement \u201ccould not have intended to create an easement for the benefit of the owner of the [280-acre parcel] that would pass directly through the homesite location that the Cutlers had created on [defendant\u2019s] property.\u201d That finding might be supported by the record if the homesite approval that the Cutlers had from the county before the execution of the easement agreement was in the same location where the home-site was ultimately built. But the Cutlers did not develop the homesite until some two years after the execution of the easement agreement and, as noted, the pad for the homesite as placed directly on or adjacent to the road, in a location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>different from that approved by the county. There is no evidence that, at the time the easement agreement was executed, the Cutlers were contemplating a homesite location on the existing roadway, where the house is now built. Thus, neither the easement itself nor the surrounding circumstances provide support for the trial court\u2019s finding that the parties did not intend the easement to travel over the existing roadway on defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The remaining question is whether, having concluded that plaintiffs were entitled to an easement over defendant\u2019s land for access to the northwestern portion of their property, the trial court had authority to require the building of a new road over defendant\u2019s property for plaintiffs\u2019 benefit, away from defendant\u2019s homesite. We appreciate the trial court\u2019s motivation to resolve the parties\u2019 conflict, but no party sought the creation of a new road,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and we conclude that the trial court erred in granting relief that was not requested. <em>Stonier v. Kronenberger, </em>230 Or App 11, 21-22, 214 P3d 41 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The trial court concluded that defendant\u2019s installation of an unlocked gate on Adams Road did not obstruct the easement, and we agree. An easement owner is limited to the uses of the easement that are reasonably necessary to satisfy the easement\u2019s intended purpose. <em>Tooker v. Feinstein, </em>131 Or App 684, 687, 886 P2d 1051 (1994), <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 94 (1995). The servient estate owner maintains dominion over the easement land and has the right to use that land, as long as that use does not unreasonably interfere with the easement owner\u2019s use. <em>Clark v. Kuhn </em>171 Or App 29, 33, 15 P3d 37 (2000); <em>Wagner v. O\u2019Callaghan, </em>104 Or App 284, 287, 800 P2d 309 (1990). In <em>Jones et ux. v. Edwards et ux., </em>219 Or 429, 433, 347 P2d 846 (1959), the Supreme Court said that a gate across an easement may be permitted if the reasonable use of the servient estate makes such a gate necessary. <em>See also Ericsson v. Braukman, </em>111 Or App 57, 62, 824 P2d 1174, <em>rev den, </em>313 Or 210 (1992). We conclude that defendant\u2019s placement of an unlocked gate as a demarcation of her property line and as a deterrent to trespassers is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>reasonable use of the servient estate that does not unreasonably interfere with plaintiffs\u2019 use of the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Having concluded that plaintiffs have an easement on defendant\u2019s property beyond the gate and over the existing roadway shown on aerial photographs in 2001 for ingress and egress to their property, we remand the case to the trial court for consideration whether defendant has otherwise encroached upon that easement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">On cross-appeal, reversed and remanded; appeal dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\"> ORAP 5.40 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">\u201cThe appellant\u2019s opening brief shall open with a clear and concise statement of the case, which shall set forth in the following order under separate headings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u00ab * :}: sH <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\u201c(8)(a) In those proceedings in which the Court of Appeals has discretion to try the cause anew on the record and the appellant seeks to have the court exercise that discretion, the appellant shall concisely state the reasons why the court should do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">\u201c(b) In those proceedings in which the Court of Appeals has discretion to make one or more factual findings anew on the record and the appellant seeks to have the court exercise that discretion, the appellant shall identify with particularity the factual findings that the appellant seeks to have the court find anew on the record and shall concisely state the reasons why the court should do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">\u201c(c) The Court of Appeals will exercise its discretion to try the cause anew on the record or to make one or more factual findings anew on the record only in exceptional cases.

In any event, in view of our conclusion that Adams and Ridge Roads were existing roads at the time of the execution of the easement, we need not address whether, if they were not, the \u201cfuture roads\u201d provision would nonetheless give plaintiffs an easement over the \u201cimproved\u201d versions of those roads or over the new road built by Offenbacher, which defendant describes as her driveway.
