On review for errors of law, ORS 183.482 (8)(a), we conclude that, under the facts established by the board, claimant\u2019s injuries occurred in the course of her employment. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Neither party challenges the board\u2019s factual findings, which we summarize as follows. Employer provides cleaning services for department stores in seven states. At the time of her injuries, claimant worked for employer as a \u201cteam leader\u201d and, in that capacity, led a three-person crew assigned to clean a particular store near Portland. Claimant\u2019s crew was one of several in the Portland area; each was led by a team leader.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Team leaders, including claimant, were responsible for receiving paychecks from employer and distributing the paychecks to the members of their crews. The paychecks were delivered by an outside provider to employer\u2019s Tacoma, Washington, office on the third and twenty-third day of each month. Employer allowed local team leaders, including those from Portland, to travel to the Tacoma office, pick up paychecks for multiple crews, and then distribute them at prearranged sites; employer did not knowingly pay team leaders for any time that they spent doing so. Team leaders who wanted to pick up paychecks were required to call or arrive at the Tacoma office by 3:00 p.m. Otherwise, employer\u2019s office manager would mail the paychecks to the team leaders for distribution to their crew members. Six or seven of the Portland crews routinely sent one or more team leaders to the Tacoma office to pick up paychecks. Alternatively, a district manager sometimes drove the paychecks from the Tacoma office to the Portland area for distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">On December 3, 2008, claimant received a call at home from another team leader who explained that he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>no longer drive to Tacoma that day to pick up the paychecks as planned and asked if claimant could do so instead. Claimant agreed and arranged to drive to Tacoma with another employee in that employee\u2019s vehicle. While traveling to Tacoma, they were involved in a car accident, and claimant was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Employer denied claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim on the ground that her injuries did not arise out of or in the course of her employment. An administrative law judge upheld that denial, as did the board, which concluded that claimant\u2019s injuries did not occur in the course of her employment. The board did not consider whether claimant\u2019s injuries arose out of her employment. <em>See </em>ORS 656.005(7)(a) <em>(\u201cA </em>\u2018compensable injury\u2019 is an accidental injury *** arising out of and in the course of employment[.]\u201d). The board reasoned that claimant was \u201coff work, not being paid, and was free to use her time as she wished\u201d when the accident occurred. Although the board noted that \u201cemployer permitted team leaders to pick up the paychecks in person,\u201d it found that \u201cclaimant was neither required nor expected to pick up paychecks as a team leader\u201d but that she did so \u201cbecause she needed the money right away,\u201d and concluded that \u201cclaimant\u2019s activity provided no benefit to her employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">On judicial review, claimant challenges the board\u2019s conclusion that her injuries did not occur in the course of her employment. Whether an injury occurs in the course of employment forms one prong of the two-pronged \u201cunitary work-connection test,\u201d which we have summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">\u201cA claimant bears the burden of establishing the compensability of his or her injury \u2014 -and, specifically, the requisite connection between the injury and his or her employment. \u2018A compensable injury is an accidental injury * * * arising out of <em>and </em>in the course of employment.\u2019 ORS 656.005(7)(a) (emphasis added). That is, both conjunctive statutory elements must be met. In determining whether an injury occurs \u2018in the course of\u2019 employment, we look at the time, place, and circumstances of the injury. The \u2018arising out of prong refers to the causal link \u2014 the causal nexus \u2014 between the injury and the employment. \u2018[A] worker\u2019s injury is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>deemed to arise out of employment if the risk of the injury-results from the nature of his or her work or when it originates from some risk to which the work environment exposes the worker.\u2019 As noted, both prongs of the \u2018unitary work-connection test\u2019 must be met to some degree. Nevertheless, the test may be satisfied, even if the factors supporting one prong are weak, if those supporting the other are strong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><em>Legacy Health Systems v. Noble, </em>250 Or App 596, 600-01, 283 P3d 924, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 127 (2012) (ellipses and brackets in <em>Noble; </em>some citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, as noted, the board did not reach the \u201carising out of\u2019 prong. However, employer concedes that, under the facts of this case, if claimant\u2019s injuries occurred in the course of her employment, they also arose out of her employment. Accordingly, the only issue on review is whether claimant\u2019s injuries occurred in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Whether an injury occurs \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment concerns the time, place, and circumstances of the injury. <em>Fred Meyer, Inc. v. Hayes, </em>325 Or 592, 596, 943 P2d 197 (1997). \u201cAn injury occurs \u2018in the course of employment if it takes place within the period of employment, at a place where a worker reasonably may be expected to be, and while the worker reasonably is fulfilling the duties of the employment or is doing something reasonably incidental to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598. \u201cAn activity need not be directed by an employer in order for it to be work-related.\u201d <em>SAIF v. Scardi, </em>218 Or App 403, 411, 180 P3d 56, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 175 (2008). Nor is it required that an employer have compensated a claimant for participating in the activity. <em>See, e.g., Iliaifar v. SAIF, </em>160 Or App 116, 981 P2d 353 (1999) (the claimant\u2019s injury occurred in the course of employment even though the claimant was off work and unpaid at the time of the injury); <em>First Interstate Bank v. Clark, </em>133 Or App 712, 894 P2d 499, <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 429 (1995) (same). Indeed, \u201c[f]or many years, Oregon has recognized that injuries are work related that occur in the performance of duties even though the claimant is off the employer\u2019s premises and performing duties that are not directly connected with the profit-making function of the employer\u2019s business or that are not considered within the claimant\u2019s typical job duties.\u201d <em>Iliaifar, </em>160 Or App at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>We conclude that claimant\u2019s injuries occurred in the course of her employment. Put simply, claimant was injured while performing a duty of her employment \u2014 namely, receiving paychecks from employer so that she could then distribute them to members of her crew. As noted, the board found that \u201cclaimant was neither required nor expected to pick up the paychecks\u201d in person and that employer merely \u201cpermitted\u201d that method of receiving the paychecks. However, it is immaterial that claimant was not required to travel to the Tacoma office in order to receive the paychecks. She <em>was </em>required, as a team leader, to receive and distribute the paychecks to the members of her crew. Employer provided local team leaders with two means of fulfilling that obligation: they could either (1) travel to the Tacoma office to pick up the paychecks or (2) wait for the paychecks to be delivered or mailed. Indeed, as the board found, although employer did not require or expect team leaders to pick up the paychecks at the Tacoma office, employer coordinated that activity by establishing rules governing when and how team leaders could do so. Moreover, the fact that claimant was motivated by a desire to receive her own paycheck sooner does not mean that her conduct was not connected with work. <em>Cf. Clark, </em>133 Or App at 715-16 (\u201c[T]he fact that an activity is directed at keeping one\u2019s job does not, in itself, make the activity a personal mission.\u201d). Accordingly, claimant\u2019s trip to the Tacoma office was an off-premises work activity that was contemplated (and coordinated) by employer. <em>See id. </em>at 718-19 (the claimant\u2019s injury, which she suffered while voluntarily attending an off-premises meeting to solicit business and perform community service, occurred in the course of employment because the activity was \u201cthe type of off-premises activity contemplated by [the] employer,\u201d who \u201cacquiesce [d] in the conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Employer argues, in part, that the board correctly concluded that claimant\u2019s trip to the Tacoma office did not benefit employer. <em>See SAIF v. Fortson, </em>155 Or App 586, 592, 964 P2d 293 (1998) (explaining that \u201c[w]e have in the past considered the benefit to the employer of the conduct that injured the claimant when evaluating whether the injury was connected with work\u201d but adding that that determination is not dispositive). As an initial matter, we note that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>board\u2019s conclusion that the activity did not benefit employer is a legal conclusion that, taking the facts as found by the board, we review for errors of law. <em>Iliaifar, </em>160 Or App at 123-24. Here, the board found that claimant\u2019s job duties as a team leader included receiving and distributing paychecks to the members of her crew, that employer allowed local team leaders to accomplish those tasks by first picking up the paychecks in person at the Tacoma office, and that, alternatively, \u201cthe district manager would sometimes drive the checks to the Portland area for distribution to the workers.\u201d However, the board also found that claimant preferred that the paychecks be picked up in person by a team leader \u201cbecause she needed the money right away\u201d and, on that basis, concluded that claimant\u2019s trip \u201cprovided no benefit to her employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">We disagree. The activity at issue \u2014 picking up paychecks at the Tacoma office to distribute to fellow employees \u2014 provided a benefit to employer. It is the obligation of an employer to provide its employees with compensation when it is owed. Team leaders who traveled to the Tacoma office to pick up paychecks for distribution to fellow employees furthered that obligation. Moreover, if a team leader picked up the paychecks at the Tacoma office, employer did not have to undergo the expense of mailing those paychecks to team leaders or sending the district manager to deliver them to the Portland area. Finally, the activity benefited employer in the sense that its employees would be more satisfied if they received their paychecks earlier than if the checks were mailed. <em>See Fortson, </em>155 Or App at 593 n 2 (suggesting that conduct that \u201cboosts morale\u201d and encourages \u201cworker loyalty\u201d may benefit an employer).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In sum, claimant\u2019s injuries occurred while she was performing a duty of her employment in a manner allowed by employer and for employer\u2019s benefit. Accordingly, her injuries occurred in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
