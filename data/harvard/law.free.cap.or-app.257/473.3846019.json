He contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion, made two days before the start of trial and again on the morning of trial, to substitute counsel and postpone the trial. Defendant further argues that the court erred in denying his motion, made during the trial, to represent himself <em>pro se </em>for the remainder of the proceeding. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying those motions and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">After defendant\u2019s truck was stopped by a sheriffs deputy for a traffic violation, defendant was arrested for DUII. A breath test administered with an Intoxilyzer 8000 machine after defendant\u2019s arrest measured his blood alcohol content to be 0.18 percent. Defendant was charged by information with DUII.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Trial was set for April 28, 2010, and defendant retained attorney Bons to represent him. Later, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion to continue the time of trial, and the trial date was reset to June 3. A second motion to postpone the trial was denied on June 2 by the presiding judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Ultimately, the trial began on June 4, and, that morning, Bons filed a motion for an order allowing him to withdraw as counsel for defendant and for a trial continuance to allow defendant\u2019s new attorney, Romano, time to prepare. In a supporting affidavit, Bons asserted that a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship had occurred on June 3 for a reason that could not be disclosed \u201cwithout a violation of the confidentiality of certain communications from [defendant] to [Bons]\u201d and that defendant was retaining different counsel. At the hearing on the motion, Bons argued that he could not comply with defendant\u2019s directions because of Oregon Rule of Professional Conduct 1.2(c). That rule mandates that a lawyer \u201cnot counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is illegal or fraudulent [.]\u201d Bons reiterated that his client relationship with defendant was broken. However, the presiding judge denied the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>\u201cWhat this looks like is, you wanted to postpone. You didn\u2019t get it, so you figured out another way to get the case postponed by claiming that your client wants to perpetuate a fraud upon the Court, so, [defendant], I don\u2019t want you to say anything about this because basically what he\u2019s saying is that you want to perpetuate a fraud upon the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\">\u201cI don\u2019t want you to respond, but I actually don\u2019t believe it, so that\u2019s my problem. I don\u2019t find any credibility in this. This is the most unbelievable situation possible. I found your Motion incomprehensible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Later that morning, the trial judge allowed the state\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony of defendant\u2019s expert, Daniels, on the functioning of the Intoxilyzer 8000 machine. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the information was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Bons immediately filed a motion to reconsider the June 2 motion to postpone and the June 4 motion to withdraw and postpone. He argued that Romano was retained and needed more time to prepare for trial. The motion to reconsider was allowed by the presiding judge. However, the court adhered to its earlier rulings, commenting that Bons\u2019s record requests regarding the Intoxilyzer machine were \u201cfishing expedition [s]\u201d and that the motion to withdraw was a \u201csubterfuge\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">\u201cSo, then at the very last moment \u2014 on the morning of trial, this morning \u2014 a Motion to Withdraw is filed literally at 9:30 in the morning at the time for trial. A Motion to Withdraw is filed and, as I stated earlier, that Motion was denied because I didn\u2019t find the Affidavit to be factually true, and I still don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">\u201cI have a good understanding of what the Case Law is on the Defendant having the right to have Counsel of his own choosing and I certainly would review those cases. 9:30 a.m. on the morning of trial, which is exactly the moment set for the beginning of trial, is not an appropriate time to file a Motion that is not based in fact in order to change lawyers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">\u201cMy finding was that it is basically subterfuge, to try and achieve the purpose that was thwarted on the 2nd of June of trying to get the trial postponed, so I\u2019m treating these Motions today, at this time, as Motions to Reconsider. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Reconsideration is granted and my former Rulings are adhered to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">Defendant then addressed the court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: What I\u2019d like to say, Your Honor, is actually I didn\u2019t feel that Mr. Bons had enough experience to defend me. We have a big difference in strategy and a conflict in personality. I felt like I\u2019m not being represented and he\u2019s not doing things I thought he was going to do, or planned on doing, and doing things I didn\u2019t know he was going to do. * * * I don\u2019t feel that he is a bad person. I just feel lack of experience, lack of interest, strategy differences and conflict, and if I was to get it postponed, I\u2019m not asking for a lot of time either, just enough to get a lawyer that I feel comfortable going to trial with. That\u2019s all I have to say, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Thank you. Of course, all of this is news to me. That was not the basis of the Motion to Withdraw that was made this morning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The court concluded that the motions were not timely made and stated, \u201c[Y]ou are in trial, so that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The trial started, a jury was selected, opening statements were made, and the state examined its first witness. The proceedings were then adjourned to June 8. On June 7, shortly before the trial recommenced, defendant again moved to continue the trial and substitute counsel. Defendant testified in a supporting affidavit that \u201c[t]he request for a postponement and firing of my attorney has never been some sort of plan of mine or my attorney, but rather has come about due to my sincere and well-founded concern that the attorney I hired didn\u2019t do many of the things he said that he would [do] in preparation for trial.\u201d Defendant further averred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">\u201cI respectfully renew my request for a continuance of the trial and Mr. Bons\u2019[s] withdrawal. If the Court will not allow a postponement, I request that Mr. Bons remain working on the case only because I cannot try the case on my own with such short notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">(Underscoring in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">When that motion was argued to the court, however, Bons amended the request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\u201cAdditionally, to this request, it may not have been clear, but in talking to my client this morning, he has requested that he represent himself for the duration of this trial, to do direct and cross examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">\u201cI think he is capable of doing so. He is not law trained, certainly, but I believe constitutionally he has the right to do so. I recommended against him doing so and I\u2019ve offered my assistance in the procedural matters and offered whatever help I can to assist him through to the finish of this trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Defendant asked to address the court so that \u201cthe record [was] made clear for the right of appeal based on ineffective assistance of Counsel and post-conviction relief.\u201d The court responded that the record was not so clear in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right, your attorney has indicated that you don\u2019t want him to represent you and you want to represent yourself. You want to cross examine witnesses. You want to present your own testimony, try to deal with evidentiary issues. You want to do all of that on your own. Is that right or is that wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u201cI read your affidavit to indicate that you wanted Mr. Bons to continue on the case only if the Court denied your Motion to Postpone, so, which is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">\u201cYour affidavit says if the Court will not allow a post-ponement, I request that Mr. Bons remain working on the case only because I cannot try the case on my own with such short notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">\u201cThat seems to me to be an acknowledgment by you, under oath, that you don\u2019t have legal training. You haven\u2019t gone to Law School. You\u2019re not familiar with the Rules of Evidence. You\u2019re not familiar with other issues of law, so I guess what I\u2019m asking you is, Mr. Bons is under the impression you did not want him speaking on your behalf or being your lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">\u201cYou filed this affidavit and I\u2019ve allowed you to make this statement, are you telling me you want to represent yourself or you are going to let Mr. Bons continue to represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Your Honor, in my heart, I feel it is crazy and insane for me to even try to represent myself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>but my lawyer \u2014 he hasn\u2019t even prepped me for the stand, I don\u2019t know what questions he is going to ask\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sir, I don\u2019t want to talk to you about your discussions with your attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: I talked to him outside about assisting me and helping guide me through it so I could do my own questioning, Your Honor, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, [defendant], I agree with you that it is absolutely crazy to let you try to do this yourself. Am I correct you don\u2019t have any legal training?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: I have no legal training and I feel I have no competent representation for this trial and I feel I am being forced to go to trial without legal, competent representation, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, you\u2019ve made your position. Counsel has represented you in this matter. The case has proceeded before the jury. Counsel understands the Rules of Evidence and has followed the Court Rules and Rules of Evidence and proceedings in this case thus far.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">\u201cEssentially, I agree with you. I think it would be foolish, fool hardy and crazy to put you in a position where you are trying to do this yourself, so, I am denying the Motion to Reconsider and Postponement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">\u201cI am going to go ahead and I am also going to require Mr. Bons to continue to represent you to the best of his ability, and you can confer with him with regard to the scope and what you want to do and proceed and he can take direction from you, but he\u2019s still going to be your attorney of record. You understand, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right, thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-13\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: May I ask a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: You may ask. I may not answer, but go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-15\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Because I am not legally qualified to do this, and I\u2019ve had very short notice and he, I guess, is going to assist me in procedure\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m not letting you represent yourself, sir. I agree with you, you are not competent to do this. You don\u2019t have the training. You don\u2019t have the ability. We are not going to stop the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u201cIt has proceeded. We\u2019ve selected a jury and he\u2019s going to continue to be your attorney. That\u2019s the Court\u2019s Order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">The prosecution did not oppose defendant\u2019s request or make a record on whether defendant\u2019s proposed self-representation would be disruptive to the trial proceedings. Bons continued to represent defendant for the remainder of the trial, and defendant was ultimately convicted of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">On appeal, defendant first contends that the court abused its discretion when it denied defendant\u2019s requests to postpone the trial and substitute counsel. The state responds that denial of a continuance was within the court\u2019s discretion, given its factual determination that the request was a \u201csubterfuge\u201d made in order to continue a \u201cfishing expedition [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We review a denial of a continuance request on the day of trial in order to hire a new attorney for abuse of discretion by the trial court. <em>State v. Martinez, </em>224 Or App 588, 591-92, 198 P3d 957 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 364 (2009). In <em>Martinez, </em>the defendant sought a continuance on the day of trial to obtain new counsel. We concluded that, although a trial court \u201cmust reasonably accommodate a defendant\u2019s right to the counsel of his or her choice [,]\u201d it was not an abuse of discretion to deny a requested postponement \u201cwhen the defendant has had prior opportunity to hire private counsel and has failed to request a continuance in a timely manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592. Moreover, it is not an abuse of discretion to avoid further delay \u201cunless a defendant makes a specific showing of good cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further explained, in <em>State v. Pflieger, </em>15 Or App 383, 390, 515 P2d 1348 (1973), that a \u201cdefendant need not be allowed without a showing of substantial cause to disrupt the orderly processes of justice by seeking on the very morning of trial to change counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The presiding judge denied defendant\u2019s requests for continuance of the trial date three times. The June 2 motion was denied, as the court later explained, because the delay was sought for a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d and the court \u201ccould not get from Mr. Bons an explanation that made sense to [it] about exactly what the history of the requests were, what the purpose of the requests were, [and] what kind of data he was seeking and for what reason. It was not adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>articulated.\u201d Because defendant failed to provide sufficient cause for postponement, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the June 2 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The next motion to postpone was made on the morning of June 4 \u201cat the time for trial\u201d and was supported by the motion to withdraw and affidavit of counsel that the attorney-client relationship had been severed the previous day and could no longer exist. The court denied that motion because it did not believe the affidavit to be \u201cfactually true\u201d and because \u201cthe moment set for the beginning of trial [] is not an appropriate time to file a Motion that is not based in fact in order to change lawyers.\u201d It was within the discretion of the presiding judge to deny the second motion to postpone because it was not supported by sufficient cause and because it was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Another request to postpone was considered after the presiding judge allowed reconsideration of the earlier ruling that day. That request was made during the afternoon of June 4 after the motion <em>in limine </em>hearing and before the <em>voir dire </em>examination of potential jurors. The court reiterated the reasons for the continuance denial (the asserted need for a new attorney because of a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship was not credible and it was not otherwise shown that additional time was needed for trial preparation) and denied the motion. Defendant\u2019s further explanation of the reasons for not continuing with Bons\u2019s representation \u2014 \u201clack of experience, lack of interest, strategy differences and conflict\u201d \u2014 were discounted by the court as \u201cnot the bas[es] of the Motion to Withdraw that was made this morning.\u201d Ultimately, the court decided that a motion to postpone at that point was untimely. (\u201c[Y]ou are in trial, so that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We conclude that a continuance request that is made after a case is called for trial and a pretrial evidentiary hearing has occurred is not requested in a \u201ctimely manner\u201d under <em>Martinez. </em>224 Or App at 592. It was not an abuse of discretion for the court to deny the motions as untimely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Defendant next asserts that the trial judge\u2019s denial of his right of self-representation was error as a matter of law. A criminal defendant has a constitutional right, under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, to represent himself and to otherwise waive the right to representation by legal counsel when the defendant \u201cvoluntarily and intelligently\u201d elects to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 US 806, 807, 95 S Ct 2525, 45 L Ed 2d 562 (1975); <em>State v. Verna, </em>9 Or App 620, 624, 498 P2d 793 (1972) (\u201cA defendant in a criminal case has the constitutional right not only to be represented by counsel, but also, if he so elects, to represent himself.\u201d). The request for self-representation and waiver of legal representation may be denied under Article I, section 11, however, if the request is unclear or equivocal or if it would result in the disruption of the orderly conduct of the trial. <em>See State v. Blanchard, </em>236 Or App 472, 475-76, 236 P3d 845 (2010) (reviewing denial of self-representation request under Article I, section 11, for whether waiver of legal representation was \u201cintelligent and understanding\u201d and whether request was unequivocal and not disruptive in effect).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>The parties do not dispute that defendant\u2019s purported waiver of counsel was intelligent and understanding. <em>See State v. Meyrick, </em>313 Or 125, 134, 831 P2d 666 (1992) (\u201c[T]he record as a whole [must] show[] that the defendant knew of his or her right to counsel and that the waiver of counsel was an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of that known right.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Whether defendant\u2019s self-representation request was unequivocal presents a closer question, and one that we need not decide.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even assuming that defendant\u2019s self-representation request was unequivocal, intelligent, and understanding, it was within the discretion of the trial court to deny the midtrial request if the court concluded that the timing of the change or other consequences of the self-representation would be disruptive of the orderly conduct of the trial in a way that would be unreasonable under the circumstances. <em>See Blanchard, </em>236 Or App at 476 (\u201cThe right to waive counsel is subject to the condition that self-representation not result in the disruption of the orderly conduct of the trial.\u201d); <em>State v. Greenough, </em>8 Or App 86, 92, 493 P2d 59 (1972) (a choice of counsel must be accommodated by the court unless \u201cit will result in * * * a disruption of the orderly processes of justice unreasonable under the circumstances of the particular case\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Thus, defendant is incorrect in contending that a trial court lacks any discretion to deny an unequivocal, knowing, and intelligent request for self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Defendant alternatively contends that \u201c[t]here is no indication in the record that defendant\u2019s self-representation\u201d would be disruptive under <em>Blanchard </em>and, consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>that the trial court lacked discretion to deny the request. We determined in <em>Koller v. Schmaing, </em>254 Or App 115, 296 P3d 529 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 445 (2013), albeit in a civil trial context that concerned a statutory right of self-representation, that the record was insufficient to support the conclusion that an allowance of self-representation would be disruptive. Accordingly, we concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the request. <em>Id. </em>at 138-42. There, a counterclaim individual defendant in a wrongful discharge case sought to represent himself and to discharge his attorney on the ninth day of the trial. The attorney had represented both defendant and the corporate defendant, with whom defendant was aligned as a principal, in the defense of the counterclaim. The court denied the request on the ground that the only defendant was a corporation and could not be represented in court by a lay person. <em>Id. </em>at 121-23; <em>see </em>ORS 9.320 (\u201cAny action, suit, or proceeding may be prosecuted or defended by a party in person, or by attorney, except that the state or a corporation appears by attorney in all cases, unless otherwise specifically provided by law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The trial court in <em>Koller </em>was wrong; there were two defendants, and the self-representation demand came from the natural person. Much later, the court rationalized its decision in findings adopted in a corrected judgment stating that the defendant\u2019s \u201cparticipation in the role of counsel could be disruptive to the proceedings [.] \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126-27. Given the context of that case \u2014 that is, that the defendant was an unlicensed attorney, had actively participated in the trial by addressing the court directly on a number of occasions, would be assisted by counsel\u2019s continued representation of the corporate defendant, and sought self-representation near the end of the trial \u2014 we concluded that the court\u2019s concerns about a potential disruption of the proceedings were \u201cnot substantiated in the appellate record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Here, in contrast to <em>Koller, </em>the court\u2019s concerns that defendant\u2019s self-representation would be unreasonably disruptive of the orderly conduct of the trial were supported by the record. The court denied defendant\u2019s request, in part, because \u201c[c]ounsel has represented you in this matter. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>case has proceeded before the jury. * * * We are not going to stop the trial. It has proceeded. We\u2019ve selected a jury and he\u2019s going to continue to be your attorney. That\u2019s the Court\u2019s Order.\u201d We understand the court\u2019s order to have included the implicit conclusion that defendant\u2019s request would likely be disruptive because it would delay the progress of the trial. (\u201cWe are not going to stop the trial.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">That concern was substantiated in the record. Defendant\u2019s oral request for self-representation was made during argument on June 8 regarding the June 7 request for a continuance of the trial and for allowance of withdrawal of counsel. Bons noted to the court that the self-representation request was part of the request for a continuance and that it was pertinent \u201cto [the withdrawal and trial continuance] request [.]\u201d Defendant had made a related request for change of counsel with a continuance motion on the first day of trial. It was reasonable for the court to conclude that defendant\u2019s oral self-representation request was coupled with and contingent upon an allowance of defendant\u2019s pending demand for a continuance of the trial. That delay, once trial had commenced, would have been disruptive of the orderly process of trial, particularly given that the prosecution\u2019s case had not ended and that the trial was only of short duration. Moreover, the request reiterated a trial continuance demand that had been repeatedly denied over the past few days. In the circumstances of this case, the record supports the court\u2019s implicit conclusion that the requested shift in representation would have been disruptive of the orderly conduct of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\"> ORS 136.070 requires that a motion for postponement be made before a case \u201cis called for trial.\u201d It provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u201c[w]hen a case is at issue upon a question of fact and before the same is called for trial, the court may, upon sufficient cause shown by the affidavit of the defendant or the statement of the district attorney, direct the trial to be postponed for a reasonable period of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Defendant\u2019s June 4 and 7 postponement requests were untimely under ORS 136.070.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\"> The Sixth Amendment provides that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d Article I, section 11, states, in pertinent part, that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right * * * to be heard by himself and counsel * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\"> We interpret defendant\u2019s claim of error to be based entirely on Article I, section 11. To whatever extent defendant\u2019s claim rests on the Sixth Amendment, it lacks merit. Federal courts have broad discretion to deny an untimely self-representation request under the Sixth Amendment and generally have held that a request made during a trial is untimely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\"><em>\u201cFaretta </em>stressed that the request [for self-representation] in that case was made \u2018well before the date of trial.\u2019 This suggests that, at some point, a request might be so disruptive of the orderly schedule of proceedings as to justify rejection on that ground alone. Provided [the] defendant does not demand additional time to prepare, lower courts generally deem pro se motions to be timely as long as they are made before trial. On the other hand, the trial court is recognized as having broad discretion to reject as untimely a request made during the course of the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Wayne R.
