Father appeals from a permanency judgment in which the juvenile court (1) continued the permanency plan for reunifying father and R and (2) determined that father had not made sufficient progress for R to safely return home, despite reasonable efforts by the Department of Human Services (DHS). The court determined that DHS\u2019s reunification efforts had been reasonable even though the agency had declined to provide father with a psychosexual evaluation, which was needed \u201cto determine whether he present [ed] a danger\u201d to R. On appeal, father challenges both the juvenile court\u2019s \u201creasonable efforts\u201d and \u201csufficient progress\u201d determinations. We conclude that the juvenile court did not consider all pertinent circumstances when it evaluated whether DHS had made reasonable efforts to reunite father and R and, moreover, that the record does not include evidence that would support a \u201creasonable efforts\u201d determination based on the totality of the circumstances. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Father does not ask us to exercise our discretion to conduct <em>de novo </em>review, and we perceive no reason to do so. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (this court will exercise discretion to try the cause anew on the record only in exceptional cases). Accordingly, we apply the same standards of review that we did in <em>Dept. of Human Services v. J. F. D., </em>255 Or App 742, 744, 298 P3d 653 (2013), another case in which we reviewed a juvenile court\u2019s \u201creasonable efforts\u201d determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">\u201cWe review findings of fact (for example, what DHS did or did not do) for any evidence, and conclusions of law (in particular, whether the historical facts constitute reasonable efforts) for legal error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\"><em>See also Dept. of Human Services v. T. C. A., </em>251 Or App 407, 414-15, 283 P3d 956, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 665 (2012) (\u201cWe review the court\u2019s [reasonable efforts] determination under ORS 419B.476(2) for legal error ***.\u201d); <em>Dept. of Human Services v. N. S., </em>246 Or App 341, 344, 265 P3d 792 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 586 (2012) (we are bound by the court\u2019s findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>historical fact if there is \u201cany evidence\u201d in the record to support them).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">We state the facts consistently with the juvenile court\u2019s findings, supplemented by uncontroverted information in the record, <em>T. C. A., </em>251 Or App at 410, and we focus on those events that are relevant to father. R was born in 2007 and is father\u2019s only child with mother. As of April 2011, DHS had jurisdiction over R based on mother\u2019s circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In February 2012, DHS filed a new petition alleging additional bases for jurisdiction relating to father, who was incarcerated and had not had regular contact with R:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">\u201c1. The father *** is currently incarcerated and unavailable to parent in the foreseeable future. This condition places the child under a threat of harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201c2. The father *** is a convicted, untreated sex offender. This condition places the child under a threat of harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">\u201c3. The father * * * [was] unable to maintain a parent-child relationship and has failed to maintain regular contact with the child. This condition places the child under a threat of harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The juvenile court found that the state had proved the first two allegations and entered a new jurisdictional judgment. At an October 2012 permanency hearing concerning R and his half-siblings, who were then in foster care,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> DHS requested a six-month extension of the permanency plan of reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">At the time of the permanency hearing, father was incarcerated at the Warner Creek Correctional Facility in Lakeview on convictions related to sexual contact he had with a minor female over two years, beginning when she was 15 years old and he was 25. Father expected to be released in November 2013. While in prison, father had completed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>courses on parenting and anger management, and he also had enrolled in a \u201ccognitive thinking errors\u201d group. DHS had allowed father to write to R while he was incarcerated, and father had sent \u201ca couple\u201d of letters by the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">A DHS caseworker testified at the permanency hearing that R had met father when R was an infant, but did not remember him at the time of the hearing. Consequently, the caseworker agreed, services aimed at developing a relationship between the two would \u201cbe a good thing.\u201d DHS wanted father to visit with R, but the agency \u201cwould ask that [father] complete [a psychosexual evaluation] prior to engaging in visitation * * * because [it] would want to determine whether or not he would be a threat of harm to [R\u2019s] safety.\u201d According to the caseworker, the results of that evaluation would determine whether father could safely have visitation with R \u2014 either in prison or after his release \u2014 or would first need services:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\u201cIf the psychosexual recommends that there are no risk factors, that there is no worry of * * * any kind of threat of harm to [R], then *** we\u2019d look at visitation at that time; however, * * * if [the evaluation] says that there is a risk factor, then we would have to, based on the recommendations of that evaluation, if there\u2019s services that [might] eradicate the risk, then we would definitely ask [father] to do services at that point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The caseworker also testified that, given R\u2019s attachment issues and \u201csexualized behaviors,\u201d R might need his own assessment before DHS could approve visitation. The caseworker opined that undergoing a psychosexual evaluation was the \u201ckey element\u201d in father progressing toward reunification with R.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Nonetheless, the caseworker acknowledged, father had not yet been evaluated. Although the caseworker had found one doctor who was willing to evaluate father at the Lakeview prison, that doctor wanted to perform the evaluation on a Saturday, and, according to the caseworker, father\u2019s prison counselor \u201cdidn\u2019t know if that was feasible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">In addition, the caseworker explained, the doctor with whom she had spoken would charge $5,000 to perform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>psychosexual evaluation while father was incarcerated, in comparison to the \u201cless than $1,000\u201d that DHS usually would pay for such an evaluation. The caseworker speculated that the higher cost might relate to the doctor\u2019s travel expenses or to his desire to perform the evaluation on a weekend. Because of the high proposed charge, the caseworker still was searching for other doctors and thus was \u201cstill looking into the logistics of making a psychosexual happen here[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Father objected to DHS\u2019s apparent plan to delay the psychosexual evaluation, pointing out that he would be released in a year, and declaring that a \u201cclean psychosexual evaluation\u201d was likely \u201cunder the circumstances and nature of his conviction [.]\u201d Father asserted that, after the evaluation, he would \u201cbe in a position to be a parental resource * * * for [R] within a relatively short period of time upon his release.\u201d He argued that \u201cthe one roadblock\u201d to his progress towards reunification was the delay in obtaining the psycho-sexual evaluation and, therefore, that DHS should arrange for the evaluation to occur promptly, despite the cost. For its part, DHS responded that it had a \u201climited pot from which to take money\u201d for evaluations and that, without undue harm to father\u2019s reunification plan, he could wait to undergo a \u201cmore reasonably priced\u201d evaluation after his release. According to DHS, $5,000 \u201cwould probably be the cost of two or three psychosexual examinations where a father or a parent was out of prison.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The juvenile court decided that DHS was not required to pay $5,000 to have father evaluated in prison:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201c[W]ith respect to the issue of reasonableness and the $5,000, * * * the objection is denied. I think it is \u2014 if it\u2019s that sort of cost, that the State should not be required to expend the funds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Thus, the court determined that DHS\u2019s efforts toward reunification had been reasonable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">\u201cDHS has made, for [R], reasonable efforts *** to make it possible for the ward[ ] to safely return home. *** For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>[father], those efforts include: Communication with father\u2019s prison counselor regarding available programs for father and inquiring whether it would be feasible to arrange for father to have a psychosexual evaluation while in prison. [R] also may communicate through letters and [DHS] will determine in the future whether it will be healthy for the ward to visit father in prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">\u2021 * <em>ifc </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">\u201cReasonable efforts do not require [DHS] to offer [father] a psychosexual evaluation while he is in prison if the cost is $5,000. If the cost is reasonable and feasible, [father] will submit to a psychosexual evaluation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The court also concluded that father had not made sufficient progress toward reunification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">\u201c[Father] has not made sufficient progress to make it possible for the ward to safe[l]y return home. Father is incarcerated and will not be released for another year. Father is a sex offender and needs a psychosexual examination to determine whether he presents a danger to the ward.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Ultimately, the court granted DHS\u2019s request for a six-month extension of the permanency plan for reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">On appeal, father does not challenge the juvenile court\u2019s extension of the reunification plan, but he does assign error to the court\u2019s determinations about DHS\u2019s efforts and his progress. In his first assignment of error, father argues that the court erred in determining that DHS had made reasonable efforts to make reunification possible. According to father, because DHS had made the psychosexual evaluation a prerequisite for visitation with R, it should have arranged for father to be evaluated \u201cwithin a reasonable <em>time\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., while he was incarcerated \u2014 and, because the timing of the evaluation was critical, \u201cregardless of cost.\u201d In response, DHS asserts that its postponement of the evaluation was reasonable because the only doctor who had expressed willingness to evaluate father at the Lakeview prison had demanded payment of \u201cmore than five times the amount that DHS usually pays for evaluations outside of prison [,]\u201d so the caseworker had continued to search for a provider willing to evaluate father at a lower cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Our analysis of the parties\u2019 arguments begins with ORS 419B.476, which governs permanency hearings. The statute provides that, when \u201cthe case plan at the time of the hearing is to reunify the family,\u201d the court must \u201cdetermine whether [DHS] has made reasonable efforts *** and whether the parent has made sufficient progress to make it possible for the ward to safely return home.\u201d ORS 419B.476(2)(a). In making that determination, \u201cthe court shall consider the ward\u2019s health and safety the paramount concerns.\u201d ORS 419B.476(2)(a). As we have explained, \u201c[t]he type and sufficiency of efforts that the state is required to make and whether the types of actions it requires parents to make are reasonable depends on the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Frazier, </em>152 Or App 568, 582, 955 P2d 272, <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 305 (1998); see, <em>e.g., id. </em>at 583 (concluding that DHS\u2019s efforts were reasonable where \u201c[t]he record established] that [the] father was offered significant opportunities to develop and demonstrate his parenting skills and to improve his mental condition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The difficulty with both parties\u2019 positions on appeal, as well as with the juvenile court\u2019s analysis, is that they do not grapple with <em>all </em>of the pertinent circumstances. Certainly the expense associated with provision of services is a factor that DHS and the courts reasonably may consider; we reject without further discussion father\u2019s suggestion that DHS must \u201cfund the services it required, regardless of cost.\u201d However, we also reject DHS\u2019s suggestion that evidence of a greater-than-usual cost in providing services aimed at reunification is enough, standing alone, to justify a decision not to provide those services. Rather, when a parent complains that DHS has not provided adequate services, a court making a \u201creasonable efforts\u201d determination must consider not only the burdens that the state would shoulder in providing those services, but also what benefit might reasonably be expected to flow from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Several of our cases highlight the importance of considering whether a parent is likely to benefit from a service. For example, when a parent is unable to benefit from services or has demonstrated an unwillingness to participate in programs, DHS may reasonably stop providing those services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>or decide not to provide others. <em>See, e.g., Dept. of Human Services v. S. N., </em>250 Or App 708, 717, 282 P3d 901, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 564 (2012) (trial court did not err in determining that DHS\u2019s efforts were reasonable, despite agency\u2019s decision not to provide the father with mental health treatment that a psychologist opined would \u201cinvariably be low yield\u201d); <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. J. A. C., </em>216 Or App 268, 280, 172 P3d 295 (2007) (DHS\u2019s efforts \u201cwere more than reasonable\u201d despite having stopped its provision of mentoring services, because there was \u201clittle evidence that mentoring sessions were effective and no evidence\u201d that the mother would have benefited from certain other services); <em>Frazier, </em>152 Or App at 583, 588 (DHS\u2019s efforts were reasonable even though it had declined to provide the father with therapy, because he had not requested that service and had failed to take advantage of other services).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Conversely, except in specific circumstances not applicable here,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> DHS must at least \u201cattempt [] to engage and work with\u201d parents, even those who are incarcerated. <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Williams, </em>204 Or App 496, 508, 130 P3d 801 (2006). In doing so, DHS must give the parents a reasonable opportunity \u201cto demonstrate their ability to adjust their conduct and become minimally adequate parents ***.\u201d <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Shugars, </em>208 Or App 694, 717-18, 145 P3d 354 (2006). And, in general, that is true even when the agency will bear the expense of providing the necessary services. <em>See State ex rel SOSCF v. Burke, </em>164 Or App 178, 191, 990 P2d 922 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 138 (2000) (DHS\u2019s efforts were unreasonable where it declined to pay for ongoing sex offender treatment that was \u201ca requirement for family reunification\u201d and the cost of which \u201cpresent [ed] an insurmountable barrier to the integration of children into father\u2019s home\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">DHS\u2019s obligation to make reasonable efforts toward reunification does not, of course, mean that the agency must provide <em>every </em>service that conceivably could benefit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>parent, regardless of expense or other burdens. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. A. D., </em>255 Or App 567, 577, 300 P3d 185 (2013). The ultimate question remains, instead, whether DHS\u2019s efforts have been reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>But in answering that question, a court must consider the <em>totality </em>of the circumstances, including both the costs associated with providing services and whether the parent is likely to benefit from services in a way that would increase the chances of family reunification. Put bluntly, when a parent contends that DHS\u2019s efforts have not been reasonable because the agency has declined to provide a particular service, the court\u2019s \u201creasonable efforts\u201d determination should include something resembling a cost-benefit analysis, at least when \u2014 as here \u2014 the agency itself has deemed that service to be \u201ckey\u201d to the reunification plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The record in this case does not reflect that sort of analysis. Rather, in concluding that DHS\u2019s efforts were reasonable, the juvenile court appears to have considered only the cost of performing the psychosexual evaluation while father is incarcerated, and not the potential benefits of providing that evaluation promptly, instead of waiting until he is released. Although the record in this case is not extensive, it includes assertions by father\u2019s attorney that evaluating father at the correctional facility, rather than after his release, could meaningfully advance his progress towards reunification with R. The results of such an in-prison evaluation might lead to father getting sex-offender treatment or could, instead, allow him to begin visitation with R immediately. But it appears that neither of those things can happen until father receives the evaluation. Consequently, delaying the evaluation until father is released from prison may significantly postpone \u2014 and therefore lessen the chances of\u2014 family reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Given the importance of the psychosexual evaluation to the reunification plan, the juvenile court should have considered the extent to which the family might benefit if father received a psychosexual evaluation promptly, instead of waiting a year to be evaluated after his release. In other words, the court should have considered the totality of the circumstances related to the reasonableness of DHS\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>reunification efforts, including both the potential benefits of providing services and the burden of associated costs. The record does not reflect such an analysis. Moreover, the parties did not proffer any evidence regarding the potential benefits (or lack thereof) of promptly providing father with a psychosexual evaluation that would support a determination, properly based on the totality of the circumstances, that DHS had made \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to make it possible for R to return home. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">In his second assignment of error, father contends that the juvenile court erred in determining that he had not made sufficient progress toward reunification. Because our resolution of father\u2019s first assignment of error is dispositive, we do not reach his second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-10\"> By that time, DHS had removed R and his half-siblings from mother\u2019s care on several occasions, initially because of domestic violence committed in their presence, and later because of mother\u2019s substance abuse, issues with domestic violence, neglect of the children, and history of involvement with the agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-11\"> DHS had returned R and his half-siblings to mother\u2019s care in March 2012. In August 2012, the agency once again removed the children from mother\u2019s home because she and her newborn had both tested positive for methamphetamine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\"> At the hearing, no one questioned the apparent discrepancy between the caseworker\u2019s initial testimony that a psychosexual evaluation typically costs less than $1,000 and the state\u2019s later assertion that $5,000 would probably cover the cost of \u201ctwo or three\u201d evaluations performed outside the prison setting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b439-6\"> Under ORS 419B.340(5), the juvenile court may find that DHS is not required to make reasonable efforts toward reunification if certain aggravated circumstances exist, if the parent has been convicted of certain crimes, or if the parent\u2019s rights to another child have been terminated involuntarily. No party contends that ORS 419B.340(5) applies in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
