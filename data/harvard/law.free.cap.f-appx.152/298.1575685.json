Ellis\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising the issue of whether the district court committed plain error in determining the loss amount under the sentencing guidelines when it failed to apply a credit against the loss for the amount of collateral pledged or otherwise provided by Ellis. Ellis filed pro se supplemental briefing further addressing this issue and raising the issue of whether his sentence constituted plain error under <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>- U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm Ellis\u2019s conviction but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">Because Ellis raised no objection at sentencing, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). \u2018We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal interpretation of the term \u2018loss\u2019 under the Sentencing Guidelines, but \u2018to the extent that the determination of the amount of loss is a factual matter, we review only for clear error.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Castner, </em>50 F.3d 1267, 1274 (4th Cir.1995) (citations omitted). To the extent the district court\u2019s determination of Ellis\u2019s sentence under the former mandatory guidelines system was based on facts not established by his plea of guilty or admitted by him, we will find plain error if the district court could not have imposed the sentence it did without exceeding the relevant Sixth Amendment limitation. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 550-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">Under <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2B1.1 app. n. 3(A) (2003), \u201closs is the greater of actual loss or intended loss.\u201d Where there is a common scheme or course of conduct, the cumulative loss should be used in determining the offense level, regardless of the number of counts of conviction. USSG \u00a7 2B1.1 app. n. 17. We have held \u201cthat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>amount recovered or reasonably anticipated to be recovered from collateral that secures a loan should be considered in calculating the amount of actual loss.\u201d <em>United States v. Rothberg, </em>954 F.2d 217, 219 (4th Cir.1992); <em>see also </em>USSG \u00a7 2B1.1 app. n. 3(E)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">In this case, Ellis acknowledged at his change of plea hearing that the loss amounts from dismissed counts could be considered for guideline and restitution purposes, and he cooperated with the Government in determining the loss amounts involved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on those figures, the actual loss under the guidelines was $64,182.07. However, the district court determined his sentence based on a loss amount of $134,450.35, without the required reduction for recovery of collateral. Ellis\u2019s counsel suggests that \u201c[b]eeause it is not clear that Ellis intended to repay the banks and keep them from suffering any loss, the district court did not commit error in failing to reduce the guideline loss amount by the value of the recovered collateral.\u201d However, while the district court could have determined that Ellis\u2019s intended loss exceeded the actual loss, no such finding appears anywhere in the record. Moreover, to the extent the district court made such a finding, it would be based on facts not established by Ellis\u2019s plea of guilty or admitted by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and find no basis upon which Ellis\u2019s conviction can be attacked. We conclude, however, that the district court plainly erred in sentencing Ellis based on a loss exceeding the actual loss amount of $64,182.07. Accordingly, we affirm Ellis\u2019s conviction, but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-18\">. The Government elected not to file a brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\">. We agree with Ellis that the record does not reflect any agreement to forego a credit under USSG \u00a7 2B1.1 app. n. 3(E)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\">. Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \"consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range ... and reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
