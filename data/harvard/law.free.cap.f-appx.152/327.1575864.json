We affirm Price\u2019s conviction, but vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Price pled guilty and does not challenge his conviction. Price claims the district court erred m failing to treat the sentencrng guidehnes as advisory when imposmg his sentence. As Price properly raised tMs issue m the district court by objectmg to his sentence based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review for harmless error. The Government bears the burden in harmless error review of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003). The Government did not meet this burden because the district court gave no indication what the sentence would have been had the district court not been bound by the guidehnes. We would have to speculate that the district court\u2019s error m thinking itself bound by the guidehnes did not affect the sentence. In hght of <em>Booker, </em>we vacate Price\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Although the sentenemg gradelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determme the appropriate sentencing range under the guidehnes, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (applying <em>Booker </em>on plain error review). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidehnes range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented m the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-9\"> Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Price\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
