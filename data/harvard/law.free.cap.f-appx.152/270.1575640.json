Davidson appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Defendants in Davidson\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) suit. The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation in which he recommended granting summary judgment to Defendants. The district court adopted the report and recommendation, finding that Davidson failed to file specific objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-17\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); see <em>also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). On appeal, Davidson does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that her objections were merely general. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b) (failure to raise claim in informal brief waives consideration of that claim). Accordingly, we conclude that Davidson has waived appellate review of both the substance of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and the district court\u2019s construction of her objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-18\">Thus, we affirm the order of the district court. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
