Castillo-Hernandez argues that the district court erred when it applied a six-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C)(i) because the social secu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>rity number that he attempted to use to obtain a port access clearance badge did not belong to an \u201cactual individual\u201d as that term is used by the guidelines, because the number was assigned to a person who died almost 30 years before Castillo-Hernandez committed the criminal offense. Castillo-Hernandez contends that there is no ambiguity in the word \u201cactual,\u201d which means existing and not merely potential or possible. Thus, he argues that an actual individual could not include a person who died almost 30 years ago. Castillo-Hernandez further argues that his reading of the term \u201cactual individual\u201d is supported by the reasons underlying the enhancement, which is designed to punish the defendant for harm, such as a damaged credit rating, damage to an individual\u2019s reputation, inconvenience, and other difficulties, that a victim of identity theft may face. Castillo-Hernandez argues that these harms, and thus the reason for applying the sentencing enhancement, are not present where the means of identification used belonged to a deceased person.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court properly applied \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C)(i) to Castillo-Hernandez\u2019s underlying conduct. <em>See United States v. Spell, </em>44 F.3d 936, 938 (11th Cir.1995). Section 2B1.1 states that if \u201cthe offense involved ... the unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of identification ... increase by 2 levels. If the resulting offense level is less than level 12, increase to level 12.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C)(i) (2003). \u201c \u2018Means of identification\u2019 has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7), except that such means of identification <em>shall be an actual (ie., not fictitious) individual, </em>other than the defendant.]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 8 (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Auguste, </em>392 F.3d 1266, 1267-68 (11th Cir.2004) (affirming the enhancement where the defendant had used her own name on the credit cards that she obtained by using the living victim\u2019s existing lines of credit and did not open new lines of credit).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">We have held that the language in the sentencing guidelines is to be given its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>United States v. Pompey, </em>17 F.3d 351, 354 (11th Cir.1994). Thus, because \u201ci.e.\u201d is an abbreviation for \u201cthat is\u201d or \u201cthat is to say,\u201d the plain meaning of the language used by Congress was that \u201cnot fictitious\u201d was the exclusive definition for \u201cactual.\u201d <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 511 (6th ed.1991). <em>See also United States v. Bush, </em>404 F.3d 263, 267 (4th Cir.2005) (affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction for using a false social security number to obtain a car loan, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B), where the social security number used was assigned to a deceased person). Accordingly, in light of the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cactual <em>(ie., </em>not fictitious),\u201d we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">In addition, we reject Castillo-Hernandez\u2019s\u2019s argument that the enhancement should not apply because he did not actually obtain a port access clearance badge. The policy of the guidelines is to provide a lesser punishment for an attempt, <em>\u201cunless </em>the defendant completed all the acts the defendant believed necessary for successful completion of the substantive offense <em>or the circumstances demonstrate that the defendant was about to complete all such acts but for apprehension </em>or interruption by some similar event beyond the defendant\u2019s control.\u201d U.S.S.G. 2Xl.l(b)(l) (emphasis added). In this case, Appellant was apprehended just before he completed all of the acts and so under the guidelines, his actions do not constitute an attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-31\">.
