On appeal, Reid asserts that his sentence was unreasonable because the court did not consider his inability to participate in the Bureau of Prison\u2019s drug treatment program when it imposed its sentence. Because the sentence is not unreasonable, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b907-18\">Reid was charged in a two-count indictment with (1) unlawful reentry into the United States following deportation for commission of an aggravated felony in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 and (2) willful misrepresentation of his citizenship in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911. The government agreed to dismiss the second count after sentencing, and Reid pled guilty to the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-19\">At his sentencing hearing, the court sentenced Reid to 37 months and observed that the sentence was at the low end of the Sentencing Guidelines range: \u201cPursuant to the <em>Booker </em>decision, I have considered the [Guidelines, although I recognize they are advisory, however, I do believe the [Guidelines in this case are reasonable, particularly given consideration of the other factors in 3553.\u201d R3 at 5. Reid noted at the hearing that the presentence investigation report was mistaken in claiming that he had been deported more than once. The court replied,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-20\">The factor that I was looking at in terms of coming back is not present. But I still don\u2019t see, given the criminal history of the defendant, why the guidelines, the low end of the guidelines, don\u2019t produce a reasonable sentence. So I am going to maintain the 37 month sentence. But thank you for correcting that misapprehension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-21\">R3 at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-22\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B), the Bureau of Prisons may reduce an inmate\u2019s sentence up to a year for successful completion of a drug rehabilitation program. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Reid has a history of substance abuse and planned to request admission to the program. At the hearing, the probation officer incorrectly reported that the drug rehabilitation program had been terminated because of funding. Reid noted that the end of the program made moot his request for admission to it. When Reid discovered that the program was still available, he moved to reopen his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Reid argued that his sentence should be reduced by 12 months, because he was unable to participate in the program. He does not specify whether his request is premised on being denied access to the program because of the misinformation at the hearing or because he believes that he is ineligible for the program because of his alien status. Reid would not be denied access to the drug rehab program, but he is ineligible for a reduction in his sentence, because he is an illegal alien. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58(a)(1)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">In denying Reid\u2019s motion, the court explained: \u201cAt the sentencing hearing, I considered and discussed all the information provided by the parties, including the Defendant\u2019s alien status disqualifying him from participating in the BOP treatment program. After considering all the relevant factors, I imposed a sentence at the low end of the guideline range.\u201d Rl-35. Arguing that the denial of his motion to reduce his sentence after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is unreasonable, Reid appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Reid argues that he would be eligible for a 12-month reduction of his sentence if he could participate in the prison drug treatment program and that, because of the advisory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines, the court should have compensated him for being unable to participate by reducing his sentencing by at least 12 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that the court\u2019s error violated <em>Booker, </em>which requires a court to consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) in formulating a reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of the right to a jury trial. 125 S.Ct. at 749 \u2014 51. The Court explained: \u201cWithout the \u2018mandatory\u2019 provision, the Act nonetheless requires judges to take account of the Guidelines together with other sentencing goals\u201d contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>Section 3553(a) instructs district courts imposing a sentence to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense; the history and characteristics of the defendant; the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense; and the kinds of sentences and sentencing range established by the Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">We \u201creview for unreasonableness\u201d sentences imposed after <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 765 (quotation and alteration omitted); <em>see also United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that <em>\u201cBooker </em>established a \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard for the sentence finally imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>on a defendant\u201d). We do \u201cnot expect the district court in every case to conduct an accounting of every \u00a7 3553(a) factor ... and expound upon how each factor played a role in its sentencing decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The district court is obligated, however, \u201cto calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">In <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>we conducted a review of an appellant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness and explained that the sentence must be reasonable in the context of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). 422 F.3d 1241, 1244-45 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). In conducting our review, we stated: \u201c[W]e do not apply the reasonableness standard to each individual decision made during the sentencing process; rather, we review the final sentence for reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We declined to address whether sentences within the Guidelines range were <em>per se </em>reasonable, holding that, based on the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the sentence was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">The same analysis applies in this case. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court applied the Guidelines in an advisory fashion and considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing Reid\u2019s sentence. Although the court did not detail the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a) or the weight it had accorded to each factor, it is not required to do so. <em>See Robles, </em>408 F.3d at 1328. Furthermore, once the probation officer corrected the misinformation about whether a drug treatment program still existed, the court, in its order denying the motion to reopen Reid\u2019s sentencing, clarified that it <em>had </em>considered Reid\u2019s ability to participate in the drug rehabilitation program in calculating his sentence. Given these considerations, we do not consider the Reid\u2019s sentence to be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Reid has appealed his 37-month sentence, following his conviction for unlawful entry into the United States by a convicted felon. After considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed a sentence at the low end of Guidelines range. As we have explained, when viewed in its totality, Reid\u2019s 37-month sentence is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-8\">. Reid's argument is misleading. He would be eligible for the program, but not for the 12-month sentence reduction. The sentence reduction is merely an option for the Bureau of Prisons, which denies, as a matter of course, such reductions to prisoners who have a detainer lodged against them by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Thus, Reid is not entitled to a reduction, and there is no other argument that the court miscalculated his sentencing range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
