We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Zaidi v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 678, 680-81 (7th Cir. 2004) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Manga\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-17\">While we lack jurisdiction to consider the Board\u2019s ruling on the asylum claim, we retain jurisdiction to consider the denial of Manga\u2019s request for withholding of removal. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2005). \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Based on our review of the record, we find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s holding, as affirmed by the Board, that Manga failed to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-18\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-19\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-13\"> As Manga failed to raise a Convention Against Torture claim before the Board, we lack jurisdiction over any challenge to the denial of such protection. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. </em>denied, -U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
