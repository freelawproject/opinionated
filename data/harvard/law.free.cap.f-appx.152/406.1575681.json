Rodriguez was sentenced to a 68-month term of imprisonment and to a three-year period of supervised release and was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine. Rodriguez gave timely notice of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Rodriguez contends that the district court erred in attributing to him at sentencing a quantity of material that was byproduct and \u201conly contained some quantity of the drug that may have not been useable or distributable.\u201d He contends that the byproduct or \u201cbones\u201d should not have been considered in determining his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">There is no evidence in the record showing that the byproduct was not a \u201cmixture or substance\u201d as defined by the guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), comment. (n.A). As there is no testimony on the subject whatsoever, the district court\u2019s determination that the \u201cbones\u201d should be included as a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine is plausible in light of the record as a whole, and is therefore not clearly erroneous. <em>See United, States v. Parker, </em>133 F.3d 322, 330 (5th Cir.1998). The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b429-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-11\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
