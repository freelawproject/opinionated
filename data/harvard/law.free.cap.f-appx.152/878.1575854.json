Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Appellant\u2019s convictions and 360-month sentence, as well as the imposition of a $10,000 fine, for distribution, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), and possession with intent to distribute cocaine (powder), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C). <em>See United States v. Baxter, </em>127 Fed.Appx. 471 (11th Cir.2005) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">In his initial brief, Appellant challenged the denial of his motion to suppress, the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction, and the district court\u2019s imposition of a $10,000 fine. Notably, Appellant did not assert error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any other case extending or applying the <em>Apprendi </em>principle. In <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 962, 121 S.Ct. 2621, 150 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001), after the Supreme Court\u2019s remand with instructions to reconsider our opinion in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-9\">Nothing in the <em>Apprendi </em>opinion requires or suggests that we are obligated to consider an issue not raised in any of the briefs that appellant has filed with us. Nor is there anything in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, which is cast in the usual language, requiring that we treat the case as though the <em>Apprendi </em>issue had been timely raised in this Court. In the absence of any requirement to the contrary in either <em>Apprendi </em>or in the order remanding this case to us, we apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 990 (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cDefendant abandoned the <em>[Apprendi </em>] indictment issue by not raising the issue in his initial brief.\u201d). We extended the foregoing rule to preclude untimely challenges based on <em>Booker. See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>No. 05-5714 (Oct. 11, 2005). In his initial brief in this case, Appellant asserted no such <em>Apprendi </em>(or its progeny) challenge to his sentence. Accordingly, we reinstate our previous opinion in this case and affirm, once again, Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">OPINION REINSTATED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b901-13\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge, specially concurring.</judges>\n<author id=\"b901-14\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b901-15\">The court declines to consider appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim on the merits because appellant failed to present the claim in his initial brief on appeal. Binding precedent, <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>and <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>which the court properly cites, requires us to disregard the claim for that reason. I therefore concur in the court\u2019s judgment. Were we no bound by such precedent, I would, for the reasons I have previously expressed, entertain appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim on the merits. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>2005 WL 1744939, 2005 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>U.S.App. LEXIS, at *17 (11th Cir. July 8, 2005).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
