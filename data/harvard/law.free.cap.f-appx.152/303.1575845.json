See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b326-4\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Obafemi Smart Olubuyimo appeals his conviction and eighteen month sentence imposed following a jury trial for possession of an immigration permit, plate or impression, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a) (2000); and his conviction and eighteen month sentence imposed following a plea of guilty for failure to appear, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(a)(1) (2000). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Olubuyimo first claims that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for knowing possession of counterfeit immigration plates. Upon a careful review of the record, and construing all inferences in favor of the Government, we find substantial evidence supports the verdict. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Olubuyimo next contends that the district court improperly refused his oral request to instruct the jury on spoliation of evidence. \u201cThe standard of review for determining whether the district court should have given a jury instruction is abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 384 (4th Cir.1999). \u201cA district court\u2019s refusal to provide an instruction requested by a defendant constitutes reversible error only if the instruction: \u2018(1) was correct; (2) was not substantially covered by the court\u2019s charge to the jury; and (3) dealt with some point in the trial so important, that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to conduct his defense.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>53 F.3d 29, 32 (4th Cir.1995) (citations omitted). Based on the record, we find that the district court\u2019s failure to give the spoliation instruction was not an abuse of discretion and did not seriously impair Olubuyimo\u2019s ability to conduct his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Olubuyimo also asserts that the district court prevented him from exercising his Sixth Amendment right to present a defense through: (1) limiting the examination of his witnesses; and (2) its explanation to a defense witness of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. This court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Leftenant, </em>341 F.3d 338, 342 (4th Cir.2003). Any error \u201cthat does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(a) (\u201cError may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected.\u201d). Having carefully reviewed the record in this case, we conclude that Olubuyimo failed to show that the district court abused its discretion or affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Finally, Olubuyimo claims that the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3C1.1 (2003) violated the Sixth Amendment because the enhancement was based upon facts found by the judge, not the jury. Assuming that Olubuyimo preserved this issue by objecting at his sentencing hearing based upon <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), this court\u2019s review is de novo. <em>United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003). On the facts of this case, including the district court\u2019s unambiguous statement at sentencing that it would impose an eighteen month sentence regardless of the impact of the <em>Blakely </em>decision upon the federal sentencing guidelines, we conclude that any error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Olubuyimo\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
