The district court found that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause did not apply such that he could raise his claims in \u00a7 2241 petition. On appeal, Flores argues that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d based on the claims described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-28\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). However, under limited circumstances, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255. That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-4\">[a]n application for writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">We have established that the savings clause only applies when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999); see <em>also Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365-66 (applying the three-part <em>Wofford </em>test). In order for a prisoner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy under <em>Wofford, </em>all three criteria must be satisfied. As we have made clear, all three criteria will be met in only the narrowest of circumstances. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. A petitioner may not argue actual innocence until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that the savings clause applies to his claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">The district court did not err by dismissing Flores\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. Flores is precluded from seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause does not apply. Flores has filed the present \u00a7 2241 petition in an effort to circumvent the rules limiting the scope of successive \u00a7 2255 motions. Also, Flores cannot meet the first prong of the test in <em>Wofford </em>because he has not demonstrated that his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision, and thus we need not address the remaining prongs. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">Flores also claims actual innocence. Because Flores is attempting to circumvent \u00a7 2255\u2019s prohibition against successive motions and because all of his arguments for relief fail the <em>Wofford </em>test, we need not reach the issue of actual innocence. Flores cannot establish actual innocence because he is unable to \u201copen a portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by establishing that the savings clause applies to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">Upon a review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-7\">. Moreover, Flores\u2019s claims of actual innocence are merely conclusoiy and would, in any event, be insufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
