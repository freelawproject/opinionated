He claims that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applies retroactively to cases like his on collateral review, that \u00a7 2255 relief is an inadequate or ineffective remedy to challenge his sentence, and that under <em>Booker </em>he is actually innocent. The District Court denied the \u00a7 2241 petition, holding that \u00a7 2255 was not inadequate or ineffective merely because Grecco was unsuccessful with regard to an earlier \u00a7 2255 motion he filed in 1997. The District Court determined that because Grecco had not yet presented his claims in a \u00a7 2255 motion, seeking \u00a7 2241 relief on these claims in the district of confinement was inappropriate. The District Court found that because Grecco had filed a \u00a7 2255 motion in 1997, his only avenue for pursuing the <em>Booker </em>claim was through an application to this Court for leave to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion. Grecco timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is de novo. <em>See United States v. Cleary, </em>46 F.3d 307, 309-10 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">A collateral attack upon a federal conviction and sentence raised outside the sentencing court via 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 must be rejected \u201cif it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by [\u00a7 2255] motion, to the court which sentenced him, or such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by [\u00a7 2255] motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">As the District Court explained, Grecco\u2019s claims challenging the judgment and sentence are properly raised in a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, not a petition for writ of habeas corpus under \u00a7 2241. Moreover, \u00a7 2255 is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d merely because the sentencing court has previously denied relief or because recent amendments to \u00a7 2255 have made it more difficult to pursue successive motions. Because Grecco is challenging his judgment and commitment, and because the current petition would be considered a second or successive such challenge under \u00a7 2255, he must apply for permission to file another \u00a7 2255 motion with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-16\">For these reasons, we conclude that the District Court correctly denied Grecco\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. Accordingly, because this appeal presents \u201cno substantial question,\u201d we will grant the appellees motion for summary affirmance and affirm the order of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. Grecco\u2019s motion for summary reversal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
