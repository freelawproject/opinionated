He now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress and from his 180-month sentence. Gordon\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), addressing these issues, but stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal. Gordon declined to file a pro se supplemental brief. At our direction, the parties filed supplemental briefs addressing the impact of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) on this appeal. Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm Gordon\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-17\">The district court properly denied Gordon\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence of the gun, which was discovered in a jacket that Gordon discarded as he ran from the officers. Because he had abandoned the jacket, Gordon lacked standing to challenge the search of the jacket. <em>See Abel v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 217, 241, 80 S.Ct. 683, 4 L.Ed.2d 668 (1960); <em>United States v. Flowers, </em>912 F.2d 707, 711 (4th Cir.1990). Thus, the evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"ASu\">Based on Gordon\u2019s prior convictions, the district court properly found that he qualified as an armed career criminal. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e)(1). Accordingly, Gordon\u2019s guideline sentencing range was properly determined to be 168 months to 210 months. The district court imposed the statutory minimum sentence of 180 months. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). In addition, because the record provides no nonspeculative basis suggesting that the district court would have imposed a lesser term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>supervised release under an advisory guidelines scheme, the mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines did not affect Gordon\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 216-24 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Gordon\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
