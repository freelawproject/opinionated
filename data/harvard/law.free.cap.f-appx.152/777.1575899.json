The district court denied Castra\u2019s motion after finding that it had no jurisdiction to consider it. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Following his convictions, Castra was sentenced to life imprisonment after the district court found Castra\u2019s total offense level under the 1995 Federal Sentencing Guidelines to be 40, and found his criminal history category to be IV, which provided for a sentencing range of 360 months to life. On direct appeal, he argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, the district court erred by denying his severance motions, erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence, and made improper relevant conduct determinations. His convictions and sentences were affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Subsequently, Castra filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence. In it, he raised two issues: (1) his conviction was obtained as a result of the government\u2019s violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(c)(2), making it a crime to offer anything of value to a person in exchange for testimony, and (2) ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion was denied on January 25, 2000. We subsequently denied his certificate of appealability. We have also denied two applications for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">On August 27, 2004, Castra filed in district court the present <em>pro se </em>\u201cMotion for Modification of Sentence Pursuant to Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(b)(2)(3), (B) and Pursuant to Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (FRCP).\u201d Castra argued that, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)(B), the court had authority \u201cto modify an imposed term of imprisonment to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute,\u201d and that, in certain circumstances, a \u00a7 3582 motion is treated as a \u00a7 2255 motion. Castra then argued that, through \u201cdue diligence and long investigation,\u201d he had discovered an error in the PSI\u2019s calculations of his criminal history points, and that, pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), he was improperly given a two-level enhancement for his role in the offense because the fact was not found by a jury. Thus, he argued that his offense level should have been 38 and his criminal history category II, for a guidelines\u2019 range of 262-327 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Castra also requested an evidentiary hearing. The government was never asked to respond and the district court summarily denied Castra\u2019s motion, finding that it had no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">On appeal, Castra restates the arguments he made to the district court and contends that because the district court erred in calculating his sentence, it could assert jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 to correct the errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">\u201cWhether the district court had jurisdiction to resentence [Castra] is a legal question subject to plenary review.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1315 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>(11th Cir.2002). In his original motion, Castra argued that he was entitled to re-sentencing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3582(b)(2), (b)(3), and (c)(1)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sections in 3582(b) clarify only that a judgment of conviction is a final judgment notwithstanding the fact that a sentence may later be modified pursuant to \u00a7 3582\u00a9), on appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, or by the district court pursuant to statute or Fed.R.Crim.P. 35.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3582(b). As such, they confer no rights on a criminal defendant. Section 3582(c)(1)(B) permits a district court, in its discretion, to modify a sentence only if authorized to do so by statute or Fed. R.Crim.P. 35. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The district court, upon review of Castra\u2019s motion to modify his sentence, found that it had no jurisdiction. To the extent that it found so on the basis of Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 (as specified under \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B)), it was correct, as we have held that Rule 35 is jurisdictional and, unless a district court actually corrects the error complained of within seven days of the sentence being imposed, a district court lacks jurisdiction to do so under Rule 35(c). <em>See Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1315-17. There is no dispute that Castra\u2019s sentence was imposed years before the present motion was filed. Thus, any modification by the district court would have been outside the seven-day window and, consequently, void for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">We have further held that a district court has no jurisdiction to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(b)(3), as that provision merely defines finality. <em>United States v. Stossel, </em>348 F.3d 1320, 1322 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, to the extent that Castra relied on Fed. R.Crim.P. 35 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(b)(3) as the basis for modifying his sentence, the district court correctly ruled that it had no jurisdiction to consider the claim. Aso, to the extent the district court construed the motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, it properly dismissed the motion because we have not granted permission to file such a motion, and Castra must, pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), file leave with this Court for permission to file a successive motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1316; <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number><em>Fugate v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>301 F.3d 1287, 1288 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201c[t]he district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Fugate\u2019s claim because he had not applied to this court for permission to file a successive application.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">However, in deference to Castra\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) does confer jurisdiction for a district court to modify the terms of a defendant\u2019s imprisonment and, therefore, to the extent that Castra argued that he was entitled to modification under \u00a7 3582(c), the district court\u2019s summary finding that it lacked jurisdiction requires further explanation. <em>See Stossel, </em>348 F.3d at 1322 n. 2 (noting in dicta that the district court had no jurisdiction over a <em>pro se </em>prisoner\u2019s motion whether considered under its actual label of \u00a7 3582(b)(3) or construed under any different statutory framework, including \u00a7 3582(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Under \u00a7 3582(c), a district court may only modify a defendant\u2019s terms of imprisonment in limited circumstances: (1) upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, which clearly is inapplicable here, or (2) upon motion of ... the defendant if, and only if, the Sentencing Commission, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o), lowers the sentencing range, and reducing the defendant\u2019s sentence is consistent with the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 and the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(l)-(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Castra has not alleged that the Sentencing Commission has amended and lowered his sentencing range and, therefore, the grounds he relies upon are extraneous to \u00a7 3582(c)\u2019s strict requirements. As such, Castra was not entitled to the discretionary relief of a sentence modification under any provision of \u00a7 3582(c), and the district court correctly found that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Castra\u2019s claim. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that the district court correctly found that it had no discretion to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence outside the amended guidelines range under \u00a7 3582(c) and that courts are without jurisdiction to consider extraneous sentencing issues outside the scope of \u00a7 3582).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Castra\u2019s motion and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\">. Attached with Castra\u2019s motion was a letter from the probation office indicating that Castra's criminal history points were incorrectly calculated, and that, as a result of the error, Castra\u2019s criminal history category should have been III and not IV. However, the letter also indicated that, even at criminal history category III, Castra\u2019s guidelines range would be 360 months to life imprisonment and, therefore, the error had no impact on Castra\u2019s sentencing range or the sentence actually imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-5\">. Castra also listed 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 as a grounds for modifying his sentence, but \u00a7 3742 provides the grounds on which a defendant can directly appeal his sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). This section does not grant jurisdiction to a district court to review a final sentence. Section 3742 is mentioned in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, but only to clarify that an appeal will not change the fact that the defendant's judgment of conviction is a \"final judgment\u201d for all other purposes. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3582(b)(2)-(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\">. Rule 35 provides district courts with the authority to correct or reduce a sentence when it results from, <em>inter alia, </em>\"arithmetical, technical, or other clear error,\u201d or upon a substantial assistance motion by the government. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b802-10\"><em>. </em>It is noted that the merits of Castra's claim, i.e., that his criminal history points were incorrectly calculated, is a non-constitutional claim and, as such, can be raised on collateral review only when the alleged error constitutes a \"fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice [or] an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\u201d <em>Diaz-Clark, 292 </em>F.3d at 1316 n. 4. Furthermore, to the extent Castra argues that, under <em>Booker </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>his sentence was improperly enhanced on facts not found by a jury, we have held that neither <em>Booker, </em>nor <em>Blakely, </em>applies retroactively on collateral review. <em>See Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 866-67 (11th Cir.2005) (initial \u00a7 2255 proceedings); <em>In re Anderson, </em>396 F.3d 1336, 1339-40 (11th Cir. 2005) (second or successive applications).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b803-7\">. It is noted that \u00a7 3582(c) motions are continuations of criminal proceedings and not post-conviction civil actions. <em>See United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
