On appeal, Singer argues that the district court erred by: (1) denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the government presented insufficient evidence to show that federally-insured banks, as opposed to non-bank entities, were the actual or intended victims of the criminal scheme; (2) miscalculating the fraud-loss amount under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l); (3) assessing a four-level leadership-role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a); (4) applying a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C) for the use of a means of identification to unlawfully produce other means of identification; and (5) ordering that restitution be paid to the defrauded merchants.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-19\">We review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction. <em>United States v.

On January 22, 2003, Singer and his co-conspirator, Craig Richard Ambrose, were charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud federally insured depository financial institutions, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. In relevant part, the indictment alleged that Singer and others fraudulently obtained information about the bank accounts of other persons, which information the conspirators used to create fraudulent checks and identification cards. The conspirators then used the fraudulent checks and identification cards to purchase merchandise at stores in Florida. The indictment also included a forfeiture count. Ambrose entered a guilty plea and Singer proceeded to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">At trial, the government presented the following testimony. Christopher Van Kahlmorgan, a co-conspirator, identified his co-conspirators as Singer, Ambrose, John Norris, Brad Nelson, and Sherri Mulkey. Kahlmorgan had first learned about the scheme from Ambrose who told Kahlmorgan that he (Ambrose) had a friend who produced fraudulent identification cards and checks, which were then used at various stores throughout Florida. Kahlmorgan subsequently was introduced to Singer, who was described as the person \u201cresponsible for producing the ID\u2019s and checks.\u201d At this meeting, Singer took Kahlmorgan\u2019s photograph and proceeded to produce several identification cards and checks from matching checking accounts. Kahlmorgan then used the fraudulent materials to purchase merchandise and generate cash via cashing checks. Kahlmorgan said that Norris and Singer explained to him that the account numbers and names used on the duplicate counterfeit checks came from either original checks stolen from mailboxes or names taken from the phone book.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">Kahlmorgan described the sophisticated computer and digital imaging equipment Singer used to create the fraudulent identification cards and checks and estimated that Singer had created \u201cat least\u201d 100 identifications cards for Kahlmorgan alone and had provided a minimum of 10 to 20 checks per identification card. Kahlmor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>gan estimated that the total dollar amount of the bogus checks that he wrote was \u201c[a]t least $150,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Kahlmorgan also testified that he and Singer had created fake payroll checks on commercial bank accounts that were cashed at various grocery stores in order to obtain cash.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After cashing the payroll checks, the conspirators used the proceeds to purchase large-ticket items that were then resold at a discount, with Singer and Kahlmorgan splitting the cash proceeds equally. On most occasions, Singer would accompany Kahlmorgan to the stores to select the items to be purchased and to act as a look-out. Kahlmorgan thereafter reviewed, and narrated for the jury, several surveillance tapes from targeted stores, which showed Singer selecting and carrying various items to the check-out counter. Kahlmorgan described Singer as the \u201cring leader\u201d of the conspiracy because he had the ability to manufacture driver\u2019s licenses and counterfeit checks in an authentic manner so as \u201cto be usable and acceptable at pretty much any given store.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Co-conspirator Norris also testified against Singer, stating that he had known Singer for seven or eight years and had been involved with passing bad checks from the mid-1990s until the end of 2000. Norris\u2019s testimony about the scheme, and Singer\u2019s role in it, was substantially similar to Kahlmorgan\u2019s description. Although Norris could not accurately estimate the number of checks that Singer had provided to him, Norris stated that he personally had passed between $250,000 and $300,000 in bad checks during the seven or eight years he was associated with Singer.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Finally, the government presented the testimony of several officials of the drawee banks, each of whom stated that their respective bank did not suffer any monetary loss \u2014 but did lose some man hours in processing the bad checks \u2014 and that the fraudulent checks were returned to the merchants.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">After the government rested, Singer moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing the government faded to show that (1) any of the banks suffered an actual loss, or (2) Singer had entered an agreement with another individual to defraud the banks themselves, as opposed to defrauding the targeted merchants. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>denied Singer\u2019s motion. The defense then rested without calling any witnesses. The jury found Singer guilty as charged and he proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Singer\u2019s base offense level was 6, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(a). The PSI recommended the following adjustments: (1) a 9-level increase for a fraud loss exceeding $350,000 but less than $500,000, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(J); (2) a 2-level increase for Singer\u2019s use of a means of identification unlawfully to produce any other means of identification, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C); (3) a 2-level increase for more than minimal planning, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(2); and (3) a 4-level leadership-role enhancement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). With an adjusted offense level of 23 and a criminal history category III, Singer\u2019s sentencing guidelines range was 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment, but based on the 5-year statutory maximum enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, Singer\u2019s maximum sentence was 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. The PSI also found that Singer was required to make mandatory restitution totaling $144,104.22 to dozens of defrauded merchants.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">At the sentencing hearing, in response to Singer\u2019s objections, the government presented additional testimony concerning Singer\u2019s role in the conspiracy and the amount of loss. Norris described Singer\u2019s participation in the conspiracy as including: (1) recruiting Norris to be a \u201cfront man\u201d; (2) making arrangements for the buying trips; (3) deciding which items to purchase, and (4) selecting the cities in which the purchases would be made. Norris testified that, on average, he presented approximately $6,700 in bad checks per account, using 1 account per month for 3 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Ambrose, the co-conspirator who had been charged with Singer and had pled guilty, also testified at the sentencing hearing, describing how Singer told other participants \u201cwhere [they] were going to go, when [they were] going to go,\u201d and what items each person would purchase. Ambrose contended that he had written approximately $400,000 total in bad checks over the course of two-and-a-half years. Kalhmorgan also testified, reiterating his trial testimony, including that he had presented approximately $150,000 in bad checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">On the fraud-loss issue, the district court explicitly found that the testimony of Norris, Ambrose, and Kahlmorgan was credible, but that their estimates of the amount of bad checks they passed was overstated. The court stated that it did not \u201chave any problems concluding from the evidence that there\u2019s at least the $200,000 worth,\u201d but found the government had not met its burden as to the requested $350,000 loss amount. Thus, the court partially sustained Singer\u2019s objection to the enhancement, reducing the \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l) enhancement from nine levels to eight levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(I). The court overruled Singer\u2019s objection to the leadership-role enhancement based on the government\u2019s evidence that the scheme was Singer\u2019s idea, and that Singer took the larger share of the proceeds, personally selected most of the merchandise to be purchased, and directed those on the \u201cfront line\u201d who actually were passing the bad checks. The court also upheld the \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C) enhancement, finding that the conspirators stole checks from the mail and used the stolen checks to create false identification cards, which, in turn, were used to pass bad checks. Finally, the court found that restitution to the merchants was appropriate because the merchants, and not just the banks, were the victims of the offense. The district court sentenced Singer to a 60-month term of imprisonment, followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>by 3 years\u2019 supervised release, and ordered that he pay $144,104.22 in restitution, jointly and severally with Ambrose. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">First, Singer argues the evidence was insufficient to convict him of conspiracy to commit bank fraud because the government did not establish that federally insured banks, as opposed to non-bank entities (the merchants), were either the actual or intended victims of the conspiracy, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. To sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, the government must prove (1) the existence of an agreement to achieve an unlawful purpose; (2) the defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy; and (3) the commission of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Adkinson, </em>158 F.3d 1147, 1153 (11th Cir.1998). To convict a defendant for bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(1) for defrauding a financial institution, the government must prove that (1) the defendant intentionally participated in a scheme or artifice to defraud another of money or property; and (2) the intended victim of the scheme or artifice was a federally-insured financial institution. <em>United States v. McCarrick, </em>294 F.3d 1286, 1290 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">While we have not directly addressed the situation of a non-bank entity as the victim of a bank-fraud offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344, in an analogous context, we have observed that a bank is not the only possible victim of a \u00a7 1344 offense for purposes of applying an abuse-of-trust sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. <em>See United States v. Linville, </em>228 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir.2000). In that case, we contrasted the bank-fraud statute with the Medicare-fraud statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320, noting that under the latter, the United States as a matter of law is the only victim of a Medicare-fraud offense since \u201cthe government is the only entity that pays directly out of pocket for the losses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1332. Under the more broadly worded bank-fraud statute, however, we explained that \u201c[a] bank is a possible victim, of course, but so are other persons, because the fraudulent scheme need only be \u2018to obtain money, funds, or credits <em>under the custody or control </em>of a federally insured financial institution.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (citation omitted). Noting that \u201cmoney under the custody or control of the bank is not necessarily money whose loss the bank is responsible for,\u201d we held that the bank-fraud statute contemplates a larger class of victims than the Medicare-fraud statute, and, depending on the facts of the case, more than one person, including a non-bank entity, could be the victim who reposes trust in the defendant within the meaning of \u00a7 3B1.3. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Applying the underlying reasoning of <em>Linville, </em>as well as the persuasive authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>ty of the Second and Fourth Circuits, Singer\u2019s claim that the government\u2019s evidence was insufficient is unpersuasive. Although the evidence presented at trial demonstrated that the <em>immediate </em>victims of the scheme were the third-party merchants from whom conspirators either purchased goods or obtained cash, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the conspirators\u2019 fraudulent checks ultimately would be presented to the drawee banks for payment. <em>See Brandon, </em>298 F.3d at 312. Moreover, the mere negotiation of a check with a forged endorsement is sufficient to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s requisite intent to defraud the bank and to expose the bank to the risk of loss. <em>See Crisci, </em>273 F.3d at 240; <em>Brandon, </em>298 F.3d at 312. As such, the jury reasonably could have concluded that Singer\u2019s scheme was designed \u201cto obtain money, funds, or credits under the custody or control of a federally insured financial institution.\u201d <em>See Linville, </em>228 F.3d at 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Singer also argues that the district court erred in calculating the fraud-loss amount under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l). Specifically, Singer contends that the district court\u2019s finding that his relevant fraud loss was at least $200,000 was based on speculative and uncorroborated testimony, and that the court, instead, should have considered the amount of only those counterfeit checks that actually passed through the banking system and created a verifiable \u201cpaper trail.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Section 2Fl.l(a) of the applicable version of the Sentencing Guidelines (2000) assigns a base offense level of six for a wide variety of fraud crimes. <em>See United States v. Bracciale, </em>374 F.3d 998, 1003 (11th Cir.2004); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(a). That base offense level then is increased under \u00a7 2Fl.l(b) based on the amount of loss resulting from the fraud in order to \u201cmeasure the actual, attempted, or intended harm of the offense.\u201d <em>Bracciale, </em>374 F.3d at 1003 (citation omitted). Where a defendant contests the amount of loss, the government bears the burden of establishing the amount of the loss by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Dabbs, </em>134 F.3d 1071,1081 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">At the sentencing hearing, the government presented the testimony of Singer\u2019s co-conspirators on the amount of loss. While Singer contends that this testimony was not credible, he presented no evidence to rebut the government\u2019s case at sentencing, and the district court made a finding that the co-conspirators\u2019 testimony was credible insofar as it supported an adjustment for a loss amount exceeding only $200,000 (but not $350,000). <em>See United States v. McPhee, </em>336 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c[W]e allot substantial deference to the factfinder, in this case, the district court, in reaching credibility determinations with respect to witness testimony.\u201d) (internal marks and citation omitted). Simply put, the government established, by a preponderance of the evidence, the attempted loss amount exceeded $200,000 and, therefore, the district court did not clearly err in applying a 8-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(I).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">We are likewise unpersuaded by Singer\u2019s argument that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>erred by applying a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C) for the use of a means of identification to unlawfully produce other means of identification. Singer contends that the original checks the conspirators stole from mailboxes \u2014 the checks that were used to create fraudulent checks for the conspirators\u2019 use \u2014 were not \u201cmeans of identification\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C), which provides for a two-level increase of a defendant\u2019s base offense level \u201c[i]f the offense involved ... the unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of identification.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C)(i) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">Application Note 15 to \u00a7 2F1.1 provides that \u201c \u2018[mjeans of identification\u2019 has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(3).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, comment. (n. 15) (2000). Section 1028(d)(3) defines the term as \u201cany name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual, including any ... name, social security number, date of birth, official State or government issued driver\u2019s license or identification number, ... unique electronic identification number, address, or routing code.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(3)(A), (C) (1999).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Application Note 16 to \u00a7 2F1.1 further enumerates several examples of when the \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C)(i) enhancement should apply, including where (1) the defendant obtains another individual\u2019s name and social security number from a stolen piece of mail and uses that information to obtain a bank loan in that individual\u2019s name; or (2) the defendant obtains another individual\u2019s name and address from a driver\u2019s license in a stolen wallet, which the defendant then uses to open a credit card account in that individual\u2019s name. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, comment, (n.16). By contrast, the enhancement should <em>not </em>apply when (1) the defendant uses a credit card from a stolen wallet to make a purchase; or (2) the defendant forges another individual\u2019s signature to cash a stolen check, because in neither of those two situations has the defendant produced or obtained another means of identification. <em>Id. </em>Here, because Singer used true bank account holders\u2019 names to create fraudulent identification cards and checks, his conduct is akin to the former examples, to which the enhancement applies, rather than the latter examples, which do not involve creating fraudulent means of identification. Simply put, the district court correctly applied \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C) in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Finally, Singer argues that the district court erred by ordering him to pay restitution to the targeted merchants, whom Singer contends were not victims of the bank fraud. Singer differentiates between the stores\u2019 losses resulting from the merchandise acquired via the fraudulent checks, and \u201cthe monies taken from their bank accounts by the offense conduct.\u201d We are unconvinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d), codified as amended, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A, applies to all offenses, such as the instant case, when the defendant commits a crime involving \u201cfraud or deceit.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(l)(A)(ii). Under the MVRA, a person is required to make full restitution when he is convicted for an offense \u201cin which an identifiable victim or victims has suffered a physical injury or a pecuniary loss.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(l)(B). The MVRA defines \u201cvictim\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-4\">[A] person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including, in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(2). Here, the targeted merchants were the <em>primary </em>victims of Singer\u2019s fraudulent scheme, and the district court did not err in ordering him to pay restitution for the merchants\u2019 resulting losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-6\">.

At trial, Singer objected to the admission of evidence concerning the fraudulent use of business payroll checks to obtain cash. On appeal, Singer argues that the indictment was constructively amended when the government presented evidence that, in addition to passing fraudulent <em>personal </em>checks to merchants in exchange for <em>merchandise, </em>co-conspirators also had presented fraudulent <em>business </em>payroll checks in order to obtain <em>cash. </em>\"An amendment to an indictment occurs 'when the essential elements of the offense contained in the indictment are altered to broaden the possible bases for conviction beyond what is contained in the indictment.' \u201d <em>United States v.

In other words, \"[a] constructive amendment occurs when the evidence presented at trial and the jury instructions so modify the elements of the offense charged that the defendant may have been convicted on a ground not alleged by the grand jury's indictment.\u201d <em>United States v.

In <em>Crisci, </em>the Second Circuit held that a defendant\u2019s knowing negotiation of a check with a forged endorsement was sufficient to show the defendant's intent to defraud a bank, even though the check was presented to a third party and not directly to a bank. <em>Id. </em>Likewise, in <em>United States v. Brandon, </em>298 F.3d 307, 312 (4th Cir.2002), the Fourth Circuit also held that the bank need not be the immediate victim or suffer actual loss, and that it was sufficient for the government to show that the defendant\u2019s scheme exposed the bank to the potential risk of loss. The Fourth Circuit noted that the defendant\u2019s scheme of passing forged checks to merchants in exchange for goods satisfied the statute because it was inevitable that the bogus checks would eventually be presented to the drawee bank and expose the bank to the risk of loss. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b898-6\">. Based on the same reasoning, we reject Singer\u2019s second sentencing argument, that the district court erred by applying a leadership-role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). Again, Singer criticizes the credibility of his co-conspirators\u2019 testimony. As with the fraud-loss amount, the government\u2019s burden to establish a defendant\u2019s leadership role is a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003). The government's evidence, both at trial and at sentencing, showed that Singer devised the scheme, created the fraudulent checks and identification cards using his computer and technical expertise, and accompanied other conspirators while purchasing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>merchandise. In addition, Singer\u2019s selection of merchandise was given priority, and each coconspirator split the proceeds from the sale of their own stolen goods with Singer. Singer also decided where and when to pass the fraudulent checks, and provided transportation to other coconspirators when necessary. As with the government\u2019s evidence to support the fraud-loss enhancement, Singer presented no evidence at sentencing to rebut the government\u2019s case, and, thus, a preponderance of the evidence supports the enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b899-11\">.
