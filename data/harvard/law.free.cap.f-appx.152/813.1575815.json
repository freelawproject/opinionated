Defendant argues that, under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights when it enhanced his sentence based on the fact of his prior convictions for drug trafficking, which were not charged in the indictment, proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, or admitted by him. Reversible error exists under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); we vacate Defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">Defendant properly raised his <em>Blakely \u00a1Booker </em>claim in the district court. <em>See United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). We review this issue <em>de novo; </em>we will reverse unless the government shows that any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1327 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">Defendant\u2019s 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) was based solely on the fact that he had previous convictions. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court stated that the government need not allege in the indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had a prior conviction for a district court to use that conviction to enhance a sentence. \u201cThis conclusion was left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, the district court did not violate Defendant\u2019s constitutional rights by applying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) enhancement based on his prior convictions. <em>See United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">But the district court did commit a statutory error under <em>Booker. See United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 688 (11th Cir.2005) (under <em>Booker, </em>two types of sentencing errors exist: \u201cone is constitutional and the other is statutory\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31. <em>Booker </em>statutory errors are subject to a less demanding harmless error test that is applicable to non-constitutional errors. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005). That standard requires us to determine whether the error either did not affect the sentence or only had a slight effect. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>Here, the government concedes that the district court\u2019s statutory error of applying the guidelines in a mandatory fashion was not harmless. The district court overruled Defendant\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection because in <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court stated that it was not addressing the federal sentencing guidelines, and because of controlling precedent from this Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court made no statement that it would have imposed an identical sentence if it had been proceeding under an advisory guidelines system. The court did mention that it saw no need to impose a sentence greater than 77 months \u2014 at the bottom of the guideline range of 77 to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 based on its belief that this sentence \u201cwill accomplish all that is going to be accomplished in terms of the effects of incarceration and how that will affect [Defendant\u2019s] future conduct.\u201d This statement is some evidence that perhaps the district court would impose the same sentence after considering the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). But the court made no other comment about the appropriateness of the sentence. We cannot say on this record that Defendant\u2019s sentence was not swayed substantially by the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines as mandatory, rather than advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In sum, although the district court properly applied the 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), Defendant must be resentenced under the advisory guidelines system in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-11\">. In <em>Shelton, </em>where the defendant raised a <em>Booker/Blakely </em>constitutional claim in his initial brief, we also considered whether statutory error existed. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b837-8\">. Shortly before Defendant was sentenced and before the Supreme Court decided <em>Booker, </em>we declined to apply the principles set out in <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Reese, </em>382 F.3d 1308 (11th Cir.2004), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 125 S.Ct. 1089, 160 L.Ed.2d 1058 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
