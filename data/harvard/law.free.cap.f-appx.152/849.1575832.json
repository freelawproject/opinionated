After review, we affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b873-21\">Looney was charged with two counts of filing a false tax return, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1) (Counts 1 and 2), and one count of willful failure to file a tax return, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 (Count 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-22\">A. Looney\u2019s Business Income and Tax History</p>\n<p id=\"b873-23\">During Looney\u2019s trial, the testimony regarding Looney\u2019s business income was as follows. In October 1993, Looney began operating an independent distributorship in a legitimate multi-level marketing company called Starlight International (\u201cStarlight\u201d). Starlight distributes vitamins and nutrition products. As an independent distributor, Looney was responsible for reporting his income to the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and for paying his own taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-24\">In October 1994, Looney transferred his distributorship to a business, CL Marketing. CL Marketing was an unincorporated business trust organization (\u201cUBTO\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Looney created the UBTO after attending tax seminars and talking with \u201csome tax professionals, attorneys, [accountants], and some friends,\u201d including David Simmons (\u201cSimmons\u201d). Looney testified that Joe Sweet (\u201cSweet\u201d), a minister at his church and a tax professional, told him that the United States Supreme Court had ruled that UBTOs were non-taxable entities. According to Looney, he sent letters to several attorneys and certified public accountants (\u201cCPAs\u201d), asking them whether he was required to file an individual tax return. Based on their responses, Looney believed that: (1) filing a tax return was \u201cstrictly voluntary\u201d; (2) compensation for his own labor could not be taxed; and (3) as long as he had no profit, he did not owe any taxes. Looney also testified that he relied on: (1) an essay written by Sweet concerning common law UBTOs; and (2) an article by an attorney, which, as he understood it, stated that a UBTO is a non-taxable entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Looney failed to file individual tax returns for 1995 and 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">On February 13, 1998, IRS Officer Kathy Kendall (\u201cOfficer Kendall\u201d) met with Looney to discuss problems with Looney\u2019s 1993 tax return and Looney\u2019s failure to file 1995 and 1996 tax returns. At the meeting, Officer Kendall explained that IRS documents showed that Looney had earned taxable income for the years 1995 and 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">In April 1998, Looney filed Form 1040 tax returns for the years 1995 and 1996. Although Looney had received approximately $306,894 in gross income in 1995, he reported only $53,480 on his 1995 tax return. Similarly, although Looney had received approximately $328,501 in gross income in 1996, he reported only $69,221 on his 1996 tax return. On April 22, 1998, Officer Kendall referred Looney\u2019s case to the criminal investigation division of the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">In 2003, Looney received notification that he was under investigation again. Looney then consulted Paul Chappell (\u201cChappell\u201d), a tax attorney. Thereafter, Looney decided to file amended returns for the years 1995 and 1996, an original return for 1997, and to seek a status determination from the IRS regarding other years. Looney stated that in 2003, Richard Fuselier (\u201cFuselier\u201d) prepared these returns for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">B. Looney\u2019s Evidentiary Proffers</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">During the trial, Looney named several witnesses that he wished to call. First, Looney indicated that he wished to call Chappell as a witness to explain the advice that he gave to Looney. The government responded that Chappell\u2019s testimony regarding what Chappell told Looney in 2003 was irrelevant to what Looney knew in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998. The district court determined that Looney could not call Chappell because Chappell\u2019s testimony was hearsay, irrelevant to Looney\u2019s reliance defense, and unnecessary since Looney already had testified about Chappell\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">Looney and the government then stipulated that Chappell\u2019s testimony would have been that he told Looney: (1) to file amended tax returns for 1995 and 1996; (2) to file a tax return for 1997; (3) to include in those returns the income in the UBTO, which previously was unreported income received from Starlight; and (4) to wait to file tax returns for 1998 through 2002 until Looney received a status determination letter from the IRS. The parties also stipulated that Chappell told Looney that his previously held belief that the trust was not taxable \u201cwould not hold up in court.\u201d The stipulations were published to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>Looney also indicated that he intended to call Fuselier, who, in 2003, prepared Looney\u2019s amended 1995 and 1996 and original 1997 tax returns. Looney indicated that Fuselier would explain the figures. The district court stated that it would exclude Fuselier\u2019s testimony because it was irrelevant to Looney\u2019s state of mind in 1995 and 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Finally, Looney stated that he intended to call his friend, Simmons, to testify about Looney\u2019s meetings with the IRS and what Simmons told Looney about UBTOs. The district court stated that it was concerned that Simmons\u2019s testimony would confuse the jury, determining that it only would allow Simmons to testify: (1) about conversations that he was present for; and (2) that he advised Looney about UBTOs and sold the trust to Looney.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">C. Looney\u2019s Waiver of Blakely<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Before the jury instructions were finalized, Looney requested that the district court require the jury to make a finding of the amount of his tax liability for purposes of applying the Sentencing Guidelines. Subsequently, however, Looney requested that the district court make a finding of the amount of his tax liability beyond a reasonable doubt. After an off-the-record discussion, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-8\">COURT: What did you decide Mr. Hansen [Looney\u2019s attorney]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-9\">HANSEN: I hate to admit this, Your Honor, but we\u2019ll go with the Government\u2019s position on this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-10\">COURT: Okay. So that means we\u2019re going to take the specific question off the verdict form asking for the amount of the tax\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-11\">HANSEN: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-13\">COURT: \u2014 liability. And the defendant stipulates to the Court making that determination at what standard, preponderance of the evidence or beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-14\">HANSEN: Well, I can\u2019t imagine why I wouldn\u2019t want it to be beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-15\">COURT: I can\u2019t either.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-16\">After a brief recess, Hansen indicated that Looney agreed to having the district court determine beyond a reasonable doubt the amount of his tax liability, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-17\">HANSEN: Your Honor, we did consult with Mr. Looney and he agrees with the decision not to put the additional line on to have the jury determine the tax liability, so we\u2019ll leave that to the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-18\">The district court questioned Looney regarding his request, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-19\">COURT: All right. Mr. Looney, you\u2019ve had a chance to talk to your lawyer about the <em>Blakely </em>decision and how it might impact your case and the sentencing on your case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-20\">LOONEY: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-21\">COURT: And you\u2019re willing to have the Court determine whatever <em>Blakely </em>issues may apply to sentencing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-22\">LOONEY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-23\">COURT: And you\u2019re willing for the guidelines to apply in so far as <em>Blakely </em>is concerned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-24\">LOONEY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-25\">COURT: And have you made that decision freely and voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-26\">LOONEY: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-27\">COURT: And the Court is to make any findings in that regard beyond a reasonable doubt. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-28\">LOONEY: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>COURT: Okay. I\u2019m going to have one of my clerks put that in writing and have Mr. Hansen, have you and Mr. Looney sign it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-4\">HANSEN: Your statement was f\u00edne, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-5\">COURT: I don\u2019t know that it has to be in writing, but I\u2019d rather do it that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-6\">HANSEN: We don\u2019t have a problem with that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">In addition to agreeing that the district court, not the jury, would determine his tax liability beyond a reasonable doubt, Looney signed a written waiver of a jury finding his sentencing enhancements, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-8\">I, Charles Looney, having consulted with counsel regarding the issues raised by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), do hereby knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waive the right to have the jury determine any and all potential sentencing enhancements applicable under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. I understand that the Court will determine any applicable sentencing enhancements beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">The jury found Looney not guilty on Counts 1 and 2 (willfully filing a false income tax return for the years 1995 and 1996) and guilty on Count 3 (willfully failing to file a tax return for the year 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">D. PSI and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a base offense level of 15, based on a tax liability of $141,333 for the year 1997. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 2T1.1, 2T4.1 (1997).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The PSI based the $141,333 figure on the trial testimony of an IRS agent who computed Looney\u2019s 1997 taxable income based upon the commissions reported in 1997 less the legitimate business expenses reported on the 1997 tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">With a total offense level of 15 and a criminal history category of I, Looney\u2019s Guidelines range was 18-24 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, because the statutory maximum sentence was 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, Looney\u2019s Guidelines imprisonment range was reduced to 12 months. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-15\">As to fines and restitution, the PSI noted that the statutory maximum fine was $100,000. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571. The Guidelines fine range, however, was $4,000 to $40,000. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2. The PSI also noted that Looney owed $141,333 in restitution to the IRS. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663. The restitution amount equaled the amount of Looney\u2019s tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-16\">Looney objected to the PSI, arguing that because no tax liability had been charged in the indictment or found by the jury, the district court\u2019s determination of the amount of Looney\u2019s tax liability would violate <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Looney also contended that no fine or restitution was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-17\">At sentencing, Looney argued that the district court\u2019s determination of his tax liability was improper because it was not charged in the indictment. Looney contended that his <em>Blakely </em>waiver did not apply to the district court\u2019s finding be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>cause Looney did not know when he waived his rights that the tax liability would be \u201cpart of the proof\u2019 since it was not charged in the indictment. The following exchange then took place between Hansen, Looney\u2019s counsel, and the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-5\">HANSEN: We think that under <em>Apprendi [v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000),] it\u2019s improper for this to be added right now and also because of the fact that it\u2019s really sentence enhancement ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-6\">COURT: Well, you waived the <em>Blakely </em>rights in writing; correct \u2014 signed by you and your client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-7\">HANSEN: ... We did, and I don\u2019t deny that, but let me comment about that. <em>Blakely </em>had come out, I think, right before the trial. At the time that we were asked to waive, I wasn\u2019t aware of <em>Blakely </em>yet.... What we were told was that it was either a choice between waiving our right to have the jury decide this or not waiving it; [and] in the heat of the trial actually we decided to go ahead and waive it, but....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-8\">COURT: And that was the whole purpose of your waiving it; right? So, we did not put it to the jury. It was not argued to the jury, and the jury didn\u2019t make that decision because you didn\u2019t want them to make the decision, and that\u2019s why you signed the <em>Blakely </em>waiver; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-9\">HANSEN: At the time, your honor, I didn\u2019t realize that we were waiving a flaw in the indictment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">The district court denied Looney\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection, stating: \u201cYou waived it \u2014 specifically waived it for that purpose, and you can\u2019t go back over and do it now.\u201d After the government presented evidence as to the tax liability amount, the court found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the amount of tax liability for 1997 was $141,333. The district court then adopted the PSI\u2019s Guidelines calculations, including \u201crestitution as determined by the [IRS].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">As to Looney\u2019s fine, the government requested that the district court fine Looney $100,000, and the district court responded that under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2, \u201cthe guidelines call for a maximum fine of $40,000.\u201d The government explained that under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571, $100,000 was the statutory maximum, while the Guidelines fine was $4,000 to $40,000. The government clarified that it was requesting the district court to exercise its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">The district court then noted that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2, cmt. n. 4, provides for an upward departure from the Guidelines fine range where two times the amount of loss caused by the offense exceeds that maximum Guidelines range, and stated: \u201cSo two times the amount of loss [$141,333] would be $282,000, I guess, limited by the statutory maximum of [$100,000].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-14\">The district court then sentenced Looney to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment and imposed a fine of $75,000, which represented an upward departure from the Guidelines fine range of $4,000 to $40,000 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2. Although the district court did not order restitution, it orally imposed, as a condition of Looney\u2019s supervised release, a requirement that Looney \u201cshall cooperate with the [IRS] regarding all outstanding taxes, interest, and penalties relating to the offense of conviction.\u201d The written judgment, however, stated that Looney owed restitution in an amount that would be determined by the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">Before briefing was completed in the instant appeal, Looney filed a motion with this Court for \u201crelease from fine pending appeal.\u201d Looney\u2019s motion argued that be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>cause the imposition of a $75,000 fine was likely to be reversed on appeal, this Court should stay payment of the fine pending the appeal\u2019s final outcome. This Court granted Looney\u2019s motion to stay payment and remanded the case to the district court for the limited purpose of \u201cdetermining what conditions, if any, should be imposed.\u201d In our remand order, this Court noted that the statutory maximum fine for an individual who violates 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7208 is $25,000, and not $75,000, as was imposed. On remand, the district court held a hearing and ordered Looney to post a bond to secure the full $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">A. Evidentiary Issues as to Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">On appeal, Looney argues that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to present \u201call witnesses\u201d that were central to his defense, which was good faith reliance. Looney contends that the district court should have allowed Chappell to testify, pointing out that Chappell would have: (1) testified about the manner in which he advised Looney; (2) explained why he advised Looney to seek a status determination from the IRS; (3) spoken about Looney\u2019s good faith, but misguided, belief that the UBTO was legal; and (4) testified that the IRS\u2019s internal documents showed that Looney owed no taxes for 1997. Looney further argues that the district court should have allowed Simmons to testify about the advice that he gave Looney regarding the UBTO.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">A violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 must be willful. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. The statutory willfulness requirement in \u00a7 7203 can be negated by a subjective, \u201cgood-faith misunderstanding of the law or a good-faith belief that one is not violating the law.\u201d <em>Cheek v. United States, </em>498 U.S. 192, 199-202, 111 S.Ct. 604, 609-11, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991) (analyzing the term willfully as used in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203). \u201cSuch a question of whether a defendant believed in good faith that he was not violating the tax law is for the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Lankford, </em>955 F.2d 1545, 1550 (11th Cir.1992). \u201c[Wjhere the element of willfulness is critical to the defense, the defendant is entitled to wide latitude in the introduction of evidence tending to show lack of intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). However, where the substance of the defendant\u2019s good faith defense was presented to the jury, notwithstanding the missing evidence, any error in not admitting the evidence did not warrant a reversal. <em>See United States v. Wellendorf </em>574 F.2d 1289, 1290 (5th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">Evidence concerning the reasonableness of Looney\u2019s belief that he was not violating the tax laws when he failed to file a return in 1997 would have been relevant to whether his violation was willful under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401; <em>Cheek, </em>498 U.S. at 199-202, 111 S.Ct. at 609-11. However, the district court did not err in refusing to allow Chappell to testify. Chappell advised Looney in 2003, subsequent to the commission of the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>stant offense (failure to file a tax return for 1997). Therefore, Chappell\u2019s testimony would have been irrelevant to Looney\u2019s state of mind at the time of the offense. Additionally, Looney and the government stipulated as to the contents of Chappell\u2019s testimony, and those stipulations were published to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">We also reject Looney\u2019s contentions about Simmons\u2019s testimony. First, the district court did not prevent Simmons from testifying. In fact, Simmons testified about the conversations that he witnessed between Looney and Officer Kendall. Further, the district court did not prevent Simmons from testifying that he had advised Looney about the UBTO and that he sold Looney the trust. The district court simply ruled that Simmons could not testify regarding the substance of his theory that the trusts were a lawful way to avoid payment of taxes. The district court\u2019s concern that Simmons\u2019s testimony might confuse the jury regarding the state of the law was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Further, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court abused its discretion in limiting Simmons\u2019s testimony and not allowing Chappell to testify, Looney\u2019s substantial rights were not affected. Looney testified extensively concerning his beliefs that the payment of taxes was voluntary, that compensation for his labor was not taxable, and that the trusts were a lawful way of avoiding taxes. Looney testified at length about specific individuals he relied upon for advice, including Simmons. Also, the district court allowed Looney to read from taxation literature, which the district court admitted into evidence. We find no reversible error in Looney\u2019s trial from any of the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">B. <em>Booker </em>Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">Looney next argues that although he waived his right to have the jury determine \u201cany and all sentencing enhancements,\u201d he did not waive his right to have the jury find the facts used to determine his base offense level. He contends that the district court violated <em>Booker </em>when it calculated his offense level based on a finding of the amount of his tax liability ($141,333) that was neither charged in the indictment, nor proven to a jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). \u201cUnder <em>Booker, </em>there are two kinds of sentencing errors: one is constitutional and the other is statutory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 688 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where under a mandatory guidelines system a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298 (emphasis omitted). The statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">In this case, we conclude that the district court did not violate Looney\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. Looney clearly and expressly waived his right to have a jury determine the amount of tax liability in this case. Although the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>initially granted Looney\u2019s request to submit sentencing factors to the jury, Looney later requested that the district court redact the questions concerning his tax liability from the verdict form. Looney also requested that the district court determine the amount of his tax liability beyond a reasonable doubt and at sentencing, the district court did so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, Looney\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Although there is no Sixth Amendment violation in this case, the district court committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error in sentencing Looney under a mandatory Guidelines regime. While Looney waived the jury\u2019s finding of both the amount of his tax liability and any sentencing enhancements, Looney did not waive the right to appeal his sentence and did not relinquish his right to be sentenced under an advisory Guidelines regime. Thus, we must determine whether the statutory error in Looney\u2019s sentencing is harmless. <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">\u201cA non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks, brackets, ellipses, and citations omitted). The burden is on the government to show that the error was harmless and the standard \u201cis not easy for the government to meet.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">There is no evidence or any indication in the record revealing what effect, if any, changing from a mandatory to an advisory approach would have had on the district court\u2019s sentencing decision in Looney\u2019s case. \u201cWe simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory, and had properly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">Accordingly, we vacate Looney\u2019s sentence and remand his case to the district court for resentencing. Because we are remanding the ease to the district court, we note that the district court correctly calculated Looney\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Cranford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that after <em>Booker, </em>district courts must consult the Guidelines and \u201c[t]his consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">Thus, on remand, the district court is required to sentence Looney under an advisory Guidelines regime, and shall consider the Guidelines range of 18-24 months\u2019 imprisonment and \u201cother statutory concerns as well, see [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp.2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757. Specifically, in this case, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>must abide by the statutory maximum sentence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">C. Fine Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Next, Looney argues that the district court erred by imposing a $75,000 fine because 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 provides for a maximum fine of $25,000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Based on the following, we conclude that the district court did not err, much less plainly err, by imposing a fine of $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, \u201c[a]ny person\u201d who violates the statute is \u201cguilty of a misdemeanor\u201d and \u201cshall be fined not more than $25,000.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. However, in 1984, Congress added to the criminal code a general fine statute applicable to all offenses. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571. Under \u00a7 3571, an individual who has been found guilty of a Class A misdemeanor may be fined \u201cnot more than the greatest of\u2019 the amount specified in the law setting forth the offense, $100,000, or twice the gross gain or loss. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3571(b), (d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, \u00a7 3571(e) provides that a defendant may be fined more than the amount listed in the statute setting forth the offense of conviction, unless the offense of conviction exempts a larger fine. Specifically, \u00a7 3571(e) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-12\">Special rule for lower fine specified in substantive provision. \u2014 If a law setting forth an offense specifies no fine or a fine that is lower than the fine otherwise applicable under this section and such law, <em>by specific reference, exempts the offense from the applicability of the fine otherwise applicable under this section, </em>the defendant may not be fined more than the amount specified in the law setting forth the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571(e) (emphasis added). Thus, a lower fine limit in the statute setting forth the offense of conviction does not preclude the district court from imposing a higher fine under the general fine statute unless the statute setting forth the offense of conviction specifically says so.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">The statute under which Looney was convicted, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, does not contain any language exempting it from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571, the general fine statute. Thus, the statutory maximum fine applicable to Looney\u2019s offense is either twice the tax liability from Looney\u2019s offense ($141,-333) or $100,000.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">We also note that the Guidelines fine range for Looney\u2019s offense is $4,000 to $40,000. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>in cases such as Looney\u2019s, the Guidelines provide district courts wide discretion to depart upwardly as to fines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2 cmt. n. 4.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In this case, the district court chose to do so, stating that it was imposing \u201ca fine in the amount of $75,000. That\u2019s an upward departure made on the basis of 5E1.2, Note 4.\u201d Thus, the district court did not err, much less plainly err, in imposing a fine of $75,000, and we affirm Looney\u2019s fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">D. Restitution Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Finally, Looney argues that the district court erred by imposing restitution without ordering a specific amount. Looney argues that it was improper for the district court to direct that the amount of restitution be determined by the IRS. We agree. On remand, if the district court elects again to order Looney to pay restitution, it must specify the amount due. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8664(f)(1)(A); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.1; <em>United States v. Butler, </em>297 F.3d 505, 518-19 (6th Cir.2002) (district court may not delegate the determination of restitution to the IRS).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-12\">. <em>Blakely v.

Because Looney timely raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court, we review his <em>Blakely, </em>now <em>Booker, </em>claim <em>de novo. United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\">. Looney contends that he did not waive his right to have a jury determine his tax liability in this case because his written waiver specifically waived the right to have a jury determine \"sentencing enhancements,\u201d and Looney did not receive any. He argues that the district court did not determine his tax liability in order to apply an \"enhancement,\u201d but instead to determine his offense level. We need not decide whether the increase in Looney's offense level was effectively an enhancement for purposes of the written waiver because in any event, the record shows that in the colloquy with the district court, Looney expressly waived his right to have a jury determine the amount of his tax liability and expressly consented to the district court\u2019s determining the amount of his tax liability beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b881-8\">. We do not mean to suggest by our holding that the district court must impose any particular sentence on remand. Rather, we merely hold that the government did not meet its burden of showing that the <em>Booker </em>statutoiy error was harmless. We also do not attempt to decide now whether a particular sentence might be reasonable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">We also note that Looney argues that a resentencing under an advisory Guidelines regime would violate his due process rights and the ex post facto Clause because his new sentence could exceed the maximum that he received under a mandatory pr <em>e-Booker </em>Guidelines regime. However, this Court has already rejected Looney\u2019s due process/ex post facto argument. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1307-08 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b881-16\">. Because Looney did not raise the statutory maximum fine issue in the district court, we review it for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peters, </em>403 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b881-17\">.

We reject Looney's argument that our remand order staying the payment of the fine specifically directed that the maximum fine amount is $25,000.
