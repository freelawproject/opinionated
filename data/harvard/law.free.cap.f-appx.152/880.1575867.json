No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-26\">In 1995, Abston pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. He was sentenced to serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>180 months in prison, which was later reduced to 120 months, and to complete 5 years supervised release which began in December 2003. In April 2004, Abston was arrested for violating the conditions of his release. After a hearing in the Southern District of Alabama, the court found Abston guilty of aiding and abetting in the possession with intent to distribute four pounds of marijuana. The court then revoked Abstoris term of supervised release and sentenced him to serve 46 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Pursuant to the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d), Abston\u2019s term of supervised release included the condition that he \u201cnot commit another federal, state, or local crime during the term of supervision\u201d nor that he \u201cunlawfully possess a controlled substance.\u201d At the revocation hearing in the Southern District of Alabama, the court heard testimony from Louisiana State Trooper Donald Pierce that on 6 April 2004 he pulled over a vehicle driven by Abston in which Abstoris uncle, Clarence Lawson, was a passenger. Abston had a suspended driver\u2019s license but told Trooper Pierce he had left his license at home; he then provided a false name and birthdate. Abston later provided correct information only after Pierce confronted him. When asked about their travels, both Abston and Lawson lied to Pierce: Abston said he was coming from Baton Rouge, where he had picked up Lawson, but had \u201cno idea\u201d where he had been in Baton Rouge nor did he know anything about Baton Rouge. Lawson said they were coming from Houston, Texas, but that he was hitchhiking and had never met Abston before that day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">After Abston initially hesitated, Pierce obtained his permission to search the car and discovered four pounds of marijuana in a backpack on the front passenger floor. Pierce testified that neither Abston nor Lawson acted shocked that Pierce found drugs in the car. At Abstoris urging, Lawson admitted ownership of the drugs. Pierce \u201chad no doubt,\u201d however, that Abston was aware of the drugs based on his observations and Abstoris reactions. Abston did not dispute Pierce\u2019s testimony at the district court hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">The record further shows that Abston pled no contest in Louisiana state court to a misdemeanor charge of possession of marijuana. Abston contends his plea was made after the state court judge assured him that if he pled no contest he would not be admitting that he knew about the marijuana. The district court considered this plea among the evidence indicating that Abston committed a crime. An order by a Louisiana state judge subsequent to the district court\u2019s judgment appears to have dismissed the state prosecution. Abston argues that the district court erroneously relied on his state court plea as evincing guilt, and he submits he is entitled to a new revocation hearing because the state prosecution was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) permits a district court to revoke a term of supervised release and to impose a prison sentence if the court \u201cfinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.\u201d The district court found Abston guilty of violating his supervised release: 1) leaving the district without permission; 2) possessing a controlled substance; 3) committing a crime; and 4) associating with an individual engaged in criminal activity. We \u201creview the district court\u2019s conclusion that appellant violated the terms of his supervised re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>lease for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Copeland, 20 </em>F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Before revoking the supervised release, the district court must consider factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to determine the grade of the violation and the applicable penalty. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). <em>See also id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B). It is uncontroverted that Abston violated a condition of his release by leaving the Southern District of Alabama without permission. This violation alone subjected Abston to a recommended sentence of 7-13 months in prison. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4 (recommending sentence for Grade C violation by defendant with Criminal History Category V). At issue in this appeal is whether Abston knew about the marijuana in his car. If Abston knew about the drugs (as the district court so found by a preponderance of the evidence), he is guilty of a Grade A violation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with a recommended sentence of 46-57 months. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Abston claimed throughout the proceedings that he did not know about the marijuana. The district court, however, credited Trooper Pierce\u2019s testimony over Abston\u2019s and relied on \u201cthe circumstantial evidence which does not lie\u201d in concluding that Abston knew about the drugs. As we have stated previously: \u201cThe credibility of a witness is in the province of the factfinder and this court will not ordinarily review the factfinder\u2019s determination of credibility.\u201d <em>Copeland, 20 </em>F.3d at 413 (citing <em>United States v. Billue, </em>994 F.2d 1562, 1563 (11th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that Abston knowingly aided and abetted his uncle in possessing marijuana with intent to distribute. The record includes evidence that Abston lied about who he was and where he was going, hesitated before consenting to a search of his car, did not seem surprised to learn that drugs were found in his car, and urged his passenger to admit ownership of the drugs. As the district court explained: \u201cYou lied about your name, you lied about going to Houston. There\u2019s also testimony that you were not shocked when the marijuana was recovered or uncovered from the bag, indicating that you had knowledge that it was there.\u201d This evidence provided a sufficient factual basis for the district court to conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that Abston committed a crime and violated his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Abston\u2019s assertion that the district court erroneously relied on his state court plea is without merit. Abston\u2019s supervised release was revoked, in part, because he \u2014 in fact \u2014 committed a crime in violation of the conditions of his release. It is not necessary that the underlying crime at issue in release-revocation proceedings be the subject of an independent prosecution. When classifying supervised release violations, the Sentencing Guidelines instruct courts that violations of the condition against committing crimes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-10\">may be charged <em>whether or not </em>the defendant has been the subject of a separate federal, state, or local prosecution for such conduct. The grade of violation does not depend upon the conduct that is the subject of criminal charges or of which the defendant is convicted in a criminal proceeding. Rather, the grade of the violation is to be based on the defendant\u2019s <em>actual conduct.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(l) (2004) comment, (n.l) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Because Grade A violations are to be determined based on actual conduct, it is immaterial whether the state of Louisiana vacated Abston\u2019s conviction. The record below includes ample testimonial and circumstantial evidence of Abston\u2019s actual conduct to support the district court\u2019s findings even when considered independent of his plea in state court. Nothing in the record indicates that Abston\u2019s state court plea was given any greater weight than the myriad of other facts used to establish his actual conduct. We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Abston\u2019s supervised release and sentencing him to 46 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-7\">. The investigation later confirmed that both men were returning from Houston, Texas. Pierce explained the discrepancy to the court that Abston likely \"was trying to distance himself from Texas because he knew law enforcement considers Texas as a source location for narcotics.\u201d Pierce concluded that Lawson likely \u201cforgot the story.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b904-7\">. Grade A violations are \u201cconduct constituting (A) a federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year that (i) is a crime of violence, (ii) is a controlled substance offense, or (iii) involves possession of a firearm or destructive device of a type described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a); or (B) any other federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding twenty years.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
