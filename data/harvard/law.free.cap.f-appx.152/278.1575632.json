The denial of a motion to compel is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Wells v. Liddy, </em>186 F.3d 505, 518 n. 12 (4th Cir.1999). A district court may, upon the government\u2019s motion, reduce the sentence of a defendant who has provided substantial assistance in aiding another prosecution. <em>See </em>Rule 35(b); <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 5K1.1. Courts review plea agreements as contracts. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>25 F.3d 211, 216-17 (4th Cir.1994). The party asserting a breach of a plea agreement has the burden of proving its breach. <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>998 F.2d 228, 230 (4th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Conner, </em>930 F.2d 1073, 1076 (4th Cir.1991). After careful review of the record, we conclude that by threatening several witnesses, Rodriguez violated his plea agreement in several respects and such material breaches relieved the Government of any obligation to move for a downward departure. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1513(b) (2000); <em>see also United States v. David, </em>58 F.3d 113, (4th Cir.1995). Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-16\">Rodriguez next asserts that his sentence was based upon facts found by a judge, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the federal sentencing guidelines\u2019 mandatory scheme, which provides for sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court, violated the Sixth Amendment. After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and impose a sentence. If a court imposes a sentence outside the guideline range, the district court must state its reasons for doing so. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Because Rodriguez did not raise this claim in the district court, his sentence is reviewed for plain error. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547 (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). To demonstrate plain error, a defendant must establish that error occurred, that it was plain, and that it affected his substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770; <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547-48. If a defendant establishes these requirements, the court\u2019s \u201cdiscretion is appropriately exercised only when failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice, such as when the defendant is actually innocent or the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 555 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Although Rodriguez\u2019s offense level was enhanced by facts that he did not admit to, the enhanced offense level did not affect the length of his sentence. In the absence of a downward departure based upon substantial assistance, the district court was without the authority to impose any sentence other than mandatory life in prison.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>\u201cBooker </em>did nothing to alter the rule that judges cannot depart below a statutorily provided minimum sentence.\u201d). Accordingly, Rodriguez suffered no Sixth Amendment violation. We therefore affirm Rodriguez\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-6\"> Rodriguez had four prior drug trafficking convictions. Accordingly, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000) (dictating mandatory life sentence if the defendant has two or more prior felony drug convictions), Rodriguez was subject to a mandatory life sentence even if his offense level had not been enhanced by judge-found facts. In light of this circumstance, we need not address Rodriguez\u2019s claim that he was entitled to a sentence reduction based on acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
