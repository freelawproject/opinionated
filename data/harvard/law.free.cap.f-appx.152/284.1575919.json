At sentencing, Barajas received a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, pursuant to <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (2002), based on the district court\u2019s finding that Barajas gave conflicting testimony about a co-defendant\u2019s role in the offense. Barajas\u2019 base offense level was determined to be 26. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7). After applying the two-level enhancement referenced above, Barajas\u2019 total offense level was 28; with a criminal history category of I, the resulting guidelines range was 78-97 months imprisonment. Without the enhancement, the applicable range would have been 63-78 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Barajas claims that the enhancement he received for obstruction of justice violated the decision announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) . Because Barajas did not raise this issue at sentencing, his argument is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) , the Supreme Court held that the \u201cSixth Amendment is violated when a distriet court, acting pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act and the guidelines, imposes a sentence greater than the maximum authorized by the facts found by the jury alone.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 746. The Court remedied this constitutional violation by severing and excising the statutory provisions that mandate sentencing and appellate review under the guidelines, thus making the guidelines advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 756-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">In <em>Hughes, </em>this court found that Hughes\u2019 sentence exceeded the maximum sentence authorized by the facts found by the jury alone, in violation of <em>Booker. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547. Under plain error review, this court found there was error, the error was plain, and the error affected Hughes\u2019 substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 549. Here, Barajas\u2019 offense level was increased by two levels based on the court\u2019s determination that his conflicting statements about his co-defendant\u2019s level of responsibility constituted obstruction of justice within the meaning of USSG \u00a7 3C1.1. Without this increase, his total offense level would have been 26, resulting in a sentencing range of 63 to 78 months. We find that this constitutes plain error and warrants vacating and remanding for resentencing. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 555-56.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, we vacate Barajas\u2019 sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\">. Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Barajas\u2019 sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \u201cplain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-15\">. Because we find that resentencing is warranted due to the erroneous two-level enhancement Barajas received for obstruction of justice, we have not addressed his remaining claims challenging the district court's de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>nial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility or its finding that he did not qualify for the safety valve reduction. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 556 n. 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
