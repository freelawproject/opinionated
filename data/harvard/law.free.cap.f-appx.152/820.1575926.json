Appellants argue the district court erred by denying qualified immunity because no clearly established law gave Appellants \u201cfair warning\u201d that the conduct set forth in Calvert\u2019s complaint was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s holding that public officials are not entitled to qualified immunity because they violated clearly established law. <em>Johnson v. Clifton, </em>74 F.3d 1087, 1090 (11th Cir.1996). After thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The facts relevant to the qualified immunity analysis are straightforward and largely undisputed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to initiating this lawsuit, Calvert was an employee in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia. Appellant Hicks holds, and has held, the elected office of Clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County since 1988. Appellants Robinson and Brown are both management-level employees in the Clerk\u2019s office. In his complaint, Calvert alleged that the Appellants discriminated and retaliated against him, based on race, after he publicly endorsed, and openly and publicly participated in campaign efforts on behalf of, Lewis Pittman, a white candidate for the Clerk of Court position. Calvert alleged that the defendants, \u201call of whom are black, were infuriated over the decision of Calvert, who is also black, to support Pittman (who is white) over Hicks in the upcoming election.\u201d Calvert stated that the adverse employment actions taken against him included \u201cdemeaning and unwelcome transfers and job assignments!!;] bogus, contrived, and pretextual \u2018write-ups\u2019 and reprimands!!;] unpaid suspensions!!;] and ultimately, involuntary termination of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">Appellants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that they were entitled to qualified immunity on Calvert\u2019s pure political patronage claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Qualified immunity protects government actors performing discretionary functions from being sued in their individual capacities. <em>Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1231-32 (11th Cir.2004). The doctrine shields government officials from liability to the extent that \u201ctheir conduct does not violate clearly established ... constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 817-18, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>A government official who is sued under \u00a7 1983 may seek summary judgment on the ground that he is entitled to qualified immunity. <em>Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252, 1263 (11th Cir. 2004). To be eligible for qualified immunity, the official must first establish that he was performing a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d at the time the alleged violation of federal law occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 1263-64. Once the official has established that he was engaged in a discretionary function, the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the official is not entitled to qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 1264. In order to demonstrate that the official is not entitled to qualified immunity, the plaintiff must show two things: (1) that the defendant has committed a constitutional violation and (2) that the constitutional right the defendant violated was \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time he did it. <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001); <em>Holloman, </em>370 F.3d at 1264. This two-step inquiry is designed to \u201cprovide!] ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">The district court, applying <em>Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), and <em>Branti v. Finkel, </em>445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980), the Supreme Court\u2019s seminal cases on political patronage claims, held the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-5\">Here, it is undisputed that the Individual Defendants were performing discretionary functions at the time the alleged violation of federal law occurred, and that Plaintiffs allegations, if true, may establish a constitutional violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-6\">Further, although the Individual Defendants argue the law was not clearly established that adverse employment action against a single employee \u2014 as opposed to an <em>en masse </em>firing or the firing of multiple employees \u2014 could give rise to a political patronage claim, the Court finds Plaintiff alleges facts which, if proven true, may defeat a claim of qualified immunity. <em>(See </em>Compl. K 23 (alleging Individual Defendants\u2019 discharged <em>other </em>Clerk\u2019s office employees based on their support of Pittman)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">(citations omitted) (emphasis added). The district court concluded that because Calvert\u2019s complaint alleged <em>numerous </em>discharges, and not just his own, summary judgment based on qualified immunity was not warranted on Calvert\u2019s political patronage claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">On the limited record before us, we cannot say the district court erred by concluding that, if the allegations in Calvert\u2019s complaint are true, which we too must assume they are, Appellants\u2019 qualified immunity defense fails. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of summary judgment at this point in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-16\">. As for Appellants\u2019 challenge to the denial of qualified immunity on Calvert's Fourteenth Amendment claims, we are unpersuaded by Appellants\u2019 arguments and affirm the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>court's conclusion that the allegations of Calvert\u2019s complaint were sufficient to defeat a qualified immunity defense. Calvert also sued Fulton County, Georgia and Hicks, in her official capacity. Those claims were dismissed, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Only the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity to the individual defendants on the First Amendment claims is before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\">. At this procedural point, we, like the district court, accept as true the facts as set forth in Calvert's complaint. <em>See Wilson v. Strong, </em>156 F.3d 1131, 1133 (11th Cir.1998)(\"In reviewing a motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity, the district court is required to accept the factual allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b843-13\">. When Calvert filed his complaint, it was unclear whether he asserted pure political patronage claims, pure expression claims, or mixed patronage/expression claims. <em>See Terry v. Cook, 866 </em>F.2d 373, 375-77 (11th Cir.1989) (distinguishing between these types of claims). After Appellants moved to dismiss based on Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), arguing Calvert failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, Calvert clarified that his claims were purely of the \"political patronage\u201d variety. We consider them as such in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
