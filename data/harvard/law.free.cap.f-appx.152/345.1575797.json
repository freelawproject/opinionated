The Government argues that Lerma knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence, except for a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum or any upward departure from established guidelines. The prosecutor did not review the specific provisions of the waiver during the rearraignment, and the magistrate judge did not determine whether Lerma understood that the only exceptions to the waiver were a sentence above the statutory maximum or an upward departure. The magistrate judge and the Government further confused the issue by their agreement that Lerma could appeal an undefined \u201cillegal sentence.\u201d Because it cannot be determined that the waiver was knowingly and voluntarily made by Lerma, we do not enforce it. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 518 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.1999); Fed. R.CrimP. 11(b)(1)(N).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Lerma argues that the enhancement of his sentence based on the mandatory sixteen-point adjustment to his offense level is illegal under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As Lerma concedes, <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>529 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) held that enhancements for prior convictions are not subject to the Sixth Amendment jury trial requirements. Lerma\u2019s sentence was enhanced based only on his prior conviction. Thus, Lerma\u2019s sentence was not affected by a <em>\u201cBooker </em>\u201d error or a Sixth Amendment violation. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Sentencing a defendant pursuant to a mandatory Guidelines scheme, without an accompanying Sixth Amendment violation, constitutes <em>\u201cFanfan </em>\u201d error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 364 (5th Cir.2005). <em>Fanfan </em>error is subject to the same plain error analysis set forth by this court in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517), for <em>Booker </em>error. <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597 (5th Cir. June 7, 2005). To the extent that Lerma urges that <em>Mares </em>was wrongly decided, that argument is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Ruff, </em>984 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Under the <em>Mares </em>analysis, Lerma has met the first two prongs of the plain error test because <em>Fanfan </em>error is \u201cerror\u201d that is \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir. 2005). To meet the third prong of the analysis and show that the error affected his substantial rights, Lerma bears the burden of showing \u201cthat the sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one\u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Review of the sentencing hearing reflects that Lerma cannot make the required showing. The district court made no statements indicating that it would impose a lesser sentence if it was not bound by the guidelines. The district court\u2019s comment that the guidelines are sometimes harsh and its imposition of a sentence at the bottom of the applicable guideline range do not demonstrate that the sentence affected Lerma\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>F.3d 310, 317 n. 4 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 26, 2005) (No. 05-5535). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Ahg\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
