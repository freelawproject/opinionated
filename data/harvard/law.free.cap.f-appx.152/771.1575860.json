Hamilton contends that she \u201ccould have at least been granted relief under The Privacy Act which requires correction of false records concerning any citizen who files a complaint that an agency is maintaining records about him that he alleges are false.\u201d Hamilton argues that she established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination \u201cunder 504 of the Rehabilitation act of 1973 and the [ADA],\u201d by alleging that: (1) she is a disabled and an SSDI recipient, (2) as an SSDI recipient, she qualified for participation in the VR program, (3) she was denied VR benefits and subjected to discrimination on account of her disability, and (4) the DVR receives federal funding. Hamilton also argues that she established a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination, pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, by alleging that: (1) she is an African-American, (2) her SSDI status qualified her for VR training and services, (3) she was denied VR services, and (4) she was denied \u201cself employment\u201d assistance which the DVR had afforded to other clients. Hamilton contends that, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-7, the State of Florida is not immune under the Eleventh Amendment from a suit in federal court alleging a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Hamilton also argues that the Eleventh Amendment \u201cdoes not bar suit against State Officials in their individual capacities, even if arising from their official acts ... unless the claim will \u2018run into the State Treasury\u2019 under State law.\u201d Hamilton further contends that the State of Florida is also not immune under the Eleventh Amendment from a suit in federal court alleging a violation of Title II of the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo, </em>accepting all allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Kyle K. v. Chapman, </em>208 F.3d 940, 942 (11th Cir.2000). A district court may dismiss a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>complaint for failure to state a claim only where it appears beyond a doubt that a <em>pro se </em>litigant can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief. <em>See Leal v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1280 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">As an initial matter, Hamilton fails to present any arguments regarding her claims of violation of her 14th Amendment rights and malpractice, and, consequently, those claims are deemed waived. <em>See Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998). Moreover, Hamilton makes only passing reference to her claims of civil conspiracy, fraud, mail fraud, and libel, and, consequently, those claims are likewise waived. <em>See Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1242 n. 10 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that, where appellant made only a passing reference to the district court\u2019s dismissal of a particular claim in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 case and made no arguments on the merits as to that issue, the issue was deemed waived). Furthermore, Hamilton contends for the first time on appeal that she was entitled to relief under the Privacy Act, and we generally will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Narey v. Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1526 (11th Cir.1994) (stating rule and five exceptions in civil context).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">As to Hamilton\u2019s claims of discrimination based upon race and disability against defendants DVR and against Whitaker and Givens in their official capacities, Hamilton\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim was barred by the Eleventh Amendment. To the extent that Hamilton made individual capacity claims against Whitaker and Givens in her complaint, she failed to allege that they, rather than DVR, violated her federal rights. Moreover, Hamilton failed to allege an essential element necessary to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination based upon disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, namely, that she was denied services because of her disability. As to defendants Bogert, Wells, and Skizynski, Hamilton failed to (1) comply with the pleading requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as well as (2) state a claim against them, as she does not mention them in the counts of her complaint related to racial and disability discrimination. Consequently, the district court did not err by dismissing Hamilton\u2019s complaint against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
