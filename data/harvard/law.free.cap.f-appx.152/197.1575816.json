For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Leinenbach was convicted in 1994 by a jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania of conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine, manufacturing methamphetamine, and possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute. Leinenbach was sentenced to a collective term of 27 years imprisonment. This Court affirmed Leinenbach\u2019s conviction and sentence on direct appeal, and the United States Supreme Court denied Leinenbach\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. In 1997, Leinenbach filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 which was denied. This Court declined to issue Leinenbach a certificate of appealability, <em>Leinenbach v. United States, </em>C.A. No. 02-3693, and the United States Supreme Court again declined to grant Leinenbach a petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Leinenbach, who is incarcerated at FCIAllenwood in White Deer, Pennsylvania, filed the underlying \u00a7 2241 petition in the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania in November 2004. In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Leinenbach raised challenges to his conviction and sentence under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (\u201cICCPR\u201d). On June 17, 2005, the District Court dismissed Leinenbach\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, concluding that Leinenbach had not shown that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective such that he should be allowed to proceed under \u00a7 2241. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">A \u00a7 2255 motion is the presumptive means by which a federal prisoner can challenge his conviction or sentence. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974). A federal prisoner may proceed under \u00a7 2241 only if the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249-51 (3d Cir.1997). \u201cA \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective only where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his claims.\u201d <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). Section 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because a prior motion has been unsuccessful or the petitioner is unable to meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements for filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120-21; <em>see also Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539. Rather, \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, for example, in the \u201crare situation\u201d where an intervening change in law makes the crime for which the petitioner was convicted \u201cnon-criminal.\u201d <em>Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">We agree with the District Court that Leinenbach\u2019s situation is not the rare one rendering \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. Specifically, we have held that \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective for a federal prisoner seeking to raise an <em>Apprendi </em>claim in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding. <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120-21. Like <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Blakely </em>(and moreover, <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not change the substantive law as to the elements of the offenses for which Leinenbach was convicted. Although Leinenbach may face substantive and procedural hurdles to presenting these claims in a \u00a7 2255 motion, that alone does not render a \u00a7 2255 motion an inadequate or ineffective remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Likewise, we agree with the District Court\u2019s disposition of Leinenbach\u2019s ICCPR claim. Treaty violations may be raised in \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 344, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974) for the proposition that relief under \u00a7 2255 extends to treaties). In any event, however, habeas relief is not available for a violation of the ICCPR because it is not self-executing. <em>See, e.g., Bannerman v. Snyder, </em>325 F.3d 722, 724 (6th Cir.2003); <em>Wesson, </em>305 F.3d at 348; <em>United States ex rel. Perez v. Warden, </em>286 F.3d 1059, 1063 (8th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Finally, Leinenbach\u2019s assertion of actual innocence does not alter our conclusion that the District Court properly dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition. Leinenbach\u2019s argument is one of legal innocence, not factual innocence, based on the erroneous premise that <em>Apprendi Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker </em>apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>See Lloyd v. United States, </em>407 F.3d 608, 613-15 (3d Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Booker, </em>which applied the <em>Blakely </em>rule to the federal sentencing guidelines, is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review); <em>United States v. Swinton, </em>333 F.3d 481, 491 (3d Cir.2003) (holding that <em>Apprend\u00ed </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review). In short, Leinenbach\u2019s actual innocence argument is unavailing in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Because this appeal presents \u201cno substantial question,\u201d 3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s June 17, 2005, order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\">. As the District Court correctly noted, because Leinenbach is a federal prisoner sentenced under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, his claim is better expressed in terms of <em>Booker. </em>Of course, this makes no difference to the outcome of Leinenbach\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
