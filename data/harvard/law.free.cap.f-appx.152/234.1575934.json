Serving his sentence at F.C.I. \u2014 Allenwood, he filed a second petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 to challenge his conviction. He argued that the District Court had jurisdiction over his \u00a7 2241 petition because he \u201chas filed multiple \u00a7 2255 motions and cannot obtain the relief from the. application of new or recent Supreme Court decisions, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>... as well as, a challenge to the unconstitutionality of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924 (ACCA) in this case, which has no retroactive constraints.\u201d Petition at 9. The District Court disagreed, holding that it was without jurisdiction to consider his claims. Tracy filed a timely motion for reconsideration and a notice of appeal. The District Court denied Tracy\u2019s motion, and Tracy filed an amended notice of appeal. Because there is no substantial question on appeal, the District Court\u2019s orders will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Tracy relied on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to generally challenge judicial fact-finding at his sentencing and to specifically challenge the constitutionality of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924 (\u201cACCA\u201d). He also claimed that the ACCA violated Article I, \u00a7 1, and the 5th Amendment of the United States Constitution, as well as the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. He made an additional claim that the use of the state criminal complaint or police report to prove the ACCA elements for sentencing was unconstitutional in light of <em>Shepard v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Despite Tracy\u2019s arguments to the contrary, he cannot bring his petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, because a motion to challenge his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 cannot be considered an \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d remedy. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2005). Tracy may not be able to meet the procedural hurdles to bringing claims, such as his Article I delegation challenge, that he could have raised in his first \u00a7 2255 motion. However, \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective just because a petitioner is unable to meet its stringent gatekeeping requirements. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Furthermore, we have held that \u00a7 2255 is not an inadequate or ineffective way to bring claims based on <em>Apprendi. See Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120-21 (3d Cir.2002). Claims under <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>are not sufficiently distinguishable from a claim under <em>Apprendi </em>to meet the <em>In re Dorsainvil </em>exception and permit Tracy to seek relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Cf. Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120-21. Also like <em>Apprendi, Shepard </em>did not change the substantive law as to the elements of the offense for which Tracy was convicted. <em>See </em>125 S.Ct. at 1257. Success on his claim under <em>Shepard </em>(or on any of his constitutional challenges to the ACCA) would affect his sentence, not the criminality of his conduct. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">In sum, the District Court was without jurisdiction to consider Tracy\u2019s petition under \u00a7 2241. Therefore, the District Court properly dismissed Tracy\u2019s petition and denied his motion for reconsideration. For the foregoing reasons, the District Court\u2019s orders will be summarily affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
