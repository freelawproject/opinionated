Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We find no plain error, and thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-20\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applies to the federal sentencing guidelines and that the mandatory guidelines scheme that provided for sentence enhancements based on facts found by the court violated the Sixth Amendment. 125 S.Ct. at 746-48, 755-56. Ferguson contends that his sentence runs afoul of <em>Blakely </em>for two reasons: (1) his base offense level was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>calculated on the basis of a prior controlled substance offense, while the indictment charged only a prior felony, and (2) the court enhanced his sentence for possession of the firearm in connection with another felony, facts that were neither charged nor admitted. Because Ferguson did not raise these claims below, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 247 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Regarding the prior controlled substance offense, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), a sentence may be enhanced based on the <em>fact of </em>a prior conviction. However, when the sentencing court looks \u201cbeyond the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement, the plea colloquy, the statutory definition, or any explicit finding of the trial court to determine a fact <em>about </em>a prior conviction,\u201d then the finding has gone too far afield from the prior judicial record and falls outside the <em>Apprendi </em>exception to the <em>Booker </em>holding. <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 521-22 (4th Cir.2005). Ferguson was previously convicted of possession with intent to sell and deliver cocaine. The district court did not need to make any factual findings about this conviction to conclude that it was a controlled substance offense, within the definition of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) (2003). <em>See Collins, </em>412 F.3d at 515. Therefore, the enhancement of Ferguson\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1 was within the <em>Apprendi </em>exception and did not violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Turning to the firearm enhancement, Ferguson\u2019s offense level would have been 20 without the enhancement. Because Ferguson was in criminal history category III, his guideline range would have been 41 to 51 months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Ferguson\u2019s 46-month sentence did not exceed the maximum sentence allowed based on the facts he admitted. Therefore, Ferguson has failed to show plain error. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005) (outlining requirements for showing plain error in <em>Booker </em>context).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Ferguson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-12\">. In his plea agreement, Ferguson waived his right to appeal. However, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss based on the waiver was filed over seven months after briefing was completed. Accordingly, the motion is denied as untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\"><em>. </em>While Ferguson did receive a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, when determining if <em>Booker </em>error occurred, this court looks to the guideline range before any reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
