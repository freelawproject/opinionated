MataHernandez was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 41 months to be followed by a two-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Mata-Hemandez contends that his Iowa incest conviction is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) and this court\u2019s jurisprudence because it does not have as an element the use or attempted use of force. The Government concedes error.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Section \u00a7 2L1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines provides that the offense level for unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States shall be increased by 16 levels if the defendant has a prior conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as any of certain listed offenses or \u201cany offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). Because incest is not a listed offense, the offense must involve the use or threatened use of force to be a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Iowa Code \u00a7 726.2 provides that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvI\">person, except a child as defined in section 702.5, who performs a sex act with another whom the person knows to be related to the person, either legitimately or illegitimately, as an ancestor, descendant, brother or sister of the whole or half blood, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew, commits incest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The commission of the offense does not require the use of physical force against a person. <em>See United States v. Vargas-Duran, </em>356 F.3d 598, 600 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>541 U.S. 965, 124 S.Ct. 1728, 158 L.Ed.2d 410 (2004). Thus, it was not a crime of violence warranting a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The sentence is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Mata-Hernandez also argues that he should be resentenced because the district court erred in sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines scheme invalidated by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Given that Mata-Hernandez\u2019s sentence has been vacated, it is not necessary to address the <em>Booker </em>issue. <em>See United States v. Southerland, </em>405 F.3d 263, 270 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">Mata-Hernandez\u2019s argument that the treatment of prior convictions as sentencing factors rather than offense elements under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1), (b)(2) is unconstitutional is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
