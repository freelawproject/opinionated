He alleged that the defendants produced a fraudulently incomplete affidavit to support his arrest warrant. Perry now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), as barred by the applicable two-year Texas limitations statute for personal injury actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-20\">The district court erred in concluding that Perry\u2019s complaint was time-barred. Because Perry continues to serve the prison sentence for the conviction he is effectively attacking, his claims have not yet accrued for limitations purposes, under the doctrine of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). <em>See Castellano v. Fragozo, </em>352 F.3d 939, 959 (5th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 31, 160 L.Ed.2d 10 (2004). This court may affirm on any ground, however, that is apparent from the record. <em>Sojourner T v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992). In the instant case, the <em>Heck </em>doctrine itself is such a ground. \u201c[I]n order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid,\u201d a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>been reversed on direct appeal or otherwise invalidated by official action. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 1994 WL 276683 (footnote omitted). If a judgment in favor of the plaintiff \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Because Perry\u2019s malicious-prosecution and false-imprisonment claims directly implicate the validity of his conviction and confinement, his claims are not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Although the district court\u2019s dismissal was based on an erroneous legal basis, the court\u2019s underlying conclusion that Perry\u2019s complaint was frivolous was correct. <em>See Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001). Perry\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cm. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The dismissal of Perry\u2019s complaint as frivolous and of this appeal as frivolous count as \u201cstrikes\u201d for purposes of the three-strikes provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Perry is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
