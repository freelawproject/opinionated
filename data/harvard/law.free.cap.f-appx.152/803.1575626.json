Hicks argues on appeal that his sentence at the bottom of his advisory guideline range, which the district court imposed after considering, at least implicitly, all of the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), was unreasonable, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm Hicks\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-20\">Hicks plead guilty, pursuant to a written plea agreement, to the above-referenced offense. During Hicks\u2019s plea colloquy, he agreed that, as part of an investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s (\u201cDEA\u2019s\u201d) Mobil Enforcement Team (\u201cMET Team\u201d) of narcotics trafficking in the northwest area of Hallandale Beach, Florida, members of the MET Team, acting as undercover agents, purchased cocaine base from him. Hicks also conceded that these buys, which occurred on four separate occasions over a two-month period, involved a total of 57.5 grams of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Prior to sentencing, a probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), recommending that Hicks\u2019s base offense level be set at 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) (setting offense level applicable for offenses involving at least 50 grams, but less than 150 grams, of cocaine base). The probation officer also recommended a three-level reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, for acceptance of responsibility. With an adjusted offense level of 29, and a criminal history category of III, Hicks\u2019s resulting guideline range was 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. In making these calculations, the probation officer explained that no role adjustment was warranted, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, because, \u201c[although Hicks was the primary negotiator and in charge of setting the purchase price of the crack cocaine, he [did] not appear to have been in a leadership role, which would warrant an aggravating role enhancement.\u201d In addition, the probation officer noted that the district court might decide to depart upward, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, because Hicks\u2019s criminal history category of III did not adequately reflect his extensive juvenile criminal history.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Hicks filed objections to the PSI, arguing that a \u00a7 3B1.2(b) minor-role adjustment was warranted because (1) he \u201cwas at the bottom of the [drug distribution] chain as a street[-]level seller\u201d; (2) his \u201clocalized\u201d offense conduct was not sophisticated or complex; and (3) he was not a leader, manager, or organizer. Hicks also argued that, due to the fact that he only was age 18 when he committed the instant offense, the court should depart downward based on his \u201cextreme vulnerability in prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Alternatively, Hicks contended that, in light of <em>Booker, </em>the court should apply the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a) to the mitigating facts in his case and conclude that his mandatory minimum statutory sentence of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment, instead of his guideline range of 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, was reasonable and sufficient. In support of this last argument, Hicks contended that (1) the offense involved simple and unsophisticated drug sales; (2) his guideline range was \u201cartificially inflated\u201d because he was not arrested until after an undercover agent made multiple drug purchases from Hicks; (3) despite Hicks\u2019s \u201ctroubled history,\u201d he was intelligent and had family support; and (4) a reduced sentence would provide him with the \u201cneeded educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">On February 4, 2005, at sentencing, Hicks renewed his \u00a7 3B1.2(b) objection and motion for a downward departure based on his \u201cextreme vulnerability.\u201d Hicks also reargued that the court should impose his mandatory minimum statutory sentence, instead of sentencing him within his advisory guideline range. In addition to reasserting the reasons outlined in his objections to the PSI, Hicks asserted in support of this last argument that (1) he had never been in prison; (2) the drug sales at issue had not involved large sums of money, weapons, threats, or injuries; (3) his pre-sentence incarceration had \u201copened his eyes\u201d to \u201cthe reality of the crime\u201d; (4) his mandatory minimum statutory sentence would reflect adequately the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>seriousness of the offense; and (5) educational or vocational treatment would have the most impact at his age.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The government responded that a sentence below Hicks\u2019s guideline range was not warranted because (1) Hicks had been dealing drugs since he was age 11; (2) Hicks had dropped out of high school in the ninth grade; (3) Hicks had an extensive criminal history as a juvenile; (4) out of the 30 MET cases the prosecutor personally had handled, Hicks had sold the highest quantity of drugs, and for the largest sums of cash; and (5) Hicks\u2019s minimum mandatory statutory sentence would not promote respect for the law because Hicks had failed to take advantage of previously granted leniency and had repeatedly committed crimes and violated his probation. Hicks replied that, although he was not disputing either the facts, or his criminal history, the court should not base his sentence primarily on misconduct that he had committed during his youth.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">At the conclusion of the parties\u2019 arguments, the district court denied Hicks\u2019s request for a minor-role adjustment, finding that Hicks, if anything, was more culpable than the only other identifiable member of the drug-trafficking operation. The court similarly denied Hicks\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on \u201cextreme vulnerability,\u201d explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">[Tjhere is nothing in this record [that] distinguishes Mr. Hicks, as a 19-, soon to be 20-year-old, from any other person of similar age or characteristics. He is not physically or mentally deficient or vulnerable in any way that would, in my mind, justify him [being treated] differently [sic] than any other person of a similar age. And, if I were to grant him a downward departure on that basis alone, his age, I don\u2019t know how I could distinguish him from any other 20-year-old who comes before me. And I believe I need more evidence in the record to justify vulnerability than his mere age. So I am going to deny that request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">The court, thus, adopted the PSI\u2019s findings and calculated Hicks\u2019s advisory guideline range as 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. After giving Hicks the opportunity to allocute, the court also denied the government\u2019s request for an upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">The court then sentenced Hicks to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment, 4 years\u2019 supervised release, and a $100 special assessment fee. In doing so, the court offered the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-11\">Now, I just want to make clear ... that simply imposing a sentence does not mean that the individual has no worth. The guidelines are intended to give guidance to district judges as to what may be an appropriate sentence under the circumstances in order to attempt to assure, insure, that similar people who are convicted of similar crimes with similar backgrounds under similar facts are treated similarly throughout the country ... [and not] just because of the culture or nature or the manner in which the courts in the legal system operate, just because of the peculiarities or preferences of an individual judge. They\u2019re intended to try and treat people equally. So, again, that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re bound by the guidelines. And that\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>what the <em>Booker </em>[C]ourt made clear: that they\u2019re advisory only, but certainly they need to be considered seriously and, in my judgment, should not be ignored without significant justification, and, taking everything into consideration in this case, I believe that a guideline sentence is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-5\">So, after a consideration of the statements of all the parties and a review of the [PSI], the [c]ourt shall impose a sentence within the guideline range. The [c]ourt finds, however, that a sentence at the low end of the guideline range is sufficient to deter future criminal conduct. Furthermore, it is the finding of the [c]ourt that [Hicks] is not able to pay a fine. Accordingly, no fine shall be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Hicks raised no objections to the court\u2019s pronouncement of, and explanation of, his sentence, other than reasserting his previous objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Hicks argues on appeal that the district court erred in imposing his sentence because it misunderstood the \u201cthe proper range of its discretion\u201d in imposing a post-<em>Booker </em>sentence. Hicks asserts in support that the court (1) violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(b) by leaving unresolved controverted matter, (2) erroneously determined that it could not sentence him outside of his guideline range \u201cwithout significant justification,\u201d and (3) failed to explain or articulate its findings as to \u00a7 3353(a)\u2019s sentencing factors. Hicks concludes that, because of these legal errors, he received an unreasonable sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">As a preliminary matter, to the extent Hicks is arguing that the court violated Rule 32(i)(3)(B), by leaving unresolved disputed issues, this rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0b\">At sentencing, the court must \u2014 for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other converted matter \u2014 rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B). In interpreting a former, but similar, version of Rule 32,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we determined that \u201c[t]o demonstrate a technical transgression of [former Rule 32], all that is necessary is that an allegation of a specific factual error in the [PSI] was before the [] court and that the [] judge did not make either of the alternative findings.\u201d <em>United States v. Boatner, </em>966 F.2d 1575, 1581 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">We, however, have clarified that, at least with respect to the former version of Rule 32, the rule is applicable only to objections to a probation officer\u2019s factual findings, instead of his or her legal opinions or conclusions. <em>See United States v. Vincent, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>121 F.3d 1451, 1453 (11th Cir.1997). In <em>Vincent, </em>we determined that the defendant, in challenging the legal conclusion that a sentence enhancement was applicable, had failed to demonstrate that his PSI contained a controverted factual allegation. <em>See id. </em>Similarly, in arguing a Rule 32(i)(3)(B) violation, Hicks has failed to identify unresolved factual allegations. Indeed, at sentencing, Hicks conceded that he was not disputing either the facts in his PSI, or its calculation of his criminal history. Moreover, as discussed below, the record, at least implicitly, shows that the court considered all of \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s sentencing factors and the mitigating facts Hicks offered as they related to these factors. Thus, Hicks argument as it relates to Rule 32(i)(3)(B) is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">To the extent Hicks also is contesting what standard of review is applicable on review, and whether the district court properly relied on his guideline range, the Supreme Court, prior to Hicks\u2019s sentencing hearing, issued its decision in <em>Booker, </em>holding that the mandatory nature of the federal guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a second and separate majority opinion, the <em>Booker </em>Court explained that, to best preserve Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the appropriate remedy was to \u201cexcise\u201d two specific sections \u2014 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (requiring a sentence within the guideline range, absent a departure) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (establishing standards of review on appeal, including <em>de novo </em>review of departures from the applicable guideline range) \u2014 thereby effectively rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory only. <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 764. Thus, the <em>Booker </em>Court concluded that a defendant\u2019s guideline range is now advisory; it no longer dictates the final sentencing result but, instead, is an important sentencing factor that the sentencing court is to consider, along with the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at -, 125 S.Ct. at 764-65. Moreover, the <em>Booker </em>Court concluded that courts of appeals now must review sentences for unreasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at -, 125 S.Ct. at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">In applying <em>Booker, </em>we have determined that a district court\u2019s interpretation of the federal guidelines still is subject to <em>de novo </em>review, while its factual findings must be accepted unless clearly erroneous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number><em>United States v. Jordi </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[n]othing in <em>Booker </em>suggests that a reasonableness standard should govern review of the interpretation and application as advisory of the [guidelines by a district court\u201d). However, after a court has calculated a defendant\u2019s guideline range, it \u201cmay impose a more severe or more lenient sentence,\u201d which we review only for reasonableness. <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1179. Moreover, although the federal guidelines now are only advisory, courts \u201cremain[] obliged to \u2018consult\u2019 and \u2018take into account\u2019 the [guidelines in sentencing,\u201d and the guidelines \u201cremain an essential consideration in the imposition of federal sentences, albeit along with the factors in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Applying this analysis to the instant case, the district court properly noted that, although it was required to consider Hicks\u2019s guideline range of 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, and although it did not believe that a defendant\u2019s guideline range should be ignored \u201cwithout significant justification,\u201d it understood that it was not bound by this range. In explaining that it had found that Hicks, if anything, was more culpable than his codefendant, and that Hicks\u2019s age, alone, was not sufficient to conclude that he would be more vulnerable than other defendants if he was sentenced to a lengthy prison sentence, the court demonstrated that it had considered \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Moreover, in discussing that a sentence of 108 months\u2019 imprisonment would be sufficient to deter future criminal conduct, and that Hicks was unable to pay a fine, the court showed that it had considered the need for a sentence \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B); and the kinds of sentences available, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Additionally, in explaining that it had considered the arguments of the parties and the contents of Hicks\u2019s PSI, the court, at least implicitly, demonstrated that it had considered, along with Hicks\u2019s guideline range, the other sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). Indeed, applying these other factors, although Hicks argued that (1) he was \u201cat the bottom of [drug distribution] chain,\u201d (2) the offense involve \u201csimple and unsophisticated drug sales,\u201d and (3) his conduct was \u201clocalized,\u201d Hicks conceded that the offense conduct involved four separate drug sales, during which he sold a total of 57.5 grams of cocaine base. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (\u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Hicks\u2019s PSI also reflects that, although he only was age 18 when he committed the instant offense, he had a lengthy juvenile criminal history and he had not taken advantage of past opportunities to rehabilitate himself. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (\u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D) (\u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to provide the defendant with needed [treatment]\u201d). Thus, Hicks has failed to show that the court did not consider \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s sentencing factors, or that his 108-month sentence, which was at the low end of his guideline range and was less than half of his statutory maximum sentence, was unreasonable. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (setting maximum statutory sentence for offenses involving five grams or more of cocaine base as 40 years); see <em>also Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1241 (concluding that a determination of how much deference is owed a sentence within a defendant\u2019s advisory guideline range was unnecessary because the defendant\u2019s two-year sentence\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>which was one-tenth of his statutory maximum sentence, was the result of his defrauding 21 people of a total of $19,600, was committed after previous convictions and while the defendant still was serving a sentence for another offense, and followed the defendant\u2019s violating his bond and threatening to murder the arresting officers as he fled from them \u2014 clearly was reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Finally, to the extent Hicks is challenging the court\u2019s failure to explicitly discuss during his sentencing hearing each of the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a), he failed to raise this claim in the district court. Indeed, when the court asked Hicks whether he had any objections to the court\u2019s pronouncement of sentence, Hicks replied that he had none, other than reasserting his previous objections. Thus, our review only is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.) (reviewing a newly raised <em>Booker </em>challenge for plain error), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). \u201cAn appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: \u2018(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201c \u2018If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">An error cannot meet the \u201cplain\u201d requirement of the plain error rule if it is not \u201cclear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1321 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation omitted). \u201c[W]here neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has ever resolved an issue, and other circuits are split on it, there can be no plain error in regard to that issue.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Gerrow, </em>232 F.3d 831, 835 (11th Cir.2000) (concluding that the Court need not determine under plain-error review, in the absence of precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court, whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)((2) provided the maximum term of supervised release for a defendant sentenced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C)). Because Hicks has failed to show that either the Supreme Court or this Court had determined <em>post-Booker </em>to what extent courts are required to explain sentences, any error was not \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d at 1321.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court (1) properly considered both Hicks\u2019s advisory guideline range and the other sentencing factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a), and (2) did not plainly err in pronouncing Hicks\u2019s sentence. We, therefore, affirm Hicks\u2019s 108-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-6\">. The PSI reflects that Hicks\u2019s juvenile history, which began at age 11, included the state offenses of (1) possession with intent to sell cocaine base, (2) burglary, (3) theft, (4) battery, (5) grand theft auto, (6) possession of cannabis, and (7) resisting without violence. Moreover, Hicks committed the instant offense while he was on probation for the state offenses of (1) carrying a concealed firearm, (2) resisting without violence, and (3) discharging a firearm at a school.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b828-7\">. Hicks also produced as mitigating evidence a letter from his parents, in which they stated that (1) their neighborhood gave \"the false perception that those who break the laws appear to prosper far greater than those [] who work hard to make ends meet\u201d; (2) Hicks was a \"child playing in a very grown man\u2019s game\u201d; (3) Hicks appeared to act, at least in part, out of his desire to provide for his new child; (4) Hicks was \"heavily addicted\u201d to marijuana when he committed the instant offense conduct; (5) he had intended to enter a \"boot camp\u201d; and (6) he was remorseful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b829-8\">.

Moreover, we recently determined in <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241 (11th Cir.2005), that, <em>post-Booker, </em>we still have no jurisdiction to review a decision of a district court not to depart downward, so long as the district court did not incorrectly believe that it lacked the authority to apply a departure. <em>See id., </em>at 1241.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b829-14\">.

In concluding in <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir.2005), that a district court's sentencing of a defendant under a mandatory-guidelines system was harmless error, we commented, albeit as dicta, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-8\">Even if Robles was sentenced <em>post-Booker </em>and we were reviewing for reasonableness, we would not expect the district court in every case to conduct an accounting of every \u00a7 3553(a) factor ... and expound upon how each factor played a role in its sentencing decision. Certainly, the more insight a district court can provide us with, the better it will be for appellate review, especially when the court sentences outside of the guidelines; however, when a district court sentences within the guidelines, we could not expect a court to do more than was done in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-14\"><em>See Robles, </em>408 F.3d at 1328.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
