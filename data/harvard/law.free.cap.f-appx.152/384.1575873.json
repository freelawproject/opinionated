Harris asserts for the first time that under <em>United States v. </em>Booker, -U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), he was sentenced in violation of his constitutional rights based on facts that were not admitted and that were not found by a jury. In addition, he contends for the first time that his sentence, which was imposed pursuant to a mandatory Sentencing Guideline scheme, constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-26\">Harris argues that the errors made at sentencing affected his substantial rights. He asserts that the district court\u2019s statement at sentencing, that it \u201cwould love to find a way to [make an adjustment based on] aberrant conduct\u201d demonstrates that the errors affected the outcome of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-27\">We review Harris\u2019s contentions for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir. 2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). To establish plain error, Harris must identify an error that is obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520. If Harris makes this showing, we may exercise our discretion to notice a forfeited error if \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court determined that the system of enhancements established by the United States Sentencing Guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment and reaffirmed that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 749-50, 756. The Court also excised from the Sentencing Reform Act the mandatory duty of district courts to apply the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and effectively rendered the Guidelines advisory. <em>See id. </em>at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Although Harris has established obvious error, he must still demonstrate that the error \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). He must show that \u201cthe sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Harris has not made the required showing. A review of the record indicates that the district court\u2019s statement was not a comment concerning its dissatisfaction with the inflexibility of the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory Sentencing Guidelines, nor was the statement an expression of the district court\u2019s desire to sentence Harris to a lesser term of imprisonment. _ Before imposing sentence, the district court explained that a departure based on aberrant conduct did not apply in Harris\u2019s case. The district court stated that although it was denying Harris a departure, it was willing to sentence Harris at the bottom of the Guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Harris has not shown that the errors that occurred at sentencing \u201caffected the outcome\u201d of the proceedings. <em>Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 318 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.2005). Harris has not shown that the district court, sentencing in a <em>post-Booker </em>proceeding, would have reached a \u201csignificantly different result.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521-22. Accordingly, Harris has not established plain error, and his sentence is AFFIRMED. Harris\u2019s motion for expedited consideration is DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
