Gant challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u00a7 1983 claims and also challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2512 claim. Gant\u2019s motion to file a reply brief out-of-time is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Gant has abandoned the issue of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his state-law claims by failing to brief the issue on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, 813 F.2d </em>744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>see Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">We review a dismissal of a complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir. 1998). A district court may dismiss an IFP complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(1) if it lacks an arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Gant\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims against Lockheed Martin Corporation (\u201cLockheed\u201d) based on Gant\u2019s allegations failing to satisfy the requirement that Lockheed was a state actor acting under color of state law. <em>See generally Ballard v. Wall, </em>413 F.3d 510, 518 (5th Cir.2005). Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in dismissing as frivolous Gant\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2512 claim. Even if a private right of action exists under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2512, an issue we do not herein decide, Gant\u2019s complaint did not allege that Lockheed knew or had reason to know that the purportedly defective transponders were designed in such a way as to render them \u201cprimarily useful for the purpose of the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2512.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Gant was previously warned that if he continued to file frivolous appeals, this court would issue sanctions. <em>Gant v. Texas, </em>123 Fed.Appx. 622 (5th Cir.2005) (unpublished). Because this court has previously warned of sanctions and Gant\u2019s appeal is frivolous, we determine that sanctions are warranted. <em>See Coghlan v. Starkey, </em>852 F.2d 806, 808 (5th Cir. 1988)(courts of appeals have the ability to impose sanctions sua sponte).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">This appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Gant is hereby' ORDERED to pay $100.00 to the clerk of this court. The clerk of this court and the clerks of all courts subject to the jurisdiction of this court are directed to return to Gant unfiled any submissions he should make until the sanction is paid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">MOTION TO FILE REPLY BRIEF OUT-OF-TIME GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
