Valenzuela-Luna, </em>115 Fed. Appx. 241 (5th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We received supplemental briefs addressing <em>Booker\u2019s </em>impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">Valenzuela acknowledges that he challenged the constitutionality of his sentence on the principles of <em>Booker </em>for the first time in his petition for writ of certiorari. Absent extraordinary circumstances, we will not consider a defendant\u2019s <em>Booker-</em>related claim presented for the first time in a petition for writ of certiorari. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.2005). Had Valenzuela raised his <em>Booker </em>argument in his initial appellate brief, this court would have reviewed the argument for plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 677. As in <em>Taylor, </em>Valenzuela \u201cpoints to no evidence in the record suggesting that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory guidelines system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Hernandez-Gonzalez, </em>405 F.3d 260, 261 (5th Cir. 2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521-22 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005)) (No. 04-9517). Indeed, to the contrary, Valenzuela concedes that he cannot show that the error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">Because Valenzuela fails plain-error review, he also falls short of showing the \u201cpossibility of injustice so grave as to warrant disregard of usual procedural rules.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ogle, </em>415 F.3d 382 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, Valenzuela has failed to show extraordinary circumstances warranting consideration of an issue raised for the first time in a petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Taylor, </em>409 F.3d at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-18\">For the first time on remand, Valenzuela challenges the 16-level enhancement to his sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), for a prior conviction for a crime of violence. Specifically, Valenzuela argues that the enhancement was not warranted because his prior Texas conviction for injury to a child does not constitute a crime of violence. Valenzuela acknowledges that he is raising this issue for the first time on remand, but contends that \u201cintervening controlling law\u201d requires this court to consider the issue. Valenzuela cites to this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Vasquez-Torres, </em>134 Fed. Appx. 648 (5th Cir.2005) in support of his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-19\">As a minimum, Valenzuela must demonstrate extraordinary circumstances in order for this court to consider an issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>raised for the first time on remand from the Supreme Court. Valenzuela fails to do this. In <em>Vasquez-Torres, </em>134 Fed.Appx. 648, this court determined, by looking at the elements of the crime, that the Texas offense of injury to a child does not constitute a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). As the Government points out, <em>Vasquez-Torres </em>is an unpublished opinion. As such, under Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4 <em>Vasquez-Torres </em>is not \u201ccontrolling law\u201d but rather persuasive authority. Furthermore, <em>Vasquez-Torres </em>did not announce a new rule of law. It, in fact, relied on case law existing at the time Valenzuela filed his appellant brief. <em>See Vasquez-Torres, </em>134 FedAppx. 648. Valenzuela does not explain why he did not challenge the district court\u2019s 16-level enhancement in his initial appellant brief. Accordingly, he has failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances warranting consideration of his issue raised for the first time on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">As Valenzuela acknowledges, his argument that his sentence is unconstitutional because it was enhanced for a prior conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326ft)) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). This court does not have the authority to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\"><em>Booker </em>does not require this court to change the prior affirmance in Valenzuela\u2019s case. Accordingly, we reinstate our judgment affirming Valenzuela\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
