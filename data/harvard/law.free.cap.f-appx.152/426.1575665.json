Martinez contends that the district court violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him under the formerly mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Sentencing Guidelines regime. According to Martinez, application of the formerly mandatory regime was a structural error that should not require plain-error analysis. Martinez acknowledges that his structural-error and presumed-prejudice contentions are foreclosed, and he concedes that he cannot satisfy the plain-error test applicable to issues raised for the first time on appeal, but he raises the issues to preserve them for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Martinez\u2019s structural-error and presumptive-prejudice contentions are foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, \u2014 L.Ed. 2d - (2005) (No. 05-6242). Martinez has failed to demonstrate that his sentence likely would have been different under an advisory sentencing regime. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 522 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. - \u2014 \u25a0, 126 S.Ct. 43, \u2014 L.Ed.2d --- (2005). The district court imposed the longest sentence indicated by Martinez\u2019s sentencing range, denied Martinez\u2019s request for a downward departure, and indicated a lack of sympathy for Martinez.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
