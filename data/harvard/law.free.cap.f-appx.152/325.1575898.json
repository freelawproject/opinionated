On appeal, White raises one issue in his brief: whether the court\u2019s application of the career offender enhancement violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The Government argues White\u2019s appeal should be dismissed based on the appellate waiver. White filed a reply brief, arguing that he preserved his right to appeal under <em>Blakely, </em>because he could not knowingly and intelligently waive a right that did not exist at the time he entered into his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">This court will uphold a waiver of appellate rights if the waiver is valid and the issue being appealed is covered by the waiver. <em>United States v. Attar, </em>38 F.3d 727, 731-33 (4th Cir.1994). White\u2019s appeal is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162 (4th Cir.2005), in which this court held that a waiver of appellate rights in a plea agreement that was accepted prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was not invalidated by the change in law effected by that decision. <em>See Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 170, 173; <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137 (4th Cir.2005) (rejecting argument that a defendant cannot waive the right to appeal based on subsequent changes in the law). We find that White\u2019s challenge falls within the scope of his pre<em>Booker </em>appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-15\">Next, White argues that his right to appeal under <em>Blakely </em>was preserved by the district court notwithstanding the waiver provision in his plea agreement. During the sentencing hearing, White\u2019s counsel stated, \u2018Tour Honor, preliminarily, I\u2019ll make an argument based on <em>Blakely. </em>As the court knows, the principles of <em>Blakely </em>may or may not affect the sentencing guidelines.\u201d The court replied, \u201cI deem all of your <em>Blakely </em>arguments to be made, and your position preserved.\u201d White relies upon <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>59 F.3d 914, 917-18 (9th Cir.1995), for the proposition that the Government\u2019s silence after the court\u2019s statement modified the plea agreement. However, in <em>Buchanan </em>the district court twice told the defendant that he had the right to appeal his sentence despite the appellate waiver in the plea agreement. 59 F.3d at 917-18. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the defendant had a right to rely on the oral statement of the court when the government failed to object. <em>Id. </em>at 918. However, in this case the court did not state that White retained the right to appeal his sentence based on <em>Blakely, </em>and the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>statement that the <em>Blakely </em>argument is \u201cpreserved\u201d was not sufficient to modify the plea agreement. Moreover, White did not rely to his detriment on the explanation of the district court in entering his guilty plea. <em>Cf. United States v. Wood, </em>878 F.3d 342, 350 (4th Cir.2004). We further observe that even if White\u2019s appellate waiver was not enforced, the district court\u2019s imposition of an identical alternative sentence would cause us to conclude that any error in the court\u2019s application of the challenged career offender enhancement was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Accordingly, we dismiss White\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-11\">. The court gave an alternative sentence in accordance with this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316, 353-54 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>vacat</em>ed,-U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005). Treating the guidelines as advisory, the alternate sentence was also 151 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
