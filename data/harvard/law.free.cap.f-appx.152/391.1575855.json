The district court sentenced Martinez to 151 months in prison on the four conspiracy and cocaine counts and 60 months on the false statement count. All sentences were to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">Martinez argues that the district court erred in refusing the following proposed jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-17\">Nervousness is a normal reaction to events that one does not understand. For that reason, general nervousness is not sufficient to show consciousness of guilt. In the absence of facts that suggest that the defendant\u2019s nervousness or anxiety derives from an underlying consciousness of criminal behavior, evidence of nervousness is insufficient to support a finding of guilty knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-18\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s refusal to give a jury instruction requested by the defense for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. John, </em>309 F.3d 298, 304 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cA court commits reversible error where (1) the requested instruction is substantially correct; (2) the requested issue is not substantially covered in the charge; and (3) the instruction \u2018concerns an important point in the trial so that the failure to give it seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to effectively present a given defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-19\">None of the three factors firmly support the general nervousness instruction. Martinez\u2019s requested charge was an incomplete statement of law with regard to nervousness because nervousness at an inspection station is among the circumstances that can be probative of guilty knowledge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>United States v. Diaz-Carreon, </em>915 F.2d 951, 954 (5th Cir.1990). The charge adequately instructed the jury on the requisite mental state because the language conveyed to the jury, at least in broad terms, that nervousness could be among the circumstances that indicate Martinez\u2019s state of mind. Contrary to Martinez\u2019s argument, the evidence presented at trial suggested several connections between Martinez\u2019s nervousness and consciousness of guilt. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>185 F.3d 459, 464 (5th Cir.1999). The existence of the substantial other evidence of guilty knowledge shows that the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that an instruction on general nervousness would not have been appropriate and that the absence of such an instruction did not seriously impair Martinez\u2019s ability to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Martinez argues that his sentence was imposed illegally in light of the rule in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), for the first time on appeal. This court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, 407 </em>F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. </em>denied,\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">After <em>Booker, </em>\u201c[i]t is clear that application of the Guidelines in their mandatory form constitutes error that is plain.\u201d <em>Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733. To satisfy the plain-error test in light of <em>Booker, </em>Martinez must demonstrate that his substantial rights were affected by the error. <em>United States v. Infante, </em>404 F.3d 376, 395 (5th Cir.2005). Contrary to Martinez\u2019s argument, there is nothing in the record indicating that the district court would have imposed a different sentence under an advisory Sentencing Guidelines scheme. <em>United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 n. 4 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 264, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005) (No. 05-5535). Martinez argues that the application of the <em>Mares/Bringier </em>plain error standard is contrary to the plain error standard enunciated in <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). Martinez\u2019s challenge to the showing required under <em>Mares </em>and <em>Bringier </em>is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Eastland, </em>989 F.2d 760, 768 n. 16 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, there is no basis for concluding that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence under an advisory sentencing regime. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
