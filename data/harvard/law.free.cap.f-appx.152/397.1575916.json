San Martin, </em>117 Fed. Appx. 985 (5th Cir. Dec.17, 2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-20\">San Martin contends that the district court illegally sentenced him pursuant to a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime, in violation of <em>Booker. </em>He concedes that such argument was raised for the first time on direct appeal and therefore is reviewable for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005). This court finds plain error when: (1) there was an error; (2) the error was clear and obvious; and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 520. Here, the first two prongs of the plain-error test are readily satisfied because it is clear after <em>Booker </em>that application of the Sentencing Guidelines in their mandatory form constitutes error that is plain. <em>Id. </em>at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-24\">To satisfy the third prong of the plain-error test, San Martin must show that his \u201csubstantial rights\u201d were affected. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005). \u201c[T]he pertinent question is whether [the appellant] demonstrated that the sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521. This question requires us to assess whether \u201cthere is [an] indication in the record from the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks or otherwise that gives us any clue as to whether [ ]he would have reached a different conclusion\u201d if sentencing under an advisory scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 522. San Martin has conceded that he cannot make such a showing under the <em>Mares </em>standard. To the extent that San Martin argues that the <em>Booker </em>error is a \u201cstructural\u201d one that is not susceptible to a plain-error analysis, or that he alternatively contends that plain-error prejudice should be presumed, this court recently rejected such arguments. <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Because nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance of this case, we reinstate our judgment affirming San Martin\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
