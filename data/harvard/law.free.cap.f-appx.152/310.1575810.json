His sole argument on appeal is that a remand is warranted because he was sentenced under a mandatory application of the federal sentencing guidelines, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We affirm Smith\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-23\">Because Smith did not object below to the mandatory application of the guidelines, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215 (4th Cir.2005). To demonstrate plain error, a defendant must establish that error occurred, that it was plain, and that it affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). If a defendant establishes these requirements, the court has discretion to correct the error, but \u201cshould not exercise ... [that discretion] unless the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-24\">In <em>White, </em>this court determined that imposing a sentence under the guidelines as mandatory was error that was plain. <em>White, </em>405 F.3d at 217. In determining whether this error affected the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>substantial rights, the court reasoned that \u201cthe error of sentencing a defendant under a mandatory guidelines regime\u201d was not an error for which prejudice would be presumed. <em>Id. </em>at 221. Rather, the defendant bears the burden of showing that this error \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228 (quoting <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 784, 113 S.Ct. 1770). We find that Smith fails to meet this burden because he presents no non-speeulative evidence or argument demonstrating that he would have received a lower sentence had the district court appreciated that the guidelines were not mandatory. We therefore conclude that the district court\u2019s error of sentencing Smith under a mandatory guidelines scheme did not affect his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Smith\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
