The Government seeks to enforce the waiver-of-appeal provision of Navarrete\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>In his plea agreement, Navarrete waived, inter alia, \u201cthe right to appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was determined,\u201d except for a sentence above the statutory maximum or an upward departure from the applicable Guidelines range. Navarrete contends that this waiver provision is not enforceable because, at his rearraignment, the magistrate judge incorrectly told him that he retained the right to appeal \u201ca sentence that is imposed illegally.\u201d We agree. Because the magistrate judge inaccurately described the waiver provision, Navarrete\u2019s waiver cannot be deemed knowing and voluntary with respect to \u201ca sentence that is imposed illegally.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.CrimP. ll(b)(l)(N); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Navarrete argues that the district court erred in sentencing him under pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 757, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He concedes that he did not raise this issue in the district court, and that review is therefore for plain error. Navarrete contends, however, that he need not show prejudice because the error is structural and because prejudice should be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">This court has rejected the contention that the imposition of sentence under a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines is structural or is presumptively prejudicial. <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 194, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005). Because Navarrete did not raise the issue in the district court, he must demonstrate plain error, which requires him to establish that (1) there is an error; (2) that is clear or obvious; and (3) that affects his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If these criteria are met, this court has the authority correct the error, but is not required to do so. <em>See id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">Here, \u201cthere is no indication in the record from the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks or otherwise that gives us any clue as to whether she would have reached a different conclusion\u201d as to Navarrete\u2019s sentence if sentencing under an advisory guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 522 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005). Accordingly, Navarrete cannot establish plain error. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
