L. 212, section 7, expressly provides that such bail shall be given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-8\">This question is not open for argument. This court, in an opinion delivered July 16, 1896, has squarely decided the question. In the opinion, by Wickham, J., it was said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-9\">\u201c The Superior Court act, however, evidently contemplates that in order to render the appeal effectual for any purpose the costs at least must be secured.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-10\">\u201cWe are clearly of the opinion that no appellant is entitled to be heard here on an appeal from the orphans\u2019 court or common pleas unless he has given bail for costs as required by the statute: \u201d Marks v. Baker, 2 Pa. Superior Ct. 167.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-11\">The act of March 15, 1847, section 1 (P. L. 361), provides that \u201c when any corporation (municipal corporations excepted), being sued, shall appeal or take a writ of error, the bail requisite in that case shall be taken absolute for the payment of debt, interest, and costs, on the affirmance of the judgment.\u201d Although doubts have been suggested in the lower courts as to whether this act applies to appeals from the awards of arbitrators (Erhard v. Coal Co., 5 Dist. Reps. 611), none has been made that it applies to all other appeals by corporations. Its provisions have not been attempted to be complied with in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-12\">The Supreme Court has said as to the conditions precedent to the allowance of an appeal that \u201c they cannot disregard the regulations of the law, .... the court cannot dispense with any of the prescribed terms: \u201d Donaldson v. Cunningham, 13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>S. &amp; R. 243. They have held that an appeal from the award of arbitrators must be stricken off if the affidavit does not exactly comply with provisions of the act of assembly: Dale v. Elder, 22 W. N. 59.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AjY\">November 9, 1896:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-3\">The provisions of the act of June 24, 1885, allowing an appeal without the payment of costs where an affidavit of inability through poverty is filed, does not relieve the appellant from the necessity of giving bail on the appeal: Davison v. Good Will Co., 4 Dist. Reps. 237.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b549-4\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u201c An appeal to the Superior Court must be taken and perfected within three calendar months from the date when the judgment, sentence, order or decree appealed from was entered in the court below, otherwise the appeal shall be quashed on motion ; \u201d Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 218, sec. 8. An appeal is perfected when the prescribed affidavit has been filed and bail has been given for costs, but to operate as a supersedeas a bond must be filed conditioned to pay, not only the costs, but also whatever judgment or decree may be entered against the appellant, either in the Superior Court or the Supreme Court. This court or one of the judges thereof may, by special order, make an appeal a supersedeas without the giving of bail for the debt, but cannot relieve from the statutory duty to give bail for costs. To render the appeal effectual for any purpose the costs at least must be secured: Marks v. Baker, 2 Pa. Superior Ct. 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">This is not the case of a defective recognizance but of a total failure to comply with a statutory condition precedent. No attempt to give bail was made within three months after the judgment was entered, and the motion to quash was made at the first opportunity. This being the case, excepting in the court below to the sufficiency of the bail entered after the expiration of the three months was not, of itself, a waiver of the objection that the appeal was not perfected within the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Appeal quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
