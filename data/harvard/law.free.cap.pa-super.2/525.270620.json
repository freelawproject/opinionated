Hancock, under contract of March 30, 1895. The affidavit of defense set up that Hancock had already paid out more than the amount of the contract price together with the liabilities he had contracted on account thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-6\">The contract between Hancock and Close contained the following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-7\">\u201c And it is further agreed that the party of the first part will not at any time suffer or permit any lien, attachment or other incumbrance under any law of this state or otherwise, by any person or persons whatever, to be found or remain on the building or premises into or upon which any work is done or material furnished under this contract for such work or material, or by reason of any other claim or demand of the party of the first part, and that any such lien or attachment or other incumbrance, until it is removed, shall preclude any or all claim or demand for any payment whatever under or by virtue of this contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-8\">The affidavit also contains the following averment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-9\">That it was agreed between this affiant and Close that neither he nor any subcontractors were to be permitted to file any liens against the premises in question. That such a clause was drafted by counsel for this affiant, and given to this affiant\u2019s clerk to copy, who erroneously wrote in the word \u201c found,\u201d for \u201cput,\u201d which was intended to be inserted in the contract by both the parties thereto. That the insertion of the word \u201c found \u201d was a mutual mistake, and does not express the intention of the parties, which was that no lien should be filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-10\"><em>Error assigned </em>was entering judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b554-11\"><em>Henry J. </em>Hancock, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7n\">\u2014 The contract set up is almost in the words of Benedict v. Hood, 134 Pa. 289, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>that the word. \u201c put \u201d was intended to be used in the place of \u201c found.\u201d As to the mutual mistake averred in the affidavit of inserting the word \u201cfound\u201d for \u201cput,\u201d see Real Est. Title Co.\u2019s App., 125 Pa. 549. The affidavit also set up a verbal contract that no liens should be filed, as was the case in McElroy v. Braden, 152 Pa. 78. See also Nice v. Walker, 153 Pa. 123. The cause relied on prevented the filing of liens. Wilkinson v. Price, 148 Pa. 153; Fidelity Life Ass\u2019n v. Jackson, 163 Pa. 208; Evans v. Grogan, 153 Pa. 121; Murphy v.

Simpson, Jr., </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axk\">\u2014 It is difficult to see how the court can decide this case without either the affidavit or supplemental affidavit of defense appearing in appellant\u2019s paper-book. It is more difficult to understand how they are going to decide it favorably to appellants, on the allegation that the written contract between the owner and principal contractor does not contain clauses appearing in cases cited by appellants, when neither of the affidavits, even if printed, would show whether or not such clauses do appear, only one clause of the contract being in fact embodied in either affidavit. \u2014 itself a fatal defect under Erie City v. Butler, 120 Pa. 374.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-4\">Whatever may be said of the earlier decisions on this question \u2014 and it would be a waste of time to follow counsel in the citation of them \u2014 the law on the subject is now settled against appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-5\">A sufficient proof of this will appear by taking the language construed in Creswell Iron Works v. O\u2019Brien, 156 Pa. 172, and Lucas v. O\u2019Brien, 159 Pa. 535.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-6\">Appellee\u2019s duty when he was requested to furnish material for this building, was simply to inquire what the effect was between the owner and the principal contractor; and he is affected only with notice of what the inquiry would have elicited: McElroy v. Braden, 152 Pa. 78.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A5m\">Rice, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">If the clause in the contract on which the defendant relies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>were amended by substituting tbe word \u201c put \u201d for tbe word \u201c found,\u201d so as to make it conform to the original draft prepared by bis counsel, it would be in the precise language tbe parties intentionally adopted to express their agreement, and would be tbe same, with tbe exception of one or two immaterial verbal differences, as tbe provision construed in Cresswell Iron Works v. O\u2019Brien, 156 Pa. 172, and Lucas v. O\u2019Brien, 159 Pa. 535. \u201c The contract,\u201d said Justice Mitchell in tbe first mentioned case, \u201cmust be interpreted according to tbe intention of tbe parties, and tbe fair construction of this is that tbe intention was to protect the owner, not by the absolute prohibition of liens, but by providing for their payment by tbe contractor, and in default of bis doing so tbe stoppage of bis own pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">There was an additional clause in tbe contract construed in that case, which, it is argued, distinguishes it from tbe present. Whether or not it is in the contract referred to, but not set forth at length, in this affidavit of defense, as it ought to have been, is left wholly to inference. But assuming that it is not, tbe result must be tbe same. This additional clause did not make tbe intention of tbe parties as to tbe filing of hens clearer than it would have been without it. Tbe construction of tbe two contracts must be tbe same. There is nothing to distinguish them: Lucas v. O\u2019Brien, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Tbe construction, known only to themselves, which tbe owner and tbe contractor placed on tbe language deliberately chosen to express their intention, cannot be set up to defeat tbe hen of a material-man. Granted that they need not have put tbe stipulation concerning hens, in writing, yet having done so, be was only affected with notice of what tbe writing contained. He bad a right to presume that it fully expressed their intention. He could not be debarred of his hen except by an express covenant or by one so clearly implied that be could not fail to understand it. Hence it is no defense to allege that in tbe preliminary negotiations the parties agreed that a clause prohibiting hens should be inserted in tbe contract, if tbe clause actually inserted did not have that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
