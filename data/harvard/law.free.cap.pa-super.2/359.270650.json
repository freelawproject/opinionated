The plaintiff testified that he had lived upon the land for ten or eleven years. He explained to the jury the quality of the land, the structures upon it and the character of the work of the defendant in laying its pipe line. He also testified as to the condition of the ground as it was left after the completion of the work. He was finally asked this question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-10\">Q. What was the value of your farm there before this gas line went through it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-11\">Mr. Buffington: That is objected to, the witness not having shown himself competent to answer the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-12\">The Court: He has testified he is the owner of the property. We will overrule the objection and give you an exception and sealed bill. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-13\">The witness testified that the construction of the line made a difference of $1,000 in the value of his farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-14\">Plaintiff further testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-15\">Q. Mr. Galbraith, how is the land through which this pipe line runs suited for building purposes \u2014 that is, for laying out in lots?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-16\">Mr. Buffington: The question is objected to as irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>The Court: Yes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-5\">Mr. Patton: You can state if this farm is ripe for building purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-6\">Mr. Buffington: The question is objected to as incompetent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-7\">The Court: We will overrule the exception and give you an exception and sealed bill. \u2022 [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-8\">Joseph Atkinson, a witness for plaintiff, testified that he lived for fifty-one years within half a mile of the plaintiff\u2019s land. He testified as to ridges and depressions on the land after the construction of the pipe line. He also knew of sales of land made in the neighborhood. He was finally asked this question :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-9\">Q. Have you taken into consideration the actual damage done to the surface in the construction of this line, including the injury to the fences and trees and the depreciation of the value of the farm as a whole by the entry and appropriation of Mr. Galbraith\u2019s land by this gas company, \u2014 what would you say the damage would be ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-10\">Mr. Buffington: That question is objected to as incompetent. The witness not having shown sufficient knowledge to answer the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-11\">The Court: We will overrule the objection and give you an exception and sealed bill. [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-12\">A. Why, if the property was my own I would not take $1,500 and have that there and have it in the shape it is in and keep it there, that is the condition the line is in, the condition of the buildings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-13\">David Wallace, a witness for the plaintiff, testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-14\">Q. Now you can state, Mr. Wallace, what the condition of it is as to ridges and depressions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-15\">Mr. Buffington: That is objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-16\">The Court: We think that is a little far distant from the time the trench had been dug and filled up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-17\">Mr. Patton: We offer to follow it by testimony of Mr. Galbraith that he has not interfered with the route of the line since, that it has not been interfered with by any person since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-18\">Mr. Buffington: That is objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-19\">The Court: We will overrule the objection and give you an exception and sealed bill.

Well, a proportion of the land is in ridges, and then there are places where it is kind of sunk low, you know.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">Robert Miller, a witness for tire plaintiff, was permitted under objection and exception to testify as to the value of the land. The substance of Miller\u2019s testimony is stated in the opinion of the Superior Court. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">Under objection and exception the testimony of L. W. Patterson was admitted as to the value of the land. [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\">When Thomas Patterson, a witness for plaintiff, was on the stand, he testified that he lived about a mile and a half from the land, and knew it nearly all his life. He stated that he knew the general value of the land as well as any other property. He was finally asked this question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-8\">Q. Now, I wish you would state what was the actual damage done to the surface of this land of Mr. Galbraith\u2019s in the constructing of the line, including the injury to fences and the depreciation of the value of the farm as a whole by the entry and appropriation of tins strip of land through this farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-9\">Mr. Buffington: The same objection to the same question to the last witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-10\">The Court: The same ruling. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-11\">Mr. Patton: What would you fix the damages ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-12\">A. Well, if I was going to buy the land I could fix the damage ; I would make at least 11,500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-13\">When Thomas Montgomery, a witness for plaintiff, was on the stand he was asked this question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-14\">Q. Mr. Montgomery, you have been a farmer in this county? A. I have been from my childhood. Q. You have owned a good deal of land in Armstrong county ? A. I have had several pieces. Q. Did you at any time make a visit to this land in dispute ? Did you at any time go over this land where this pipe line goes through? A. Yes, sir, I went there by order of court as a viewer. Q. Did you make an examination of the land down there? A. We looked over the land when the line went through, not over the whole farm. Q. But you looked through it when the line went through? A. Yes, sir, went over the ground. Q. Are you acquainted with the value of land in Armstrong county? A. Well, that is most too much; I have been about as much as many people; it is pretty hard for a man to be acquainted with the value of all the land in the county. Q. You <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>have a general idea of the market value of land ? A. I think as good as the general farmer. Q. Now, will you state what in your opinion was the injury done to Mr. Galbraith\u2019s land by the depreciation of its value, of the farm as a whole, by this pipe line running through it? A. We made a written report of that-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-5\">Mr. Buffington: We object to the question as incompetent and irrelevant; the witness has not shown sufficient knowledge to justify his answering the question proposed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-6\">The Court: We will overrule the objection and give you an exception and sealed bill. [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-7\">Mr. Buffington: Aside from the question he should be directed by the court to give his answer unbiased by any influence that rests in his mind from the view.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-8\">The Court: We will instruct the witness as you request. Mr. Montgomery, you have been asked the question in reference to the damage sustained by Mr. Galbraith\u2019s property on account of the pipe line passing through it. Now, we have been requested by counsel for the defense here to instruct you that in giving your answer you are not to be influenced in any way by the influence brought upon you or by any of the viewers or that occurred in your deliberations in the view.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-9\">Mr. Patton: Now, just state what Mr. Galbraith\u2019s, damage was there, in your opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-10\">A. Why, my opinion is that I made it $500, that is my best recollection and I won\u2019t be sure without having the paper whether I made that for running from the bend from the tow path through the farm, or whether that was through the farm and the part on the tow path separate. I could not answer that; I had thought they left a very dirty, mean job, and they ought to pay for it; if they had cleaned up the work and left it decent I believe I would not have made it so heavy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-11\">Phillip A. Lloyd, a witness for defendant, was asked these questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-12\">Q. Plow long have you been in the gas business? A. Ever since the Philadelphia Company started, eleven years ago. Q. What has been your business with regard to pipe lines ? A. The first year or two I laid the biggest lines to Murraysville; since then right of way and claim agent. Q. Have you been actively in the field during the eleven years ? A. Contin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>uously. Q. Going almost all the time? A. In all counties contiguous to Allegheny. Q. You have attended the settlement of claims for the company ? A. Yes, sir. Q. Have come in contact with farmers and farms all along the line, building lots and everything ? A. Between eight and nine hundred of them. Q. Are you familiar with the character of gas as to its lasting qualities in. the field, what is the duration of gas fields ? A. Some fields hold out longer than others. Q. Are you familiar with them? A. Yes, sir, I am familiar with them. Q. Just state what the character of the fields are.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-4\">Mr. Patton: What is the object of that?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-5\">Mr. Buffington: We want to show the probable lasting qualities of the Armstrong county field for which this pipe line was constructed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-6\">Mr. Patton: It is objected to as incompetent and irrelevant and too indefinite.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-7\">The Court: If you can put a specific time on it which you use it we will let you show that.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-8\">Mr. Buffington: As an estimate for the jury, as a basis. We propose to prove by Mr. Lloyd as an expert, the probable time which this easement will be used by the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-9\">Mr. Patton: It is objected to as incompetent and irrelevant and too indefinite.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-10\">The Court: We will sustain the objection and give an exception and sealed bill. [11]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-11\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-12\">[Joseph Atkinson, another witness on behalf of the plaintiff, testifies that he has lived in the neighborhood there for fifty years, that he knows this land, that he knows the value of lands in the neighborhood, and he states that the damage to this property by reason of the pipe line going through it was $1,500.] [12]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-13\">[Robert Miller is called on the part of the plaintiff; he testifies to seeing the pipe line laid, as to the ridges, some places there was some ground piled up upon it \u2014 he gives you a description of that as far as he saw it; but he also testifies as to the value of the land and the damages; he states that he is acquainted with the value of land in the neighborhood, and that he estimated the damage which this plaintiff has sustained by reason of the company going through his land at the sum of $1,000.] [13]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>[Thomas Montgomery, who had been one of the viewers in this case, comes upon the witness stand and describes what he saw there when he went over the land, where this pipe line was laid, and that he places the damage at 1500.] [14]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-5\">[James B.

The appellant is a natural gas company engaged in the transportation and sale of natural gas. In 1894 the appellant constructed a twenty inch pipe line through the property of the appellee a distance of one thousand and sixty feet. Viewers were appointed to assess damages and on an appeal from their award the case was tried in the court of common pleas of Armstrong county, and under instructions from the court the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the appellee for $887.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The first eleven assignments of error are to the action of the court, in admitting and rejecting the testimony of witnesses on the question of damages. The correct rule, as often stated in estimating the damages to land taken under the right of eminent domain, is the difference in value of the entire property or tract, as a whole, unaffected as it was before the taking and as it is affected after the taking. The first ten assignments raise the question of the competency of the witnesses whose testimony was admitted under objections upon the question of dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ages. Before discussing the assignments, I propose to embody in this opinion the rules established by our Supreme Court in various decisions upon the question from Kellogg v. Krauser, 14 S. &amp; R. 142, to Pennock v. Orescent Pipe Line Co., 170 Pa. 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u201c Upon a scire facias sur mortgage, the witness acquainted with the premises was asked his opinion of the value of the mortgaged premises. The principal reason assigned by the plaintiff against this evidence was that an opinion of the value of land is not evidence, because it is not a fact. It is certain that such opinions are every day received as evidence, although it is true that an opinion is not strictly a fact; and it is difficult to conceive how the value of land can be proved without them. The witness may indeed prove the prices at which other lands in the neighborhood were sold; but that would not ascertain the value of the land in question, without a comparison between it and the land which was sold, as to quality; and quality is very much a matter of opinion. It is a kind of evidence so commonly admitted without dispute or objection that I have no doubt of its legality.\u201d Tilgham, C. J., in Kellogg v. Krauser, 14 S. &amp; R. 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u201c The measure of damages is to be determined by a comparison of values immediately before and immediately after the taking. To enable a jury to determine this \u2018 they are entitled to the benefit of the opinions of witnesses of skill and judgment, who have had opportunities to learn the value of the property in question.\u2019\u201d Woodward, J., in Brown v. Corey, 43 Pa. 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u201c The market value of land is not a question of science and skill, upon which only an expert can give an opinion. Persons living in the neighborhood may be presumed to have a sufficient knowledge of the market value of the property with the location and character of the land in question. Whether their opinion has any proper ground to rest upon, or is mere conjecture, can be brought out upon cross-examination.\u201d Sharswood, J., in Penna. &amp; N. Y. R. R. Co. v. Bunnell, 81 Pa. 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u201c Though the knowledge of a witness of the value of lands in the neighborhood may have rested solely upon a few purchases made by the railroad company, and from no other sales or purchases in the real estate market, he has some knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>upon which, to base an opinion, and the value of that opinion is for the jury.\u201d Gordon, J., in Pittsburg <em>&amp; </em>Lake Erie R. R. Co. v. Robinson, 95 Pa. 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u201c The estimate which a witness may make, it is true, is in some sense an opinion, but it is an opinion formed from actual personal knowledge of the facts affecting the subject-matter of the inquiry, and as a conclusion of fact, is admissible in evidence, from necessity, as the best evidence of which such a-question is ordinarily susceptible. In order therefore that a witness maybe competent to testify intelligently as to the market value of land, he should have some special opportunity for observation, he should in a general way and to a reasonable extent, have in his mind the data from which a proper estimate of value ought to be made ; if interrogated he should be able to disclose sufficient actual knowledge of the subject to indicate that he is in a condition to know what he proposes to state, and to enable the jury to judge of the probable proximate accuracy of his conclusions. He may hesitate in making an estimate of the value, he may say he does not know certainly, but, after due deliberation, may be able to express an opinion, or come to a conclusion, the accuracy of which, under all the evidence, is, of course, wholly for the jury.\u201d Clark, J., in Pittsburg, Virginia &amp; Charleston Railway Co. v. Vance, 115 Pa. 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u201c A farmer living a few miles distant who has known a farm for forty years, seeing the greater part of it in passing and repassing upon the public road, has been upon it and at the buildings, and knows the general selling price of land in the neighborhood, is a competent witness as to the market value under the test laid down in Pittsburg, etc. Co. v. Vance, 115 Pa. 331: \u201d Curtin v. R. R. Co., 135 Pa. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u201c Expert testimony is not necessary to determine the value of the property. All persons familiar with the property, who have formed an opinion, are competent to testify as to its value.\u201d Willlams, J., in Jones v. R. R. Co., 151 Pa. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u201cIn condemnation proceedings a witness who has known the property for ten or fifteen years and knew of sales of like property in the neighborhood is competent to testify to the market value of the property condemned.\u201d McCollum, J., in McElheny v. Bridge Co., 153 Pa. 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u201c An essential test of the competency of witnesses called to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>give an opinion in respect to the market value of the land in condemnation proceedings, is that they should affirmatively appear to have actual personal knowledge of the facts affecting the subject-matter of the inquiry. Such witnesses should have a sufficient knowledge of the market value of the land, estimated upon a fair consideration of the land, the extent and condition of its improvements, its quantity and productive qualities, and the uses to which it may reasonably be applied, taken with the general selling price of lands in the neighborhood at the time.\u201d Stebbett, C. J., in Michael v. Crescent Pipe Line Co., 159 Pa. 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u201c A witness is competent to testify as to the damage caused by the construction of a pipe line across a farm, where it appears that he lived upon an adjoining farm and knew the one in question for over fifty years, knew the character and productiveness of its soil, the kind and quality of the improvements on it, the extent and sources of its water supply, and the prices at which lands in the neighborhood were held and the prices at which they had been sold prior to the construction of the pipe line and up to within six months of the trial; but one who has never seen the property, nor even been in its neighborhood and knew of but one sale in the neighborhood, is not competent for that purpose.\u201d Sterrett, J., in Mewes v. Crescent Pipe Line Co., 170 Pa. 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u201c In an action to recover damages for injury caused by the location and construction of a pipe line across a farm, a witness is competent to testify as to the damage who has knowledge of the land, and has knowledge of the prices brought by other lands in the neighborhood which had pipe lines across them.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u201c A witness who was not on the ground when the work was done is not competent to testify as to construction damages caused in the laying of a pipe line: \u201d Pennock v. Crescent Pipe Line Co., 170 Pa. 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">A. W. Galbraith was the owner of the land and had lived on it for ten or eleven years. He was clearly a competent witness as to the extent and amount of the damage, and on the authority of Wilson v. Equitable Gas Co., 152 Pa. 566, it was not error for the witness to state that the land was ripe or right for building purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Joseph Atkinson testified that he had lived within half a mile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>of the property for fifty-one years, was well acquainted, with the land, knew of the construction and knew of sales of land in the neighborhood. He was clearly competent under the ruling in Mewes v. Crescent Pipe Line Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The testimony of David Wallace as to ridges and depressions left on the property in the construction of the pipe line, in connection with the testimony of the appellee, was admissible; it tended to prove the effect of the construction upon the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Robert Miller, a witness who was permitted to give his opinion on the question of damages, testified as to Iris knowledge of the premises as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Q. Mr. Miller, where do you live ? A. I live at Freeport. Q. How long have you lived there ? A. A little over four years. Q. Do you know this property of Mr. Galbraith. A. Yes, sir. Q. How far do you live from it? A. Well, now I couldn\u2019t tell you the distance it is, not half a mile, I don\u2019t think. Q. Are you acquainted with the value of Mr. Galbraith\u2019s property there, and the property in the neighborhood ? A. Property sells at various prices, as you sell to different parties ; it is pretty hard to come to a value of it until you close the bargain with the man. Q. Are you acquainted with the value of the land in the neighborhood of Freeport, in the neighborhood of Mr. Galbraith\u2019s land? A. Well, no, there has not been much land sold there that I know of, neither do I know of any farms lately being sold close by. Q. Mr. Miller, will you state to the jury what damage was sustained by Mr. Galbraith by injury done to the surface and the construction of this line, including the injury to the fences and the depreciation of the value of the farm as a whole by the entry and appropriation by the gas company of this land ? What in your opinion was the damage done ?</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Mr. Buffington : The question is objected to as incompetent and irrelevant for the reason that the witness has not shown sufficient knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The Court: If he is acquainted with the value of it, it will be all right.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Q. By Mr. Patton : Are you acquainted with the value of Mr. Galbraith\u2019s property? A. I answered that question. Q. Are you acquainted with it? A. Well, I say some parties would value it at more than others; you cannot know until you get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>your purchaser; there has no farms been sold adjoining it that I know of. Q. Well, you know its value, do you, as well as other people would know it? A. Well, taking it as a piece as a whole I could not know what it was worth until I could know what it would sell for.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Mr. Buffington : We object.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Mr. Patton: Mr. Miller, what is the value of Mr. Galbraith\u2019s property in your opinion ?</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Mr. Buffington: That is objected to.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Mr. Patton: That is for the purpose and only for the purpose of showing that the witness knows the value of property.</p>\n<p id=\"Ami-\">Mr. Buffington: Objected to as incompetent and irrelevant, the witness not having testified to sufficient facts to show sufficient knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">The Court: We will overrule the objection and give you an exception and seal a bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">Mr. Patton: What, in your opinion, is the value of Mr. Galbraith\u2019s property now?</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">Mr. Buffington: That is objected to as irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">A. It is a hard question. Q. I am asking just your opinion of it. A. My opinion of it is that it might be sold for 1150 an acre. From $100 to $150, just as you would get your buyef. Q. Now, Mr. Miller, will you answer my other question; whal was the actual damage done to the surface of Mr. Galbraith\u2019fe land in the construction of this pipe line, including the injury to the fences and the depreciation of the farm as a whole by the entry and appropriation of this land by the gas company ?</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">Mr.. Buffington: We make the same objection as made t\u00f3 the same question to the witness preceding the last witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">The Court: We will make the same ruling and the same bill sealed. '</p>\n<p id=\"AZy9\">Q. What is the damage done to Mr. Galbraith ? A. I would suppose it was $1,000 damage and might be more.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-18\">The testimony of this witness should have been excluded. His opinion was formed on no sufficient knowledge of th\u00e9 property or its value, as his answers clearly demonstrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-19\">L. W. Patterson testified that he was well acquainted with the property, had known it all his lifetime and knew the value of land in the immediate vicinity. His testimony was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Thomas Patterson was clearly a competent witness. He testified that he knew the land and had been acquainted with it from boyhood, knew it all over, knew its general value as well as any other property. No bill appears to have been sealed to the exception taken to the admission of the testimony of this witness, but the language of the judge might have misled the appellant\u2019s counsel. In our view of the competency of the witness it is immaterial whether the answer of the judge was considered the sealing of a bill or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Thomas Montgomery, one of the witnesses, testified that he had as good an idea of land in Armstrong county as the general farmer. He examined the land as a viewer. We do not think the witness was incompetent to testify, but we do think his answer to the question as to the amount of damage was not responsive, and would have probably been stricken out had a motion to that effect been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">To the testimony of James Douglass there was no objection or exception. The ninth assignment of error will therefore not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The testimony of Dr. T. H. Allison was not objected to on the ground of the incompetency of the witness; he was allowed to engage in a rambling conversation, and express his opinion on various irrelevant subjects, all of wlfich was improper and undoubtedly would have been eliminated from the record had a motion to that effect been made to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The appellant offered to show by Phillip A. Lloyd (a person of eleven years\u2019 experience in the natural gas business), the probable lasting qualities of the Armstrong county gas fields, for which the pipe line was constructed. Just how he proposed to show this was not stated, nor is it apparent from the record. The evidence was promptly and properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In his charge to the jury the trial judge in commenting upon the testimony, told them that Joseph Atkinson had testified that he knew the value of land in the neighborhood and had stated on the witness stand that the damage to this property by reason of the pipe line going through it was $1,500. Unfortunately the testimony of Mr. Atkinson as reported did not warrant the judge in his statement. Mr. Atkinson did not so testify. In long trials the jurors are apt to forget the testimony of witnesses. They are not as apt however to forget the words of the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>delivered to them just before retiring to their room for con-' sultation, and it is to be regretted that the testimony of Mr. Atkinson was incorrectly stated to the jury. It was a serious error and will have to be corrected by another trial of this case. Equally erroneous was the statement of the judge in his charge to the jury as to the testimony of Robert Miller, Thomas Montgomery, James Douglass and Dr. T. H. Allison. These witnesses did not testify according to the reported testimony as stated by the judge in his charge. The statement tended to and doubtless did prejudice the appellant\u2019s case in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Jurors not only take the law from the court, hut when the testimony of the witnesses is commented upon, as in this case,they naturally rely to a great extent upon every word uttered by the trial judge and take his version of the testimony. It is incumbent upon the judge to exercise the greatest care and arrive at substantial accuracy in his comments on the testimony before the jury. We do not think the general charge open to the objections contained in the last specification of error. The fifth, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth assignments of error are sustained. The others are all overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The judgment is reversed and a venire fa ias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
