Eady appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-16\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s order of dismissal <em>de novo </em>and will uphold a dismissal only if it appears beyond doubt that the allegations in the complaint, when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, do not state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d <em>Dillard v. Baldwin County Comm\u2019rs, </em>225 F.3d 1271, 1275 (11th Cir.2000). Upon thorough review of the complaint, we agree with the district court that Eady has not stated a claim upon which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-17\">Eady alleges that \u00a7 36-22-16(a) is an unconstitutional taking of \u201cproperty\u201d from Jefferson County taxpayers without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Eady bases this claim on the theory that \u00a7 36-22-16(a) violates the Alabama Constitution by requiring counties to pay the salaries of county sheriffs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court correctly concluded that Eady\u2019s allegations fail to state a viable claim for relief under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-18\">Because Eady did not allege that \u00a7 36-22-16(a) violates a fundamental right or involves a suspect classification, the district court correctly analyzed Eady\u2019s due process claim under rational basis scruti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>ny.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court found that \u00a7 36-22-16(a) survives rational basis scrutiny because it bears a rational relation to a legitimate government interest. Specifically, the district court concluded that a statute requiring counties to pay sheriffs\u2019 salaries is rational because sheriffs are elected in county-wide elections and because counties are the direct beneficiaries of the services rendered by sheriffs. Because \u00a7 36-22-16(a) passes muster under the rational basis test, the district court correctly concluded that Eady\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted under the Fourteenth Amendment. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Eady\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1251-14\">. We also agree with the district court that, to the extent Eady seeks retrospective monetary relief, her claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 663, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1251-19\">. The Alabama Constitution provides that county sheriffs are state officers. <em>See </em>Ala. Const, art. V, \u00a7 112 (1901). Eady\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment argument appears to presume that this provision entitles Alabama residents in each county to the services of a sheriff who is compensated by the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1252-13\">. Before it addressed Eady\u2019s due process claim, the district court properly found that Eady had no claim based on the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because she did not allege that \u00a7 36-22-16(a) had a disparate impact on her or the putative class members vis-\u00e1-vis other Alabama residents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
