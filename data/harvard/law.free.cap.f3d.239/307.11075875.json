Roman, </em>116 F.3d 83 (3d Cir.1997), interpreting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Under this statute, popularly known as the \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule, a prisoner may not file a new action or appeal in forma pauperis (\u201cI.F.P.\u201d) if, on three or more prior occasions while incarcerated or detained, the prisoner has brought a federal action or appeal that was dismissed on the grounds that it was frivolous, malicious or fails to state a claim, unless the prisoner \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ry.\u201d We held in <em>Gibbs </em>that \u201cimminent danger\u201d is measured at the time of the alleged incident, not at the time the complaint is filed. 116 F.3d at 86. Three of our sister courts of appeals have since rejected our teachings in <em>Gibbs, </em>holding instead that the court should assess \u201cimminent danger\u201d as of the time the prisoner\u2019s complaint is filed and that a prisoner\u2019s allegation that he faced danger in the past is insufficient to allow him to proceed I.F.P. <em>Medberry v. Butler, </em>185 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir.1999); <em>Ashley v. Dilworth, </em>147 F.3d 715, 717 (8th Cir.1998); <em>Banos v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 884-885 (5th Cir.1998). We now abandon the interpretation set forth in <em>Gibbs </em>and adopt that of our sister courts of appeals. We hold also that \u00a7 1915(g), as so interpreted, is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Appellant Debro Siddiq Abdul-Akbar was most recently incarcerated by the Delaware Department of Corrections from June 10, 1994 through May 15, 1999 on state charges including robbery, conspiracy, assault and shoplifting. During the time material to Appellant\u2019s underlying proposed Complaint based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, he was incarcerated at the Sussex Correctional Institute in Georgetown, Delaware. On May 17,1999, Appellant reported to a community confinement center, and on May 27, 1999, he was released from the custody of the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Appellant has filed at least 180 civil rights or habeas corpus claims. <em>Abdul-Akbar v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>910 F.Supp. 986, 998 (D.Del.1995). In <em>Abdul-Akbar v. Watson, </em>901 F.2d 329 (3d Cir.1990), this court reviewed a district court order barring Appellant from filing any further \u00a7 1983 claims I.F.P. and held that a district court may enter an injunction precluding a prisoner from filing any \u00a7 1983 claims without leave of court and without making certain good faith certifications. 901 F.2d at 333. We stated that Abdul-Akbar\u2019s \u201chistory of repetitious and frivolous filings indicates a clear intent to abuse the courts and the I.F.P. process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334. An injunction subsequently was entered by the district court. <em>Abdul-Akbar v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>910 F.Supp. at 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">On February 10, 1998, Appellant filed a motion for leave to file a \u00a7 1983 Complaint, a proposed Complaint and a motion to proceed I.F.P. The proposed Complaint alleged that on or about January 9, 1998, prison officials arbitrarily sprayed Appellant with pepper gas and refused to provide him with medical treatment even though they knew that he suffers from asthma. Appellant also claimed that certain prison officials violated his civil rights by belonging to a racist organization, that one defendant failed to investigate properly the pepper spray incident, and that the district court judge violated his Sixth Amendment right of access to the courts by preventing his complaints from being heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">The district court denied the motion to proceed I.F.P., reasoning that (1) Appellant had brought actions that the court had dismissed as frivolous on more than three prior occasions, and (2) he did not claim to be in imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">The district court had jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. We have jurisdiction because an order denying leave to proceed I.F.P. is a final, collateral order appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The appeal was timely filed. This court reviews de novo issues of statutory interpretation, <em>Pennsylvania Mines Corp. v. Holland, </em>197 F.3d 114, 119 n. 2 (3d Cir.1999), and the constitutionality of a statute, <em>DeSousa v. Reno, </em>190 F.3d 175, 180 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">The discretionary power to permit indigent plaintiffs to proceed without first paying a filing fee was initially codified in the federal statutes in 1892. <em>See </em>Act of July 20, 1892, ch. 209 1-5, 27 Stat. 252. Congress enacted the I.F.P. statute, currently codi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>fied at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, \u201cto ensure that administrative court costs and filing fees, both of which must be paid by everyone else who files a lawsuit, would not prevent indigent persons from pursuing meaningful litigation.\u201d <em>Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1084 (3d Cir.1995) (citing <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 31, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992)). Congress was also aware of the potential for abuse, and it included a subsection allowing for dismissal of frivolous or malicious actions. <em>Denton, </em>504 U.S. at 31, 112 S.Ct. 1728.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Congress subsequently enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321 (1996), largely in response to concerns about the heavy volume of frivolous prisoner litigation in the federal courts. <em>See </em>141 Cong. Rec. S14408-01, S14413 (daily ed. Sept. 27, 1995) (statement of Sen. Dole) (explaining that the number of prisoner suits filed \u201chas grown astronomically\u2014 from 6,600 in 1975 to more than 39,000 in 1994\u201d). In enacting the PLRA, Congress concluded that the large number of merit-less prisoner claims was caused by the fact that prisoners easily obtained I.F.P. status and hence were not subject to the same economic disincentives to filing meritless cases that face other civil litigants. <em>See </em>141 Cong. Rec. S7498-01, S7526 (daily ed, May 25, 1995) (statement of Sen. Kyi) (\u201cFiling frivolous civil rights lawsuits has become a recreational activity for long-term residents of prisons.\u201d); 141 Cong. Rec. S7498-01, S7524 (daily ed. May 25, 1995) (statement of Sen. Dole) (\u201c[Pjrison-ers will now \u2018litigate at the drop of a hat,\u2019 simply because they have little to lose and everything to gain.\u201d). To curb this trend, the PLRA instituted a number of reforms in the handling of prisoner litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Among other things, the PLRA amended the I.F.P. statute as it applies to prisoners. Under the statute as amended, a prisoner who is allowed to proceed I.F.P. is not excused from paying filing fees, but is only excused from <em>pre-paying </em>them in full if they meet certain criteria. The PLRA now requires prisoners who qualify for I.F.P. status to pay by way of an initial partial fee, followed by installment payments until the entire fee is paid. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1). Congress also added \u00a7 1915(g), the \u201cthree strikes rule,\u201d which limits a prisoner\u2019s ability to proceed I.F.P. if the prisoner abuses the judicial system by filing frivolous actions. Prisoners may avoid the limitation in this provision, however, if they are under \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">This appeal requires us to decide when the existence of \u201cimminent danger\u201d is to be assessed; specifically, whether it is assessed as of the time the complaint is filed, or at some time in the past, even though that danger no longer exists when the complaint is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Today we abandon the rule announced in <em>Gibbs </em>that \u201cimminent danger\u201d is assessed at the time of the alleged incident. We adopt, instead, the construction set forth by the Fifth, Eighth and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals, that a prisoner may invoke the \u201cimminent danger\u201d exception only to seek relief from a danger which is \u201cimminent\u201d at the time the complaint is filed. We conclude that this interpretation is consistent with the plain language of \u00a7 1915(g), with congressional intent and with the legislative purpose of the PLRA as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">This is a case of statutory construction, and we begin our analysis with the language of \u00a7 1915(g):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We now apply settled precepts of statutory construction and take as our beginning point a recognition that from the earliest times, we have adopted what is called the American Plain Meaning Rule exemplified in <em>Caminetti v. United States, </em>242 U.S. 470, 485, 37 S.Ct. 192, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917) (internal citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">It is elementary that the meaning of the statute must, in the first instance, be sought in the language in which the act is framed, and if that is plain, and if the law is within the constitutional authority of the law-making body which passed it, the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms. Where the language is plain and admits of no more than one meaning the duty of interpretation does not arise and the rules which are to aid doubtful meanings need no discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">In 1993, the Court made a modern statement of the plain meaning rule: \u201cOur task is to give effect to the will of Congress, and where its will has been expressed in reasonably plain terms, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u201d <em>Negonsott v. Samuels, </em>507 U.S. 99, 104, 113 S.Ct. 1119, 122 L.Ed.2d 457 (1993). If the language of the statute is plain, the sole function of the court is to enforce the statute according to its terms. <em>United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., </em>489 U.S. 235, 241, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989). The plain meaning is conclusive, therefore, \u201cexcept in the \u2018rare cases [in which] the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 109 S.Ct. 1026 (quoting <em>Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., </em>458 U.S. 564, 102 S.Ct. 3245, 73 L.Ed.2d 973 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">We now apply the ordinary meaning of the words chosen by Congress in drafting \u00a7 1915(g). The phrase \u201cin no event\u201d simply means \u201cmay not.\u201d This court has previously held that the word \u201cbring\u201d in this context plainly refers to the time when the civil action is initiated. <em>Gibbs v. Ryan, </em>160 F.3d 160, 162 (3d Cir.1998). Putting the phrases together, the first clause of \u00a7 1915(g) obviously means \u201ca prisoner may not file a new civil complaint.\u201d In the ordinary sense of the words, this clause refers temporally to the time the new complaint is filed. The clause \u201cunless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d is an exception to the preclusive effect of the statute. But the exception is cast in the present tense, not in the past tense, and the word \u201cis\u201d in the exception refers back to the same point in time as the first clause, i.e., the time of filing. The statute contemplates that the \u201cimminent danger\u201d will exist contemporaneously with the bringing of the action. Someone whose danger has passed cannot reasonably be described as someone who \u201cis\u201d in danger, nor can that past danger reasonably be described as \u201cimminent.\u201d The court so held in <em>Ashley v. Dilworth, </em>147 F.3d 715, 717 (8th Cir.1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">As the statute\u2019s use of the present tense verbs \u2018bring\u2019 and \u2018is\u2019 demonstrates, an otherwise ineligible prisoner is only eligible to proceed IFP if he is in imminent danger <em>at the time of filing. </em>Allegations that the prisoner has faced imminent danger in the past are insufficient to trigger this exception to \u00a7 1915(g) and authorize the prisoner to pay the filing fee on the installment plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-11\"><em>See also Medberry v. Butler, </em>185 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cCongress\u2019 use of the present tense in \u00a7 1915(g) confirms that a prisoner\u2019s allegation that he faced imminent danger sometime in the past is an insufficient basis to allow him to proceed in forma pauperis....\u201d); <em>Banos v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 885 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201c[T]he language of \u00a7 1915(g), by using the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>present tense, clearly refers to the time when the action or appeal is filed or the motion for IFP status is made.\u201d)- Taking both clauses together, the statute plainly means that a prisoner is not permitted to file his complaint unless he is, at that time, under imminent danger. Viewed from the Plain Meaning Rule, we interpret \u201cis under imminent danger\u201d to relate to the time when \u201ca prisoner bring[s] a civil action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Reinforcing the interpretation of the statute by application of the Plain Meaning Rule is an analysis of language found in other portions of the PLRA. For example, another section of the Act, \u00a7 1915(b)(4), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\"><em>In no event shall </em>a prisoner be prohibited from bringing a civil action or appealing a civil or criminal judgment for the reason that the prisoner <em>has </em>no assets and no means by which to pay the initial partial filing fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(4) (emphasis added). As in subsection (g), this provision begins with the exhortation \u201cin no event shall,\u201d and, as in subsection (g), it describes a necessary condition by using the present tense of the operative verb. Section 1915(b)(4) plainly means that the courts may not prohibit a prisoner from filing a new complaint for the reason that he does not possess any assets at the time of filing. The temporal reference point for the verb \u201chas\u201d is the time of filing, the time at which the fee is due.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Other provisions support this construction by focusing on the time of filing. Section 1997e(a) of Title 42, amended by the PLRA, requires that the plaintiff exhaust administrative remedies, but only if the plaintiff is a prisoner at the time of filing. <em>Greig v. Goord, </em>169 F.3d 165, 167 (2d Cir.1999). Similarly, the applicability of the personal injury requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e) turns on the plaintiffs status as a prisoner, not at the time of the incident, but when the lawsuit is filed. <em>Harris v. Garner, </em>216 F.3d 970, 974-975 (11th Cir.2000). Finally, the need for the district court to screen a complaint in a civil action filed by a prisoner, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, looks to the plaintiffs status when the case is filed. <em>Johnson v. Hill, </em>965 F.Supp. 1487, 1488 n. 2 (E.D.Va.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Appellant argues that requiring proof of imminent danger as of the time of filing is inconsistent with Congress\u2019 intent. Having applied the American Plain Meaning Rule and having determined that there is no ambiguity, we are not required to answer this contention of the Appellant. Nevertheless, we perceive the congressional intent as clear when we examine the purpose of the entire PLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">As noted above, Congress enacted the PLRA in order to limit the filing of frivolous and vexatious prisoner lawsuits. To accomplish this, Congress curtailed the ability of prisoners to take advantage of the privilege of filing I.F.P. The \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule added by the PLRA supplied a powerful economic incentive not to file frivolous lawsuits or appeals. In stark terms, it declared that the I.F.P, privilege will not be available to prisoners who have, on three occasions, abused the system by filing frivolous or malicious lawsuits or appeals, no matter how meritorious subsequent claims may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">It is important to note that \u00a7 1915(g) does not block a prisoner\u2019s access to the federal courts. It only denies the prisoner the privilege of filing before he has acquired the necessary filing fee. Appellant argues that a prisoner subject to the \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule, but who does not establish \u201cimminent danger,\u201d could for ever lose his ability to bring his suit as a practical matter because of the difficulties of obtaining the money, the application of the statute of limitations, or the possible loss of necessary evidence. This argument attempts to prove too much. It overlooks the fact that prisoners may seek relief in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>state court, where limitations on filing I.F.P. may not be as strict. Potentially negative consequences in <em>federal </em>courts, as distinguished from <em>state </em>courts, are precisely the consequences intended by Congress. The outcome predicted by Appellant is, for better or for worse, exactly the result the PLRA intends.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Recognizing that it could take prisoners a significant period of time to obtain the filing fee in some cases, Congress created a limited exception aimed at preventing future harms, and did so through the use of the word \u201cimminent.\u201d \u201cImminent\u201d dangers are those dangers which are about to occur at any moment or are impending. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s II New Riverside UniveRSIty DICTIONARY 611 (1984). By using the term \u201cimminent,\u201d Congress indicated that it wanted to include a safety valve for the \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule to prevent impending harms, not those harms that had already occurred. The imminent danger exception allows the district court to permit an otherwise barred prisoner to file a complaint I.F.P. if the prisoner could be subject to serious physical injury and does not then have the requisite filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In contrast, under the <em>Gibbs </em>construction, the prisoner need only show that he was subject to imminent danger at the time of the alleged incident. By definition, an imminent threat of serious physical injury always exists in the moments before any such injury is inflicted. Thus, under the <em>Gibbs </em>approach, any time that an otherwise disqualified prisoner alleges that any threat of physical injury occurred at <em>any time, </em>that prisoner automatically qualifies for the imminent danger exception. The <em>Gibbs </em>interpretation of the imminent danger exception thereby swallows the rule. Like every other court of appeals that has considered this issue, we refuse to conclude that with one hand Congress intended to enact a statutory rule that would reduce the huge volume of prisoner litigation, but, with the other hand, it engrafted an open-ended exception that would eviscerate the rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">This is not to suggest that we would criticize any statute or judicially-created legal precept that would permit any prisoner, even a frequent filer, to file such a complaint I.F.P. Such a notion is entirely compatible with the precept that for any injury, there should be a remedy. But we do not write in the abstract here, nor do we write on a clean slate. Congress has deliberately decided to legislate on this subject by proclaiming, as public policy, a determination to reduce prisoner litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>in the federal courts. As citizens, we may disagree with the congressional wisdom, but as judges, knowing the clearly stated legislative purpose, we may not disembowel the legislative act. Federal courts, unlike state common law King\u2019s Bench courts, do not have unlimited power and authority. We are limited to that which has been granted by Congress. What Congress gives it may also take away. The ability to proceed I.F.P. is not a constitutional right. Congress granted the right to proceed I.F.P. in 1892, and it has the power to limit this statutorily created right. Here it has taken away our ability as judges to grant I.F.P. status to a \u201cthree strikes\u201d prisoner, no matter how meritorious his or her subsequent claims may be, unless the prisoner \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d when he or she \u201cbring[s] a civil action.\u201d Congress has held trump here, and it has dealt a hand. As judges we must play it.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Appellant also mounts the argument that \u00a7 1915(g), as we interpret it, would offend the equal protection guarantee implied in the Fifth Amendment by improperly burdening a prisoner\u2019s \u201cfundamental right of access\u201d to the courts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, he argues that we must apply strict scrutiny in considering this contention and that, alternatively, even under rational basis scrutiny, the statute, as we interpret it, does not pass constitutional muster because it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Although the Fifth Amendment contains no Equal Protection Clause, \u201cthe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause prohibits the Federal Government from engaging in discrimination that is \u2018so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schlesinger v. Ballard, </em>419 U.S. 498, 500 n. 3, 95 S.Ct. 572, 42 L.Ed.2d 610 (1975) (quoting <em>Bolling v. Sharpe, </em>347 U.S. 497, 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954)). Accordingly, the Court has construed the Fifth Amendment to contain an equal protection guarantee. <em>See, e.g., Edmonson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number><em>Leesville Concrete Co., </em>500 U.S. 614, 616, 111 S.Ct. 2077, 114 L.Ed.2d 660 (1991). Fifth Amendment equal protection claims are examined under the same principles that apply to such claims under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, </em>515 U.S. 200, 217, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995) (citations omitted). Statutes that substantially burden a fundamental right or target a suspect class must be reviewed under \u201cstrict scrutiny;\u201d that is, to survive, they must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. <em>Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 216-217, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982). Conversely, if a statute neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, it does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause, as incorporated through the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, so long as it bears a rational relationship to some legitimate end. <em>Romer v. Evans, </em>517 U.S. 620, 631, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">This requires us first to determine whether Appellant is a member of a suspect class or whether a fundamental right is implicated. Neither prisoners nor indigents are suspect classes. <em>See, e.g., Pryor v. Brennan, </em>914 F.2d 921, 923 (7th Cir.1990) (noting that prisoners do not constitute a suspect class); <em>Harris v. McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 323, 100 S.Ct. 2671, 65 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980) (noting that poverty is not a suspect classification). Nor has Appellant argued before us that indigent prisoners, specifically, frequent filer indigent prisoners, are a suspect class. We then must inquire whether the \u201ctime of filing\u201d construction infringes upon one of Appellant\u2019s fundamental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Appellant contends that the \u201ctime of filing\u201d interpretation adopted by our sister courts of appeals and adopted by us today unconstitutionally burdens his fundamental right of access to the courts by requiring him to pay fees. But the right of access to the courts is not absolute. <em>United States v. Kras, </em>409 U.S. 434, 450, 93 S.Ct. 631, 34 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972). Courts presented with this issue have consistently held that merely requiring a prisoner to pay filing fees in a civil case does not, standing alone, violate that prisoner\u2019s right of meaningful access to the courts. <em>See, e.g., Rivera v. Allin, </em>144 F.3d 719, 724 (11th Cir.1998); <em>Roller v. Gunn, </em>107 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.1997). We agree. Section 1915(g) does not prevent a prisoner with \u201cthree strikes\u201d from filing a civil action; he or she is simply unable to enjoy the benefits of proceeding I.F.P. and must pay the fees at the time of filing instead of under the installment plan. And, given the right of Congress to limit the power of federal courts, it cannot be said that limiting the temporal aspect of the exception to the \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule infringes upon Appellant\u2019s right of access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The Court has recognized only a \u201cnarrow category of civil cases in which the State must provide access to its judicial processes without regard to a party\u2019s ability to pay court fees.\u201d <em>M.L.B. v. S.L.J., </em>519 U.S. 102, 113, 117 S.Ct. 555, 136 L.Ed.2d 473 (1996). An unconditional right of access exists for civil cases only when denial of a judicial forum would implicate a fundamental human interest \u2014 such as the termination of parental rights or the ability to obtain a divorce. <em>Id. </em>at 116-117, 117 S.Ct. 555; <em>Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 382-383, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971). Examples of interests that the Court has held do not rise to this level are bankruptcy filings, <em>Kras, </em>409 U.S. at 444-445, 93 S.Ct. 631, and welfare benefit determinations, <em>Ortwein v. Schwab, </em>410 U.S. 656, 659, 93 S.Ct. 1172, 35 L.Ed.2d 572 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">In the seminal case of <em>Boddie, </em>the Court emphasized that the deprivation of due process emanated from \u201cthe State\u2019s refusal to admit these appellants to its courts, <em>the sole means in Connecticut for obtaining a divorce, </em>[and that this] must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>be regarded as the equivalent of denying them an opportunity to be heard upon their claimed right to a dissolution of their marriages.\u201d 401 U.S. at 380-381, 91 S.Ct. 780 (emphasis added). Unlike the parties in <em>Boddie, </em>Appellant is not precluded from filing his \u00a7 1983 Complaint in another court system that does not have a \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision. State courts have concurrent jurisdiction over \u00a7 1983 cases. <em>Howlett v. Rose, </em>496 U.S. 356, 358, 110 S.Ct. 2430, 110 L.Ed.2d 332 (1990). Appellant can seek I.F.P. status under Delaware law because it does not have a parallel \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule. See generally 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8802 (I.F.P. statute). A state court provides a fully adequate forum for the vindication of civil rights claims. <em>See generally Tafflin v. Levitt, </em>493 U.S. 455, 458, 110 S.Ct. 792, 107 L.Ed.2d 887 (1990) (\u201c[Sjtate courts have inherent authority, and are thus presumptively competent, to adjudicate claims arising under the laws of the United States.\u201d). Because neither Delaware substantive law nor Delaware court rules prevented him, as an indigent prison litigant, from pursuing his claims, we do not agree that strict scrutiny is the appropriate test. We therefore examine \u00a7 1915(g) using rational basis review as have our sister courts of appeals. <em>See, e.g., Rodriguez v. Cook, </em>169 F.3d 1176, 1180 (9th Cir.1999); <em>White v. Colorado, </em>157 F.3d 1226,1234 (10th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>526 U.S. 1008, 119 S.Ct. 1150, 143 L.Ed.2d 216 (1999); <em>Wilson v. Yaklich, </em>148 F.3d 596, 604 (6th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1139, 119 S.Ct. 1028, 143 L.Ed.2d 38 (1999); <em>Rivera, </em>144 F.3d at 727; <em>Carson v. Johnson, </em>112 F.3d 818, 822 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">We are satisfied that our interpretation of \u00a7 1915(g) passes the rational basis test. Appellant focuses on the right of access to the courts, arguing that \u00a7 1915(g)\u2019s purpose and effect is to prevent him and other frequent filer prisoner indigents from filing civil lawsuits. In addressing this contention, we must first examine the legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">As discussed above, the legislation was aimed at the skyrocketing numbers of claims filed by prisoners \u2014 many of which are emotionally driven but legally deficient \u2014 and the corresponding burden those filings have placed on the federal courts. Congress sought to put in place economic incentives that would prompt prisoners to \u201cstop and think\u201d before filing a complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule thus serves as a rational deterrent mechanism, forcing potential prisoner litigants to examine whether their filings have any merit before they are filed, and disqualifying frequent filers who have failed in the past to carefully evaluate their claims prior to filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">Deterring frivolous prisoner filings in the federal courts falls within the realm of Congress\u2019 legitimate interests, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>and the interpretation we adopt today is rationally related to the achievement of that interest. \u201c[T]he right of access to federal courts is not a free floating right, but rather is subject to Congress\u2019 Article III power to set limits on federal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Roller, </em>107 F.3d at 231. Although it had the power to do so, Congress did not repeal any particular cause-of-action available to prisoners. Rather, Congress changed only the rules regarding I.F.P. status. Under \u00a7 1915(g), prisoners are still able to file civil actions; they are merely prohibited from enjoying I.F.P. status. <em>Lyon v. Krol, </em>127 F.3d 763, 765 (8th Cir.1997); <em>Carson, </em>112 F.3d at 821. Preventing frequent fliers from obtaining fee waivers is rationally related to the legitimate government interest of deterring frivolous lawsuits because \u201cCongress is no more compelled to guarantee free access to federal courts than it is to provide unlimited access to them.\u201d <em>Roller, </em>107 F.3d at 231. Although the dissent claims that the \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule embodied in S 1915(g) is too blunt an instrument and is insufficiently targeted to arrest frivolous filings, we have always recognized that constitutional constraints \u201crequire[ ] neither a perfect nor even best available fit\u201d between a statute\u2019s goal and the means employed in that statute to further that goal. <em>Mariani v. United States, </em>212 F.3d 761, 774 (3d Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Congress included an exception to the \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule for those cases in which it appears that judicial action is needed as soon as possible to prevent serious physical injuries from occurring in the meantime. Thus, \u00a7 1915(g) rationally balances the economic deterrence rationale behind the \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule with the need for those prisoners who remain in danger of future grievous harm to be able to file immediately. Accordingly, we hold that our interpretation of \u00a7 1915(g) does not violate equal protection concepts embodied in the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">We have considered all contentions presented by the parties and conclude that no further discussion is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-6\">. The dissent devotes much effort to asserting that, even under our time of filing construction, Appellant's \u00a7 1983 Complaint satisfied the terms of the imminent danger exception because the Complaint, under the dissent\u2019s liberal construction, alleged an ongoing risk of serious physical injury. Importantly, at no point in the present litigation did Appellant seek to rely on an ongoing danger theory, even through the able counsel appointed by this court for purposes of this appeal. Inasmuch as the dissent uses our silence with respect to an issue not raised by the parties to argue that our construction of the imminent danger exception eliminates a prisoner\u2019s ability to satisfy the imminent danger exception by alleging an ongoing risk of serious physical injury, we respond only by stressing that we by no means intend such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">At all events, we doubt whether the allegations in Appellant\u2019s \u00a7 1983 Complaint suffice to establish such an ongoing danger. Even under a liberal reading of Appellant's pleading, it is evident that Appellant\u2019s allegations center on an incident that occurred on or about January 9, 1998, when a prison official allegedly sprayed Appellant with pepper gas. App. 9-10. Appellant does not identify any further incidents occurring after that date. Moreover, although Appellant alleges that he experienced several other acts of physical harassment by different prison officials, these events not only all pre-date the January 9th incident, but also appear entirely unconnected to it, and thus undermine the dissent's claim that the danger to Appellant was ongoing. Finally, while Appellant does allege that he complained for a year about the use of pepper gas (App. 10), and that prison officials engaged in \"continuing harassment, ploits [sic] to hurt or kill [him], and other forms of retaliation,\u201d (App.8, 9) such generalized allegations strike us as insufficient to connect the separate incidents mentioned above into a patter n of threats of serious physical injury that are ongoing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-6\">. In his reply brief, Appellant contends for the first time that this interpretation of the statute runs counter to the protections assured by the Eighth Amendment. Appellant argues that \"[t]he right to be free from serious physical injury while in prison is surely as fundamental as the right to divorce,\u201d citing as authority <em>Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971), and that, therefore, he is entitled to a waiver of filing fees as a matter of law. We will not discuss the merits of this contention because Abdul-Akbar waived this argument by not raising it in his opening brief. <em>Ghana v. Holland, </em>226 F.3d 175, 180 (3d Cir.2000). \"[The argument in the reply brief comes] too late.... Rule 28(a)(5) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and our Local Rule 28.1(a) require appellants to set forth the issues raised on appeal and to present an argument in support of those issues in their opening brief.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Kost v. Kozakiewicz, </em>1 F.3d 176, 182 (3d Cir.1993) (\"It is well settled that if an appellant fails to comply with these requirements on a particular issue, the appellant normally has abandoned and waived that issue on appeal and it need not be addressed by the court of appeals.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The dissent contends that Abdul-Akbar's waiver should be ignored because an assessment of the importance of a claimed constitutional interest is an implicit part of any <em>equal </em>protection or due process inquiry determining the level of scrutiny that will apply to a challenged government action. The dissent agrees with Abdul-Akbar that the right to be free from serious physical injury is just as weighty as the right to a divorce at issue in <em>Boddie, </em>and would hold that such a right represents a fundamental interest for <em>Boddie </em>purposes. Furthermore, the dissent also points to several other underlying rights, including the First Amendment right to free exercise of religion, that are not at issue in the instant case, but that the dissent would also presumably treat as fundamental interests under <em>Boddie. </em>What the dissent fails to recognize, however, is that the importance of the underlying right is largely immaterial to the question whether that right is a fundamental interest for <em>Boddie </em>purposes. As we discuss <em>infra </em>in Part VLB., an underlying constitutional entitlement rises to the level of a <em>Boddie </em>fundamental interest only when the government blocks the sole legal means for safeguarding that entitlement, and not simply because the interest itself is a weighty one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-4\">. Congress\u2019s rationale for placing the fee requirements on prisoners is captured in the statements of Senator Jon Kyi:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADn\">Section 2 will require prisoners to pay a very small share of the large burden they place on the Federal judicial system by paying a small filing fee upon commencement of lawsuits. In doing so, the provision will deter frivolous inmate lawsuits. The modest monetary outlay will force prisoners to think twice about the case and not just file reflexively. Prisoners will have to make the same decision that law-abiding Americans must make: Is the lawsuit worth the price? Criminals should not be given a special privilege that other Americans do not have.... The volume of prisoner litigation represents a large burden on the judicial system, which is already overburdened by increases in nonprisoner litigation. Yet prisoners have <em>very </em>little incentive not to file nonmeritorious lawsuits. Unlike other prospective litigants who seek poor person status, prisoners have all the necessities of life supplied, including the materials required to bring their lawsuits. For a prisoner who qualifies for poor person status, there is no cost to bring a suit and, therefore, no incentive to limit suits to cases that have some chance of success. The filing fee is small enough not to deter a prisoner with a meritorious claim, yet large enough to deter frivolous claims and multiple filings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">141 CONG. REC.

Because I believe that this case falls within a statutory exception, as properly interpreted in <em>Gibbs,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and that the statute, as interpreted and applied by the majority, substantially burdens fundamental rights without narrowly serving a compelling governmental interest, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">In 1990 we struck down a District Court injunction barring <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) suits by the same Appellant before us today as violative of the constitutional right of access to the courts, and we directed instead entry of an injunction that would permit such suits subject to certification and review calculated to test for frivolity. <em>See Abdul-Akbar v. Watson, </em>901 F.2d 329 (3d Cir.1990). While not expressly repudiating our holding in <em>Watson, </em>the majority nonetheless essentially holds that what the District Court was then precluded from doing by the Constitution it is now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>required to do by statute. Today\u2019s holding therefore places us at odds with a well-established line of cases exemplified by <em>Watson.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">This case unfortunately illustrates the maxim that bad cases may sometimes make bad law. This Appellant has clearly abused the IFP system, filing some 200 cases, most without merit. The three strikes rule as interpreted by the majority, however, will burden <em>other </em>would-be litigants who have <em>not filed 200 </em>eases, and whose \u201cstrikes\u201d were racked up without any bad faith or abuse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It will, moreover, bar potentially meritorious litigation at the filing stage, with no opportunity for substantive review or appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The principal holding announced by the majority is not very far-reaching. It rejects a statement in our earlier <em>Gibbs </em>case to-the effect that imminent danger is to be determined as of the time of the incident complained of, and joins with our sister courts of appeals that have held that danger must exist at the time the Complaint or appeal is filed. I joined in, and continue to adhere to, the able opinion of Judge Garth in <em>Gibbs. </em>In <em>Gibbs </em>we held that a prisoner who alleged two prior attacks by inmates and death threats, each related to his identification as a government informant, and who alleged that his \u201clife[was] in constant danger\u201d, provided sufficient allegations of \u201cimminent danger\u201d to survive the \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule. Although our principal holding was that \u201ca complaint alleging imminent danger ... must be credited as having satisfied the threshold criterion of \u00a7 1915(g) unless[that] element is challenged\u201d, we also stated that \u201cthe proper focus when examining an inmate\u2019s complaint filed pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g) must be the imminent danger faced by the inmate at the time of the alleged incident, and not at the time the complaint was filed.\u201d 116 F.3d at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">No clear intent may be discerned from section 1915(g)\u2019s use of the present tense (\u201cunless the prisoner is under imminent danger\u201d), because the same subsection elsewhere employs the present tense in reference to what are expressly recognized as past events (\u201cif the prisoner has brought an action or appeal ... that <em>was </em>dismissed on the grounds that it <em>is </em>frivolous, malicious or <em>fails </em>to state a claim ...\u201d). This erroneous combination of tenses renders the statutory provision ambiguous, and I believe that such ambiguity must be resolved in favor of preserving the right of access to the courts for prisoners threatened with bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>As the majority has acknowledged, the purpose of the exception is to \u201cprevent[ ] future harms.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 314. This purpose is best served by a liberal interpretation of the exception, one which gives scope to \u2014 and so facilitates \u2014 the deterrent effect of the subsequent damages remedy available under section 1983. See <em>City of Riverside v. Rivera, 477 </em>U.S. 561, 575, 106 S.Ct. 2686, 91 L.Ed.2d 466 (1986) (plurality) (stating that \u201cthe damages a plaintiff recovers contribute significantly to the deterrence of civil rights violations in the future\u201d). <em>Cf. Gibbs </em>(rejecting argument that \u201csuit for damages rather than injunc-tive relief ... was not seeking to protect ... physical safety\u201d). 116 F.3d at 85. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the exception as interpreted by <em>Gibbs </em>does not \u201ceviscerate\u201d the three strikes rule. A would-be litigant must plead imminent danger of serious physical injury (rather than a deprivation of procedural, associational, religious or other rights), and the court must determine that such danger is or was in fact present if such allegation is controverted. Moreover, as discussed below, section 1915(g)\u2019s potential encroachment into important constitutional rights also counsels for a broad interpretation of the exception. Finally, the importance of presenting an appropriately lenient interpretation in this <em>en banc </em>opinion \u2014 -which will guide the district courts in their decisions on hundreds, if not thousands, of prisoner filings \u2014 is heightened by the pre-clusive nature of section 1915(g). That is, the denial of <em>in forma pauperis </em>status and resultant dismissal of prisoner litigation made pursuant thereto will be effectively unreviewable, as a truly indigent plaintiff will no more be able to afford the requisite filing costs for appeal of that dismissal than for the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">While I disagree with the majority\u2019s rejection of the standard enunciated in <em>Gibbs </em>for one which determines the existence of imminent danger at the time the Complaint or appeal is filed, it is the majority\u2019s <em>application </em>of that standard to the facts of this case, and implicitly to those of <em>Gibbs, </em>that I find considerably more troubling.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The majority appears simply to assume that its holding that imminent danger must be assessed at the time of filing is dispositive of this case, and that Appellant was not in such danger. In so assuming, the majority seriously undermines protection of physically endangered prisoners by paying too little heed to ongoing threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The majority\u2019s lengthy explication of statutory tense notwithstanding, an equally crucial question of interpretation under section 1915(g) concerns the meaning of \u201cimminent danger\u201d. The majority\u2019s definition of \u201cimminent\u201d dangers as those \u201cwhich are about to occur at any moment or impending\u201d, <em>supra </em>at 314, is far too restrictive. In a real-world prison setting, the timing of an attack cannot be so neatly predicted. It may be that an ongoing threat of danger looms over a prisoner for an extended period. At any given moment, the harm might not be \u201cabout to\u201d occur; then again, it might. Such is the nature of \u201cdanger\u201d. It involves risk, not certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">The phrase \u201cimminent danger\u201d is not defined in the PLRA. It may be instructive, however, to consider the definition accorded the same phrase in other contexts. For example, under the Eighth Amendment prison authorities must protect prisoners not only from current threats, but also from \u201csufficiently imminent dangers\u201d; the courts have defined that phrase as encompassing those dangers \u201clikely to cause harm in the \u2018next week, month, or year.\u2019 \u201d <em>Horton v. Cockrell, </em>70 F.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Helling v. McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993); <em>Payne v. Collins, </em>986 F.Supp. 1036, 1052 (E.D.Tex.1997) (observing that this approach includes review of the actions taken to alleviate the threat)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In discussing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u201cimminent harm\u201d in the preliminary injunction context, we have held that standard met where the potential harm was not \u201cuncertain or speculative\u201d, but might be expected to occur before the threat could otherwise be averted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In determining standing, the courts have framed their inquiry into the \u201cimmediate threat\u201d as one encompassing consideration of the likelihood of an ongoing danger, as evidenced by past events. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 496, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974) (\u201cpast wrongs are evidence bearing on whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Indeed, this conception of imminent danger as encompassing an ongoing threat has been explicitly recognized by one of our sister circuits. In <em>Ashley v. Dilworth, </em>147 F.3d 715 (8th Cir.1998), the Eighth Circuit held that a prisoner placed in continuing proximity to inmates on his \u201cenemy alert list\u201d and subject to prior assaults \u201cproperly alleged an ongoing danger\u201d and so \u201c[met] the imminent danger exception of section 1915(g).\u201d 147 F.3d at 717.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Appellant\u2019s litigious history may incline us to read his Complaint with a certain degree of skepticism. Nonetheless, our precedents require us to construe pleadings, and especially <em>pro se </em>pleadings, liberally. <em>See Gibbs, </em>116 F.3d at 86 (observing that \u201c[u]nder our liberal pleading rules\u201d all allegations should be construed \u201cin favor of the complainant\u201d) (citations omitted). Reading the Complaint in the light most favorable to Appellant, I find his claimed predicament alarming.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Appellant, a black inmate, brought this action seeking, inter alia, an injunction against white prison guards \u201cfrom continuing ... plots to hurt or kill [him]\u201d. App. 8. The guards in question are asserted to be racists who \u201cdon\u2019t accept ... Black people as human beings\u201d and thus do not respect rights of any black person. App. 13. Appellant is a particular target of the guards\u2019 animus, as he asserts they are engaged in a conspiracy to retaliate against Appellant for filing complaints against them for past abuses. App. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Guards have made a practice of using pepper gas routinely to punish inmates for failing to obey orders or for \u201csaying something an officer don\u2019t like.\u201d App. 10. \u201c[M]a-jor problems happen on the white [guards\u2019] shifts, especially Black inmate\u2019s [sic] getting sprayed arbitrarily with pepper gas.\u201d App. 13. Although Appellant complained for over a year about the abuse of pepper gas, no restraint was placed on the use of pepper gas. App. 10,11.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Defendants \u201cknow [Appellant has] asthma ... and they\u2019ve seen [him] suffer whenever that pepper gas has been sprayed.\u201d App. 12. The danger faced by Appellant was not limited to attacks directed against him. Rather, the use of pepper gas \u201ceffects [sic] every inmate ... in the area\u201d. For example, in December, 1997, Appellant was exposed to pepper gas directed at other inmates and was taken to the hospital with an asthma attack. App. 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>In September or October of 1997, in a \u201cdeliberate attempt to have [Appellant] hurt or killed\u201d, a guard told an inmate that Appellant had \u201csnitched\u201d on him and other inmates. App. 12. Although Appellant feared for his life as a result of this incident, his request for protective custody was not honored. App. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">On January 8,1998 Appellant was transferred to a cell block with no window \u201cfor the express purpose\u2019s [sic] of having [him] in an area where the [racist guards] could harass, set up and try to kill [him]\u201d. The very next day, one of the defendant guards, again in the presence of other inmates, accused Appellant of informing, and proceeded to spray him with an entire can of pepper gas, whereupon Appellant collapsed with an asthma attack, \u201cfighting for breath on the floor\u201d and the guard \u201cleft [him] on the floor to die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">As far as the record reflects, none of the foregoing conditions had been corrected at the time Appellant filed his Complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In sum, Appellant alleges that at the time of the Complaint (i) Appellant remained confined in an institution controlled by guards who believed he did not have any rights and who had a vendetta against him; (ii) the guards made a practice of spraying inmates with pepper gas (to which Appellant was acutely vulnerable) on slight provocation, and prison officials placed no restraint on that practice; (iii) Appellant had been injured twice by pepper gas within just the past 10 weeks prior to filing;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (iv) the guards had incited hostility toward Appellant on the part of other prisoners by labeling Appellant as an informant; <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (v) Appellant was housed in a cell block selected to facilitate attacks by guards and inmates. These unabated conditions clearly give rise to an ongoing imminent danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Hence, I believe the facts alleged in this case place Appellant squarely within a proper interpretation of the exception to the three strikes rule. In <em>Gibbs, </em>as in <em>Ashley </em>and <em>Choyce, </em>there were similarly sufficient averments of ongoing danger that remained \u201cimminent\u201d at the time of filing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The majority today disposes of this case, overrules <em>Gibbs, </em>and effectively disagrees with <em>Ashley </em>and <em>Choyce, </em>without carefully analyzing the sufficiency of the allegations of ongoing danger.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The result is that, henceforth in this Circuit, prisoners with three strikes seeking IFP status will be faced with an insurmountable obstacle: they must show that a serious physical injury is \u201cabout to\u201d befall them \u201cat any moment\u201d, and apparently they may not predicate their showing on an ongoing risk based on past events.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> What, then, will suffice? Must a prisoner be running from his attackers as he files? By limiting the imminent danger exception to the \u201csword of Damocles\u201d situation, the majority all but writes the exception out of the statute. Certainly, the drastically impoverished version of the exception allowed by the majority cannot well fulfill its putative office as \u201ca safety valve ... to prevent impending harms\u201d. <em>Supra </em>at 315.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">A prisoner\u2019s resort to the courts may be expected to avert impending danger not only by correcting unlawful conditions,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but by deterring prison officials from unlawful conduct. Under the majority\u2019s interpretation, the potential deterrence of civil rights damages would be lost with respect to indigent prisoners with a history of prior failed suits. That is, guards would be free to abuse or retaliate against such prisoners without fear of civil liability, so long as their conduct was not so perpetual as to trigger the majority\u2019s test for imminent danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The majority\u2019s undermining of the protections afforded civil rights under section 1988 is exacerbated by other factors which, by delaying access to courts, increase the likelihood that past abuses will effectively be immunized because a danger will no longer be \u201cimminent\u201d at the time of filing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Finally, even in the rare case that satisfies the majority\u2019s narrow definition of imminent danger at the time of filing, a prisoner is effectively denied protection against trial error. Under the majority\u2019s interpretation, a prisoner who has secured a final judgment in the District Court finds himself in a peculiar position: he must once again meet the \u201cimminent danger\u201d requirement <em>at that moment </em>in time in order to file an appeal IFP. It is highly improbable that the danger would still be \u201cabout to\u201d occur at the time of an appeal, following entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Although the majority opinion purports to create unanimity among the courts of appeals, it does not and cannot achieve that purpose. As discussed above, today\u2019s holding cannot be reconciled with either the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Ashley </em>or the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Choyce. </em>Those cases evaluated the danger as of the filing date, but both recognized that the imminent danger requirement may be satisfied by an ongoing threat evidenced by past injuries attributable to uncorrected conditions. <em>See supra </em>n. 6 and accompanying text.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We cannot avoid a conflict by reciting similar standards, while reaching inconsistent results.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">I would hold that the exception applies, in accord with <em>Gibbs, Ashley </em>and <em>Choyce; </em>and I would leave for another day determination of the constitutional validity of section 1915(g) in a case that clearly falls outside of its saving exception.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, since the majority has interpreted the exception narrowly and has found this case within the rule barring IFP status, I will proceed to address the statute\u2019s constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">As the majority acknowledges, \u201c[s]tat-utes that substantially burden a fundamental right ... must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. <em>Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 216-17, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982).\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 316.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The right of access to the courts has long been deemed fundamental. As long ago as 1215, this right was articulated in Chapter 29 of the Magna Carta.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>seminal case of <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803) the Supreme Court observed that \u201c[t]he very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.\u201d More recently, the Court has repeatedly recognized the fundamental importance of the right of access to courts.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In <em>Wolff, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that prisoners have a constitutional right to bring civil rights actions before the courts. \u201cThe right of access to the courts ... is founded in the Due Process Clause and assures that no person will be denied the opportunity to present to the judiciary allegations concerning violations of fundamental constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Wolff, </em>418 U.S. at 579, 94 S.Ct. 2963.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">By 1977, the Supreme Court found it to be \u201cbeyond doubt that prisoners have a constitutional right of access to the courts.\u201d <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 821, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Court in <em>Bounds </em>described this right of access as \u201cfundamental\u201d, and held that it requires that prisoners receive \u201ca reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts.\u201d <em>Bounds, </em>430 U.S. at 825, 828, 97 S.Ct. 1491. Finally, in <em>Lewis, </em>the Court indicated that inmates\u2019 right of court access recognized in <em>Bounds </em>applies to actions \u201cto challenge the conditions of their confinement\u201d. <em>Lewis, </em>518 U.S. at 355, 116 S.Ct. 2174.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">As we have previously held, this right of court access applies even to litigious prisoners such as Appellant. <em>See In re Oliver, </em>682 F.2d 443, 446 (3d Cir.1982), <em>quoted in Watson, </em>901 F.2d at 332 (\u201cAccess to the courts is a fundamental tenet to our judicial system; legitimate claims should receive a full and fair hearing no matter how litigious the plaintiff may be.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">In view of this long and virtually unbroken array of authority,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> it can scarcely be disputed that prisoners\u2019 right of access to the courts is a fundamental right. The majority is doubtless correct in pointing out that the right of access is \u201cnot absolute\u201d; no rights are. What is important for equal protection purposes is that the right of access is fundamental, at least when underlying fundamental rights are in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>volved. <em>See McCarthy v. Madigan, </em>503 U.S. 140, 153, 112 S.Ct. 1081, 117 L.Ed.2d 291 (1992) (\u201c[T]he right to file a court action might be said to be [a prisoner\u2019s] remaining \u2018most fundamental political right, because preservative of all rights.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Yick Wo v. Hopkins, </em>118 U.S. 356, 370, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886)).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Even if access to courts were not itself a fundamental right, denial of access should still be subject to strict scrutiny to the extent that it may impermissibly burden underlying fundamental rights at stake.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Indeed, the majority opinion acknowledges that \u201c[a]n unconditional right of access exists for civil cases ... when denial of a judicial forum would implicate a fundamental human interest\u201d. <em>Supra </em>at 317. However, it declines to address whether Appellant\u2019s claims involve fundamental rights.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Notwithstanding the majority\u2019s avoidance of the issue, it is manifest that the rights underlying Appellant\u2019s suit are fundamental. As I read the Complaint, at stake are the rights to be free from arbitrary infliction of serious physical injury,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and from racially discriminatory assault.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> That these rights are fundamental to our constitutional system cannot be gainsaid.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Moreover, other fundamental rights are sure to be implicated in cases barred by the three strikes rule. For example, a suit charging denial of a prisoner\u2019s religious freedom in violation of the First Amendment is not likely to involve an element of imminent danger, and so will fall outside of the exception under section 1915(g). <em>See, e.g., Lyon v. Krol, </em>940 F.Supp. 1433, 1437 (S.D.Iowa 1996), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>127 F.3d 763 (8th Cir.1997) (dismissing prisoner\u2019s free exercise of religion claim pursuant to three strikes rule). <em>Cf. O\u2019Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, </em>482 U.S. 342, 348, 107 S.Ct. 2400, 96 L.Ed.2d 282 (1987) (recognizing prisoner\u2019s fundamental right to free exercise of religion).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">It seems clear that section 1915(g) substantially burdens affected prisoners\u2019 access to the courts and thereby burdens their enjoyment of whatever underlying rights they may seek to enforce in court. The statute\u2019s effect, in contravention of our law going back to the Magna Carta, is either to sell, to delay or to deny justice to the prisoners subject to its strictures.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> If they cannot buy entry into court, they must wait until they can; and if the wait is too long, justice will be denied to them.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In response to the apparent burden on fundamental rights, the majority makes two arguments: First, the majority argues that section 1915(g) does not prevent affected prisoners from filing their actions, but only from enjoying IFP status. The same argument was previously made by the Eleventh Circuit. <em>See Rivera v. Allin, </em>144 F.3d 719, 723 (11th Cir.1998). This argument reflects a surprising disregard for the practical financial constraints faced by indigent prisoners, and appears to ignore the reality, recognized by the Supreme Court, that even a small prepayment obligation can pose an insurmountable hurdle. <em>See Boddie, </em>401 U.S. at 380, 91 S.Ct. 780 (acknowledging that a facially valid fee may \u201coffend due process because it operates to foreclose a particular party\u2019s opportunity to be heard.\u201d); <em>Green, </em>669 F.2d at 786 (describing a prepayment requirement as a \u201cpotentially prohibitive financial barrier\u201d to court access on the part of the affected indigent prisoner). The majority does not, however, really miss this point: in the very same paragraph in which it argues that section 1915(g) does not block access to the federal courts, it concludes that precluding suit in federal court as a practical matter is precisely what Congress intended. <em>See supra </em>at 314-15.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Because it ultimately recognizes the practical reality that access to the federal courts will be delayed or denied for some, the majority repairs to its second argument: that foreclosing the federal forum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>imposes no real burden, as prisoners may bring the same civil rights claims in state courts, \u201cwhere limitations on filing I.F.P. <em>may </em>not be as strict.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 314 (emphasis added); <em>see also supra </em>at 317. In the end, the majority\u2019s rejection of strict scrutiny is expressly predicated on the presumed availability of a state law forum.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>See supra </em>at 318 <em>(\u201cBecause </em>neither Delaware substantive law nor Delaware court rules prevented [Appellant] ... from pursuing his claims, we do not agree that strict scrutiny is the appropriate test.\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <em>See also Wilson v. Yaklich, </em>148 F.3d 596, 605 (6th Cir.1998) (concluding that prisoner\u2019s fundamental right of access to the courts was not infringed upon because he \u201cstill had available ... the opportunity to litigate his federal constitutional causes of action in forma pauperis in state court.\u201d). <em>But cf. Rivera, </em>144 F.3d at 724 n. 9 (declining to place reliance on availability of state forum).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Even assuming that a state forum is available, however, it is by no means clear that denial of a <em>federal </em>forum does not in itself impose a substantial burden on the right of access. <em>See, e.g., Lyon, </em>940 F.Supp. at 1437-38 (\u201cAlthough inmates can also bring S 1983 claims in state court, plaintiffs have an important interest in access to federal courts for vindication of their federal constitutional rights.\u201d); <em>see also Procup, </em>792 F.2d at 1070 (\u201cAn absolute bar against a prisoner filing any suit in federal court would be patently unconstitutional.\u201d); <em>Green, </em>669 F.2d at 786 (concluding that \u201cconstitutional right of access to the courts\u201d was \u201cunduly impair[ed]\u201d by order that effectively denied \u201cany and all access to the district court\u201d); <em>Packer Avenue Assocs., </em>884 F.2d at 748 (holding that order prohibiting subsequent filings in federal court could \u201cnot be allowed to stand\u201d).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Although the alternative forum argument may have superficial appeal, I do not believe it can withstand searching examination. In the first place, the argument neglects to consider foreclosure of the courts to the \u201cthree-strikes\u201d prisoner in states which have adopted parallel legislation.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This is not merely an academic con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>eern. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania appeared as an <em>amicus </em>curiae in this case and explained that the \u201cmany thousands of prisoners\u201d housed in Pennsylvania\u2019s thirty-nine correctional facilities \u201cannually file hundreds of federal civil actions directed against state officials and employees\u201d, and implied that a substantial number of those actions would be affected by the decision announced herein. Because Pennsylvania has adopted a three strikes limitation of IFP status that parallels section 1915(g), there is no judicial forum available to indigent Pennsylvania prisoners with three strikes unless they can satisfy the majority\u2019s virtually preclusive test for imminent danger, no matter how meritorious their claims and no matter how fundamental the rights at stake.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In the second place, the alternative forum argument also neglects the potential implications of removal to federal court. Federal-law civil rights actions filed in state court generally may be removed by the defendants, with the likely effect that an indigent plaintiff subject to the three strikes rule would lose his ability to appeal.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The prospective loss of such an important procedural safeguard is a very substantial burden on affected litigants.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">Because section 1915(g) does impose a substantial burden on the fundamental rights of many if not all members of the class against whom it is directed, the next step is to examine whether it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">As identified by the majority, the congressional purpose behind section 1915(g) was to deter frivolous lawsuits through \u201ceconomic incentives that would prompt prisoners to \u2018stop and think\u2019 before filing a complaint.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 318. <em>See also supra </em>at 314 (\u201cThe \u2018three strikes\u2019 rule ... supplied a powerful economic incentive not to file frivolous lawsuits or appeals.\u201d).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> It is not at all apparent how \u201cdisqualifying frequent filers who have failed <em>in the past </em>to carefully evaluate their claims\u201d can serve as a \u201cdeterrent mechanism\u201d. <em>Supra </em>at 318 (emphasis added). No matter how long a disqualified prisoner such as Appellant stops, no matter how carefully he thinks, and no matter how meritorious his claims, he will remain disqualified. It is simply not possible to deter frivolous filings that have already occurred. At a minimum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>therefore, the retrospective application of the three strikes rule to past filings cannot further the statute\u2019s asserted deterrent purpose.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">With respect to future filings, it is difficult to see how the three strikes rule functions solely as an <em>economic </em>deterrent. To be sure, another section of the PLRA is well calculated to have that effect. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b) (requiring prisoners with IFP suits to pay filing fee in installments, in lieu of prior practice of waiving fee). This section corrects the perceived problem of inmates filing suits with no financial consequences, while at the same time ensuring that the truly indigent prisoner will not be denied access to the courts solely because he lacks the requisite funds.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The disincentive supplied by the three strikes rule, on the other hand, is not purely economic. For the truly indigent, the rule threatens a loss of the fundamental right of access to the courts. This is in no sense a market-correcting economic deterrent.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In any event, even assuming that the goal of deterring frivolous suits is a compelling governmental interest, and that the three strikes rule somehow furthers that goal, the statute nevertheless cannot withstand strict scrutiny because at best there is only a very poor fit between end and means. As a mechanism for deterring frivolous claims, section 1915(g) is both under- and over- inclusive. On the one hand, it leaves unchecked the flow of frivolous lawsuits filed 'by indigent non-prisoners and by prisoners and non-prisoners with sufficient funds.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> On the other hand, it cuts off non-frivolous claims filed by indigent prisoners within its scope. <em>See supra, </em>at 314 (\u201cIn stark terms, ... the I.F.P. privilege will not be available ... no matter how meritorious subsequent claims may be.\u201d).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> These shortcomings precisely echo those of the prepayment requirements disapproved in <em>Green </em>and its progeny.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Rinaldi v. Yeager, </em>384 U.S. 305, 310, 86 S.Ct. 1497, 16 L.Ed.2d 577 (1966) (state statute requiring reimbursement of cost of criminal appeal transcript only as to prisoners held unconstitutional: \u201cAssuming a law enacted to [deter frivolous appeals] to be otherwise valid, the present statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>classification is no less vulnerable under the Equal Protection Clause when viewed in relation to that function. By imposing a financial obligation only upon inmates of institutions, the statute inevitably burdens many whose appeals, though unsuccessful, were not frivolous, and leaves untouched many whose appeals may have been frivolous indeed\u201d) Moreover, much better targeted means are available to arrest chronic frivolous filings.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">It is therefore not surprising that courts which have applied strict scrutiny have found section 1915(g) wanting. <em>See Lyon, </em>940 F.Supp. 1433 (S 1983 action alleging denial of participation in Jewish services and other religious practices); <footnotemark>49</footnotemark> <em>Ayers v.

The majority's discussion does not say <em>how </em>the three strikes rule is supposed to further deterrence. Instead, it seems to say that the three strikes rule is rationally related to its goal <em>because </em>it is within congressional power. <em>See supra </em>at 319 (\"Preventing frequent filers from obtaining fee waivers is rationally related to the legitimate government interest of deterring frivolous lawsuits because \u2018Congress is no more compelled to guarantee free access to federal courts than it is to provide unlimited access to them.\u2019 \u201d).

The injunction that apparently remains in effect against Appellant, setting special filing preconditions in response to his history of abuse, is but one example. See <em>supra </em>at 311. Another example is the PLRA\u2019s own provision for judicial screening. Under section 1915A, a court may review and assess the merit of a prisoner's claims before docketing. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a)-(b) (Supp. Ill 1997). These measures, directed at particular abusers and particular frivolous claims, are clearly more narrowly tailored to serve their proper end than the three strikes classification, which lumps good faith err or with abuse and stifles meritorious claims along with frivolous ones. <em>See </em>Lukens, <em>The Prisoner Litigation Reform Act, </em>70 Temp. L.Rev. at 505-06 (observing that \"Section 1915(g) ... treats the prisoner who has filed otherwise meritorious claims, but failed to name the proper party, ... in the same manner as the litigant who sued the President ... for stealing the multiplication tables from him.\u2019\u2019)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\">. The District Court in <em>Lyon </em>noted that, unlike the traditional discretionary power of the courts to limit abusive litigation by an individual prisoner based on his particular circumstances, the \"three dismissal rule\u201d gave no consideration to, <em>e.g., </em>length of incarceration, number of meritorious actions, or \"other pertinent information that might guide a federal court in properly limiting abuse....\u201d <em>Lyon, </em>940 F.Supp. at 1438. Applying a strict scrutiny review, the District Court held section 1915(g) violative of equal protection. The Eighth Circuit undertook no constitutional review, finding instead that the plaintiff lacked standing because he had sufficient funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b360-9\">. The majority\u2019s response that constitutional constraints require \"neither a perfect nor even best available fit\u201d between statutory ends and means, <em>supra </em>at 318-19, quoting <em>Mariani v. United States, </em>212 F.3d 761, 774 (3d Cir.2000) (en banc), is not entirely apt. Section 1915(g) is not constitutionally deficient because it is merely imperfect or suboptimal; rather, its very high degree of both under- and over-inclusiveness renders it an extremely poor fit. Cases such as <em>Mariani, </em>which permit a certain degree of under-inclusiveness in statutes that burden First Amendment rights, therefore do not advance the inquiry. In the context of an equal protection challenge to a burden on access to the courts, the Supreme Court has found the same type of under- and over-inclusiveness at issue here to be constitutionally impermissible. <em>See supra </em>at 331-32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b360-10\">. This conclusion is in accord with an apparent consensus among commentators who have addressed the constitutionality of the PLRA\u2019s three strikes provision. <em>See, e.g., </em>Luk-ens, <em>The Prison Litigation Reform Act, supra </em>n. 36; Franklin, <em>Three Strikes, supra </em>n. 25; David C. Leven, <em>Justice for the Forgotten and Despised, </em>16 Touro L.Rev. 1, 15 (Fall 1999); Mary Tushnet and Larry Yackle, <em>Symbolic Statutes and Real Laws: The Pathologies of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the Prison Litigation Reform Act, </em>47 Duke L.J. 1, 70 (Oct. 1997); Simone Schonenberger, <em>Access Denied: The Prison Litigation Reform Act, </em>86 Ky. L.J. 457 (1997-1998); Catherine G. Patsos, <em>The Constitutionality and Implications of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, </em>42 N.Y.L. Sch.

In addition to its infirmity on equal protection grounds, section 1915(g) raises troubling questions concerning the constitutional prohibition against bills of attainder and <em>ex post facto </em>laws, in'that it operates as an extrajudicial punishment against an identified group based on their past conduct. As noted by the majority, the three strikes rule seeks to deter prisoner litigation by \"disqualifying frequent filers who have failed in the past to carefully evaluate their claims prior to filing.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 318. <em>Cf. Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 939, 947, 117 S.Ct. 1871, 138 L.Ed.2d 135 (1997) (stating that a statute which \"attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions ... already past, must be deemed retrospective\u201d) (quoting <em>Soc. for Propagation of the Gospel v. Wheeler, </em>22 F. Cas. 756, 767 (No. 13,156) (C.C.D.N.H.1814) (Story, J.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">The Supreme Court has identified three requirements for finding that a challenged statute is a bill of attainder: \"specification of the affected persons, punishment, and lack of a judicial trial.\u201d <em>Selective Service System v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group, </em>468 U.S. 841, 847, 104 S.Ct. 3348, 82 L.Ed.2d 632 (1984). As to the first element, section 1915(g) plainly is directed toward \"specifically designated persons or groups\u201d. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>381 U.S. 437, 447, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 (1965). The affected prisoners are identified by an objectively ascertainable, immutable characteristic \u2014 three or more prior \"strikes\u201d \u2014 and are commonly referred to in cases and congressional debate by a common pejorative title (\"frequent filers\u201d). As to the second element, the majority, appears to acknowledge a punitive purpose and effect: \"Potentially negative consequences in <em>federal </em>courts ... are precisely the consequences intended by Congress. The outcome predicted by Appellant [i.e., that a prisoner \"could forever lose his ability to bring his suit as a practical matter\u201d] is ... exactly what Congress intended.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 314-15. <em>Cf. Green, </em>669 F.2d at 786 (characterizing as \"simply punitive\u201d a prepayment requirement which \"is not geared to discerning whether each claim presents a new nonfrivolous issue\u201d and which seeks to \"deter\u201d by \"as-sum[ing]\u201d that the affected prisoner \"will not be able to meet the required filing fee\u201d). Finally, as to the third element, section 1915(g) imposes its deprivation without any judicial trial. <em>Cf. Lyon, </em>940 F.Supp. at 1438 (contrasting blanket bar of section 1915(g) with particularized discretion attendant on judicial proceeding to limit abusive litigation).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
