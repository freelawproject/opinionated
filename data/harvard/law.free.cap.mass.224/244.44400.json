The said party of the second part doth engage to provide and furnish to the said vessel, a full cargo of coal, and to pay said party of the first part, or agent, for the use of said vessel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>during the voyage aforesaid Sixty five cents (65c) from Baltimore, Md. and Fifty five cents (55c) from Newport News and Norfolk, Va. to Boston. If ordered to Portland rate of freight on same terms except that vessel shall receive bridge money 3c per ton for each bridge used. If vessel is ordered to Mystic Wharf Boston, the party of the second part is to pay bridge money at the rate of lc per ton for each bridge used. If vessel is sent to N. E. Coal &amp; Coke Co.\u2019s wharf, Everett, no bridge money is to be paid to vessel per ton of 2240 lbs. Coal to be loaded and discharged free of expense to vessel, but vessel to trim as customary.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\">\u201cIt is agreed that 8 days average (Sundays and Holidays excepted) are to be allowed for loading and discharging, both inclusive, commencing from the time the Captain reports vessel ready to receive or discharge cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u201cFor each and every day\u2019s detention beyond said time by default of said party of the second part, or agent, five cents per ton on Bill of Lading weight per day and pro rata for portion of a day shall be paid by said party of second part, or agent, to said party of the first part, or agent. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u201cThe dangers of the seas and navigation of every kind mutually excepted. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u201cTo the true and faithful performance of all and every, of the foregoing agreement, we, the said parties, do hereby bind ourselves, our heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and also the said vessel\u2019s freight, tackle and appurtenances, and the merchandise to be laden on board, each to the other, in the penal sum of the estimated amount of this charter; and the vessel holding a lien upon the cargo for freight and demurrage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\"><em>Randall </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>21 C. C. A. 334, and cases cited in note 337, 338. <em>Hagerman </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>46 C. C. A. 1. See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>64 Maine, 339, 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">While two of the plaintiff\u2019s schooners were chartered, it was agreed \u201cthat by the contemporaneous construction of the charter party by the parties, the two schooners were to be treated separately, and there was to be no averaging of time between the two vessels, and the time consumed by the 'William L. Douglas\u2019 in no wise affects the rights of the parties in this suit,\u201d and that the words \"as many successive voyages,\u201d meant, \u201cas many successive voyages as can be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s other vessel, the \u201cMertie B. Crowley,\u201d having completed six round voyages, was lost on her seventh voyage by a peril of the sea, thirty-eight days before the steamer in process of construction had been commissioned or substituted as provided in the charter party. It is the defendant\u2019s contention that, the vessel not having kept on sailing continuously between the time when she reported as ready for loading and when the steamer was substituted, no demurrage ever accrued or was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\">But the contract is entire and unambiguous. It is to be construed accordingly, and \u201cthe dangers of the seas and navigation\u201d are expressly excepted. The plaintiff did not contract that the vessel should make as many trips as actually could be made within the period if all dangers of the seas or of navigation were excluded, but only promised performance subject to those dangers and exceptions. The judge, before whom the case was tried without a jury, having been warranted in finding on the evidence that neither party had terminated the contract, and there having been no contention that the vessel had not made as many trips as were possible at the time she was wrecked, the vessel had fulfilled all the obligations imposed by the charter party. The plaintiff therefore was entitled to recover demurrage for the voyages which had been completed. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>11 Mass. 45. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Garfield &amp; Proctor Coal Co. </em>113 Fed. Rep. 520, 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The next question is upon what basis should the amount of demurrage be computed. In compliance with the defendant\u2019s sixth request, the judge ruled that under the language of the charter party, \u201ceight days average for loading and unloading, both inclusive,\u201d the charterer was entitled to average together the days taken for loading with the days taken for unloading on all trips as a basis for the \u201cdetermination of whether or not any demur-rage was due,\u201d and awarded damages for overtime beyond the lay days allowed during each voyage for loading and discharging the cargo. See <em>Elswick Steamship Co. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Montaldi, </em>[4907]1 K. B. 626. By this construction it is apparent that the provision giving the vessel \u201ca lien upon the cargo for freight and demurrage\u201d is disregarded. But, the plaintiff not having excepted to the ruling and being satisfied with the finding, it is unnecessary to determine whether the average overtime to secure which the vessel was given a possessory lien should not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>been ascertained for each voyage and the plaintiff\u2019s damages correspondingly increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The defendant\u2019s other requests for rulings in so far as not given or waived at the argument, having rested on its contentions that the demurrage must be so computed as to average the time for discharging and loading on all the voyages the vessel could have made if she had continued in the service until the substitution of the steamer, and that, the vessel having been lost before that time, even if by perils of the sea, the action could not be maintained, were denied rightly. The exception to the exclusion of evidence has been waived and, the defendant having failed to show that it has been prejudiced, the exceptions must be over-</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">rU^e&lt;^\u2018 <em>So ordered.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
