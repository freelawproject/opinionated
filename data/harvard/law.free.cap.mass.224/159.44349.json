Fawcett and Robert Fawcett, intervening petitioners, as judgment creditors of . the defendant, Thomas F. Tighe, to reach and apply to the payment of their claims the interest of Thomas F. Tighe in a judgment recovered by him and others in an action against the Maryland Casualty Company, the exceptions of the defendant in that case having been overruled by this court. <em>Tighe </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>218 Mass. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">On August 17, 1910, and before the recovery by these plaintiffs, respectively, of their judgments against Thomas F. Tighe, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>latter and Ms co-plaintiffs had by a written instrument assigned <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> all their mterest m their claim against the Casualty Company to Darnel H. Coakley and James P. Magenis, and afterwards Coakley and Magenis assigned and conveyed all the interest wMch they received by virtue of the assignment to one David Stoneman. The amount of the judgment recovered by Tighe and others against the Maryland Casualty Company has been paid into the Superior Court by the defendant in that action, and is to be paid to the person or persons found to be entitled thereto by decree of court in tMs case. Stoneman has appeared and filed a claim for the whole amount of the fund by virtue of the assignments above referred to. The plaintiffs contend that the assignment to Coakley is a champertous agreement, and therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>A judge of the Superior Court by whom the suit was heard,* found that \u201cthe said Tighes carried a policy of liability insurance issued by the Maryland Casualty Company, which the said Casualty Company refused to pay. It was deemed necessary in order to sue said Company, to provide in some way for paying the Adler judgment. To accomplish this, and also in order to pay CoaHey for his services in prosecuting the suit, the Tighes, who had no money for the purposes, made the assignment in question. The assignment was made for a valuable consideration, and transferred to the assignees all of the said Tighes\u2019 interest in and to their claim against the Casualty Company. Coakley, who was duly authorized by Magenis, assigned all their interest in said assignment to the claimant Stoneman for a valuable consideration. Coakley took the assignment as security for his services. These services he rendered successfully, and the amount charged therefor was reasonable. There was no evidence of any agreement that said Coakley should not be paid for his services if he was unsuccessful' in prosecuting this suit. Both Coakley and Thomas F. Tighe testified, and neither was asked any question relative to such an agreement. I rule and find that under the circumstances stated, the assignment did not constitute a champertous agreement, and is valid and binding. The fund paid into court exceeded the amount of $4,943.75 by reason of interest which had accumulated on said amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In view of these findings upon evidence which is not reported, we are unable to say that they were not warranted. The assignment to Coakley was of a portion of the judgment to be recovered, the sum of $1,000, the balance of the judgment by the terms of the agreement being assigned to Magenis.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The judge having found that there was no evidence of any agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>ment that Coakley should not be paid for his services if he was unsuccessful in prosecuting the action, it was not a champertous contract and is to be distinguished from that considered by this court in <em>Gargano </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>184 Mass. 571. The finding that the assignment was executed to secure the payment to Coakley for legal services did not of itself make it illegal. As was said in the case of <em>Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Ahern, </em>144 Mass. 393, at page 395, \u201cWhere the right to compensation is not confined to an interest in the thing recovered, but gives a right of action against the party, though pledging the avails of the suit, or a part of them, as security for payment, the agreement is not champertous.\u201d <em>Hadlock </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>178 Mass. 425. <em>Delml </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>213 Mass. 203.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b190-8\"><em>F. Hunt, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b190-9\"><em>J. G. Walsh, </em>for .the claimant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The remaining question is whether the assignment includes the interest which has accumulated on the judgment. By the terms of the agreement, the whole amount of the claim was intended to be assigned. The assignee is entitled to receive the accumulated interest, as incidental to the right to the principal sum, in the absence of anything to show that the parties intended a different disposition as to interest. Besides the judge has expressly ruled and found that the assignment was intended \u201cto cover the amount of the final judgment against the Maryland Casualty Company, principal and interest, and was not limited to the exact amount stated in the assignment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">What has been said disposes of all the questions raised. The entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b188-5\"> This assignment was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u201c.Whereas Matthew Adler, a minor of Boston, County of Suffolk and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, recovered judgment against Thomas F.
