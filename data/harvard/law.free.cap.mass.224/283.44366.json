Trust, </em>Creation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-8\">The aunt in this country of a girl seven years of age then living in Ireland deposited in a savings bank in her own name as trustee for the girl $200 that belonged to the girl as the only next of kin of her deceased mother, and afterwards deposited in this account $350 to which was added the accumulated interest. Later when the girl came to this country the aunt showed her the bank book and told her that the money that her mother had left was to be put in the bank in trust for her. For more than seven years the aunt collected wages earned by the girl, amounting to 81,190, and told the girl that she was saving them for her and was putting them with her mother\u2019s money so that the girl should have that in trust. In fact she deposited in the trust account 8350 of the wages and mingled the balance with her own money. The aunt stated to the girl that she could have the money in the trust account if anything happened to the aunt and that the account would be something that the plaintiff always could have. In a suit in equity brought by the girl after the aunt\u2019s death against the executor of her will, it was <em>held, </em>that these facts with the inferences naturally to be drawn from them were sufficient to justify, if not to require, a finding that the account in the savings bank became a completed gift when the plaintiff\u2019s aunt first informed her that the original deposit of money in that account was the money that had belonged to the plaintiff\u2019s mother, and that the gift was accepted by the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AX5\">In the same case it was <em>held, </em>that the plaintiff\u2019s wages, which were collected by the defendant's testatrix for a period of seven years with the declared purpose of holding them for the plaintiff, were impressed with a trust that was not terminated by their being deposited in the savings bank fund nor by their being mingled with other money of the defendant\u2019s testatrix.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-9\">Bill in equity, filed in the Superior Court on February 10, 1915, against the executor of the will of Mary Dignan, late of Boston, praying for an accounting by the defendant as executor for a fund held in trust by Mary Dignan for the benefit of and belonging to the plaintiff as stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-10\">In the Superior Court the case was heard by <em>Wait, </em>J., the evidence having been taken by a commissioner appointed under Equity Rule 35, to which was annexed the deposition of Mrs. Rose Brown Snow. The judge made a memorandum of findings of fact and ordered a decree for the payment to the plaintiff of the amount of $1,088.39 withdrawn by the defendant\u2019s testatrix on March 20,1890, of which $1,000 was immediately redeposited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>by her in the Provident Institution for Savings, and also the amount of $700 of wages unexpended, held for the plaintiff Theresa; with interest on both amounts computed from March 20, 1890, at four and one half per cent per annum, compounding in the manner of savings bank deposits with semiannual rests on January 1 and July 1 of each year; and that the decree should be without costs to either party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\">Later the judge made a final decree in accordance with this order, directing the payment by the defendant as executor of the will of Mary Dignan to the plaintiff of the sum of $5,388.67 with interest at the rate of six per cent per annum computed from February 10, 1915, the date of the filing of the bill, without costs to either party.

Suffolk Savings Bank, </em>198 Mass. 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">That the gift was then accepted may be inferred from the fact that a part of the deposit belonged originally to the plaintiff subject to the administration of the estate of the mother and that it was a benefit and not a burden to the plaintiff to receive it: <em>Gerrish </em>v. <em>New Bedford Institution for Savings, </em>128 Mass. 159. <em>Alger </em>v. <em>North End Savings Bank, </em>146 Mass. 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>The wages of the plaintiff, collected by the defendant fora period, of over seven years before 1890, under a declaration of purpose to conserve and care for them in the interest of the plaintiff, were impressed with a trust which was not divested upon their deposit in the savings bank fund or upon their being mingled with other moneys of the defendant. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>114 Mass. 400; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Whoriskey, </em>170 Mass. 63; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>189 Mass. 332, 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">There was no error in the refusal to make the rulings and findings requested by the defendant. It follows that the decree of the court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\n<em>Decree accordingly-</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
