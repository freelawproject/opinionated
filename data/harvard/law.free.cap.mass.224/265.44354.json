As the owner in control it was his \u25a0duty to use reasonable care to keep it in as safe condition for its intended use as it was, or appeared to be, when the male plaintiff became a tenant. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Blouin, </em>210 Mass. 140. <em>Domenicis </em>v. <em>Fleisher, </em>195 Mass. 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\">There was evidence that it was not in as good condition at the time of the injury as when the plaintiffs first moved in; that the defendant\u2019s attention had been called to the alleged \u201cunsafe and dangerous condition\u201d of the stairway at least two weeks before the accident; that the \u201ctreads\u201d had gradually \u201cworn way down to the scotia; ... to a hollow, which had worn the nosing out;\u201d that the nosing was worn through to what is known as the scotia; that the scotias \u201cwere broken in the centre where the treads were the most worn;\u201d that the plaintiff, Maria C. Stagnaro, on January 22, 1912, as she testified, \"started from her living apartment on the third floor to go to her office which was on the second floor; that she started to go slowly down the stairway in question with her hands on the rail; that when she got about on the middle of the stairs she put her right foot down and her left foot got caught on a broken step, 'got caught right in the middle, you know, in one of the steps, got caught, and I hold myself with my hands, but I went like that;\u2019 that she fell to the bottom of the stairs; that her foot was on the eighth step when she fell, 'the eighth going up, eighth coming down.\u2019\u201d On cross-examination she testified that she thought she really knew how she got hurt; that according to her story she was terribly injured; that the exact stair where her foot got caught was in the middle \u25a0of the stairs; that no one had told her that the edge of the eighth stair was worn a little more than any of the others; that she caught her heel in the moulding which was underneath the edge of one of those treads which were in evidence, a broken step; that as she fell she struck on the post and fell round the -corner and landed against the wall in the hall, near the office -door.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Upon these facts and upon the evidence which the jury might -derive from an inspection of the treads and scotia which were shown to the jury and exhibited to the court at the argument, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the presiding judge was warranted in submitting the issue of the female plaintiff\u2019s due care and that of the defendant\u2019s negligence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">It follows that he refused rightly to rule \u201cthat on all the evidence the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
