But in that contention the defendant is met with the same rule of law which was decisive of the case of <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Couch. </em>The paroi promise to pay the balance of the judgment did not impose upon the defendant a less onerous liability than that imposed upon him by the judgment and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>not give to the plaintiff a more beneficial right than that given him by it. It follows that the defendant\u2019s paroi promise to pay the balance of the judgment was neither a benefit to the plaintiff nor a detriment to the defendant and, being without consideration, was <em>nudum factum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The defendant\u2019s other contention is that the promise to pay the balance of the judgment comes within the doctrine on which it is held that a negotiable promissory note given by a debtor is <em>frima facie </em>payment of an open account; for which he cites <em>Ilsley </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>2 Met. 168, 173, and <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Bodwell, </em>12 Pick. 268. But, whether the obligation assumed by the maker of a negotiable promissory n\u00f3te is or is not a more burdensome one than that resting upon one liable upon an open account, the negotiable note is more beneficial than the open account and for that reason there is a valid consideration in that case. And for the matter of that a non-negotiable note which is not within the rul\u00e9 invoked (see <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>4 Mass. 93; <em>Maneely </em>v. <em>M\u2019Gee, </em>6 Mass. 142, 145) may be taken in satisfaction. If it is taken as an account stated it is founded on a valid consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The defendant\u2019s last contention is that, inasmuch as the judgment is satisfied on the record, the plaintiff\u2019s remedy is by way of <em>scire facias </em>and for this he relies upon <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Bangs, </em>206 Mass. 408, and <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>2 Gray, 326. But upon the face of the record the judgment was not satisfied. The indorsement upon the execution states that-the plaintiff had \u201creceived on the within named execution $125 in full satisfaction.\u201d Since the $125 is a smaller sum than that due upon the judgment, it is apparent upon the face of the execution that the judgment was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
