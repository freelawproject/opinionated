The instrument containing the application and agreement to indemnify the said surety company was signed by the defendant, and a premium of $5 was paid upon the issuing of the appeal bond. The case was still pending in the Superior Court, and the bond was in full force, when this action was brought to recover four unpaid annual premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The presiding judge <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> excluded certain offers of proof made by the plaintiff, evidently assuming that the application and indemnity agreement embodied the complete and final record of all the terms agreed upon between the parties. But even on this assumption we do not think he was justified in ordering a verdict for the defendant. The agreement expressly provided for the payment of a premium to the company annually in advance so long as the bond should remain in force. The obvious failure to fill in the blank space where the agreement recited \u201ca premium of dollars ($ ) annually\u201d <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> cannot reasonably be interpreted as showing that the parties meant \u201can annual payment of nothing at all\u201d as the defendant contends. The payment of an annual premium not only is customary, but was expressly contemplated. In the margin of the application part of the agreement appear the words \"Premium, $5.00.\u201d This well may be interpreted as defining the amount of the annual payment. In the light of the context, and in view of the contract as a whole, it seems apparent that it was intended to insert the word \u201cfive,\u201d where the obvious omission occurs. Accordingly, this will be supplied by the court; especially as there was oral evidence, admitted without objection, that such was the mutual understand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>ing and intention of the parties. <em>Sweetser </em>v. <em>French, </em>13 Met. 262.
