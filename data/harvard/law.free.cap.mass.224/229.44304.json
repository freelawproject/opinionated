Turner while the defendant\u2019s name was Augustus W. Turner.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-5\">The Commonwealth, at such trial, may introduce in evidence under R. L. c. 175, \u00a7 24, to impeach the credit of the witness Mrs. H as to some of her statements, evidence of statements made by her to various police officers immediately after the death of the woman to the effect that the doctor who called upon the woman at her home was named Augustus W. Turner and that he had an office at the address on Massachusetts Avenue near Symphony Hall, if, before the evidence of such statements is introduced, the circumstances under which they were made, sufficient to designate the particular occasions, have been mentioned to the witness and she has been asked if she made the statements and has been given an opportunity to explain them.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-6\">At such trial, testimony of a police officer is admissible to the effect that, four days after the alleged criminal act of the defendant and two days before the death of the woman, at a time when other evidence showed that the woman was at the house of Mrs. H, he saw Mrs. H and the defendant talking together on Massachusetts Avenue near the corner of Boylston Street in Boston.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-7\">In this case it was <em>held, </em>that, under the circumstances, the discretion of the presiding judge as to permitting the Commonwealth to cross-examine or lead the witness Mrs. H could not be said to have been exercised so as manifestly to have prejudiced the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-8\">At the trial above described, the jury were instructed that they should disregard all of Mrs. H\u2019s testimony unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the identity of the defendant as the Dr. Turner who called at her house when the woman was there; and a motion to have her entire testimony stricken out was held to have been denied rightly.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-9\">A woman, whose death has been caused by a criminal operation to procure a miscarriage, is not an accomplice to the crime although she voluntarily went to the person who performed the operation and paid him for doing it, and, at the trial of an indictment for the crime under R.

Richardson died.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">The case was tried before <em>Callahan, </em>J. During the opening statement to the jury by the Commonwealth, the presiding judge said to the jury, \u201cI will say to the jury that anything said by counsel in opening statement is not to be regarded by them as evidence and is to have no effect whatever upon their minds until it is made good by evidence subsequently introduced, and that I state to you, gentlemen.\u201d Later, in the course of the opening, the prosecuting officer stated, without objection being made by the defendant, \u201cNow, gentlemen, we will call the nurse and put her on the stand in the course of the trial, and the government anticipates difficulty in getting the truth from this woman. However, what I am saying is not going to make evidence in this case, it is what you hear on the witness stand and what you see take place there; but that is what we contend.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">There was evidence tending to show the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-8\">At about six o\u2019clock in the evening of January 6, 1915, Irene A. Richardson sent for her sister to come to the apartment of one Marie Hansen, numbered 282 on Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, and take her to her home in Arlington. When she arrived at her home she was in a feeble condition. She at once was attended there by Dr. Harold R. Webb, the physician of her family, who found her in so dangerous a condition that under his advice she was removed to a hospital. At the hospital a consultation as to her condition was held between Dr. Webb and Dr. Edward P. Stickney, both of whom were of opinion that she had been pregnant three or four months, that an abortion had been performed upon her some days before and that her condition then was critical from septicaemia. An operation was performed about one o\u2019clock in the morning of January 7, but it soon became apparent that she could not live.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-9\">At about ten o\u2019clock in the morning of January 7, both physicians <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>informed her that she was about to die. Her mind was clear and she stated that she understood the fact of her approaching death and that a statement that she was about to make probably would be her last statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-5\">She then made a statement to the physicians and the matron of the hospital, in which she at first named a certain man as responsible for her pregnancy. Her attention being called to the fact that she was naming a different man than one whom she previously had named, and she being asked, \u201cDo you realize your condition and the necessity for absolute truthfulness, and do you wish to change all the statements you have made?\u201d she said, \u201cYes,\u201d and named a different man, who, she said, gave her $30 to have the abortion performed \u201cand I supplied the rest. ... I paid Dr. Turner $60. ... I am now telling the truth. I did not tell the truth before about\u201d who was responsible for the pregnancy. \u201cI went to Boston last Friday [January 1] to the office of A. W. Turner, Massachusetts Avenue, near Symphony Hall. I saw him first there. He put a red tube up inside of me. Then he sent me to Mrs. Hansen, 282 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge. I went to bed, had pain and began to flow. Dr. Turner came on Sunday and curetted me, he curetted me again on Monday and again on Tuesday. I got up on Wednesday and telephoned home, and Ethel [her sister] came to this house, 282 Massachusetts-Avenue, Cambridge, for me. . . . Mrs. Hansen wasn\u2019t in the room when Dr. Turner curetted me ... I say this realizing that I am about to die.\u201d Her right hand then held raised, supported at the elbow by Dr. Webb, she repeated after Dr. Stickney these words, \u201cI say this realizing I am about to die, and this is true, so help me God.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">There was other medical testimony confirming the opinions stated by Dr. Webb and Dr. Stickney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-7\">Marie Hansen was called as a witness by the Commonwealth. She stated that a Dr. Turner called her on the telephone on the afternoon of Monday, January 4, and said, \u201cI am Dr. Turner that you spoke to a few months ago,\u201d' and asked her if she had any rooms vacant; that she responded in the affirmative and he said, \u201cI am sending over a girl roomer. Would you take care of her until I see you?\u201d to which she said,\"Yes;\u201d that later on the same day Irene A. Richardson came; that during the time she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>at the house of the witness she seemed sick; that on Tuesday a man came to see the girl, and the witness said, \u201cIs this Dr. Turner?\u201d and he replied, \u201cYes. T. W. Turner \u2014 Theodore Turner.\u201d She further testified that no one else than that man saw the girl while she was at the house and that he was not the defendant and did not look like the defendant; that he was the same man who spoke with her on the telephone and whom she had seen two months before in his office in the Hotel Pelham at the corner of Boylston Street and Tremont Street, and whom she had been to in the same office about five years before; that she also had been, to the Hotel Pelham since the death of the girl with Chief Urquhart of the police department of Arlington and Captain Hurley of the police department of Cambridge and Inspector Linton of the police department of Boston, and had pointed out to them an office-which she said \u201c looked like the place,\u201d and that that office had upon, it a sign reading, \u201c Chemico Electric Company, Dr. A. W. Turner.\u201d She further testified that the Dr. Turner who called on the girl stayed only five minutes each time and that she did not know that he \u201cwas treating her as a doctor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\">In order to impeach the testimony of the witness Hansen as to-the defendant not being the Dr. Turner who called upon the girl at the house of the witness, and as to other material details, the prosecuting officer recalled to her the circumstances of interviews between her and various police officers and to her testimony at a previous trial, read from her statements made on such occasions and asked her if she had made them. She denied that she had made statements to the police officers that the man who called upon Irene A. Richardson was Dr. Augustus W. Turner. She also denied that she made others of the statements, could not remember as to others and still others attempted to explain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">The Commonwealth then called the police officers, who testified that she had told them that the Dr. Turner who called on. the girl at her house was Augustus W. Turner and that he had offices in the Hotel Pelham and on Massachusetts Avenue beyond Symphony Hall; and that she made other statements contradictory to some to which she had testified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-7\">The Commonwealth also introduced evidence tending to show that there was no physician registered with the board of registration in medicine in Massachusetts under the name of Theodore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>W. Turner or Theodore Turner; that the defendant had an office at Hotel Pelham bearing the sign, \u201c Chemico Electric Company. A. W. Turner, Manager,\u201d and also at 262 Massachusetts Avenue, bearing his name, Dr. A. W. Turner, on a sign, and that the latter office was five hundred and fifty feet from Symphony Hall; that both offices had telephones and that there had not been any T. W. or Theodore W. or Theodore Turner with an office at Hotel Pelham during the last five years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">A police officer of Boston testified that on Tuesday, January 5, \u25a0 1915, he saw the witness Hansen and the defendant talking together at the corner of Boylston Street and Massachusetts Avenue ' in Boston at about twelve o\u2019clock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-6\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the defendant asked that all the testimony of the witness Hansen relating to conversations and transactions with the physician who attended Irene A. Richardson be stricken out, and moved that a verdict of \u201cnot guilty\u201d be ordered. The motions were denied. Thereupon the defendant rested and asked for the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-7\">\u201c1. That on all the evidence a verdict of \u2018not guilty\u2019 should be ordered for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-8\">\u201c2. That on all the evidence and on the weight of the evidence a verdict of \u2018not guilty\u2019 should be ordered by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-9\">\u201c3. That on all the evidence the Commonwealth has failed to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, the identity of the defendant, Augustus W. Turner, with the man alleged to have called at the home of Mrs. Hansen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-10\">\u201c4. That all the testimony of Mrs. Marie Hansen, with reference to the conversation, transaction and actions, which occurred between her and the man who visited her flat, and whom she says she knew as T. W. Turner, be stricken from the record and that the jury be instructed that said evidence has no bearing upon this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-11\">\u201c5. That if the jury find this defendant has an office on Massachusetts avenue and another at the Hotel Pelham, they are not justified in finding on any testimony of Mrs. Hansen, that he is the man with whom she had conversation and communication at her home at Cambridge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-12\">\u201c6. That the so called \u2018dying declaration\u2019 be stricken from the records and that the jury be instructed not to consider the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>on the ground that the statement was made under the sanctity of an oath and that the statement thus loses its value under the statute..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\"><em>\u201c7. </em>That, from the testimony of the doctors in the case called \"by the government, the government has failed to prove that there was any evidence of mechanical means employed to procure an abortion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">The rulings were refused. The jury returned a verdict of guilty. The defendant then moved for a new trial, as stated in the opinion. The motion was denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-7\">The defendant alleged exceptions, and, he then being sentenced to the State prison for a term of not more than six and not less than five years, the sentence was stayed until further order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-8\"><em>J. P. Walsh &amp; C, W. Rowley, (G. F. Grimes </em>with them,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-9\"><em>A. C.

L. c. 212, \u00a7 15, the defendant with intent, to procure the miscarriage of Irene A. Richardson did unlawfully use some unlawful means with said intent, and that in consequence of the use by him of said unlawful means the said Irene A. Richardson died. A verdict of guilty having been returned, the case is here on the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the admission of evidence, the form of questions, the manner of conducting the trial, the overruling of a motion to strike out a portion of the evidence, to the refusal of his requests and to the denial of a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">While at common law dying declarations of a deceased person were confined to prosecutions for homicide, the St. of 1889, c. 100, now R. L. c. 175, \u00a7 65, makes such declarations admissible in the prosecution of the crime for which the defendant is indicted. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Lombard, </em>165 Mass. 174. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>165 Mass. 148, 152. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>159 Mass. 56. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Homer, </em>153 Mass. 343. It is, however, necessary before such declarations can be admitted that the presiding judge must be satisfied of the declarant\u2019s belief in the - certainty of approaching death, and that the statements made are material and relevant to the issue on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>164 Mass. 577. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>165 Mass. 148, 152. The preliminary inquiry made in the absence of the jury abundantly showed and the judge by admitting the evidence found that the decedent realized that all hope of recovery was gone, and the fact that she held up her right hand and repeated to one of the attending physicians \u201cI say this realizing I am about to die and this is true, so help me God,\u201d did not render her declaration that he performed the operation merely a statement under oath and hence, as the defendant contends, inadmissible as hearsay. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Woodcock, 2 </em>Leach Crown Law, 563. It is true that she made contradictory statements as to the person responsible for her pregnancy but the change of names in the accusation went to the weight and not to the competency of the evidence when submitted to the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>5 Allen, 495. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>108 Mass. 296. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>164 Mass. 577. And. her declarations, having been properly admitted, were left for the jury\u2019s consideration under full and suitable instructions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>165 Mass. 148. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>146 Mass. 571, 580, 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">This evidence, when coupled with the testimony of the doctors describing her symptoms and giving their opinion as to the cause of death and the uncontradicted evidence showing the location of the defendant\u2019s office and his name as a practicing physician which corresponded with the description given by the declarant, was sufficient unless controlled to warrant the jury in finding that the decedent died as the result of an abortion unlawfully performed by the defendant, who afterwards treated her at the house of Mrs. Hansen. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>158 Mass. 81, 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The prosecuting officer having called Mrs. Hansen as a witness, exceptions to her testimony are presented and urged in various forms. The witness was the nurse to whom the decedent declared she had been sent immediately after the operation, and in whose care she remained until removed to the hospital where she died. If believed by the jury, she received and cared for the decedent in response to a call over the telephone \u201cfrom Dr. Turner\u201d who said \u201cI am Dr. Turner that you spoke to a few months ago . . . and then he asked me if I had any rooms vacant, and I said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 He said, \u2018I am sending over a girl roomer. Would you take care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>of her until I see you?\u201d\u2019 and that while at her house he attended the decedent as a patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">It is plain that the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the admission of this evidence from which the jury, rejecting other parts of her testimony, could say that the defendant was the guilty operator, are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The issue of the defendant\u2019s identity was material, and when confronted with the defendant, the witness having denied that he was the doctor who telephoned or visited the house, the Commonwealth, after calling her attention thereto, was properly permitted to show previous contradictory or inconsistent statements made to police officers in which she stated that the defendant was the person with whom she dealt, and that at the first trial she testified that the doctor who called at the house \u201clooked like the defendant.\u201d The evidence of a police officer also tending to identify her as the woman seen talking in the street with the defendant after the operation had been performed was admissible. Whatever uncertainty in identification he may have shown on cross-examination or however limited his opportunities for observation may have been, affected the weight, but not the competency of his evidence. R. L. c. 175, \u00a7 24. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Weeks, </em>121 Mass. 433. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>207 Mass. 240, 245. The judge moreover told the jury when this evidence was offered, and later in full instructions, that such evidence although discrediting the witness was not to be considered as proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Donaldson </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>188 Mass. 484, 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The defendant also excepted to the form of very many of the questions, contending that they were leading, and that the witness, although called by the prosecuting officer, was being constantly cross-examined in accordance with his opening to the jury, that \u201cwe will call the nurse and put her on the stand in the course of the trial\u201d and the \u201cgovernment anticipates difficulty in getting the truth from this woman.\u201d The record however fails to show that any exception was taken to the opening and, the judge having cautioned the jury that anything then said could have no effect as evidence and should be disregarded, it must be assumed that his instructions were followed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Poisson, </em>157 Mass. 510, 512, 513. It is settled that the extent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>which a party should be permitted to cross-examine or lead his own witness must be left very largely to the sound discretion of the presiding judge. <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Rooney, </em>183 Mass. 577, 579, and cases cited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>188 Mass. 382, 385, 386, and cases cited. And we cannot say that the judge\u2019s discretion appears to have been so exercised as manifestly to have prejudiced the defendant, although if he had been more stringent no-ground for criticism could have been justly suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The jury furthermore were instructed to disregard Mrs. Hansen\u2019s entire evidence unless they were satisfied of the defendant\u2019s identity beyond reasonable doubt, and for reasons-previously stated the defendant\u2019s motion to have all her evidence-stricken out and withdrawn from the jury could not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The motion that a verdict be ordered for the defendant the-judge also rightly denied. If the jury, who alone were to pass upon the question, accepted the dying statements of the declarant, whose evidence, she not being an accomplice, needed no-corroboration, there was evidence as we have said for their consideration that the defendant performed the operation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Follansbee, </em>155 Mass. 274, 277. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hollis, </em>170 Mass. 433, 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The requests for rulings were refused properly. The first, second, third, fourth, sixth and seventh rulings requested require no comment as they are covered by the discussion of the admissibility of the evidence. The fifth called for instructions on a portion only of the evidence which the judge was not required to give. <em>Towne </em>v. <em>Fiske, </em>127 Mass. 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">A new trial having been moved for, it was for the judge to determine whether it should be granted on the alleged ground that the testimony of Mrs. Hansen, the Commonwealth\u2019s witness, after the prosecuting officer with knowledge of her testimony at the former trial had stated to the jury in his opening \u201cthat the government anticipates difficulty in getting the truth from this woman,\u201d was improperly admitted, and because after calling her he had argued to the jury in closing, \u201cthat she was an abortionist nurse.\u201d <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Magoun, </em>18 Pick. 13, 15. Nor can the decision denying the motion be reviewed on exceptions. <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>210 Mass. 487, 495, 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>We have considered all of the voluminous exceptions and, not being able to discover any material error of law, the order must be</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
