In redirect examination, subject to an exception of the defendant \"to both the form and the substance,\u201d he was asked \u201cwhether or not you would have parted with your money or drawn this check to Carver if he had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>made the representations to you that Kennedy was good, that Reycroft was good, that Logue was good, and that it was a perfectly good note?\u201d He answered \u201cI would not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-5\">Other material evidence is described in the opinion.

Thereafter the defendant appealed from the sentence, and his exceptions then were allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-8\"><em>J. C.

He was found guilty on both indictments, but no sentence was imposed on the one which charged forgery and uttering. The-reason for this presumably is that stated in the defendant\u2019s appeal, namely, that this case was placed on file. As questions of law arising in the trial of the forgery charge have not been reported under R. L. c. 219, \u00a7 34, and no sentence has been imposed and stayed under R. L. c. 220, \u00a7 3, the exceptions taken in that case are not properly before us. There has been merely a suspension of active proceedings in the case, and as yet no final disposition. Unless and until the prosecuting attorney shall move for sentence-there is no occasion to pass upon the conduct of the forgery trial.. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dowdican\u2019s Bail, </em>115 Mass. 133; <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>199 Mass. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">The judge rightly refused to direct a verdict of not guilty on the larceny indictment. Larceny, as defined by our statutes, includes the obtaining of personal property by criminal, false<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>pretences. R. L. c. 208, \u00a7 26; c. 218, \u00a7 38. St. 1910, c. 378, \u00a7 2. There was evidence for the jury that the defendant obtained the money of Slessinger by false statements as to the good standing of the alleged maker and indorsers of the note, and by his simulation of their handwriting: and Slessinger testified that he would not have parted with his money but for those misrepresentations. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>115 Mass. 481. <em>Dexter </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>217 Mass. 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">As to the exceptions to evidence: The question as to Slessinger\u2019s reliance upon the false representations was material in substance, and its leading form was allowable in the discretion of the presiding judge. <em>Comstock </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>210 Mass. 581. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>190 Mass. 184. The testimony of Logue, that the indorsement \u201cJoseph P. Logue\u201d looked like his handwriting, plainly was competent on the forgery indictment. And in view of the defendant\u2019s contention that he was authorized to use the names of these parties on notes, the evidence that he sought to imitate their handwriting, which was indicative of guilt, was relevant to show intent to defraud in the larceny case. The witness could be found competent to express an opinion as to whether the signature was his own or an imitation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sturtivant, </em>117 Mass. 122, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The appeal calls for little beyond what already has been said. The indictment was in accordance with the form prescribed by the statute R. L. c. 218, \u00a7 67. It charged but a single offence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>165 Mass. 526. Even if the defendant had a right to have the larceny and forgery cases tried separately, (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>211 Mass. 50,) he waived that right, and preferred to have them tried together.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled. Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
