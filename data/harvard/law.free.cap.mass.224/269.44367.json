Vacca, the brother of Ralph and the father of Michael, were travelling with Pia Vacca, the wife of John.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The jury upon conflicting evidence having found for the plaintiffs against all the defendants, the case is before us on the exceptions of John S. Vacca, who contends there was no evidence which warranted a verdict against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We shall refer to him as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">. If he was an occupant of the car as the guest of his brother and the accident was due to the negligence of the driver over whom the defendant exercised no direction or control, his request that a verdict be ordered in his favor should have been given. <em>Shultz </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>193 Mass. 309. But the unlicensed driver who operated the car at the time of the accident was the defendant\u2019s son and the jury further could find that he was \u201clearning to drive the car\u201d and that with knowledge of his inexperience and shortly before the accident as the car was approaching the plaintiffs\u2019 team in the rear, the defendant said: \u201cLook out and keep to the right\u201d and to \u201clook out for the plaintiffs\u2019 team because the team was in the middle of the road,\u201d and that the driver \u201cwas trying to get on the left;\u201d and that these directions were intended to control or influence the conduct of the driver in properly operating the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">If the owner of the car also gave directions to the driver, yet the jury upon all the evidence further could find that the defendant and his relatives were engaged on an excursion for their mutual enjoyment and that in common with his brother he participated in the active management of the car. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>172 Mass. 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">It is not contended that there was no evidence of the negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>of the driver and the question of the defendant\u2019s liability was properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b299-6\"><em>T.
