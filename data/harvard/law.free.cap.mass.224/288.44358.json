Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated July 26, 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-5\">The case was presented to a judge of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston upon an agreed statement of facts, the substance of which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">The lease above mentioned was made and dated on August 1, 1913, between the defendant and the trustee of the Associated Trust. The description of the term of the lease is quoted in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\">The defendant entered under the lease and paid rent thereunder at the rate of $28.50 a month in advance to the trustee of the Associated Trust, to and including June 30, 1914. On December 1, 1913, the trustee of the Associated Trust gave to the Cambridge Realty Company a mortgage of the Whittier apartments in which the suite was. The mortgage was in the usual form of real estate mortgages and contained the provision that \"until default in the performance or observance of the condition of this deed, I and my heirs and assigns may hold and enjoy the granted premises and receive the rents and profits thereof.\u201d On or about June 24, 1914, the Cambridge Realty Company as mortgagee entered upon the Whittier apartments and took possession thereof for breach of the conditions in the mortgage, and on the same day the defendant received a notice from the Cambridge Realty Company that thereafter \"your rent will be payable to us, at the same rate which you are now paying.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-8\">On July 1, 1914, the defendant received from the Associated Trust the following notice: \u201cWe hereby authorize you to pay all rent due beginning July 1st to the Cambridge Realty Company, in accordance with a transaction which we have with them, which is only temporary.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-9\">After the receipt of these notices, the defendant paid $28.50 a month in advance for occupation of suite 16, to the Cambridge Realty Company, for the months of July, August, September, October, November and December, 1914.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-10\">On August 27, 1914, the plaintiff in this action was appointed receiver of the Associated Trust by decree of the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts, directing him as receiver among other things to take possession of all properties of the Associated Trust and to collect the income thereof, and ordering all persons owing money to the Associated Trust to pay it to the receiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-5\">The Cambridge Realty Company surrendered possession of the Whittier Apartments to the receiver as of January 1, 1915, and some time in December, 1914, the superintendent of the Whittier Apartments notified the defendant orally that the Cambridge Realty Company had surrendered possession of the estate to the receiver and that he should pay the receiver thereafter for the occupation of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">Thereafter the defendant paid to the plaintiff $28.50 a month on the first day of each month from January 1, 1915, to March 1, 1915, for suite 16 for the months of January, February and March.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-7\">On February 26, 1915, the defendant delivered to the plaintiff as receiver a letter or notice as follows: \u201cYou are hereby notified that I shall on the 31st day of March next quit and deliver up the premises now occupied by me as your tenant, namely Suite 16 in the Whittier Apartments, 885 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Mass.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-8\">The plaintiff on February 27, 1915, replied to the foregoing letter or notice as follows: \u201cI cannot accept this notice. Your tenancy is under a lease which does not terminate until August 31, 1915. I shall be obliged to hold you responsible for the rent until that date.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-9\">On March 11, 1915, the defendant vacated suite 16 and moved to another building.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-10\">On May 20, 1915, the trustees of the Associated Trust, acting under permission given by the District Court, conveyed the estate 885 Massachusetts Avenue, \u201csubject to said mortgage and to all existing leases upon said premises,\u201d to the Whittier Realty Company, a Massachusetts corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-11\">The defendant before the arguments asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-12\">\u201c1. Upon all the evidence in the case as a matter of law the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-13\">\u201c2. The Cambridge Realty Company after taking possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>as mortgagee on July 1,1914, was entitled to rent from the defendant by privity of estate only, and not by privity of contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-5\">\u201c 3. The Cambridge Realty Company was not an assignee of the lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">\u201c4. The Associated Trust in assenting to payments by the defendant to the Cambridge Realty Company as mortgagee by letter dated July 1,1914, in effect gave notice to the defendant that the contract of lease was at an end.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-7\">The judge refused to make the first and fourth rulings requested, but made the second and third.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-8\">The judge found for the plaintiff in the sum of $59, and at the request of the defendant reported the case to the Appellate Division.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-9\">The Appellate Division made an order that the report be dismissed; and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-10\"><em>W. R. Bigelow, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-11\">S. <em>Vaughan, </em>(J. <em>Noble </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b319-12\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akg\">The lease having described the term as \u201cOne year from the first day of September one thousand nine hundred and thirteen to August 31st, one thousand nine hundred and fourteen and thereafter from year to year until one of the parties hereto shall, on or before the first day of July in any year, give to the other party written notice of his or her intention 'to terminate this lease on the last day of the following August, in which case the term hereby created shall terminate in accordance with such notice,\u201d it could not be ended by either the lessor or the lessee except in accordance with these provisions or by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">The subsequent mortgage of the leased premises undoubtedly operated as an assignment of the lease. <em>Burden </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>3 Met. 76. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>2 Allen, 42, 43. And the mortgagee, having entered and having given notice to the tenant, thereafter was entitled to all accruing rent. <em>Mirick </em>v. <em>Hoppin, </em>118 Mass. 582, 587. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>128 Mass. 365, 366. But, as the mortgagee never terminated the lease, it remained in full force and effect at the time possession of the premises was surrendered to the plaintiff as receiver of the lessor. The defendant having continued in occupation and there being no evidence that the required notice has been given, the fourth request was refused properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">The first request, that upon all the evidence the plaintiff as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>matter of law cannot recover, is also disposed of by what has been said, except as to the defendant\u2019s contention that the action cam not be maintained by the receiver in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">It is plain that he is not an assignee of the lease and the action should have been brought in the name of the lessor. <em>Wilson </em>v. Welch, 157 Mass. 77, 80, 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The merits having however been fully determined, the plaintiff is given leave to amend; and upon the filing of the amendment the order dismissing the report is affirmed. St. 1913, c. 716, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\n<em>So ordered:</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
