The district court imposed a sentence of 16 months of imprisonment, which was at the high end of Esparza\u2019s correctly calculated guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-21\">For the first time on appeal, Esparza contends that illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not supported by empirical evidence and that his sentence is therefore not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. We have squarely rejected the proposition that an appellate presumption of reasonableness does not apply to guidelines sentences under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.2009). Espar-za\u2019s sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-22\">Esparza also contends that his 16-month sentence of imprisonment is greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 and, therefore, is substantively unreasonable. Esparza, noting that his prior illegal reentry conviction was used to both increase his offense level and his criminal history category, argues that his criminal history was overstated. He asserts that the sentence did not properly reflect his benign motive for returning to the United States and that the sentence did not take into account the support of his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>We consider Esparza\u2019s argument as to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). As noted above, Es-parza\u2019s sentence, which was imposed within a properly calculated guideline range, is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554. After reviewing the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, we hold that Esparza\u2019s appellate arguments fail to establish that his sentence was unreasonable. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1010-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
