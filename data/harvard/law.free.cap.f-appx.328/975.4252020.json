The IJ denied Sabit\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and ordered his removal to Chad or, in the alternative, to Cameroon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-21\">Sabit is subject to deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), because he has two convictions for crimes of moral turpitude. Nevertheless, our jurisdiction is not limited by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C): Sa-bit\u2019s convictions are misdemeanor offenses not \u201cotherwise covered by\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-22\">Sabit does not address the BIA\u2019s rejection of his claims for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. Accordingly, he has waived those issues. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-23\">Concerning the remaining claim, our court will uphold the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum unless Sabit shows that its action was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. <em>See Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994). A petitioner must show that he presented evidence \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>478, 484, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). Sabit\u2019s petition for review does not present the requisite detailed facts establishing he has a reasonable fear he will be singled out for persecution if he is returned to Chad; therefore, he has failed to show that the denial of asylum was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. <em>See Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Jukic, </em>40 F.3d at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1009-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Crit R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
