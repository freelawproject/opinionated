The BIA determined, inter alia, that the motion to reopen was filed almost six years after the BIA\u2019s dismissal of their appeal and the motion was therefore untimely. The Petitioners argue that the delay in filing their motion was attributable to ineffective assistance of counsel and the time limit for filing such a motion should therefore be equitably tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-22\">Subject to certain exceptions that are inapplicable here, a motion to reopen removal proceedings \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The only authority for reopening the Petitioners\u2019 removal proceeding was the BIA\u2019s sua sponte au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>thority to reopen the case pursuant to \u00a7 1003.2(a). <em>See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 1003.2(a), the BIA has complete discretion to deny untimely motions to reopen. <em>See id. </em>This court lacks jurisdiction to review such decisions and therefore lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision in the instant proceeding. <em>See id. </em>at 220; <em>Enriquez-Alvarado v.
