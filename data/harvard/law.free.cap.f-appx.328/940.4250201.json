In his suit for damages, he asserts that the defendants conspired to obtain his conviction illegally and to thwart his appeal by falsifying and altering documents and trial transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-20\">Powell contends that his suit is not barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because officers of the court committed the criminal act of conspiracy, and the charges against him were unfounded. As the district court found, however, Powell\u2019s claims are barred by <em>Heck, </em>because he is seeking to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction that has not been reversed on appeal or in a post-conviction proceeding. <em>See id. </em>at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b975-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
