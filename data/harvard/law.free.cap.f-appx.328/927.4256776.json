Alvarado petitions this court for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019s (BIA\u2019s) summary dismissal of his appeal. Alvarado fails to address the BIA\u2019s reasons for the summary dismissal, specifically the BIA\u2019s conclusions that his notice of appeal failed to \u201cmeaningfully apprise the Board of the specific reasons underlying the challenge to the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision,\u201d that his brief was untimely, and that he failed to \u201creasonably explain\u201d his failure to file a timely brief. Accordingly, any arguments relating to the BIA\u2019s summary dismissal of his appeal are abandoned. <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">Further, because Alvarado failed to exhaust his claims by presenting them to the BIA, we are without jurisdiction to review the claims. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Toledo-Hernandez v. Mukasey, </em>521 F.3d 332, 336 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Townsend v. INS, </em>799 F.2d 179, 181-82 (5th Cir.1986) (conclusional statements in the notice of appeal did not preserve claim for the BIA\u2019s review).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-15\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b962-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
