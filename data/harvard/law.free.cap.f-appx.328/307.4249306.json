De La Garza argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to permit counsel to argue for an appropriate sentence and failed to provide sufficient reasons. He also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). He further contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) (2006) is flawed as it was not based on empirical data.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-24\">De La Garza did not preserve these objections in the district court. Review is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>therefore for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). De La Garza \u201cmust demonstrate (1) error, (2) that is clear or obvious, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. \u201cIf these conditions are met, this court may exercise its discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The district court provided defense counsel ample opportunity to address the arguments that counsel deemed appropriate. Also, the formalistic procedure suggested by De La Garza\u2019s arguments is not prescribed by the authorities upon which De La Garza relies. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(4)(A)(i); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); and <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596. Additionally, nothing in the record indicates that De La Garza\u2019s sentence would have been different if the court had provided more explanation of its chosen sentence. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 363-64. De La Garza\u2019s argument that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable thus does not provide a basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">De La Garza\u2019s argument regarding <em>Gall </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>does not establish that his sentence is substantively unreasonable, as the record does not suggest that the district court wished to impose a different sentence but felt constrained by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338-39. Finally, this court has rejected De La Garza\u2019s argument that \u00a7 2L1.2 is flawed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
