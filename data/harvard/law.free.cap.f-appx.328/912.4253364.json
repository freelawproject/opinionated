The district court may grant a reduction if consistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Section 3582(c)(2) applies only to retroactive guidelines amendments, as set forth in the guidelines policy statement. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 lB1.10(a); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28-29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Kliffmueller contends that he is entitled to have his sentence reduced in light of Amendment 709 to the Sentencing Guidelines. He argues that Amendment 709 modified U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, and, thus, that he is entitled to have his criminal history score recalculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">Unless an amendment is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), a reduction based on the amendment under \u00a7 3582(c) is not consistent with the policy statement of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). Amendment 709 is not listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) (May 2008). Therefore, under the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c), a district court is not autlwxrized to reduce a sentence based on Amendment 709 because that would be inconsistent with Sentencing Commission policy. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). Insofar as Kliff-mueller contends that Amendment 709 is a clarifying amendment that should be applied retroactively even though it is not listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), this court has held that, except on direct appeal, a clarifying amendment is not retroactively applied unless the amendment is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Kliffmueller argues for the first time on appeal that he was eligible for relief under the version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) that was in effect at the time of his sentencing. He also argues that the district court did not correctly assess the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing his original sentence and that it incorrectly calculated his criminal history. He contends that his counsel failed to raise the issue, and the district court did not consider this pertinent factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">Kliffmueller did not raise these claims in the district court. Thus, plain error review governs these newly raised issues. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). Kliffmueller cannot rely on \u00a7 3582(c) as a procedural vehicle to obtain a recalculation of his sentencing guidelines range or a redetermination of the reasonableness of his initial sentence in this instance because he is not relying on a retroactively applicable amendment to the Guidelines in making this argument. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a); <em>Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">Kliffmueller has not demonstrated that he has any evidence that he could present at an evidentiary hearing to show that he is entitled to relief under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). His request for an evidentia-ry hearing is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">In view of the foregoing, the district court did not abuse its discretion or plainly err in denying Kliffmueller\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>See Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 28; <em>United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b946-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
