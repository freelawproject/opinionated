On July 11, 1989, the IJ granted Doreantes-Quinonez voluntary departure, requiring him to leave the country by August 11, 1989. The IJ\u2019s order was based upon a stipulation, which was signed by Do-reantes-Quinonez and submitted by his counsel, conceding Doreantes-Quinonez\u2019s deportability and requesting voluntary departure. On November 24, 2006, represented by new counsel, Doreantes-Qui-nonez filed a motion to reopen his proceedings in order to seek relief under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (NACARA). Doreantes-Quinonez argued in his motion to reopen that the final order was issued in absentia and that he had been unaware until recently that he had been granted voluntary departure in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">To the extent that Doreantes-Qui-nonez\u2019s motion to reopen was filed under NACARA, he failed to meet the September 11, 1998, filing deadline. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.43(e)(1). Because the untimeliness of that motion constitutes a failure to exhaust his administrative remedies, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the denial of the motion to reopen on that basis. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 248 (5th Cir.2004). Doreantes-Quinonez\u2019s petition for review is dismissed in part on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">In his motion to reopen, Do-reantes-Quinonez also invoked 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(h), which permits an alien to file at any time a motion to reopen challenging an in absentia removal order if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive sufficient notice of the proceeding. Because Doreantes-Quinonez was in deportation proceedings, rather than removal proceedings, the applicable regulation is 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(2), which contains an analogous exception. The IJ determined that Doreantes-Quinonez\u2019s deportation hearing was not conducted in absentia and that, even if it had been conducted in absentia, the law governing motions to reopen for NACARA relief did not contain a filing-deadline exception for in absentia hearings. Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, this court may review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 348 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">To the extent that Doreantes-Qui-nonez argues in this petition that his first counsel\u2019s representation of him ended at some point during his deportation proceedings, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider that argument because Doreantes-Qui-nonez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies regarding that argument by raising it before the BIA. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001). Our review of the relevant laws and regulations relating to whether Doreantes-Qui-nonez\u2019s deportation hearing was conducted in absentia and whether a motion to reopen seeking NACARA relief may qualify for the filing-deadline exception set forth in \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(2) indicates that the IJ\u2019s interpretations as to both issues were reasonable and are therefore entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>to deference. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006). Based upon that deference, Doreantes-Quinonez\u2019s petition for review is denied in part to the extent he sought relief under \u00a7 1003.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
