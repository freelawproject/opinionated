HLP/GAC International, Inc. (\u201cHLP\u201d) responded and also filed motions to dismiss the appeal and for fees under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction and therefore GRANT the motion to dismiss PICC\u2019s appeal. We DENY the motion for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Wachovia Bank, N.A., sued HLP/GAC International, Inc. (\u201cHLP\u201d), in the 55th Judicial Court of Harris County, Texas. HLP later sued PICC in a third-party action in the same court. PICC subsequently removed the suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, on the basis that diversity jurisdiction existed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. HLP did not seek remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">In July 2008, over a year after removal, the district court issued an order <em>sua sponte </em>raising the issue of the propriety of its removal jurisdiction and requesting that PICC brief the issue of \u201cwhether [the district court] ha[d] subject matter jurisdiction over the third-party action,\u201d specifically, whether a third-party defendant could remove a third-party action under \u00a7 1441 on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. After receiving briefing from the parties, the district court ruled on August 13, 2008, that \u201c[u]pon review and consideration of the aforementioned documents and the relevant legal authority, and for the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the instant case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">The reasons then set forth by the district court solely focused on whether a third-party defendant is a \u201cdefendant\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1441(a). After thoughtfully analyzing \u00a7 1441(a) and various cases interpreting that provision, the court concluded that third-party defendants are not entitled to remove under \u00a7 1441(a), following the majority of courts that have addressed the issue. The district court concluded its order by again stating that it found that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking and that the suit was therefore remanded to the state court where it was originally filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">PICC appealed. HLP moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction and moved for fees pursuant to Rule 38. The motions were carried with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">In 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), Congress provided that: \u201cAn order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not renewable on appeal or otherwise.\u201d Although this language is broad, \u201cthe Supreme Court has explained that this provision is to be interpreted <em>in pari materia </em>with \u00a7 1447(c), such that only remand orders issued under \u00a7 1447(c) and \u2018invoking the grounds specified therein\u2019 are immune from review.\u201d <em>Heaton v. Monogram Credit Card Bank of Ga., </em>231 F.3d 994, 997 (5th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Thermtron Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 345-46, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976), abrogated on other grounds by <em>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>517 U.S. 706, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996)). Under \u00a7 1447(c), a case may be remanded upon a motion made within thirty days after the filing of the notice of removal \u201con the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d However, \u00a7 1447(c) goes on to require that \u201c[i]f at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">It is well-established that \u201c[a] \u00a7 1447(c) remand is not reviewable on appeal even if the district court\u2019s remand order was erroneous.\u201d <em>Heaton, </em>231 F.3d at 997; <em>Thermtron, </em>423 U.S. at 343, 96 S.Ct. 584. This is true \u201ceven if a court employs erroneous principles in concluding that it is without jurisdiction under \u00a7 1447(c),\u201d not merely if the court employs the correct reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>and reaches an erroneous outcome. <em>Smith v. Texas Children\u2019s Hosp., </em>172 F.3d 923, 925 (5th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Gravitt v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>430 U.S. 723, 723-24, 97 S.Ct. 1439, 52 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">HPL argues that this appeal must be dismissed because the remand order states that the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and we need not look further. PICC argues that this court has appellate jurisdiction because the district court\u2019s conclusion that a third-party defendant is not a \u201cdefendant\u201d for \u00a7 1441(a) purposes, and therefore cannot remove an unsevered third-party action, was a procedural defect that was waived when HLP did not raise it within thirty days, not a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">A plain reading of Judge Harmon\u2019s remand order makes clear that \u00a7 1447(c) was the basis for remanding this case. The court specifically concludes, and reiterates at the end of the order, that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action. Contrary to PICC\u2019s assertion, the district court did not \u201cclearly stat[e]\u201d that \u201cremand was based on a defect in the removal procedure.\u201d Rather, the district court held that the removal defect \u2014 that third-party defendants are not \u201cdefendants\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 1441(a) \u2014 deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction. PICC takes issue \u2022with the determination that the identified defect is one of subject matter jurisdiction, rather than a waivable procedural error. That is certainly a plausible argument,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but it does not affect our analysis. Even if the district court erred in perceiving \u00a7 1441(a) to be an issue of subject matter jurisdiction rather than a procedural defect, it does not mean that the instant remand order is appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">PICC further argues that the district court\u2019s statement that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction was a \u201cmere incantation\u201d that does not immunize an improper remand that PICC asserts was only based on a defect in the removal procedure, relying on <em>In re Digicon Marine, Inc., </em>966 F.2d 158, 160 (5th Cir.1992). That reliance is misplaced. In <em>Digicon Marine, </em>the district court\u2019s original remand order \u201cclearly indicate [d] on its face that the remand was not based upon lack of original subject matter jurisdiction but on the lack of authority to remove a maritime case ... [,]\u201d and only in its order denying reconsideration did the district court describe the remand as based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Digicon Marine, </em>966 F.2d at 160. We have previously rejected similar arguments that we should look beyond the language of the remand order\u2019s stated \u00a7 1447(c) reason for remand and determine the \u201creal\u201d basis for the district court\u2019s order. <em>See Heaton, </em>231 F.3d at 998; <em>Smith, </em>172 F.3d at 926-27. In <em>Hea-ton, </em>we rejected an argument based on <em>Digicon Marine </em>similar to that made by PICC, concluding that \u201c[j]ust as in <em>Digicon Marine, </em>in this case we need only look to the face of the remand order to determine [the district court\u2019s] reasons for remanding.\u201d <em>Heaton, </em>231 F.3d at 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Rejecting the argument that we should determine the \u201ctrue\u201d basis for a district court\u2019s remand order, this court examined <em>Bogle v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>and noted that court looked only at the face of the remand order. <em>Heaton, </em>231 F.3d at 998 (discussing <em>Bogle, </em>24 F.3d 758, 762 (5th Cir.1994)). The <em>Bogle </em>court stated: \u201cThe magic words \u2018this case does not contain a federal claim\u2019 rendered the district court\u2019s remand order unreviewable.\u201d 24 F.3d at 762. Here, as in <em>Heaton, </em>the district court identified a lack of subject matter jurisdiction as the basis for remand, and \u201cfw]e cannot read the remand order to say that the court \u2018clearly and affirmatively\u2019 relied on a non-\u00a7 1447(c) basis as required ...\u201d to make the order appealable. <em>Heaton, </em>231 F.3d at 999. \u201cInstead, we will only review remand orders if the district court affirmatively states a non-\u00a7 1447(c) ground for remand.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>172 F.3d at 927 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Because the district court\u2019s remand order was based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, it was a \u00a7 1447(c) remand, and therefore it is unappealable under \u00a7 1447(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the motion to dismiss this appeal is GRANTED, and the motion for fees is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b980-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b982-6\">. In this Circuit, any objection to removal that does not involve whether the action could have originally been brought in federal district court is a procedural error that may be waived by a litigant's failure to object to removal within the 30-day period provided in \u00a7 1447(c), rather than a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Williams v. AC Spark Plugs Div. of Gen. Motors Corp., </em>985 F.2d 783, 787 (5th Cir.1993); <em>but see First Nat\u2019l Bank of Pulaski v. Curry, </em>301 F.3d 456, 461, 467 (6th Cir.2002) (holding third-party defendant did not have the power to remove under \u00a7 1441 and that, as a result, the district court never had subject matter jurisdiction).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
