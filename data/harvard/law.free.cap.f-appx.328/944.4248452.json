They alleged racial discrimination by the City of Dallas in the provision of municipal services, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, 2000d, and 3604, and 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.65. The parties resolved these claims after the city agreed, contingent upon arranging financing, to offer to purchase Plaintiff-Appellants\u2019 homes. Plaintiff-Appellants subsequently filed a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1988 and 3613, arguing they were prevailing parties entitled to such an award. The district court denied the motion, stating that it had not lent its judicial imprimatur to the settlement of the claims. Plaintiff-Appellants appealed. The characterization of prevailing-party status is a legal question subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Bailey v. Mississippi, </em>407 F.3d 684, 687 (5th Cir.2005). For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-15\">Sections 1988(b) and 3613(c)(2) allow a court, in its discretion, to award attorneys\u2019 fees to a prevailing party. To be a prevailing party, \u201ca plaintiff must (1) obtain actual relief, such as an enforceable judgment or consent decree; (2) that materially alters the legal relationship between the parties; and (3) modifies the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff at the time of the judgment or settlement.\u201d <em>Dearmore v. City of Garland, </em>519 F.3d 517, 521 (5th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Energy Mgmt. Corp. v. City of Shreveport, </em>467 F.3d 471, 482 (5th Cir.2006)). The first element is crucial; it is not enough to bring about \u201ca defendant\u2019s voluntary change in conduct in response to the plaintiffs lawsuit and not a court order.\u201d 519 F.3d at 521. Rather, in order for the plaintiff to be a prevailing party, the court must lend its \u201cjudicial <em>imprima</em>tur\u201d to a resolution of the dispute favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>Judgments on the merits and settlement agreements enforced through a consent decree possess the necessary judicial imprimatur. <em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, </em>Inc. <em>v. </em>W. <em>Va. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Res., </em>532 U.S. 598, 604, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001); <em>Dearmore, </em>519 F.3d at 521. Private settlements ordinarily do not, because they lack judicial approval and oversight. <em>Buckhannon, </em>532 U.S. at 604 n. 7, 121 S.Ct. 1835.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-16\">Plaintiff-Appellants\u2019 private settlement with the city did not entail the requisite judicial approval and oversight to obtain prevailing-party status. They point to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>district court\u2019s participation in a telephone conference that resulted in settlement, but this was not enough. The district court did not review or evaluate the specific home purchase proposals or the merits of the underlying litigation during the telephone conference. It simply facilitated negotiation and made removal of the case from the trial docket contingent on the progress of the settlement. The terms by which the parties resolved the dispute were not incorporated into any order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The district court\u2019s ruling is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b979-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
