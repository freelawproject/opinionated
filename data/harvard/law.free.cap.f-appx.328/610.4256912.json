The government concedes. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand with instructions to reinstate the original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-17\">Jackson pled guilty to bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e). On March 20, 2007, the district court sentenced Jackson to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Believing that Jackson ah'eady had served time on the bank robbery charge, the district court ordered that Jackson receive credit for time served. Thereafter, the Bureau of Prisons informed the district court that it could not give Jackson credit for time served because he had not been arrested on the bank robbery charge, but, rather, on an unrelated charge. On September 18, 2008, the district court amended the judgment to remove the credit order. Jackson timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-19\">Whether the district court has jurisdiction to amend a defendant\u2019s sentence is a legal question subject to plenary review. <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir.2002). Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), the district court may amend a sentence if expressly permitted by statute or by Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 or if the sentence was based on a guideline imprisonment range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. We have interpreted \u00a7 3582(c) to mean that a district court lacks the \u201cinherent power\u201d to amend what it views as an illegal sentence. <em>Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1315. Rather, a district court is limited to applying Rule 35. <em>Id. </em>at 1315-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-20\">Pursuant to Rule 35(a), the district court may amend a sentence \u201cthat resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error\u201d within seven days after sentencing. Rule 35(a)\u2019s seven-day deadline for amending a sentence is a jurisdictional restriction. <em>Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1317 (addressing the identical restriction under former Rule 35(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-21\">The district court lacked jurisdiction to amend Jackson\u2019s sentence, at 1315-17. The only provision under which the district court might have amended Jackson\u2019s sentence was Rule 35(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c); <em>Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1315-16. However, Rule 35(a)\u2019s seven-day jurisdictional restriction had long passed. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c); <em>Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1317. Accordingly, we vacate Jackson\u2019s amended sentence and remand to the district court with instructions to reinstate the original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
