The Federal Public Defender appointed to represent Jenkins on appeal moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel noted in his <em>Anders </em>brief, that Jenkins filed an untimely notice of appeal. Counsel\u2019s motion was denied, and briefing was ordered on whether this court\u2019s reasoning in <em>United States v. Acquaye, </em>452 F.3d 380, 382 (5th Cir.2006), should be extended to apply to direct criminal appeals involving untimely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">Jenkins complied with this court\u2019s order and filed a brief on the issue. Jenkins contends that this court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Ac-quaye </em>should be extended. He asserts that the Government should be deemed to have forfeited the right to rely on the claim processing time limits for the filing of a notice of appeal once a notice has been filed and transcripts have been prepared. The Government has filed a brief arguing that as long as it invokes the claim processing rule time limits for filing a notice of appeal before this court addresses the merits of the appeal, the invocation should be considered timely. The Government has also filed a motion to dismiss Jenkins\u2019s appeal on the basis that he failed to file a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">In <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 388-89 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 728, 169 L.Ed.2d 568 (2007), this court determined that, because the 10-day time limit to file a notice of appeal in Rule 4(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure is not statutorily imposed, the time limit is \u201cnot jurisdictional and [can] be waived.\u201d In the instant case, the Government did not forfeit or waive its objection to Jenkins\u2019s untimely notice of appeal. <em>See United States v. Sealed Appellant, </em>304 Fed.Appx. 282, 284 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b950-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
