We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">While Hoffart\u2019s complaint is sketchy, we can discern that he contends that he and Louise Hoffart were victimized by Hal Wiggins and others in violation of Oregon statutes. He complained to the Oregon authorities, but Wipper declined to prosecute for various reasons Hoffart contends are false. He contends that Wipper\u2019s declination to prosecute and alleged false statements she made, as well as her refusal to respond to further inquiries from Hoffart, constitute a further victimization of the Hoffarts in violation of Oregon law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">It is unclear why this action was brought in the Eastern District of Texas, and the Oregon Prosecutors challenged personal jurisdiction and venue. They also claimed absolute prosecutorial immunity. The district court dismissed the case and certified its judgment as a final judgment as to the Oregon Prosecutors under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">We need not reach the questions of personal jurisdiction and venue because we agree that Hoffart\u2019s claims \u2014 all stemming from the discretionary decision not to prosecute \u2014 are barred by absolute prose-cutorial immunity under both federal and Oregon law. <em>Van de Kamp v. Goldstein, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 855, 172 L.Ed.2d 706 (2009); <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 431, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976); Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 30.265(3)(c); <em>Tennyson v. Children\u2019s Servs. Div., </em>308 Or. 80, 775 P.2d 1365 (1989). We also agree that the motion to disqualify the Oregon Attorney General as counsel in the district court was mooted by its dismissal of the case against these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-15\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1007-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
