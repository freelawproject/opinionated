Harris argues that the government failed to prove that he knowingly possessed the firearm. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a judgment of acquittal. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>473 F.3d 1115, 1118 (11th Cir.2006). To establish that a person is a felon in possession of a firearm, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was a convicted felon who knowingly possessed a firearm and that the firearm affected interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Glover, </em>431 F.3d 744, 748 (11th Cir.2005). The possession may be constructive, in which case the government must prove the defendant exercised either \u201c \u2018ownership, dominion, or control\u2019 over the firearm.\u201d <em>United States v. Molina, </em>443 F.3d 824, 829 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Ferg, </em>504 F.2d 914, 916 (5th Cir.1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-17\">The district court did not err by denying Harris\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. Harris admitted to the arresting officers that he knew a firearm was in the car and he had attempted to conceal the firearm behind the passenger seat. Harris\u2019s statement established that he knowingly possessed the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-18\">Harris\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
