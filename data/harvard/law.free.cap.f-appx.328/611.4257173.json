After granting appellees summary judgment, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s whis-tleblower claim under state law and accordingly dismissed it without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-20\">Appellant now appeals, contending that the district court erred in several respects in granting summary judgment. She also contends that the court should have re-cused. We agree with the district court, for the reasons stated in its February 12, 2009 order granting summary judgment, that appellant\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims of retaliation are meritless. As for appellant\u2019s recusal argument, we note that appellant did not move the district court to recuse while the case was pending before the court. She therefore asks, in effect, that we conclude that the court\u2019s refusal to recuse <em>sua sponte </em>amounted to plain error. We decline her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-21\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b645-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
