Kuemo contests the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and claims she established past persecution on account of her membership in a particular social group. Accordingly, Kuemo contends the BIA\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-16\">Factual findings that an alien is ineligible for asylum are reviewed only to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Gomez-Mejia v. INS, </em>56 F.3d 700, 702 (5th Cir.1995). Along this line, \u201cwe must defer to the BIA\u2019s factual findings unless the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find otherwise\u201d. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 304 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-17\">The IJ\u2019s finding Kuemo\u2019s testimony not credible is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Vidal v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 250, 254 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, Kuemo\u2019s contentions do not compel this court to substitute its judgment for that of the IJ. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cWe cannot substitute our judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to the credibility of the witnesses or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations.\u201d); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii) (specifying criteria allowing petitioner\u2019s credible testimony to constitute sole support for asylum-eligibility). Because the IJ\u2019s finding Kuemo\u2019s testimony not credible is a sufficient ground for affirming the BIA\u2019s decision, we need not reach the alternative ruling that Kuemo failed to meet her burden of demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-18\">Kuemo did not exhaust her Convention Against Torture claim before the BIA; therefore, that claim cannot be considered here. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-19\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b963-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
