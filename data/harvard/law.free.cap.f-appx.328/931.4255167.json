Medellin argues that the district court erred in applying a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his prior Nebraska state conviction for aiding and abetting burglary. He asserts that his prior conviction does not constitute the enumerated offense of bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>glary of a dwelling because the Nebraska statute does not track the generic, contemporary definition of this offense. Medellin contends that the Nebraska statute does not require the necessary intent with regard to unlawful or unprivileged entry. He also contends for the first time on appeal that the Nebraska statute\u2019s reference to \u201cimprovements\u201d is broader than the generic definition of buildings or structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Medellin argued before the district court that his prior offense was not a crime of violence and that the intent requirement with .respect to entry was missing from the Nebraska statute. Because he did not specifically argue that statute\u2019s language regarding \u201cimprovements\u201d was overly broad, this issue arguably is subject to plain error review. <em>See United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 310 (5th Cir.2002). However, it is unnecessary to decide this question because Medellin\u2019s arguments fail under de novo review, as well as plain error review. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009); <em>United States v. Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), a defendant\u2019s base offense level is increased by 16 levels if he was previously deported after being convicted of a crime of violence. The Government argues only that Medellin\u2019s prior conviction is an enumerated crime of violence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)). We apply a three-step process to determine whether an offense qualifies as an enumerated crime of violence: (1) the statute and its elements are analyzed categorically; (2) the charging papers may be examined to narrow the definition and \u201cto determine which of the crime\u2019s underlying facts were necessary to the plea or verdict\u201d; and (3) the definition of the crime is compared to the \u201c \u2018generic, contemporary\u2019 meaning of the enumerated offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Carbajal-Diaz, </em>508 F.3d 804, 807-10 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1731, 170 L.Ed.2d 533 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">This court has adopted the generic, eon-temporai\u2019y definition of burglary defined by the Supreme Court in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), as \u201can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with the intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Ortega-Gonzaga, </em>490 F.3d 393, 394-95 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 410, 169 L.Ed.2d 287 (2007). Dwelling has been defined to include \u201ca structure, tent, or vessel where someone lives.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo-Morales, </em>507 F.3d 873, 877 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1106, 169 L.Ed.2d 838 (2008). Nebraska Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-507 provides that: \u201c[a] person commits burglary if such person willfully, maliciously, and forcibly breaks and enters any real estate or any improvements erected thereon with intent to commit any felony or with intent to steal property of any value.\u201d Although the statute does not use the words \u201cunlawful or unprivileged entry,\u201d the force required by the statute indicates that the entry is nonconsensual. Accordingly, Medellin\u2019s assertion that the statute lacks the requisite intent regarding entry is without merit. <em>Cf. Ortega-Gonzaga, </em>490 F.3d at 394-96 (holding California burglary offense was not a crime of violence where the entry was not required to be nonconsensual).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-15\">With respect to Medellin\u2019s second argument, the Government concedes that the statute encompasses burglaries beyond those of a dwelling. <em>See </em>\u00a7 28-507. However, because the statute is written in the disjunctive, it is permissible to look to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>charging document to see what portion of the statute Medellin was charged with violating. <em>See United States v. Murillo-Lopez, </em>444 F.3d 337, 339-45 (5th Cir.2006). The charging document shows that Medellin was charged with aiding and abetting the breaking and entering of a residence. Therefore, Medellin\u2019s prior offense qualifies as burglary of a dwelling and is a crime of violence. <em>See Carbajal-Diaz, </em>508 F.3d at 810-12. Because Medellin has not established error or plain error with respect to the district court\u2019s application of the 16-level enhancement in \u00a7 2L1.2, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b965-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
