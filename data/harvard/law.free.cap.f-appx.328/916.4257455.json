He was sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. He appeals the denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence, basing his appeal on the Sentencing Commission\u2019s adoption of Amendment 706, which modified the sentencing ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses to reduce the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentences. <em>See </em>U.S. SENTENCING Guidelines Manual, supp. to app. C, amend. 706, at. 226-31 (Nov. 1, 2007) (amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-16\">\u201cSection 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). The decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is discretionary, so we review the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-17\">Jones argues that under <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the court has discretion to lower his sentence, because his career offender enhancement was \u201cactivated\u201d by the crack cocaine guideline. Jones contends that his career-offender-guideline sentence should be reexamined for a determination whether, after the amendment, it is not greater than necessary to satisfy the purposes of sentencing as provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. He avers that the district court erred in enforcing the career-offender-guideline sentencing range as mandatory rather than advisory, in violation of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Jones has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a reduction of sentence. Because the guideline range was derived from his status as a career offender and not the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, Jones was not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Further, to the extent Jones argues that the district court had discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough, </em>the argument is unavailing, because those decisions were not \u201cbased on a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines.\u201d <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994) (Booker); <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 564. <em>Rita </em>and <em>Gall </em>are likewise inapposite. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a reduction. Jones\u2019s motion to transcribe the computer disk provided by the government with its brief is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b951-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
