ARTHUR KELSEY\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   SunTrust Bank (\"SunTrust\") made secured loans totaling $18.3 million to Sweely Holdings, LLC (\"Sweely\") and later sought to recover collateral when Sweely defaulted and threatened bankruptcy. The parties negotiated a Master Loan Modification and Forbearance Agreement (\"Workout Agreement\") that provided Sweely with another opportunity to pay its debt. When Sweely failed to do so, SunTrust took action against Sweely's collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In response, Sweely filed this suit against SunTrust, alleging, among other things, breach of contract, fraud in the inducement, and constructive fraud. The circuit court dismissed the case on demurrer, finding that the Workout Agreement defeated Sweely's breach of contract claim and that Sweely had failed to state a claim for any fraud.

The Failed Loan Transaction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Amended Complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleges that, in 2008, Sweely and SunTrust engaged in an $18.3 million commercial-lending relationship to provide capital for the Sweely Holdings Estate Winery in Madison County, Virginia (\"the Winery\"). In addition to personal property at the Winery estimated to have a value of $2.5 million, Sweely offered four parcels of real property as collateral for the loans: (i) a horse farm in Florida appraised at $10 million; (ii) a mixed-use farm property in Madison County with a tax-assessed value of $1.5 million; (iii) the Winery in Madison County appraised at $16 million; and (iv) the Sweely family farm in Madison County appraised at $6.2 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sweely defaulted on these loans in May 2010. Pursuant to the loan documents, SunTrust seized $1.8 million of Sweely's cash assets from Sweely's Interest Reserve Account. After Sweely had declared its intention to seek bankruptcy protection, the parties entered into \"discussions and negotiations\n   regarding a workout of the loans.\" J.A. at 7. Sweely alleges that during one of those discussions in 2010, a SunTrust employee falsely stated that SunTrust had obtained appraisals of the four parcels that showed a\n   collective fair market value of $10.5 to $13.5 million. Sweely asked for copies of these appraisals but did not receive them during the negotiations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the time of this alleged misrepresentation, Sweely claims, SunTrust possessed appraisals estimating the collective worth of the parcels to be $22.8 million and had filed regulatory documents repeating this valuation. According to Sweely, SunTrust intended the misrepresentation as a subterfuge to deter Sweely from declaring bankruptcy because SunTrust would be able to seek relief from the automatic stay of collections imposed by bankruptcy law if the low appraisals were accurate and if SunTrust were an under-secured lender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Amended Complaint concedes that \"Sweely initially expressed doubt as to the accuracy of the appraisals\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   but nevertheless alleges that Sweely \"believed and relied on the misrepresentation that SunTrust possessed appraisals showing\" a value of $10.5 to $13.5 million for the collateral and \"further believed and relied on the misrepresentation that SunTrust could demonstrate to a court that there was a negative equity position on the loans.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. The possibility that SunTrust could make that under-secured showing, Sweely alleges, caused it \"not to file for bankruptcy, not to negotiate for more favorable workout terms ..., and to enter into the Workout Agreement instead.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Pursuant to SunTrust's motion craving oyer, the circuit court admitted into the record four appraisals that SunTrust had obtained\n   in 2010 and 2011.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 2. The 2010 appraisals of the Winery, the family farm, and the Florida horse farm offered two alternative valuations: a \"Market Value As Is,\" which assumed, for each separate property, a one- to four-year period of marketing and exposure, and a \"Disposition Value,\" which assumed a one-year period of marketing and exposure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. at 124, 272, 383-84 (altering capitalization). The 2011 appraisal of the mixed-use property offered a single \"\n   <em>\n    Market Value\n   </em>\n   '\n   <em>\n    As Is\n   </em>\n   ' \" figure of $975,000 and assumed a 12- to 18-month marketing and exposure period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 494, 498. Collectively, these alternative valuations ranged between $13,550,000 in \"Disposition Value\" for three of the four properties to $18,715,000 in \"Market Value As Is\" for all four properties. The appraisal reports also contained an assumption that there were no liens on the properties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 218, 358, 461, 500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   2. The Workout Agreement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties subsequently entered into the Workout Agreement, which stated that the obligors, including Sweely, had \"requested that SunTrust Bank forbear from exercising its rights and remedies ... to allow the Obligors time to either refinance the Loans and/or obtain equity investments in their businesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 103. SunTrust made clear, however, that its agreement to forbear was conditional: \"Without waiving any rights or remedies available to SunTrust Bank on account of the defaults recited above, SunTrust Bank is willing to grant the Obligors' request,\n   provided that all of the Obligors comply with each of the terms, conditions and understandings contained in this Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The principal condition was Sweely's agreement to a \"disposition schedule and incentive plan\" that established \"turnover\" dates for each of the four properties by which Sweely would either make a specific cash payment to SunTrust or voluntarily convey the collateralized property to SunTrust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 110-12. Each property had a different turnover date: (i) November 5, 2010, for the Florida property; (ii) January 31, 2011, for the mixed-use property; (iii) March 31, 2011, for the Winery; and (iv) June 30, 2011, for the family farm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 110-11. The Workout Agreement also required SunTrust to prepare and deliver the deeds to the properties to Sweely for Sweely to execute if it could not make the required payments by each property's corresponding\n   turnover date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 112. If Sweely did not make the required cash payments, but instead delivered the deeds, Sweely would receive a credit from each deed toward its overall debt, culminating in its release from all future liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 110-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For each of the properties, the disposition schedule provided that \"SunTrust Bank may, immediately after such turnover date, schedule and conduct a foreclosure sale ... which all of the Obligors agree shall be subject to the 'Friendly Foreclosure' provisions of Section 8.12 hereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110-12 (emphasis omitted). Titled \" 'Friendly Foreclosure' of Real Property Collateral Upon Expiration of Property-Specific Deadlines or Forbearance Default,\" Section 8.12 provided that the obligors would give \"full cooperation with the commencement and continuation of any foreclosure action\" against the collateralized properties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116. The provision added:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   In the event a Foreclosure Action is commenced (but only after a Forbearance Default under this Agreement), such cooperation shall include the present agreement of each Obligor that no Obligor will contest, object to, file injunctive relief with respect to, or otherwise hinder or delay any Foreclosure Action in any way, shape or form, and will not request, induce or influence other third parties to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Sweely represented in the Workout Agreement that it had not granted any liens on the properties that it had not \"previously disclosed\" to SunTrust.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When Sweely was unable to make the required payment by the turnover date applicable to the Florida property, it voluntarily conveyed that property to SunTrust pursuant to the Workout Agreement. As the January 31, 2011 turnover date for the mixed-use property approached, Sweely found itself unable to make the required payment. Sweely claims that it failed to convey the property by the turnover date because SunTrust refused to accept the property pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sweely alleges that SunTrust contacted a title-service company to review a deed in lieu of foreclosure for the mixed-use property. The title-service company, the Amended Complaint asserts, advised SunTrust that \"it would be 'much safer' for SunTrust to\n   foreclose on the Mixed-Use Property due to the existence of liens on the property\" because \"[u]nder Virginia law, certain liens would have been extinguished if the property was foreclosed on but not if it was transferred by deed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. SunTrust \"immediately confirmed\" to the title-service company that it \"would not record a deed-in-lieu and would instead foreclose on the Mixed-Use Property.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. For this reason, Sweely asserts, SunTrust elected to foreclose on the mixed-use property rather than accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As the March 31, 2011 turnover date for the Winery approached, Sweely again found itself unable to make the required payment. SunTrust stated that it would \"forsake the Deed delivery requirement\" and simply foreclose on the Winery instead.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. SunTrust agreed to accept the deed in lieu of foreclosure for purposes of triggering Sweely's right to a credit and to relief from any deficiency obligations but would not record the deed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Prior to the date of foreclosure, Revolution, LLC, a real-estate-investment firm, bought all of the Sweely promissory notes from SunTrust for an aggregate\n   price of $7.5 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sweely alleges that its debt balance at this time was \"just in excess of\" $9 million and that the value of the remaining collateral \"was at least twice that amount.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. Sweely later negotiated a final settlement with Revolution, LLC that resulted in the sale of the Winery to an affiliate of Revolution, LLC in exchange for Sweely's right to keep the family farm and avoid any deficiency judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   3. Sweely's Lender-Liability Lawsuit\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Sweely filed suit against SunTrust, three of its employees, and its outside counsel, alleging various causes of action including, among others, breach of contract, fraud in the inducement, and constructive fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court sustained SunTrust's demurrer to the Amended Complaint and dismissed all counts with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The breach of contract claim failed, the court held, because the Workout Agreement preserved SunTrust's preexisting right to foreclose and did not require SunTrust to forfeit that right if Sweely offered a deed in lieu of foreclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 90-91 (relying on SunTrust's argument in its post-trial supplemental brief). The court dismissed the fraud counts on the ground that the Amended Complaint did not make out a prima facie case of \"justifiable reliance\" on the alleged misrepresentation,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 81, because \"there simply are no facts that would allow Sweely to reasonably rely on ... the information that was given to [it] by the bank about the appraisals,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 79.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, Sweely contends that the circuit court misread the Workout Agreement to allow SunTrust the option of foreclosing rather than accepting and recording a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Sweely also argues that the court misapplied the justifiable-reliance doctrine and, on that flawed basis, dismissed the fraud claims. We disagree with both of Sweely's assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Sweely contends that the Workout Agreement forbade SunTrust from foreclosing on any of the four properties even if Sweely never paid a dollar of the underlying debt because Sweely had a right to convey the collateral to SunTrust\n   <em>\n    against SunTrust's will\n   </em>\n   by issuing a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The Workout Agreement, Sweely reasons, contemplated that SunTrust would have to immediately absorb \"the continued operating costs\" of the properties (relevant mostly to the Winery) and that Sweely would be protected from \"the notoriety and negative business impact of public foreclosures.\" Appellant's Br. at 12, 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The circuit court read the Workout Agreement differently, as do we. The point of departure is the maxim that \"[a] contract must\n   be construed as a whole and the intention of the parties is to be collected from the entire instrument and not from detached portions.\"\n   <em>\n    Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. v. Areva NP, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12645560\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/788/237/\">\n    292 Va. 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 180 n.8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12645560\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/788/237/\">\n    788 S.E.2d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (quoting 11 Samuel Williston &amp; Richard A. Lord, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 32:11, at 765 (4th ed. 2012) ). \"All of the different parts of an agreement must be viewed together, i.e., as a whole, and each part interpreted in the light of all of the other parts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12645560\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/788/237/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration omitted) (quoting\n   John Edward Murray, Jr., Murray on Contracts \u00a7 88(C), at 481 (4th ed. 2001) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Prior to executing the Workout Agreement, Sweely was in default on each of the four loans and SunTrust had an uncontested right to foreclose on all of the collateralized properties. In the recitals of the Workout Agreement, SunTrust agreed to \"forbear from exercising,\" but not to \"waiv[e] any rights or remedies available to [it],\" including its right to foreclose. J.A. at 103.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Addressing the turnover dates for the four properties, Section 5.5(a) of the Workout Agreement states that Sweely \"shall deliver to SunTrust\" either a specified amount of money or a \"Deed\" transferring the property to SunTrust.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110-11. If the latter, Sweely would receive an agreed-upon credit toward its overall debt, concluding with a complete release from all liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Not one of the four turnover provisions, however, states that SunTrust\n   <em>\n    shall accept\n   </em>\n   the deed and thereby\n   <em>\n    waive\n   </em>\n   its preexisting right to foreclose on the property. To the contrary, each provision ends with the following statement: \"SunTrust Bank may, immediately after such turnover date, schedule and conduct a foreclosure sale under the [applicable mortgage or deed of trust], which all of the Obligors agree shall be subject to the 'Friendly Foreclosure' provisions of Section 8.12 hereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110-12 (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Though inartfully written, these provisions reveal a finely tuned balance of contractual rights and duties. SunTrust was free to accept and record a deed in lieu of foreclosure if it was willing to assume there were no subordinate liens against the collateralized property (thereby taking the risk there were some) that would need to be extinguished by foreclosure. SunTrust was also free to accept,\n   without recording, a deed in lieu of foreclosure and thereafter to conduct a friendly foreclosure if the risk of subordinate liens was unacceptable. Without this choice, SunTrust would have been contractually obligated to accept and record the deed in lieu of foreclosure, afford Sweely a credit against its overall debt, and ultimately forfeit any right to pursue a deficiency judgment against Sweely-all in exchange for property potentially subject to recorded or unrecorded subordinate liens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agreement as a whole undermines this interpretation as both unreasonable and unrealistic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the circuit court, as here, SunTrust argued that its \"right to conduct an immediate foreclosure sale after turnover of collateral, notwithstanding SunTrust's receipt of a deed, was therefore critically important to remove subordinate liens.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is hard to find fault with this interpretation. Any contractual promise that Sweely-an insolvent debtor threatening bankruptcy - might make about undisclosed liens would provide very little succor to a creditor holding millions of dollars in defaulted loans on its books. The Workout Agreement took this fact into account by preserving SunTrust's preexisting power of foreclosure, the only legal remedy that would extinguish subordinate liens and justify the forbearance compromise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Sweely is not without a response to this view. Perhaps SunTrust intended to preserve its right to foreclose, Sweely contends, but SunTrust waived that right in Section 8.12 of the Workout Agreement. Words matter, and words in a contract, when clear, supersede unarticulated intentions. We\n   take this point seriously, as it goes to the heart of our judicial task:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   We have neither the duty nor the inclination to creatively construe an unambiguous contractual phrase \"so as to conform it to the court's notion of the\n   contract the parties should have made\" under the circumstances. We are \"aware of the temptation\" of courts to \"indulge in artificial interpretations or abnormal implications in order to save a party from a bad bargain.\" We resist this temptation with the observation that our interpretative task is far simpler: \"It is the court's duty to declare what the instrument itself says it says.\" \"What the parties claim they might have said, or should have said, cannot alter what they actually said.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12645560\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/788/237/\">\n    292 Va. at 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12645560\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/788/237/\">\n    788 S.E.2d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations, footnote, and citations omitted).

Two paragraphs follow.

And, after giving up this uncontested right, SunTrust would then have had to obligate itself to give Sweely full credit toward the remaining outstanding debt and forever waive any right to seek a deficiency judgment. As the circuit court correctly concluded, this is too heavy an interpretation to drag out on such a weak textual limb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The process of eliminating Sweely's implausible interpretation leaves only one plausible alternative: The second paragraph, including its parenthetical, provides SunTrust with additional, anti-injunction specificity to Sweely's duty to cooperate following a Forbearance Default, however the parties understood that term.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   While this thin meaning attributable to the second paragraph may\n   seem to add little to the first, it does add\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   , and it is certainly more in line with the rest of Section 8.12 than Sweely's proffered interpretation.

When this subject arises during a jury trial on a motion to strike, the court asks only whether a reasonable jury could conclude that the reliance was justifiable.

Our prior cases illustrate this point. In\n   <em>\n    Murayama\n   </em>\n   , for example, a plaintiff claimed that it \"had been duped\" into a settlement agreement that resolved a dispute through the sale of corporate shares.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 243,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=727%20S.E.2d%2080\">\n    727 S.E.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Prior to the agreement, the defendants had allegedly threatened the plaintiff with litigation if the plaintiff did not agree to sell the shares to the defendants.

In\n   <em>\n    Murayama\n   </em>\n   , the alleged fraud involved the value of the corporate shares. Here, the alleged fraud involves appraisal reports valuing the collateralized property. Prior to the agreement in\n   <em>\n    Murayama\n   </em>\n   , the parties \"were in an adversarial relationship and represented by counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20S.E.2d%20189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The same was true here. Sweely was in default on millions of dollars in loans. SunTrust had already seized $1.8 million from Sweely's Interest Reserve Account. Distrustful of SunTrust's alleged appraisals, Sweely asked for copies but did not receive them during negotiations. Like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Murayama\n   </em>\n   , Sweely \"had every reason to be skeptical,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20S.E.2d%20189\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20S.E.2d%20189\">\n    at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=727%20S.E.2d%2080\">\n    727 S.E.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , of the alleged misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The parties in\n   <em>\n    Murayama\n   </em>\n   entered into the settlement agreement to avoid the imminent prospect of litigation. Similarly, Sweely threatened to delay further collection efforts by filing for bankruptcy, which would trigger an automatic stay and jeopardize SunTrust's ability to seek deficiency judgments. To be sure, Sweely's theory of reliance rests in part on this premise. But for being duped into the Workout Agreement, Sweely asserts, it would\n   have immediately stopped all of SunTrust's collection efforts by filing for bankruptcy. From any reasonable perspective, the parties negotiated and entered into the Workout Agreement, at least in part, for the purpose of avoiding the threat of imminent bankruptcy litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The question that we must answer, like the one that we answered in\n   <em>\n    Murayama\n   </em>\n   , is whether a reasonable factfinder could accept Sweely's factual allegations as true and nonetheless conclude that Sweely\n   <em>\n    justifiably\n   </em>\n   relied on SunTrust's alleged misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 248-49,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=727%20S.E.2d%2080\">\n    727 S.E.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like the circuit court, we think not. The allegations in the Amended Complaint, when placed in the context of the relevant documents in the record and the parties' arguments, demonstrate that any alleged reliance by Sweely on the appraisal information was unjustified as a matter of law. Thus, the circuit court also did not err in its decision to dismiss the fraud in the inducement and constructive fraud claims on demurrer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In sum, the circuit court correctly interpreted the Workout Agreement to preclude Sweely's breach of contract claim and correctly held that the fraud claims failed because Sweely had not alleged any justifiable\n   reliance on SunTrust's alleged misrepresentation.

Another document was a memo written by Jess Sweely stating that, at the meeting in which SunTrust claimed it had low appraisals, Jess Sweely \"told [the SunTrust employee] that the appraisals were a farce and that what she was proposing made no sense\" and \"that there was no way that all of the appraisals were only $13.5 million.\" Ex. 3 to Original Demurrer (filed Sept. 8, 2015);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    J.A. at 42-43, 46-47 (relying on the same exhibit in the demurrer to the Amended Complaint).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Sweely conceded in the circuit court that the memo \"memorialize[d]\" what Jess Sweely had said to the SunTrust employee.
