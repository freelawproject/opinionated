At the conclusion of the trial of this PCR case, the circuit court took the decision on the merits under advisement and directed both the State and Reese to prepare proposed orders. The circuit court eventually signed the order prepared by the State and denied all claims for relief. In preparing the order, however, the State did not address each of Reese's claims, and did not include specific findings of fact or conclusions of law on any of Reese's claims. Nevertheless, the circuit court signed the order. As the law requires when a PCR order does not contain specific findings of\n   fact and conclusions of law, Reese's PCR counsel filed a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marlar v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4035778\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/375/407/#p410\">\n    375 S.C. 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 410,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4035778\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/375/407/#p410\">\n    653 S.E.2d 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267 (2007) (holding, \"a Rule 59(e) motion must be filed if issues are not adequately addressed\" in the PCR order). In the motion, PCR counsel explained the \"Order of Dismissal does not contain specific findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding each of the claims presented at the evidentiary hearing, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2017-27-80\">\n    S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 17-27-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\" Nevertheless, the circuit court summarily denied the motion, stating only, \"Applicant's Motion Pursuant to Rule 59(e) SCRCP to Amend is DENIED.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   In her petition for a writ of certiorari, Reese requested a remand to the circuit court and asked this Court to require the circuit court to prepare an order that complies with section 17-27-80 and Rule 52(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. Rather than filing a return to Reese's petition, the State filed a motion to remand the case for detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, conceding a remand would be appropriate in light of the PCR order's patent inadequacies. We grant the State's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This is not the first time this Court has raised concerns over orders prepared by the State that do not comply with section 17-27-80 and Rule 52(a).

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"825966\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/310/254/\">\n    310 S.C. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"825966\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/310/254/\">\n    423 S.E.2d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), we stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   We take this opportunity to express our concern with the increasing number of orders in PCR proceedings that fail to address the merits of the issues raised by the applicant. Not only does this deprive the parties of rulings on the issues raised, but it makes review by the appellate court more difficult and ultimately increases the work load of all involved\n   where, as in this case, a new hearing is required to secure the rulings which should have been made initially. Counsel preparing proposed orders should be meticulous in doing so, opposing counsel should call any omissions to the attention of the PCR judge prior to issuance of the order, and the PCR judge should carefully review the order prior to signing it. Even after an order is filed, counsel has an obligation to review the order and file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend if the order fails to set forth the findings and the reasons for those findings as required by \u00a7 17-27-80 and Rule 52(a), SCRCP.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"825966\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/310/254/\">\n    310 S.C. at 255-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"825966\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/310/254/\">\n    423 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   128 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smalls v.
