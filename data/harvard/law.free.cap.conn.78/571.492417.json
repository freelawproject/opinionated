Section 1957 provides that upon such appeal \u201csaid judge may, by committee or otherwise, reassess said damages or benefits, or review and revoke, modify, or affirm,\u201d the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">The plaintiff alleged, as reasons of appeal to said judge : (1) that the amount assessed against her property was disproportionate to that assessed against other properties in the same street for the construction of said sewer; (2) that in making such assessment the board of warden and burgesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>applied an arbitrary rule by which they apportioned the expense of the construction of the sewer among \u201c the adjoining owners according to the number of the front feet of their land, without apparent reference to any other consideration;\u201d (3) that in making the assessment against the plaintiff\u2019s property said board failed to apply the rule which had theretofore been established as just and equitable, of exempting 125 feet of a corner lot when a sewer is laid upon two sides of such lot; and (4) that in the application of said front-foot rule the plaintiff\u2019s land was assessed for too great a frontage.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The reasons of appeal having been denied, the Superior Court judge appointed a committee to try the issues of fact raised by the pleadings, reassess the benefits assessed against the plaintiff\u2019s property, and make report to said judge. The plaintiff filed a remonstrance to the acceptance of the report made by the committee, and the judge sustained the defendant\u2019s demurrer to such remonstrance and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">There was no error ih the judgment of the judge of the Superior Court. Of the reasons of appeal to this court the only ones pursued by the plaintiff in her brief are that the trial judge erred : (1) \u201c In refusing to hold said assessment illegal and invalid because it was based on a frontage four and seven-tenths feet greater than the actual frontage of said property; (2) in refusing to hold said assessment illegal and invalid because no exemption was allowed on said property as a corner lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The first alleged error is based upon the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the assessment was improperly made by applying an \u201c arbitrary rule by which the expense of the construction of the sewer is apportioned among the adjoining owners according to the number of front feet of their land, without apparent reference to any other consideration.\u201d But the committee finds that an arbitrary front-foot rule was not the basis of computation; that the values of the different pieces of property as estimated by the committee were 'considered, and that the value of the plaintiff\u2019s property was fairly 'esti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>mated; </em>and that the assessment against her property was a fair one. It does, however, appear that the properties were valued by the front foot, and that if the borough authorities made the claimed error in measuring the frontage of the plaintiff\u2019s land, there was an error in valuation, rather than in the application of a rule of assessment, by which the amount of the benefits required to be paid by the plaintiff was improperly increased some $4.71. The committee regarded such a difference in measurements, as shown by different evidence, as too trifling to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">But the plaintiff does not appear to have satisfied the committee that the measurement adopted by the borough authorities was wrong. The finding fails to state which of the two measurements was the correct one. The facts found by the committee upon this point are, that \u201c although there is a discrepancy of four and seven-tenths feet between the measurements of the frontage of the- appellant\u2019s land as made by her engineer, and the measurements as made by the borough authorities, it is so trivial that it ought not to disturb the assessment against the property; \u201d and that the borough in making the assessment assumed that the frontage of the plaintiff\u2019s property was four and seven-tenths feet greater than was disclosed by the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s engineer. In finding the issues for the defendant, the trial judge may properly have regarded this as not amounting to a finding that the measurement testified to by the plaintiff\u2019s engineer was the correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Regarding the second alleged error, that under the rule of assessment established by the borough there should have been an exemption allowed of a part of the frontage of the plaintiff\u2019s property, as a corner lot, the committee finds that tire warden and burgesses had adopted a rule of assessment by which it has been customary to exempt 125 feet of a frontage, on a corner, where a sewer was laid on two frontages of property at the intersection of two streets, but that the property of the plaintiff is not so situated as to constitute a comer lot within the rule. The map before us shows that the plaintiff\u2019s property is on the west side of Queen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Street, through which the sewer is laid, and that in front of the plaintiff\u2019s lot Queen Street turns to the west at au obtuse angle, and that there is no intersecting street at said angle.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Upon these facts, and upon the finding of the committee that the assessment against the plaintiff\u2019s property was a fair one, we cannot hold as a matter of law that the plaintiff was entitled to the claimed exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
