By a codicil he revoked the gift of income to George, and from such income gave an annuity to George\u2019s wife for her life, with remainder to George \u201c for and during his natural life, the same to be paid to him annually.\u201d William died testate in November, 1904, leaving surviving issue ; George in December, 1904, and Mary in 1895. In a suit to construe the will it was <em>held </em>that the provision for the issue of William was intended to take effect only in case he should die before the testator, and therefore having survived the testator, William acquired an absolute title to the property, subject only to his father\u2019s life estate.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b374-10\">Submitted on briefs October 17th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Am1P\">decided December 15th, 1905.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-11\">Suit for the construction of the will of William S.

Noyes, depends upon the construction of the provision creating a remainder in favor of his sister. The estate was to be hers absolutely, after the death of the testator\u2019s grandson William S. Noyes, \u201cin case he shall die, leaving no living issue,\u201d provided that it was \u201c not to pass to her until after \u201d the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>George W. <em>Noyes, </em>and subject to an annuity charge during the life of the latter\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The phrase \u201c die leaving no living issue,\u201d by the rules of interpretation adopted in this State, is equivalent to \u201c die leaving no surviving issue.\u201d ' <em>St. John </em>v. <em>Dawn, </em>66 Conn. 401, 407. It carries a plain \u2022 implication in favor of any issue of the first taker who may survive him. If employed, in a devise of lands, with reference to his death, without regard to the time at which that event may occur, it may create an estate tail. If, on the other hand, employed with reference to his death in case that event should occur before that of the testator, it may amount to a substitutionary provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In the will now before us, a vested remainder is first given to William S. Noyes in terms sufficient to convey an absolute title. On the happening of a certain contingency an absolute estate is then limited over to Mary W. Noyes ; but it is \u201c not to pass to her \u201d (that is, the enjoyment of it is not), until the death of the father of the first remainder-man. It is not probable that the testator meant to create an estate tail in his residuary real estate, which under our statute (\u00a7 4027) would become a fee-simple in the issue of his grandson, while contemplating the possible vesting of an absolute title in remainder in his daughter before the death of his son. His general intent is better served by interpreting the provision for the issue of William S. Noyes as one to take effect only in case his grandson should die before him. <em>Coe </em>v. <em>James, </em>54 Conn. 511; <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>55 id. 359; <em>Lawlor </em>v. <em>Holohan, </em>70 id. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The Superior Court is advised that on the testator\u2019s death William S. Noyes acquired an absolute title to the fund in question, subject only to his father\u2019s life interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">No costs will be taxed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
