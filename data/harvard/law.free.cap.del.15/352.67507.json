Run Dairy, on Delaware Avenue, just west of Jefferson Street, in the city of Wilmington, for the purpose of taking the milk out of the wagon and putting it in the cellar of said dairy; that the horse was fronting west with the hind wheels of the wagon in an easterly direction, near the car-track of the defendant company\u2019s road; that two cars had previously passed, but afterwards, while the hind-wheel was so near the track as to make it dangerous for any other cars to pass, car No. 32 of the Wilmington City Railway Company came up, running rapidly, ran into and injured the horse and wagon of the plaintiff. The damage to the horse was placed at $275.00, and the amount of the repairs to the wagon, rendered necessary by the accident, at $67.73, making $342.73 the total amount of damages claimed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-10\">At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, <em>Ponder, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFb\">moved for a non-suit, because as he contended, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>evidence showed that there was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, and that, therefore, he could not recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-6\">Non-suit may and ought to be granted where there is no evidence showing negligence on the part of the defendant or even where there is very little evidence of such negligence. <em>N.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AdlK\">(charging the jury.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">We have been asked to charge you on certain points of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">There are no new questions of law raised in this case; they have all been decided and are governed by the decisions of this State. Both parties had a right to the use of that street. Parties driving horses and wagons have a right to the use of all the streets, using reasonable and proper diligence in doing so. The railroad company have a right to use all that portion of it included within their lines of track, and within those lines they have a superior right and must not unnecessarily be interfered with or impeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Such superior right does not give them the right either care<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>lessly or reckessly to injure others, it is simply that they have a superior right, and necessarily so, as they can travel only in that track, and others must get out of their way.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We have been asked to say to you' that the leaving of horses unhitched and unattended in the streets of the city was in itself negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">We do say to you that the leaving of a horse unhitched to a, carriage or a wagon on the streets of the city unattended by and out of the control and reach of the driver, is negligence. This principle has been decided in the case of <em>Robinson vs. Simpson, </em>by the late Chief Justice Comegys. If that negligence was the proximate cause of the injury, then the plaintiff could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">This case lies within very narrow bounds. The question for you to decide is, whether there was negligence at or about the time of the collision and the injury to this horse and wagon, and if so, whose negligence it was that actually caused the injury, or was the proximate cause thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">If, as claimed by the plaintiff, the wheels of the wagon were dangerously near the track, and the motorman of the approaching car, No. 32, either did see it, or if by the the use of proper care and diligence he could have seen it in time to have stopped this car and did not do so, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover. The law requires that a person shall exercise all due care and diligence to prevent accidents. If he did see it and ran into it, or if he, using proper care, could have seen it and did not and ran into it through carelessness or reckelessness, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">If, therefore, the wagon was standing on the side of the street, far enough for the car to pass by without striking, and was not moving when the car came within the distance, so that the motorman could see it, and within the distance that it was possible for him to stop, then the motorman had a right to presume that the wagon, which was thus standing still by tbe side-walk would so remain, and he had a right to go on ; and if, when the car got up near the horses, they got scared and backed the wagon into the car, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>it was an accident, something the defendant could not have foreseen, and was not bound to see it. In that case the plaintiff could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">You see, therefore, this question narrows itself down to the point of the collision with the wagon. If the motor man did see or could have seen that the wheels were dangerously near the track and ran into the wagon, then the company would be liable. If the wheels were not dangerously near and the wagon was still the motorman was not bound to presume that it would move, otherwise a car would have to stop at every wagon that may be standing along the streets, and speedy locomotion over the city would be impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">This whole matter is before you as a question of fact, and you are to decide it from the evidence in the case. In considering the evidence you are to be governed by a preponderance of proof. In criminal cases you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the prisoner or you must acquit him. In civil causes you are governed by whatever is the weight of the evidence or whichever side in your judgment the evidence preponderates. In estimating that evidence you are to take into consideration the fairness of the witnesses, their opportunities for seeing, their intelligence, their appearance on the stand, their numbers, if it be a mere matter of numbers, and every other element enabling you to rightfully and properly measure the credit to be given. Your verdict in this case should be in accordance with what you believe to be the weight of the evidence; that is, all things considered, what is most entitled to belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The evidence is conflicting. One class of witnesses swears positively one way and another class positively another way. Reconcile that testimony, if you can, so as to reach a just conclusion. But if you cannot reconcile it, then gentlemen, you must give credit to those witnesses who, under all circumstance, in your best judgment, are entitled to belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The measure of damages, if you believe the plaintiff entitled to recover; that is, that the injuries resulted from the negligence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the company:\u2014is the actual damages proved to you, and in measuring that, you are to take the evidence on both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">If then, after considering carefully and conscientiously\u2014as it is your duty\u2014all the testimony in this case, you believe that the wagon wheel was on or near the track, and that the motorman either saw it or ought to have seen it and ran into it, your verdict should be for the plaintiff for such damages as have been proved. If you think the wheel was clear of the track when the motorman saw it and he got up nearly abreast of the horses when the wagon backed into the car then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, and your verdict should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\n<em>Verdict for the plaintiff for \u00a731fi.78.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
