They have not proved that the judgment was not paid, further than to 1870 by the return of this execution. From 1870 to 1893, when this writ was issued, was twenty-three years, and the judgment is paid by presumption of- law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-8\"><em>White </em>for the plaintiffs, replied.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvA\">The provision referred to is under the statute of limitations strictly, and does not apply to a judgment. We are proceeding under the general principle of law that if we can show any circumstances which are admissible as evidence, we can do so to rebut this legal presumption of payment. It is not strictly a statute of limitations; it is not a statute of repose, but simply a.statute of presumption, and turns upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>question as to whether or not upon the facts and circumstances submitted, the jury can infer that the judgment has not been paid.

Moore and William S. Hitch, administrators of Nathaniel Hearne, deceased, against George W. Carey, to revive a judgment, which was given by confession on the first day of July, A. D. 1863. The defendant in this case pleads payment. Twenty years having elapsed since the confession of the judgment, the presumption of law is that it has been paid and it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove to your satisfaction, that the judgment has not been paid. To sustain that, he has offered in evidence the fact that an execution was issued at the April Term, 1868, upon which his property was sold and the proceeds applied to the judgment. In addition to that, he has offered testimony to show that since that time he has had no other property in this county, and has been since 1870 a non-resident of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">These facts, and all the others you have in this case, you are to weigh and say whether from them you are satisfied that the judgment has not been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>On the other hand, this judgment is one that has been stand,ing since 1863, which was revived by the execution of 1868, since which time it seems no process has been taken to revive or keep alive the judgment. They might have proceeded during this time, to revive or keep alive the judgment, although the defendant was absent from the State, by two returns of nihil\u2014that is, that he could not be found. You may take that fact into consideration\u2014 that is, their not having acted during this time\u2014as evidence that the judgment has been paid, or they would otherwise have proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">If from all the testimony in the case, as presented from the stand, and from the records offered in evidence, you find that the judgment has not been paid, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff. If you find that the judgment has been paid, then your verdict should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\n<em>Verdict for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
