In Section 2, of the ordinances of 1856 and 1882, Charter and Ordinances, 384, 385, there is an enumeration of the general powers of the Board of Health, which, if there were no express provisions as to wet cellars, and if the record disclosed a case properly within the general phrases used, might include a wet or unclean cellar; but as the same ordinance afterwards takes up wet or unclean cellars specifically in the three instances above enumerated, the ordinance must be construed as having fully explained and defined the jurisdiction of the Board of Health over wet or unclean cellars in those provisions which refer to them expressly.

Laws, Ch. 345 <em>; </em>Rev. Code (1893) 298-301.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-9\">From the foregoing review of the state laws, Charter and Ordinances of the City of Wilmington, it would appear that the plaintiff below must depend for its jurisdiction in this case upon the general provisions of \u00a7 137 of its charter, and the method of procedure therein laid down. This section, so far as it is material now to quote, reads as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-10\">\u201cAnd the said Board of Health, upon complaint that a nuisance has heen created, erected or continued, and is continued within said city or within one mile of the boundaries thereof, which may prove injurious to the health of the inhabitants thereof, shall hear and determine such complaint, and if necessary view and examine the matter or thing complained of, and if the said Board shall adjudge the place or thing complained of to be a nuisance whereby the health of the inhabitants of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>city is or may be injured the said Board shall give directions to cleanse, remove, abate or remedy the same to the person or persons causing or producing such nuisance, or to the owner or owners, agents, tenants or occupants of the premises wherein the said nuisance exists, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-6\">This provision, which defines the method of procedure in case of a nuisance prejudicial to the health of the city, is intimately connected with the definition of the powers of the Boai'd of Health over such nuisances immediately proceeding, and must be construed in connection with it. It would therefore seem that in every case of a nuisance cognizable under any statute or ordinance by the Board of Health this method of procedure here laid down must be strictly followed, even though such statute or ordinance should be silent upon the method ot procedure in any specified case or provide a different procedure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-7\">The charter is the constitution of the city government, and every ordinance of the city and all powers exercised by its officers, derive their strength and validity from it, and must be limited by and conform to its provisions; Dillon Mun. Corp. \u00a7\u00a7 89-91, note 3; Wood, Nuisances (11th ed.), 875, \u00a7\u00a7 738-741; Cooley, Const. Limit. (4th ed.), 231, 235, 248, 250; 2 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. of Law, 435; Sutherland, Stat. 325-329.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-8\">The proceedings of the Board of Health for the City of Wilmington, provided in the charter of said city, whereby said Board passes upon nuisances injurious to the health of the inhabitants of said city, are essentially judicial. The language of the section of the charter conferring jurisdiction upon said Board to pass upon the question of such nuisances, precludes the contention that the duties of the Board in this behalf are merely ministerial or merely legislative, and makes the proceedings in all necessary points purely judicial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-9\">The machinery of the Board is set in operation <em>\u201c upon complaint, </em>that a nuisance has been created, erected or continued, and is continued within said city, or within one mile of the boundaries thereof, which may prove injurious to the health of the inhabitants thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Whereupon, it is provided that the Board <em>\u201c </em>shall <em>hear </em>and <em>determine </em>such <em>complaint, </em>and if necessary, <em>view </em>and <em>examine </em>the matter or thing <em>complained </em>of.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-6\">The power to judicially determine the fact is then attempted to be conferred in the following words:\u2014\u201c if the said Board shall <em>adjudge the place or thing complained of to be a nuisance, </em>whereby the health of the inhabitants of said city is or may be injured,\u201d then the Board shall act as the charter provides in that behalf.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-7\">Lastly, as the consequences of its prior judicial determination of the fact of such a nuisance as is or may be injurious to the health of the inhabitants of the city, the Board is given power to enforce its judgment and decree by civil and criminal prosecutions, and criminal and civil forfeitures and penalties. All the marks of a judicial proceeding thus appear (1) a <em>charge </em>or <em>complaint, </em>(2) a <em>trial </em>upon which this charge or complaint is \u201c heard,\u201d <em>\u201c </em>determined,\u201d <em>\u201c </em>viewed \u201d and \u201c examined \u201d, (3) a <em>judgment </em>that the charge or complaint is sustained or otherwise, (4) process or mandate of <em>execution </em>by which the alleged nuisance may be abated, and lastly, (5) a <em>penalty </em>imposed upon the owner, either by way of a pecuniary forfeiture upon a civil action or fine or imprisonment upon a criminal prosecution. Charter of the City of Wilmington, \u00a7 137; 17 Del. Laws Ch. 207.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-8\">The judicial functions above outlined appear upon the face of the statute to be summary, without notice to the party charged, or power on his part to appear and defend, without the intervention of a grand or petit jury, and absolutely without appeal. City Charter, \u00a7 137. The method provided for the exercise of these judicial functions must therefore be strictly followed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-9\">Under the rulings of the Municipal Court, from whose judgments in this behalf the right of appeal is expressly taken away, the only issues possible to be raised in the criminal prosecution before it provided in this section of the City Charter, are (1) has or not the Board of Health in fact \u201c adjudged the place or thing complained of to be a nuisance, whereby the health of the inhabitants of said city is or may be injured,\u201d (2) is or not the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the \u201c owner, agent, tenant or occupant of the premises,\u201d (3) has the Board of Health notified him or her to abate, &amp;c., and (4) has or not such owner, agent, tenant or occupant <em>\u201c </em>failed, neglected, omitted or refused to comply with the directions of said Board of Health as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-6\">Under the plan of procedure laid down in \u00a7 137 of the City Charter, and its practical workings, as disclosed by this record, every safeguard thrown around the property and liberty of the citizens of this State by the Bill of Bights and Constitution, every right of property and liberty which the State Constitution in its preamble declares that \u201c all men have by nature,\u201d and every sentiment of justice and fair dealing, is violated; Del. Const. Preamble, Art. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 7, 8, 9, Art. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4, 15, 24.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-7\">Under the Constitution of this State, \u201c every man for an injury done him in his person, movable or immovable possessions, shall have remedy by the due course of law, and justice administered according to the very right of the cause and the law of the land ; \u201d Del. Const. Art. 1, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-8\">The fact that the injury so suffered is by virtue of the operation of a statute, or is according to mere forms prescribed by statute law, is wholly immaterial, if the injury or damage is imposed contrary to the \u201c due process of law,\u201d or <em>u </em>the law of the land; \u201d Cooley, Const.

Const. Art. 6, \u00a7 15; 4 A. &amp; E. Encyc. of Law 447-450.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-6\">The creation or maintenance of a public or common nuisance is a criminal offence; Wood, Nuisance, \u00a717.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-7\">Not having been established as a court within the meaning of the Constitution, the General Assembly cannot, by law, give to the Board of Health criminal jurisdiction of nuisances; Del. Const. Art. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4, 15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-8\">The jurisdiction conferred by the General Assembly upon the Municipal Court of the city of Wilmington by the city charter, \u00a7 137, is solely for the specific offence of \u201cfailing, neglecting, omitting or refusing to comply with the directions of said Board as aforesaid,\u201d leaving the trial of the fact of nuisance or no nuisance exlusively to the Board of Health; City Charter, \u00a7 137.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-9\">One of the jurisdictional facts required, but not disclosed, by the record is that a <em>complaint </em>was made to the Board of Health that a nuisance had been created, erected, or continued, and is continued within the city of Wilmington, or within one mile of the boundaries thereof, which may prove injurious to the health of the inhabitants thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-10\">So far as the record shows, there was no <em>complaint </em>by any person of this cellar, but the Board of Health by its executive officer, Mr. McKinney, itself ascertained the fact that the cellar was wet. The record therefore, plainly and unequivocally negatives this jurisdictional fact of a complaint to the Board,, of Health by anybody. The law having provided that the machinery of the Board should be set in motion by such complaint, it is a prerequisite to the Board\u2019s taking jurisdiction in any such case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-11\">There having been no such complaint the Board of Health could not, of course, \u201chear and determine such <em>complaint\u201d </em>or \u201c view and examine the matter or thing <em>complained </em>of\u201d or-\u201cadjudge the place or thing <em>complained </em>of to be a nuisance,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-12\">Because of the lack of the specific complaint, all of the subsequent deliberations of the Board of Health on the matter in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tion, including the order of abatement, etc., are also without the jurisdiction and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-6\">But without regard to whether there was a complaint, such as the charter contemplates or not, the record does not show that there was any <em>\u201c hearing </em>and <em>determination </em>\u201d of the matter before or by the Board, or that it <em>\u201c </em>viewed\u201d or \u201cexamined\u201d the place or thing which was reported to it by its executive officer; upon this point, the record simply says \u201c above report of Mr. McKinney having been read, on motion of Mr. Lewis the places, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-7\">No witnesses appear to have been called to show the condition of the cellar, whether its condition was permanent or temporary, or even to show how wet it was, or the cause thereof, or by whose negligence or default it was wet, nor does there appear to have been any testimony before or inquiry by the Board as to whether any ill effects had or might result from the condition of the cellar to the health of the inhabitants of the city. In brief, there appears to have been no testimony upon or inquiry into the main question which the Board had to consider and determine, that is to say, whether this cellar, which it itself and alone asserted to be wet, was or not a \u201c nuisance whereby the health of the inhabitants of the city might be or was injured.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-8\">The only possible conclusion from the record is that simply upon the reading or Mr. McKinney\u2019s \u201c report \u201d the Board hastened to \u201c adjudge \u201d that the batch of places and things reported by him were \u201c nuisances \u201d detrimental to the public health, and hereupon ordered them in a batch to be abated in ten days. Such action is clearly incompetent; <em>State vs. Trenton, </em>36 N. J. L. 283.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-9\">But the words \u201c hear and determine,\u201d \u201c view and examine\u201d and the word \u201c adjudge\u201d import a hearing of a certain sort, to wit, a judicial or quasi-judicial hearing and a judicial or qz\u00bfasi-j udicial adjudication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-10\">Essential requisites of a judicial or quasi-judicial hearing and determination are notice to the person involved or interested in the inquiry and judgment an opportunity to be heard by himself or his attorney, and an opportunity to defend by calling witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>upon the facts to be determined; Del.

Conviction is, therefore, almost inevitable, since the merits of the case are not inquired into.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-8\">The real hearing upon which the fine and imprisonment are based, is had before the Board of Health.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-9\">As the hearing before the Board of Health appears by the record to have been without notice to the defendant below and opportunity to appear and defend, or trial by jury, she was thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>deprived of liberty and property without the judgment of her peers, and contrary to the law of the land; Del.

L. 308\u2014 316.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-10\">It follows that as this power of abatement must be performed by agents of the State, it may be delegated to executive officers such as Boards of Health, to proceed without the delay of judicial proceedings in cases analogous to those where the remidy by sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>mary abatement existed at common law ; <em>Lawton vs. Steele, supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-6\">There is no constitutional provision in Delaware requiring notice of proceedings to abate nuisances detrimental to public health either to the person upon whose premises the nuisance exists, or to him who causes it. The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8, 9, of Art. I, as to the due course of law relate to the rights of accused persons in criminal prosecutions and \u201c the law of the land \u201d means indictment by grand jury and trial by petit jury in criminal proceedings. Sec, 8 is not a limitation of the general power and authority of the State over property with reference to taxation or the exercise of police powers to preserve the public health or morals and \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 have no application to summary proceedings of a <em>quasi-</em>judicial character, such as those arising under the law of eminent domain, abatement of nuisances, and other exercises of police power; and the principal rules as to notice of judicial proceedings do not apply to them; <em>Wilson vs. Baltimore and Philadelphia R. R. Co., </em>5 Del. Ch. 524.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-7\">Preservation of health is <em>one </em>of the permanent objects of government, included in the police power of the State or municipality, and subject to which every citizen holds his property. To accomplish their purpose Boards of Health are necessarily invested with large and arbitrary powers, and the proceedings are frequently of a summary character, although they may impair or destroy valuable rights and property of individuals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-8\">II. It is not essential to the validity of proceedings of a Board of Health, whereby a certain place or thing is declared a nuisance detrimental to public health, that it should therein appear that notice of such proceedings was given to the owner of the place or thing affected. The proceeding is <em>in rem, </em>and the determination of the Board is valid and conclusive so far as the <em>res </em>is concerned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-9\">This is a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>and the sole question is the validity of that record. Notice to the owner of the thing or place under investigation and opportunity to him for hearing, prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the decision of the Board as to the existence of a nuisance injurious to health, is not required by statute or ordinance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-6\">Whether it is sufficient to justify further action, or would protect officers who should abate the nuisance, or furnish a ground of action by the municipality against the owner to recover the cost of abatement of the nuisance, does not arise here and cannot be before the court in this proceeding; <em>Salem vs. Eastern R. R. Co., </em>98 Mass. 431; <em>Miller vs. Horton, </em>152 <em>id., </em>540, 543, 548-556 ; <em>Newark, etc., Horse R. R. Co. vs. Hunt, </em>50 N. J. L. 308.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-7\">Cases wherein a contrary view have have been expressed are not satisfactory authorities, if they be cases where the ulterior remedy of the Board of Health was being enforced, and unless they be cases where the validity of the record was directly disputed as in a writ of <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-8\">All that the law requires is that judgment shall not pass against the owner of the property, condemning him to pay the costs of suppressing or abating an alleged nuisance existing on his premises, or the cost of doing any other work on his premises for the benefit of the public health or safety, without a hearing upon the question as to the existence of the nuisance, and the necessity of the work, as well as upon the other questions involved. And the hearing may come before or after the alleged nuisance is abated or the work is done, as the circumstances may require. The matter is governed by the necessities of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-9\">In the case at bar, notice by law is provided and no step can be taken to enforce the decision of the Board as to the fact of a nuisance until notice is served on the proper person. It is the duty of the Board after adjudication of the nuisance to \u201cgive directions\u201d for its abatement within a time to be prescribed by the order, and if the direction be not observed within the time prescribed, then it may be done by the Board, or its agent, and the expense recovered of the person causing the nuisance; Charter \u00a7 137.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-10\">The plaintiff in the <em>certiorari </em>cannot now complain that any constitutional or natural right has been infringed by the action of the Board of Health. Her property has not been destroyed, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>entry has been made upon her premises, and as far as her rights are concerned they are, as yet, unaffected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-6\">If entry is made upon her premises to abate the nuisance, she may then set up her constitutional or inherent right to a <em>hearing; </em>and also when she is arrested for not complying with the direction to abate the nuisance, she may assert her right and have the proceedings annulled if invalid, or if she so desires, she may in the Municipal Court contest the fact of the existence of a nuisance detrimental to the public health.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-7\">So, also, if the nuisance is abated by the Board of Health, and suit brought to recover from her the cost of the abatement, she may then have her hearing and contest every fact on which the action of the Board was based.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-8\">It cannot be claimed that the defendant below was deprived of any inherent or constitutional right, because by law an appeal from the Municipal Court was denied, for by the Constitution of Delaware the Legislature may confer final jurisdiction of nuisances upon inferior Courts and Justices of the Peace, and may deny trial by jury and the right of appeal; Const. of Delaware, Act VI, \u00a7 15,</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-9\">III. A municipality, and in this case the Board of Health, its agent, has the same right of abatement of common nuisances without notice that a private person has, and by law the duty to so abate is imposed upon upon it. Every thing or place which is in such condition as to be detrimental to public health is <em>per se </em>a common nuisance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-10\">The municipal authority is. charged according to some authorities with- the same responsibility to the owner of the place or thing affected by the abatement of the nuisance as the private person abating the nuisance. In the determination of this liability, the fact of notice prior to the abatement is immaterial. The sole question that can be raised is, was it a common nuisance ? If so, both the private person and the municipality are fully protected and the individual whose property has been affected, has no remedy, for no., right has been infringed. He has no right to maintain a common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>nuisance, and holds his property subject to the right of the State to prevent and remove nuisances, and in so doing to destroy his property, if necessary to do so effectively. ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">A Legislature may invest a municipal corporation with power to abate nuisances summarily without resort to legal proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-7\">Familiar instances of this are removal or destruction of wooden buildings within prohibited limits, and the capture and killing of unregistered dogs and cattle running at large. <em>Baungartner vs. Hasty, </em>100 Ind. 595; <em>King vs. Davenport, </em>98 Ill. 305; <em>Blair vs. Freehand, </em>100 Mass. 136.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-8\">IV. The city may by ordinances define and remove <em>nuisances; </em>Charter, \u00a7 31; <em>Hart vs. Mayor of Albany, </em>3 Paige 213, 218.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-9\">Water standing in a cellar, <em>i. e. </em>a wet cellar, has been defined a nuisance by ordinance. Charter, Laws and Ordinances, 386. Therefore, it is not competent for an owner to show that a wet cellar was not a nuisance; <em>Train vs. Boston Defecting Co., </em>144 Mass. 523.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-10\">V. The Board of Health has final jurisdiction in determining the fact of a nuisance which they order to be abated; <em>Kennedy vs. Board of Health, </em>2 Pa. 366; <em>Green vs. Savannah, </em>6 Ga. 1; <em>Raymond vs. Fish, </em>51 Conn. 80; <em>North Chicago vs. Lake View, </em>105, Ill. 202.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-11\">VI. Within the scope of the authority, the proceedings of the Board of Health are presumed to have been according to law and rightly done; <em>Salem vs. Eastern R. R. Co., </em>98 Mass. 431-452.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-12\">VII. A complaint is not necessary to the validity of acts of the Board of Health declaring a thing or place a nuisance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-13\">The Board and agents may act upon their own knowledge or information; <em>Swett vs. Sprague, </em>55 Me. 190. And a formal complaint of the existence of a nuisance serves the function of imposing a duty on the Board of Health to investigate the alleged nuis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>anee, and is not and was not intended as conferring a power to so investigate. They can act without a formal complaint, but they are bound to act if there be a formal complaint made.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-11\">The references to the charter and ordinances if not otherwise specified are to the edition of 1893.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b242-6\">Cullen, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Au8\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">This is a <em>certiorari </em>under very peculiar circumstances, and we will not attempt to go into any extended review of the different matters and principles upon which this case rests, but shall merely state the general principles involved, upon which we dismiss these exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">It appears that there was a proceeding originally commenced under an act of Assembly, vesting in the Board of Health of this city certain powers and authority in relation to matters mentioned under their immediate jurisdiction. The result of the action of the Board of Health is not a judgment. This is a power that is conferred and which is acted on by the Board of Health by force of the police power, which is part of the sovereignty of the State. The State may delegate those powers, and it has in this case delegated to the Board of Health the power, upon complaint coming before them, to determine whether o\u00ed not a thing is deleterious or injurious to the community generally, and they may examine that matter and inquire into and investigate it. And upon this investigation, if the person upon due notice does not remove that which is deleterious\u2014you may call it a nuisance\u2014then the Board of Health have the right to remove or abate the nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">It is contended that there was no notice given in this case before they proceeded. Every person, of course, has his right to a day in court, but the Board of Health act upon these matters like a Grand Jury, for instance, where there is a charge against a person\u2014on one side of the matter. When the matter is determined by them it is not a judgment; they simply determine that a certain matter is a nuisance. Then when it is so determined it is their duty to notify the party that a nuisance exists on his premises, and that he is required to remove it within a certain time, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>by them specified. The act does not prescribe a particular time in which it must be done, because the time it takes to remove it must necessarily depend upon the nature and character of the nuisance to be abated. Five days might be enough in one case, while it might take two, three, five or six months in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">When it is determined by the Board of Health, acting under the police power vested in them by the Legislature or the sovereign power of the State, that a certain thing is a nuisance, it becomes their duty for the first time to notify the party of the fact that a nuisance exists on his place\u2014that is, notice is given to him of that fact; it is nothing more or less in our judgment than that <em>\u201c </em>a nuisance exists on your place, and we require you to remove it in so many days.\u201d The party\u2019s rights have not been invaded; it has been a mere matter of investigation. And then he may, if he see fit, have his day in court. He has an impartial, full and complete remedy. For the first time the case enters into trial when both parties are represented. He may appeal to the Chancellor for an injunction to stay the action, and commence an action whereby his rights may be determined by proceedings in chancery. If he sees fit to allow the matter to go on, and if the Board of Health have violated the powers vested in them in removing the matter, then they become personally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Were it otherwise, what would become of the community, and what would police regulations amount to ? Parties must act in an emergency; if the Board of Health act in an emergency, still there is time left for the opposite party, if he wishes, to contest their action. Their action is not a legal judgment such as is contemplated under the law, to which a <em>certiorari </em>at common law may issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">We think, therefore, under the circumstances, that this is not a case in which a <em>certiorari </em>would lie, and therefore dismiss the exceptions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
