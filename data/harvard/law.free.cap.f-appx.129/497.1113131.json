He brought suit against, <em>inter alia, </em>Miami-Dade County, claiming that the County violated his Eighth Amendment rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted MiamiDade County\u2019s motion and denied Thompson\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-23\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1085 (11th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue was to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-24\">We have carefully reviewed the record, the briefs of the parties, and the order of the district court on summary judgment. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Thompson, it is clear that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>has failed to present any genuine issues of material fact. The allegations raised and the evidence presented does not state a violation of the Eighth Amendment on the part of Miami-Dade county, and the county was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Therefore, the well-reasoned opinion of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
