Robinson appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal, for lack of jurisdiction, of his Fed. R.CrimP. 35(a) motion, challenging the drug quantity attributable to him for sentencing purposes and his life term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Contrary to Robinson\u2019s argument, because Robinson\u2019s conspiracy offense continued well after November 1, 1987, the version of Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a) applicable to offenses committed after that date applies. Cf<em>. United States v. White, </em>869 F.2d 822, 826 (5th Cir.1989) (holding that the Sentencing Guidelines, effective November 1,1987, applied to case in which conspiracy offense continued after effective date of the Guidelines). Because Robinson\u2019s Fed. R.CrimP. 35(a) motion was not filed within seven days of sentencing, the district court properly dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a); <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>26 F.3d 512, 518-20 &amp; n. 8 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b131-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
