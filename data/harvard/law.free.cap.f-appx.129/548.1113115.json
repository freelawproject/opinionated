The court also concluded that appellee has no duty to indemnify appellants for any damages that may be assessed against them in the wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Appellants challenge the court\u2019s ruling. They contend that appellee has a duty to defend because some of the allegations of their third amended complaint fall within the policy\u2019s coverage (and not the exclusion). They also contend that the court acted prematurely when it held that appellee has no duty to indemnify. We find no merit in appellants\u2019 first contention; it lacks merit for the reasons stated by the district court in its December 15 order. This holding effectively disposes of appellants\u2019 second contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-23\">.
