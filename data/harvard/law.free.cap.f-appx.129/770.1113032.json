Because Mauney was not prejudiced by the alleged failing of his appellate counsel, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The underlying criminal charges against Mauney arose out of his employment as the head of cotton and yarn purchasing for Sara Lee Knit Products, Inc. (Sara Lee). As part of his responsibilities, Mauney was charged with procuring cotton from Sara Lee\u2019s vendors at the price most advantageous to Sara Lee. Unbeknownst to Sara Lee, Mauney received at least $285,759, more than double his annual salary, from these vendors between October 11, 1992 and August 8,1994.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Sara Lee required all of its executives to file annual disclosure statements to help Sara Lee identify and address conflicts of interest. On his disclosure form, Mauney represented that he had received no payments in excess of two hundred dollars from any of Sara Lee\u2019s suppliers, and he disavowed having any interest in or being affiliated with \u201cany vendor, purchaser or competitor\u201d of Sara Lee. (J.A. at 75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">On October 27,1997, Mauney was indicted for mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1346 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2004), wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1343, 1346 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2004), money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1957 (West 2000),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371 (West 2000). The indictment alleged that Mauney had perpetrated a scheme to defraud Sara Lee of its money, property and its right to the honest services of Mauney by virtue of his misrepresentations on Sara Lee\u2019s disclosure form. The indictment did not allege, however, that Mauney\u2019s misrepresentations were material.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">At his trial, Mauney did not deny that he received large payments from Sara Lee\u2019s vendors, but testified that the payments were \u201cconsulting fees\u201d for services that he provided to the vendors on nights and weekends. Mauney argued that the evidence showed that he had no intent to defraud Sara Lee when he made his false disclosure statements because the payments he received did not harm Sara Lee. Instead, Mauney argued, he had always procured cotton at the lowest possible price and had made millions of dollars in profits for Sara Lee. In contrast, the Government argued that, as the indictment alleged, Mauney had forced vendors to pay him kickbacks as a <em>quid pro quo </em>for the award of cotton contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">The district court instructed the jury, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-12\">[A] scheme to defraud includes any scheme to deprive another of money, property, or of the intangible right to honest services by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-13\">A representation may be false when it constitutes a half truth, or effectively conceals a material fact, provided it is made with intent to defraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">(J.A. at 563.) The jury convicted Mauney on all counts on July 24, 1998. On May 21, 1999, the district court sentenced Mauney to seventy-eight months of imprisonment. The district court entered its judgment of conviction on June 10,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>On that same day, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 25, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999), which held that materiality is an element of the federal crimes of mail, wire and bank fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 25. Prior to <em>Neder, </em>the Government was not required to prove materiality as an element of mail and wire fraud in this circuit. <em>See, e.g., United States v. ReBrook, </em>58 F.3d 961, 966 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Believing that <em>Neder </em>significantly raised his chances of prevailing on appeal, Mauney notified his attorney of the decision. Despite this notification, Mauney\u2019s counsel failed to read <em>Neder </em>before filing his opening brief on appeal. Indeed, Mauney\u2019s counsel did not raise <em>Neder </em>in a written filing with this court until he filed a motion to file a rehearing petition out of time, after we had already affirmed Mauney\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Mauney then filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that his attorney rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to argue on appeal that Mauney\u2019s indictment and jury instructions were defective in light of <em>Neder. </em>After holding an evidentiary hearing, a magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny Mauney\u2019s motion. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. We granted Mauney a certificate of appealability, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253 (West Supp.2004). When reviewing a district court\u2019s judgment on a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>94 F.3d 136, 140 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">To establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show, first, that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficiency prejudiced him. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>\u201cperformance\u201d prong, the defendant must demonstrate that his counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d determined by comparison to \u201cprevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688. In addition, the defendant must show under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>\u201cprejudice\u201d prong that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694. If the defendant conclusively fails to demonstrate sufficient prejudice from certain acts or omissions, the court need not decide whether counsel\u2019s performance was, in fact, deficient under <em>Strickland. See id. </em>at 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">The only claim Mauney raises in this appeal is that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that his indictment and jury instructions were defective under <em>Neder. </em>Thus, Mauney must show that his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise <em>Neder </em>was objectively unreasonable<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that, but for his counsel\u2019s deficient performance, there is a reasonable probability that his appeal would have succeeded. Because Mauney did not object to either the jury instructions or his indictment in the district court, Mauney must show that there is a reasonable probability that, had his attorney made those challenges on appeal, we would have found reversible plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Under plain error review, which is authorized by Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) (West Supp.2004), federal appellate courts have only \u201ca limited power to correct errors that were forfeited because [they were] not timely raised in [the] district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (citing Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b)). An appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">An indictment that fails to charge an element of the offense of conviction does not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings if there is \u201coverwhelming\u201d and \u201cessentially uncontroverted\u201d evidence of the missing element. <em>Id. </em>at 633 (quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 470, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)). Similarly, when the district court fails to charge the jury on an element of the offense of conviction, we will not notice the error if the evidence would \u201cpermit no other conclusion\u201d and the defendant\u2019s conviction \u201cwas inevitable\u201d under the correct jury instruction. <em>United States v. Cedelle, </em>89 F.3d 181, 186 (4th Cir.1996); <em>see Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">To determine whether Mauney was prejudiced by his appellate counsel\u2019s failure, we first must determine whether the challenged indictment and jury instructions were plainly erroneous. In <em>Neder, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cmateriality is an element of the federal mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes.\u201d 527 U.S. at 4. Thus, to be guilty of federal mad fraud, wire fraud, or bank fraud, a defendant must have \u201cmisrepresent[ed] or concealed] [a] <em>material </em>fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22. A fact is material \u201cif it has a natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing\u201d the intended victim. <em>Id. </em>at 16 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">In this case, Mauney was alleged to have falsely represented to Sara Lee that he was not receiving payments from Sara Lee\u2019s vendors as part of his scheme to defraud Sara Lee. Thus, under <em>Neder, </em>Mauney could not be found guilty of mail fraud or wire fraud unless the fact that he was receiving substantial payments from Sara Lee\u2019s cotton vendors was material. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on materiality and the indictment\u2019s failure to allege materiality were plain errors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">Nonetheless, if the evidence of the materiality of Mauney\u2019s misrepresentation was \u201coverwhelming\u201d and \u201cessentially uncontroverted,\u201d we would not have noticed the plain errors in Mauney\u2019s indictment and jury instructions on direct appeal, because the errors would not have \u201cseriously af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>fect[ed] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Cotton, 5</em>35 U.S. at 632-33; <em>Cedelle, </em>89 F.3d at 186. Thus, if it was absolutely clear from the record that Sara Lee was \u201ccapable of [being] influenced],\u201d <em>Neder, </em>527 U.S. at 16, by Mauney\u2019s misrepresentation, we would have affirmed Mauney\u2019s conviction. <em>Cotton, </em>535 U.S. at 633; <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We think it beyond serious dispute that a company is capable of being influenced by knowledge of the fact that its purchasing agent is receiving large kickbacks from suppliers. In such a situation, the company would naturally suspect that it would be getting a lower price absent the kickbacks. Certainly, any rational employer that discovers that an employee in charge of purchasing is earning more money from kickbacks than from his salary -will have a \u201cnatural tendency\u201d to put someone else in charge of purchasing and investigate the employee\u2019s conflict of interest. Given that Mauney admitted to receiving over a quarter of a million dollars in payments from Sara Lee\u2019s vendors, we conclude that the evidence of the materiality of his misrepresentation was \u201coverwhelming\u201d and \u201cessentially uncontroverted.\u201d <em>Cotton, </em>535 U.S. at 631. Accordingly, we would not have noticed the defect in Mauney\u2019s indictment had his attorney raised it on direct appeal, because the defect did not \u201cseriously affect[ ] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632-33. Similarly, we would not have noticed the defect in Mauney\u2019s jury instructions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because the evidence would \u201cpermit no other conclusion\u201d than that the kickbacks were material, and Mauney\u2019s conviction \u201cwas inevitable\u201d under proper jury instructions. <em>Cedelle, </em>89 F.3d at 186. Accordingly, Mauney was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the indictment and jury instructions under <em>Neder </em>on direct appeal, and the district court properly denied Mauney\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">As the kickbacks in this case were undisputedly large, Mauney could not credibly argue that the payments he received involved immaterial sums that were incapable of influencing Sara Lee\u2019s decision to retain him and continue entering into contracts tainted by his conflicts of interest. Recognizing this weakness in his position, Mauney instead argues that the absence of a materiality instruction prejudiced him by allowing the jury to convict him solely on the basis of his breach of Sara Lee\u2019s conflict-of-interest policy and without finding that the kickbacks harmed Sara Lee economically. Because of the absence of a materiality instruction, Mauney\u2019s argument goes, the jury could expansively interpret the deprivation of honest services to include any and all violations of company policy. This argument misinterprets the change in law wrought by <em>Neder </em>and its application in Mauney\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">Under the district court\u2019s instructions, to convict Mauney of mail and wire fraud, the jury needed to conclude that Mauney intentionally devised a scheme to defraud Sara Lee, and that Mauney used the mails and interstate wires for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>executing the scheme. The court also instructed the jury that a \u201cscheme to defraud\u201d was one that sought to \u201cdeprive another of money, property, or of the intangible right to honest services by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises.\u201d (J.A. at 563.) Thus, the jury\u2019s guilty verdict necessarily included the following findings: (1) Mauney intentionally devised a scheme; (2) Mauney\u2019s scheme sought to deprive Sara Lee of money, property, or of the intangible right to honest services; and (3) the scheme utilized false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises to accomplish the deprivation. The false representation charged in the indictment was Mauney\u2019s statement that he was not receiving payments from Sara Lee\u2019s vendors. The only additional finding necessary under <em>Neder </em>was that the <em>fact </em>Mauney misrepresented, i.e. his receipt of the kickbacks, was material to the deprivation that his scheme sought to accomplish.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">In other words, the jury <em>found </em>that Mauney <em>intended to deprive </em>Sara Lee of money, property or honest services. To that end, Mauney devised a scheme that relied, in part, on his false representation that he was not receiving payments from Sara Lee\u2019s vendors. So long as Sara Lee\u2019s <em>decision whether to part </em>with money, property, or honest services might have been different if Sara Lee had known that Mauney was receiving kickbacks, the <em>fact </em>that Mauney misrepresented was material. Thus, Mauney\u2019s assertion that the jury could have convicted him solely on the basis of his breach of Sara Lee\u2019s conflict of interest policy does not relate to the <em>materiality </em>of his misrepresentation, but instead it relates to <em>what </em>the jury could have found <em>constituted a deprivation </em>as the object of his scheme. Accordingly, even if Mauney were correct that the jury could have convicted him based solely on his violation of Sara Lee\u2019s conflict of interest policy, he is mistaken that this result obtains from the district court\u2019s failure to charge materiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">In essence, Mauney\u2019s prejudice argument is nothing more than a lamentation that the district court failed to define \u201chonest services\u201d more precisely in its charge to the jury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But <em>Neder </em>did not even discuss the meaning of \u201chonest services\u201d as used in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346, let alone restrict its meaning in the way Mauney advocates. Thus, even if counsel had appealed the district court\u2019s failure to charge the jury that Mauney\u2019s misrepresentation had to be material under <em>Neder, </em>we would not have had occasion to consider whether the district court should have defined honest services more precisely in its jury instructions. Accordingly, the \u201cprejudice\u201d that Mauney complains of did not result from the deficient performance he challenges, <em>i.e., </em>his attorney\u2019s failure to appeal the lack of a materiality instruction under <em>Neder. </em>Because, as we noted above, knowledge of the fact that Mauney was receiving kickbacks unquestionably was \u201ccapable of influencing\u201d Sara Lee\u2019s decision to part with its money, property, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>intangible right to honest services, we would have affirmed Mauney\u2019s conviction and sentence even if Mauney had raised <em>Neder </em>on direct appeal. Because Mauney was not prejudiced by the alleged failing of his appellate counsel, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Because Mauney\u2019s appeal would have been unsuccessful even if his attorney had challenged Mauney\u2019s indictment and jury instructions under <em>Neder, </em>Mauney was not prejudiced by the deficient performance of which he complains in this appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Mauney\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\">. The evidence presented at sentencing supported the district court's finding that Mauney actually received more than $1,000,000 in kickbacks during his tenure as the head of cotton purchasing for Sara Lee. Nonetheless, the indictment alleged that Mauney received $285,759 in kickbacks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b800-15\">. Mauney used several shell corporations and straw men so that his activities would remain undetected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\">. Because we conclude that Mauney has conclusively failed to show that he was prejudiced by his counsel's alleged failing, we need not decide whether Mauney\u2019s counsel was objectively unreasonable when he failed to raise <em>Neder </em>on direct appeal. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b802-5\">. Of course, given the state of the law at the time of Mauney\u2019s trial, we do not fault the district court or trial counsel for failing to recognize these errors. Nonetheless, because <em>Neder </em>issued while Mauney\u2019s case was still pending on direct review, we would have applied it in Mauney\u2019s case. <em>See Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (holding that if \u201claw at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d a district court ruling contrary to the law at the time of appeal is a plain error).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b803-6\">. The Government argues that Mauney\u2019s jury instructions were not defective because the district court charged the jury that \u201c[a] representation <em>may </em>be false when it constitutes a half truth, or effectively conceals a <em>material fact.\" </em>(J.A. at 563 (emphasis added).) Considering the instructions as a whole, however, it is clear that the jury could have convicted Mauney if it found any of the following: (1) Mauney had \"effectively conceal[ed] a material fact\"; (2) Mauney had made a half-true representation; <em>or </em>(3) Mauney had made any other \"false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises.\u201d (J.A. at 563.) Accordingly, Mauney\u2019s jury instructions did not <em>require </em>the jury to find that any false representations related to a <em>material </em>fact, as is mandated by <em>Neder.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b804-5\">. Although Mauney alleged in his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2004) motion that his attorney was ineffective for failing to object to the district court's failure to instruct the jury that an employee deprives his employer of honest services only when he \"breach[es] a fiduciary duty, and ... foresaw or reasonably should have foreseen that his employer might suffer an economic harm as a result of the breach,\u201d <em>United States v. Vinyard, </em>266 F.3d 320, 327 (4th Cir.2001), he has not pursued that claim on appeal. In his opening brief, the only defective performance claimed by Mauney is his counsel's failure to raise <em>Neder </em>on direct appeal. Accordingly, we do not address whether Mauney\u2019s counsel performed deficiently by failing to object to or appeal from the district court's lack of a precise definition of \u201chonest services,\u201d or whether Mauney was prejudiced thereby.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
