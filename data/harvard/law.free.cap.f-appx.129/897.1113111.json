He ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>gues (1) for the first time on appeal that his sentence violates <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); (2) that the district court clearly erred in calculating his base offense level under \u00a7 3582(c)(2); and (3) that the district court abused its discretion in denying him a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The instant appeal therefore has two components: (1) a direct appeal from Privette\u2019s resentencing and (2) an appeal from the denial of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">We hold pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that Privette cannot survive the plain error standard of review, given that he has not borne his burden of showing that the district court \u201cwould have reached a significantly different result\u201d under an advisory scheme and, therefore, that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\"><em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to review of the denial of Privette\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. By its plain language, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not implicated by a decision of the Supreme Court that is unrelated to an actual amendment of the guidelines. We review findings of fact made during a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding for clear error. <em>United States v. Mimms, </em>43 F.3d 217, 220 (5th Cir.1995). We hold that the district court did not clearly err in including the 27 pounds, 11 ounces of amphetamine produced during the conspiracy in the drug quantity calculation for purposes of determining Privette\u2019s base offense level; Charles Apodaca\u2019s testimony on this issue was sufficiently reliable for the district court to make such a finding. Additionally, the district court\u2019s unobjected-to inclusion of 48.5 pounds of phenylacetic acid in the drug quantity calculation was not plainly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Vasquez, </em>216 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s decision to sentence Privette at the bottom of the amended guideline range was not an abuse of discretion given the nature of his offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); <em>United States v. Townsend, </em>55 F.3d 168, 170 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO FILE REPLY BRIEF DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b926-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
