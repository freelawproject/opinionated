In 1995, Outler filed a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 challenging his convictions. The district court recharacterized this motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion and denied it. When Outler filed a \u00a7 2255 motion attacking his conviction in 2004, the district court dismissed this motion as successive. We issued a certificate of appealability (COA) on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">Whether the district court violated <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), by treating appellant\u2019s instant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion as impermissibly successive when the court construed appellant\u2019s previous Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 motion for a new trial as appellant\u2019s \u201cfirst\u201d \u00a7 2255 motion without informing him of the consequences of the recharacterization or giving him the opportunity to withdraw or amend the motion to dismiss?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Neither party has moved to expand the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Outler contends that, because he did not receive notice of the district court\u2019s recharacterization of his 1995 motion and did not have an opportunity to amend or withdraw it, this motion did not render his 2004 motion successive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">A criminal defendant may not file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion unless he first receives leave to do so from the appropriate court of appeals. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>181 F.3d 1274, 1275 (11th Cir.1999). Of course, for a \u00a7 2255 motion to be successive, the defendant must have filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion. In <em>Castro, </em>the Supreme Court placed limits upon when a <em>pro se </em>pleading which a district court recharacterizes as a \u00a7 2255 motion will render subsequent \u00a7 2255 motions successive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">[W]hen a district court recharacterizes a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s motion as a first \u00a7 2255 motion ... the district court must notify the <em>pro se </em>litigant that it intends to recharacterize the pleading, warn the litigant that this recharacterization means that any subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion will be subject to the restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d motions, and provide the litigant an opportunity to withdraw the motion or to amend it so that it contains all the \u00a7 2255 claims he believes he has. If the court fails to do so, the motion cannot be considered to have become a \u00a7 2255 motion for purposes of applying to later motions the law\u2019s \u201csecond or successive\u201d restrictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-11\"><em>Castro, </em>124 S.Ct. at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">The record contains no indication the district court apprised Outler of its intention to recharacterize his 1995 motion, which was filed under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, as a \u00a7 2255 motion. Furthermore, it does not appear Outler was ever warned his 1995 motion would render subsequent \u00a7 2255 motions successive or was given an opportunity to amend or withdraw this motion. Accordingly, the 1995 motion did not render the instant \u00a7 2255 motion successive. Because the district court erred by dismissing Outler\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as successive, we vacate its order dismissing Outler\u2019s motion, and remand for further proceedings. We express no opinion on whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Outler\u2019s motion was timely, an issue which the district court may consider on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\">. The Government argues that, because the instant \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely, the district court\u2019s conclusion this motion was successive was harmless error. We decline to address this argument because it is outside of the scope of the COA. However, the Government is free to raise the timeliness issue on remand. The district court should have the opportunity to address this argument in the first instance and make appropriate factual findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
