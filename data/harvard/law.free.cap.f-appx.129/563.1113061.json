According to his motion, in 1999, he contacted government agents; he offered them information about a gang trafficking drugs; and after the Government orally promised that if he testified before a grand jury, it would move the district court pursuant to Rule 35(b) to reduce his sentence, he appeared before a grand jury. The Government, however, refused to move the court to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The Government filed a response to appellant\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It denied that it had promised appellant anything for appearing before the grand jury and said that the law enforcement officers involved in the case did not believe that appellant had been truthful before the grand jury. In short, the Government\u2019s position was that any assistance appellant had provided law enforcement was worthless.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">On June 3, 2004, the court denied appellant\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion in a written order which stated that it was denying the motion after reviewing \u201cthe pertinent portions of the record and being duly advised in the premises.\u201d On June 9, appellant moved the court for an extension of time to respond to the Government\u2019s response to his May 6 motion. On June 11, appellant appealed the court\u2019s June 3 order. Appellant also moved the court to amend or reconsider that order. On June 21, the court denied as moot appellant\u2019s June 9 motion for an extension of time, and appellant appealed that order. On July 15, the court issued an order denying appellant\u2019s motion to amend or reconsider, and appellant appealed that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Rule 35(b) Reducing a Sentence for Substantial Assistance, states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">(1) In General. Upon the government\u2019s motion made within one year of sentencing, the court may reduce a sentence if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">(A) the defendant, after sentencing, provided substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-11\">(B) reducing the sentence accords with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s guidelines and policy statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\">(2) Later Motion. Upon the government\u2019s motion made more than one year after sentencing, the court may reduce a sentence if the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance involved:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-13\">(A) information not known to the defendant until one year or more after sentencing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-14\">(B) information provided by the defendant to the government within one year of sentencing, but which did not become useful to the government until more than one year after sentencing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-15\">(C) information the usefulness of which could not reasonably have been anticipated by the defendant until more than one year after sentencing and which was promptly provided to the government after its usefulness was reasonably apparent to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-16\">Ten years elapsed between the imposition of appellant\u2019s sentence and the filing of appellant\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion. Thus, the Rule\u2019s subsection (2) governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-17\">In addressing the government\u2019s refusal to file a pre-sentencing substantial-assistance motion pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 (which is akin to the post-sentencing provision of Rule 35(b)), the Supreme Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number><em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 183, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1842, 1844, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992), held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATk\">because we see no reason why courts should treat a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion differently from a prosecutor\u2019s other decisions, we hold that federal district courts have authority to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive. Thus, a defendant would be entitled to relief if a prosecutor refused to file a substantial-assistance motion, say, because of the defendant\u2019s race or religion. It follows that a claim that a defendant merely provided substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Nor would additional but generalized allegations of improper motive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-186, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-1844. A defendant \u201cwould [also] be entitled to relief if the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to move was not rationally related to any legitimate [g]overnment end.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 186, 112 S.Ct. at 1844. Thus, although both \u00a7 5K1.1 and Rule 35(b) contain the limiting phrase \u201cupon motion by the government,\u201d the Article III courts still retain the authority to review the refusal on limited grounds, e.g., an unconstitutional motive. <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-186, 112 S.Ct. at 1844.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">As noted, the basis of appellant\u2019s motion to compel is a breach by the Government of an oral promise to file a Rule 35(b) motion. The question here bods down to whether the district court was required to hold an evidentiary hearing on appellant\u2019s motion. Though we are aware of no decision addressing the issue of when the court must hold an evidentiary hearing on a Rule 35(b) motion, we have considered the issue in the \u00a7 5K1.1 context. <em>United States v. Gonsalves, </em>121 F.3d 1416, 1420 (11th Cir.1997). To obtain an evidentiary hearing, we said, the \u201cdefendant must first put forth evidence of bad faith before the government\u2019s duty to respond, and defendant\u2019s right to reply, are triggered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, appellant failed to produce such evidence. The district court therefore committed no error in denying appellant\u2019s motion for Rule 35(b) relief. Further, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s subsequent motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-25\">. The plea agreement provided that the Government may move the court <em>before </em>sentencing to depart downward from the Guidelines sentence range or the statutorily mandated minimum sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). The plea agreement was silent, however, as to the Government\u2019s discretion to move the district court <em>after </em>sentencing to reduce appellant\u2019s sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\">. The Government also moved the court to unseal the parties' plea agreement. The court granted the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
