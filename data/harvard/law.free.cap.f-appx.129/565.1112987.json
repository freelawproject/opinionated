Following a jury trial, Post was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and sentenced to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. Post initially appealed his conviction but then voluntarily dismissed his direct appeal with prejudice. Instead of proceeding on direct appeal, Post filed a \u00a7 2255 motion alleging that his trial attorneys were ineffective. On June 29, 2000, the district court denied his \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-14\">In June 2004, Post filed a Rule 60(b)(3) motion seeking to vacate the district court\u2019s denial of his original \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court construed Post\u2019s Rule 60(b)(3) motion as another \u00a7 2255 motion and denied it as successive. Thereafter, we granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue: \u201cWhether the district court erroneously found that appellant\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3) motion was an unauthorized successive motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether a district court has jurisdiction over a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims. <em>Fernandez v. United States, </em>941 F.2d 1488, 1491 (11th Cir.1991). We review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). Conversely, \u201cwe review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding <em>de novo </em>and the underlying facts for clear error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-16\">\u201cMost of the provisions of Rule 60(b), which vest courts with broad discretion to reopen judgments on a wide variety of grounds, are inconsistent and irreconcilable with the AEDPA\u2019s purpose, which is to greatly restrict the power of federal courts to award relief to state prisoners who file second or successive habeas corpus applications----\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>366 F.3d 1253, 1271 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 961, 160 L.Ed.2d 896 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, Rule 60(b) mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>tions that are filed to reopen a final habeas judgment are generally \u201ctreated as an application to file a second or successive [habeas] petition\u201d and dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 2244(b). <em>Id. </em>at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Rule 60(b), however, still has \u201csome limited role to play in habeas cases\u201d to the extent that its application is not inconsistent with the AEDPA. <em>Id. </em>at 1272. Rule 60(b) motions are not subject to \u00a7 2244\u2019s prohibition on successive habeas petitions if (1) the motion is based on \u201cclerical errors in the judgment itself\u2019 or (2) \u201cthere was fraud upon the federal court which led to the denial of the habeas petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Post contends that his Rule 60 motion fits into the second exception. This Court made clear in <em>Gonzalez </em>that: \u201c[t]he fraud exception ... applies where the fraud was perpetrated on the federal [habeas] court and resulted in the denial of federal habeas relief, not where the fraud was perpetrated on a [trial] court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284. Yet, Post\u2019s allegations do not state a claim that fraud was perpetrated on the habeas court. Instead, he reframes the ineffective assistance of counsel claims that he made in his prior \u00a7 2255 motion as fraud claims pursuant to Rule 60(b)(8). Our decision in <em>Gonzalez </em>makes clear that such repackaging will not succeed in evading the requirements of the AEDPA. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Post\u2019s Rule 60 motion as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-19\">. In <em>Gonzalez, </em>this Court consolidated the following three cases for rehearing en banc: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number><em>Mobley v. Head, </em>No. 02-14224, <em>Lazo v. United States, </em>No. 02-12483, and <em>Gonzalez v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>No. 02-12054. <em>See Gonzalez v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>326 F.3d 1175 (11th Cir.2003) (en banc) (per curiam). These three cases were resolved by <em>Gonzalez v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>366 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). The Supreme Court has granted certiorari only in the case of <em>Gonzalez. See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 961, 160 L.Ed.2d 896 (2005) (granting certiorari as to Gonzalez); <em>Mobley v. Schofield, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 965, 160 L.Ed.2d 902 (2005) (denying certiorari as to Mobley). (Lazo did not seek certiorari.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-24\">The issue in <em>Gonzalez </em>is whether a Rule 60 motion is the appropriate vehicle to challenge a habeas judgment when there has been \"an intervening change in the law applicable to the original [habeas] petition.\u201d 366 F.3d at 1263. Because Post\u2019s case does not involve an intervening change in the applicable law, it is not affected by the Supreme Court's limited grant of certiorari.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
