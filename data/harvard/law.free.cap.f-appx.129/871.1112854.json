He argues that he is entitled to proceed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 because the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective. He also argues the merits of several claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-24\">Alexander has not met his burden of showing that he meets the requirements for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He has neither pointed to a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited by law nor shown that his claims were foreclosed by circuit law at the time of his conviction, appeal, or first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 903-04 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b899-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
