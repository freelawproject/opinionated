Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Garcia-Rodriguez\u2019 and Toroguet-Cervantes\u2019 convictions and sentences. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Rodriguez, </em>97 Fed.Appx. 904 (11th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Supreme Court vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">On appeal, neither Garcia-Rodriguez or Toroguet-Cervantes asserted error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any other case extending or applying the <em>Apprendi </em>principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005), after the Supreme Court\u2019s remand with instructions to reconsider our opinion in light of <em>Booker, </em>we relied on our earlier case of <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 962, 121 S.Ct. 2621, 150 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001), which observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afl\">Nothing in the <em>Apprendi </em>opinion requires or suggests that we are obligated to consider an issue not raised in any of the briefs that appellant has filed with us. Nor is there anything in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, which is cast in the usual language, requiring that we treat the case as though the <em>Apprendi </em>issue had been timely raised in this Court. In the absence of any requirement to the contrary in either <em>Apprendi </em>or in the order remanding this case to us, we apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-6\"><em>Ardley, </em>242 F.3d at 990 (citations omitted). Thus, because Dockery had not asserted an <em>Apprendi </em>(or its progeny) challenge to his sentence, we reinstated our previous opinion. <em>Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Because neither Garcia-Rodriguez or Toroguet-Cervantes asserted error based on <em>Apprendi </em>(or its progeny) in their appeals, we reinstate our previous opinion this case and affirm, once again, Garcia-Rodriguez\u2019 and Toroguet-Cervantes\u2019 convictions and sentences after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">OPINION REINSTATED IN PART; AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
