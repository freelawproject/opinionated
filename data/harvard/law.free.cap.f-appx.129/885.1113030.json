This court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on Gallow\u2019s claim that Evangeline Parish used a racially discriminatory system in the selection of the grand jury foreperson.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">On appeal from the denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, \u201cthis court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and it reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo, applying the same standard of review to the state court\u2019s decision as the district court.\u201d <em>Robertson v. Cain, </em>324 F.3d 297, 301 (5th Cir.2003). Because the state habeas court decided Gallow\u2019s grand jury discrimination claim on the merits, that court\u2019s decision is entitled to deference under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). <em>See Valdez v. Cockrell, </em>274 F.3d 941, 946 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">In denying COA relief, the district court determined, inter alia, that Gallow had not provided the state habeas court with statistical evidence to support his claim. On appeal Gallow contends that he attached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>statistical evidence to his state habeas petition, and that the evidence shows that Evangeline Parish employed a racially discriminatory system in selecting grand jury forepersons.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">In support of such a claim, a petitioner must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection of a grand jury foreperson by (1) showing that the group against whom discrimination is asserted is a distinct class, singled out for different treatment; (2) proving the degree of under-representation by comparing the proportion of the group in the total population to the proportion called to serve as forepersons over a \u201csignificant period of time\u201d; and (3) showing that the selection procedure is susceptible to abuse or is not race-neutral. <em>See Rose v. Mitchell, </em>443 U.S. 545, 565, 99 S.Ct. 2993, 61 L.Ed.2d 739 (citation omitted); <em>Guice v. Fortenberry, </em>661 F.2d 496, 499 (5th Cir.1981) (en banc) <em>(\u201cGuice I\").</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Gallow has not shown that the district court clearly erred in its determination that he failed to support his claim with statistical data in the state habeas court. <em>See Meanes v. Johnson, </em>138 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1998). Our review of the state habeas record shows that in his efforts to support his claim, Gallow provided the state habeas court with nothing more than a textual discussion of statistics from unspecified sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">In the absence of competent evidence, Gallow\u2019s assertion of racial discrimination is, at best, conclusional, and thus insufficient to obtain habeas relief. <em>See Ellis v. Lynaugh, </em>873 F.2d 830, 839 (5th Cir.1989). In view of the deficiency of proof submitted by Gallow, we agree with the district court that the state habeas court\u2019s determination that Gallow failed to establish a prima facie case for his claim of discrimination in the grand jury foreman selection process was not \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d apd that the state habeas court\u2019s adjudication of the claim did not \u201cresult[] in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b914-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
