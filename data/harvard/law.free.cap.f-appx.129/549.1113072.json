R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion for reconsideration of the dismissal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">Cruz filed a \u00a7 1983 action alleging that Miami-Dade County\u2019s deduction of a $2 subsistence fee from his prison account, while he was in the county jail, violated his First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The magistrate judge recommended that the case be dismissed for failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), essentially because Cruz could not use \u00a7 1983 to challenge state law violations and Cruz was not alleging that the state law itself was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">In Cruz\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendations, he argued that the magistrate judge erred because: (1) he alleged a constitutional violation as his complaint alleged violations of his First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights; (2) state officials violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights by not following state laws and regulations; (3) the state law required that anyone with a U.S. Marshal hold be exempt from the $2 fee; and (4) he tried to use the grievance procedure, but prison officials did not respond to his grievances, which violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights. In a motion to amend the memorandum of law in support of the \u00a7 1983 complaint, Cruz also argued that the magistrate judge erred by determining that the district court did not have jurisdiction over the plaintiff. In adopting the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, the district court agreed with the magistrate judge that Cruz was not challenging the constitutionality of the state regulation but merely challenging the application of the state law to him, which was not a cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">Having reviewed the record, we find no error in any of the district court\u2019s rulings resulting in the dismissal of the complaint in this case. We also conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing the complaint without granting leave to amend because Cruz never filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>motion to amend his complaint. <em>Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Industries America Corp., </em>314 F.3d 541, 542 (11th Cir.2002) (en banc). Finally, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Cruz\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion for reconsideration. \u201cMotions for reconsideration should not be used to raise legal arguments which could and should have been made before the judgement was issued. Denial of a motion for reconsideration is especially sound[ ] when the party has failed to articulate any reason for the failure to raise the issue at an earlier stage in the litigation.\u201d <em>See Sanderlin v. Seminole Tribe of Florida, </em>243 F.3d 1282, 1292 (11th Cir.2001) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
