This court lacks jurisdiction to review Mutagwanya\u2019s claim that the BIA erred in denying her request for voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B); <em>Eyoum v. INS, </em>125 F.3d 889, 891 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-17\">Mutagwanya argues that the immigration judge (IJ) and the BIA (which upheld the IJ determination) erred by failing to make a finding regarding her credibility. She also argues that they erred in rejecting her claims based on her failure to provide corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-18\">The court conducts a <em>de novo </em>review of the BIA\u2019s legal rulings but \u201cwill defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration regulations if the interpretation is reasonable.\u201d <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). Fact findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard requires only that the decision have some basis in fact in the record. <em>Renteria-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>322 F.3d 804, 816 (5th Cir.2002). It does not require this court to agree with the decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-19\">The IJ determined that absent corroborating evidence, he did not find Mutagwanya\u2019s testimony sufficient to warrant relief. Section 208.13(a) \u201cplainly indicates that if the trier of fact either does not believe the applicant or does not know what to believe, the applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony can be fatal to his [] application.\u201d <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1090 (9th Cir.2000)(cited with approval in <em>Beganovic v. Ashcroft, </em>106 Fed.Appx. 279 (5th Cir.2004)(unpublished)). When it is reasonable to expect that such evidence exists, an applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>should provide corroborating evidence relevant to the specifics of his allegations, or he should provide an explanation of why he did not provide such evidence. <em>Matter of S-M-J, 21 </em>I. &amp; N. Dec. 722, 725-26 (BIA 1997); <em>see also In re Y-B, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1136, 1139 (BIA 1998)(noting that the weaker the alien\u2019s testimony the greater the need for corroborating evidence). However, even assuming that the IJ erred in rejecting Mutagwanya\u2019s claim based on insufficient corroboration, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Mutagwanya failed to show a clear probability of persecution upon her return to Uganda. <em>See Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 666-67 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Renteria-Gonzalez, </em>322 F.3d at 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Mutagwanya also argues that she should have been granted relief under the CAT because she testified to \u201cpast torture\u201d and because arbitrary arrests still occur in Uganda. The standard for granting relief under the CAT requires an alien to show \u201c \u2018that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. The testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002)(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)). Torture is \u201can extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishments that do not amount to torture.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(2). Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that the incidents related by Mutagwanya did not warrant relief under the CAT. <em>See id.; Renteria-Gonzalez, 322 </em>F.3d at 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b928-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
