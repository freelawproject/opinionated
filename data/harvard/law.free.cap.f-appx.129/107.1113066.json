Barraza argues that he was entitled to a two-level reduction in his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 because, as a courier, he was a minor participant in a drug-smuggling operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">Whether a defendant is entitled to a \u00a7 3B1.2 adjustment \u201cturns upon culpability, not courier status.\u201d <em>United States v.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-15\"><em>Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989). \u201c[T]o qualify as a minor participant, a defendant must have been peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 446-47 (5th Cir.2001). In light of Barraza\u2019s admission that, had he successfully crossed the border in his courier status, he would have accepted even more money to to continue on another leg of the trip, the district court did not clearly err when it denied the reduction. <em>See United States v. Deavours, </em>219 F.3d 400, 404 (5th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b136-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
