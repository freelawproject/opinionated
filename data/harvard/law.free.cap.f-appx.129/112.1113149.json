Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In the appellant\u2019s brief he did claim that the sentence above the guideline range would be forbidden by the Supreme Court when it decided <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>because his waiver should be treated as allowing appeal if the guideline range was exceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-27\">We reject the argument that the waiver allowed an appeal of a sentence below the statutory maximum because it exceeded the guideline range. The plea agreement expressly named the statutory maximum as what he accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-28\">Having bound himself to the sentence without appeal, we would hold no plain error if we were to accord Harrington jurisdiction to appeal. However, we see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the appeal as we did before: barred by the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b140-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
