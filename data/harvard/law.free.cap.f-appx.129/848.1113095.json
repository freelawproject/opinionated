Artis asserts that the district court erred by permitting admission of a certified copy of Artis\u2019s prior conviction for possession of a firearm while in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>possession of cocaine. Artis contends that admission of this evidence violated Federal Rule of Evidence 609 and unfairly tainted his trial. After consideration of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The district court actually admitted the evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which prohibits evidence of prior conduct proving the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therein, but permits evidence of prior conduct if it is (1) relevant, (2) \u201cprobative of an essential claim or an element of the offense,\u201d (3) reliable, and (4) its probative value is not \u201csubstantially outweighed by confusion or unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 997 (4th Cir.1997). In addition, the evidence necessary to prove a defendant\u2019s lack of credibility is an issue separate from character that satisfies Rule 404(b). <em>United States v. Lamarr, </em>75 F.3d 964, 970-71 (4th Cir.1996). The district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence of prior bad acts under Rule 404(b) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Queen, </em>132 F.3d at 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Here, Artis testified that, although he had sold crack cocaine in the past, he never carried a gun while selling crack cocaine because he did not need one, and he did not know what an \u201ceight ball\u201d was. Artis\u2019s prior conviction was inconsistent with his assertions that he did not need a gun, did not know how crack cocaine was measured, and had never possessed a gun while selling crack cocaine. Although Artis argues that his testimony concerned possession of a firearm during a drug sale while his prior conviction involved only drug and firearm possession, his testimony that he did not need to carry a firearm in connection with drug dealing was clearly inconsistent with his prior conviction for possession of a firearm in connection with a drug offense. Applying the principles of Rule 404(b) discussed above, we find that the district did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Artis\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b877-7\"> Rule 609 does not address or prevent the introduction of prior convictions offered to prove the falsity of defendant\u2019s testimony. <em>United States v. Norton, </em>26 F.3d 240, 243-44 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
