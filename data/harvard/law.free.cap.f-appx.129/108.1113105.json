Dr. Rahi contends: the <em>third amended eomplaint </em>did not allege sufficient facts to establish a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; and he is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-16\">We must, of course, consider the basis for our jurisdiction. <em>Jackson v. City of Atlanta, Tex., </em>73 F.3d 60, 62 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 818, 117 S.Ct. 70, 136 L.Ed.2d 30 (1996). In general, we have jurisdiction of \u201cappeals from all final decisions of the district courts\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The denial of a claim of qualified immunity is an appealable final decision, provided that denial is based on a purely legal issue. <em>Jackson, </em>73 F.3d at 62-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-17\">The interlocutory order granted plaintiffs leave to file a third amended complaint. It did not discuss Dr. Rahi\u2019s qualified immunity claims; it declined to adopt the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation for dismissal of individual-capacity claims against Dr. Rahi based only on the grant of leave to amend. Of course, an order granting leave to amend is not appealable. <em>See Levy v. Securities &amp; Exchange Comm\u2019n, </em>405 F.2d 484, 485-86 (5th Cir.1968); <em>see also Reed v. National Old Line Ins. Co., </em>239 F.2d 594, 596 (5th Cir.1956). And, as stated, Dr. Rahi contests the alle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>gations in the third amended complaint, for which qualified immunity has not been requested from the district court. In sum, we lack jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b137-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
