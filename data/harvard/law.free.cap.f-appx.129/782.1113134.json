After unsuccessfully challenging his murder conviction in state court on direct review and in state habeas proceedings, Simpson filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 (West 1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2004). The district court denied his application for relief, and declined to issue a certificate of appealability. We granted a e\u00e9rtificate of appealability to review three claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (West Supp.2004). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">On August 27, 1984, Simpson and his sixteen-year-old girlfriend, Stephanie Yvette Eury, forced their way into the home of Reverend Jean Ernest Darter, a 92-year-old retired minister, burglarized the home, and murdered Reverend Darter.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Doris Faircloth, the victim\u2019s daughter, became concerned when she could not reach her father by telephone, and she and her husband drove to the victim\u2019s home that evening. As they entered the home, they observed that all of the lights were off except for a bathroom light. Reverend Darter was found lying across his bed with a strap tying his neck to the bedpost. According to Ms. Faircloth, what she saw was \u201c \u2018so horrible that [she] seemed not to be able to see it all collectively,\u2019 \u201d but rather \u201c \u2018in bits and pieces.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Simpson, </em>341 N.C. 316, 462 S.E.2d 191, 197 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Officers responding to the murder scene found no signs of forced entry. The telephone cords in the hall and bedroom had been cut. In one bedroom, the sheets and covers on the bed were wadded up, the dresser drawers had been pulled out, and the contents from the drawers had been dumped onto the floor. A number of knives were found lying in the kitchen sink and the freezer and refrigerator doors were cracked open. In a storage area adjacent to the kitchen, the officers found a carton of glass Tab bottles with one bottle missing. A pack of razor blades was in the bathroom sink. The officers also found a writing pad with the names \u201cLisa Marie Johnson\u201d and \u201cCurtis Anthony Parker\u201d written on it. Reverend Darter was found lying on his bed, with his feet on the floor. The scene was further described by the North Carolina Supreme Court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-10\">Two belts were wrapped around Reverend Darter\u2019s neck. The outer belt was the largest and thickest, and it was tied to the bedpost. The inner belt was broken. Reverend Darter\u2019s face was bloated and bloody. He had glass in his left eye, and a design composed of many small circles and dots was imprinted on the Reverend\u2019s left cheek. Both of the Reverend\u2019s arms were cut open from his elbows to his wrists. Blood was on the bed and had run down the side of the bed and formed a puddle on the floor; there was blood on the walls and window blinds. Also on the bed were the contents of two dresser drawers, shattered glass, the Reverend\u2019s broken glasses, his false teeth, a razor blade, and the neck of a glass Tab bottle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">Eight latent fingerprints and Reverend Darter\u2019s telephone bill led police investigators to Simpson. According to the telephone bill, a long-distance telephone call had been placed on the day before the murder from Reverend Darter\u2019s house to a telephone number belonging to a woman named Ruby Locklear in Greensboro, North Carolina, When questioned, Ms. Locklear told the officers that Simpson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>would occasionally call her from Reidsville when he wanted to reach his father. The fingerprints matched those of Simpson.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">An autopsy performed by pathologist Michael James Shkrum revealed further details of the gruesome crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuL\">[T]he Reverend sustained blunt-trauma injuries to his face causing swelling and bruising. The bone between the eye socket and the brain was fractured, the cheek and the jaw bone were broken, and the Reverend\u2019s tongue was torn. Strangulation bruises appeared on the neck. It was Dr. Shkrum\u2019s opinion that Reverend Darter died from ligature strangulation, and that it would have taken several minutes for his heart to stop beating. It was Dr. Shkrum\u2019s further opinion that Reverend Darter experienced pain. Dr. Shkrum also testified that because Reverend Darter sustained bruising around his face, his heart was still beating when those injuries were inflicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anb\"><em>Id. </em>at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">During the investigation, officers discovered that there was an outstanding warrant for Simpson in Greensboro for simple assault. Simpson was arrested on September 21, 1984, and advised of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). He initially claimed to know nothing about the murder, denied ever having met or seen Reverend Darter, and denied ever having been inside Reverend Darter\u2019s home. After he was transported to Greensboro for a bond hearing on the simple assault charge, however, Simpson agreed to talk with the officers about the Darter murder and ultimately executed a sixteen-page, detailed written statement confessing to the crime. The North Carolina Supreme Court summarized the confession as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARC\">Defendant confessed that on 26 August 1984, he and his pregnant, sixteen-year-old girlfriend, Stephanie Eury, went for a walk to look for some money. Stephanie went to the front door of Reverend Darter\u2019s house and rang the doorbell. She told Reverend Darter she was hungry, so he brought her a diet soft drink and gave the defendant a glass of milk. Stephanie asked if they could come inside, so the three went into the front living room. Stephanie told the Reverend that she and defendant were traveling to Florida and had gotten stuck in Reidsville. The Reverend suggested they contact the Salvation Army or the police. Stephanie asked Darter if he could give them some money, and Reverend Darter gave her four dollars, explaining that was all the money he had in cash. Defendant told police that he and Stephanie \u201cnoticed the preacher had a nice home.\u201d After getting permission to use the telephone, defendant called Ruby Locklear in Greensboro to see if she had seen defendant\u2019s father. When defendant got off of the telephone, he heard Stephanie tell the Reverend her name was \u201cLisa\u201d and defendant\u2019s name was \u201cCurtis Anthony.\u201d Defendant watched the Reverend write these names down on a pad of paper. Defendant told the police that before he and Stephanie left the house, the Reverend gave them some sponge cake and peaches to take with them. Defendant admitted that \u201cReverend Darter was real friendly to us and was very helpful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-10\">The next day, 27 August 1984, defendant said that he and Stephanie \u201cboth talked about going back to preacher Darter\u2019s house to get some money. Stephanie and I decided we would go back to Darter\u2019s house and we would not come back empty-handed no matter what.\u201d Defendant told police that he and Stephanie walked around outside waiting for it to get dark. Once it was dark enough, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>two walked to Reverend Darter\u2019s house, looking around to make sure no one saw them. They rang the doorbell, and when Reverend Darter answered the door, they forced their way inside. Reverend Darter ran to the telephone, but defendant \u201cpulled the preacher\u2019s hands off the telephone.\u201d Defendant told Stephanie to cut the telephone cords, and in the meantime, he was \u201cstruggling with Preacher Darter holding onto the preacher\u2019s arms to control him and force him back in his bedroom so he would tell me where some money was.\u201d Defendant held the Reverend down on the bed, with his hands around his neck, telling him he wanted money \u201cor else,\u201d but the Reverend told defendant he did not have any money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-4\">The Reverend told defendant that if he was killed, he knew he was going to heaven. Defendant told the police, \u201cthis frustrated me and I grabbed him tighter around the throat.\u201d Defendant reached across the bed and got a belt and \u201clooped it around his neck and tightened the belt.\u201d While he held the belt tight, defendant rummaged through two dresser drawers Stephanie had dumped onto the bed. Not finding anything he wanted, defendant drew the \u201cbelt more tight around his neck and I told the preacher he had better tell us where some more money was but the preacher could not talk because he was choking.\u201d When the first belt broke, defendant got another, thicker belt \u201cand looped this leather belt around the preacher\u2019s neck and tightened up on this leather belt. Then I called Stephanie to bring me something in the bedroom to kill this preacher with.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-5\">When defendant did not receive any weapon to his liking, he called for Stephanie to come and hold the belt while he \u201cwent in the kitchen and looked for some device to beat the old preacher and finish him off.\u201d He picked up a full pop bottle and then decided to put it back and get an empty bottle. He returned to the bedroom, pulled tight on the belt, and \u201chit the old preacher hard three times with this bottle and on the third blow the soft drink bottle broke.\u201d Defendant then decided to tie the end of the belt to the bedpost, and he went into the bathroom and got a double-edged razor blade. \u201cI held this double-edged razor blade between my right index finger and right thumb and then I sliced the preacher\u2019s arms from the biceps all of the way.down the under side of the forearms to the wrist. I cut both of the preacher\u2019s arms.\u201d Stephanie gathered a bag of food, a porcelain lamp, a radio, and boxes of Kleenex and packed them in a plastic laundry basket. \u201cThe last thing we did before leaving the preacher\u2019s house was to turn off all the lights except the bathroom light.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-7\"><em>Simpson, </em>462 S.E.2d at 198-99. According to one officer, when Simpson read the statement out loud to check for mistakes he laughed when he came to a portion of the statement where he had used profanity-</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">On March 4, 1985, Simpson entered a plea of guilty to first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and armed robbery. Under a plea agreement, Simpson reserved his right to appeal from the state trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress his confession and the state dismissed the charge of first-degree burglary. A sentencing hearing was held, at the conclusion of which the jury returned a verdict recommending a sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">On July 7, 1987, the Supreme Court of North Carolina rejected Simpson\u2019s appeal of the order refusing to suppress his confession and affirmed the convictions, but vacated the sentence of death and remand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>ed for a new sentencing hearing due to an error that had occurred during closing argument. <em>See State v. Simpson, </em>320 N.C. 313, 357 S.E.2d 332 (1987), <em>cert. denied, Simpson v. North Carolina, </em>485 U.S. 963, 108 S.Ct. 1230, 99 L.Ed.2d 430 (1988). A second sentencing hearing was held in May 1989, and Simpson again received a sentence of death. This time, the Supreme Court of North Carolina vacated the sentence and remanded for a new sentencing hearing due to an error under <em>McKoy v. North Carolina, </em>494 U.S. 433, 110 S.Ct. 1227, 108 L.Ed.2d 369 (1990). <em>See State v. Simpson, </em>331 N.C. 267, 415 S.E.2d 351, 353 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">In January 1993, Simpson\u2019s third sentencing proceeding took place. In mitigation, Simpson presented testimony of various persons who knew him. during his childhood and his case manager at the prison where he had been incarcerated pending trial. The heart of the case in mitigation, however, centered on the testimony of Ms. Joan Landreth, a social worker, and Dr. Claudia Coleman, a clinical psychologist. In summary, Ms. Landreth related to the jury that Simpson had been removed from his mother at birth and placed into the North Carolina foster care system, where he languished for the rest of his childhood. Dr. Coleman opined that this background, along with a personality disorder, exacerbated Simpson\u2019s severe and untreated attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) causing him to suffer from severe mental and emotional disturbances and an impaired ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">At the conclusion of the sentencing Hearing, the jury found as aggravating factors that the murder of Reverend Darter was committed by Simpson while he was engaged in the commission of robbery and that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. The jury found thirteen mitigating circumstances: (1) that the murder was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance; (2) that the defendant aided in the apprehension of another capital felon; (3) that the mental or emotional age of the defendant at the time of the murder was a mitigating circumstance; (4) that the defendant\u2019s development was adversely affected by the lack of permanence in his life resulting from frequent changes in foster home and school placements; (5) that the defendant was taken into and removed from the home and care of his grandmother during which time his brother, Daryl, continued to remain in the home and care of his grandmother; (6) that the defendant experienced mental or emotional disturbance beginning at an early age; (7) that the defendant\u2019s mental or emotional disturbance adversely affected his ability to perform in school; (8) that the defendant\u2019s mental or emotional disturbance adversely affected his ability to sustain employment; (9) that the defendant\u2019s behavior has improved during times when he was in a structured environment; (10) that prior to his arrest for murder, the defendant freely and voluntarily confessed, both orally and in writing, to his involvement in the murder; (11) that the defendant did not minimize his personal culpability for the murder in the course of his confession; (12) that the defendant voluntarily consented to a search of his portion of the Eury residence for evidence of the robbery and murder; and (13) that the defendant voluntarily entered a plea of guilty to the offenses of murder, armed robbery, and conspiracy to commit murder. However, the jury unanimously decided that the aggravating circumstances outweighed these mitigating circumstances and recommended that Simpson be sentenced to death for the murder of Reverend Darter.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>On direct appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court, Simpson asserted, among other claims, that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecution to cross-examine Dr. Coleman about diagnoses and opinions of other physicians and psychologists which were contained within the reports she had reviewed and erred in refusing to allow Ms. Landreth to testify regarding several additional matters that he contends would have had mitigating value. The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed Simpson\u2019s death sentence, <em>see Simpson, </em>462 S.E.2d at 200, and the United States Supreme Court denied Simpson\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, <em>see Simpson v. North Carolina, </em>516 U.S. 1161, 116 S.Ct. 1048, 184 L.Ed.2d 194 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">In 1997, Simpson was appointed new legal counsel and initiated state post-conviction proceedings by filing a motion for appropriate relief (\u201cMAR\u201d) in the North Carolina Superior Court. The motion alleged, among other things, that Simpson\u2019s plea of guilty entered in 1985 was not the result of a knowing and informed decision because he did not fully understand the consequences of pleading guilty. The state MAR court denied Simpson post-conviction relief and the North Carolina Supreme Court denied review. <em>See State v. Simpson, </em>350 N.C. 848, 539 S.E.2d 648 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254, Simpson filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court on August 27, 1999. The district court denied the petition, and declined to issue a certificate of appealability under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253. We then granted a certificate of appealability to address Simpson\u2019s constitutional claims that (1) his death sentence violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment because the state trial court allowed the prosecution to cross-examine Dr. Coleman concerning the diagnoses and opinions of other providers; (2) his Eighth Amendment right to introduce evidence in mitigation was violated by the trial court\u2019s exclusion of certain testimony by Ms. Landreth; and (3) that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Pursuant to the limits on federal habeas review of a state conviction, when a habeas petitioner\u2019s claim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State Court proceedings,\u201d we may not grant relief unless that adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court\u2019s decision is contrary to clearly established federal law under \u00a7 2254(d) where it \u201capplies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth\u201d by the United States Supreme Court or \u201cconfronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of [the Supreme Court] and nevertheless arrives at a result different from [that] precedent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405-06. A state court\u2019s decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law \u201cif the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from [the Supreme] Court\u2019s cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407. Factual determinations made by the state court \u201cshall be presumed to be correct,\u201d and \u201c[t]he applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>dence.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(e)(1) (West Supp.2004). In cases where \u00a7 2254(d) provides no barrier to habeas relief and it is determined that a constitutional error occurred in the state court proceedings, the petitioner must also show \u201cthat the error had a \u2018substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Fullwood v. Lee, </em>290 F.3d 663, 679 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">We begin with Simpson\u2019s claim that his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated because the trial court permitted the prosecution to cross-examine his expert, Dr. Claudia Coleman, about diagnoses and opinions of mental health professionals who had examined Simpson prior to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Dr. Coleman is an expert in clinical psychology, neurological psychology, and forensic psychology. She was retained in 1989, five years after the murder of Reverend Darter, to interview and evaluate Simpson for purposes of mitigation. Dr. Coleman reviewed Simpson\u2019s history, medical records, and social services records, and conducted a psychological examination. On direct examination, Dr. Coleman testified that, based upon her evalu\u00e1tion, it was her opinion that Simpson suffered from severe ADHD, and that this condition, left untreated, had resulted in destructive, aggressive, and disruptive behavior which was further exacerbated by Simpson\u2019s unstable social environment and a mixed personality disorder. As a result, Dr. Coleman opined that Simpson suffered from severe mental and emotional disturbances at the time of the murder and that his capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned Dr. Coleman about the medical records and social services records that she had compiled, reviewed, and relied upon during the course of her evaluation and, in particular, questioned her about the diagnoses and opinions recorded by the physicians and psychologists in those records. Dr. Coleman acknowledged that she had relied upon information contained within the reports in formulating her expert opinions, but testified that she disagreed with the information contained within them that contradicted her diagnosis of ADHD. The prosecution utilized this cross-examination to point out that none of the prior professionals had arrived at a diagnosis of ADHD and to suggest that the jury reject Dr. Coleman\u2019s opinions offered in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">The Sixth Amendment provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. At the time of Simpson\u2019s third sentencing hearing, an unavailable hearsay declarant\u2019s statement was admissible \u201conly if it [bore] adequate \u2018indicia of reliability.\u2019\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). Reliability could be established if the evidence fell \u201cwithin a firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or if there was \u201ca showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>On direct appeal, the North Carolina Supreme Court rejected Simpson\u2019s claim that the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Coleman \u201cresulted in a violation of his constitutional right to confrontation,\u201d and held that \u201c[pjursuant to [North Carolina Rule of Evidence] 705, Dr. Coleman was properly cross-examined about other diagnoses contained within psychiatric reports upon which she relied, although she ultimately formed a differing diagnosis.\u201d <em>Simpson, </em>462 S.E.2d at 213. In doing so, the state court noted that the case was indistinguishable from <em>State v. Allen, </em>322 N.C. 176, 367 S.E.2d 626, 630-31 (1988), which had held that such contrary opinions contained within the records and reports relied upon by an expert may be highlighted for the purpose of impeaching the expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">On federal habeas, Simpson argues that the state court applied an improper evidentiary standard of review as evidenced by its reference to <em>Allen </em>and the absence of any explicit analysis as to whether the contrary opinions and diagnoses introduced via the cross-examination of Dr. Coleman fell \u201cwithin a firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or otherwise contained \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d as required under <em>Roberts. </em>Consequently, he argues, the North Carolina court\u2019s adjudication of his claim was \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established Supreme Court precedent, and that we should grant habeas relief because the opinions and diagnoses of the other mental health providers met neither of the exceptions set forth in <em>Roberts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">We disagree. Although the North Carolina Supreme Court did not explicitly reference the <em>Roberts </em>inquiry, we cannot conclude from this omission that it rested its determination solely upon a conclusion that the cross-examination was appropriate under state evidentiary rules. <em>See Bell v. Cone, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 125 S.Ct. 847, 853, 160 L.Ed.2d 881 (2005) (per curiam) (noting that \u201c[fjederal courts are not free to presume that a state court did not comply with constitutional dictates on the basis of nothing more than a lack of citation\u201d). Nor can we otherwise conclude that the state court\u2019s adjudication of the constitutional claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to or an unreasonable application of the principles of <em>Roberts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">Under the North Carolina Rules of Evidence, \u201c[t]he facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to him at or before the hearing\u201d and, \u201c[i]f of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 703. The expert is \u201crequired to disclose such underlying facts or data on direct examination or voir dire before stating the opinion,\u201d if the adverse party requests, and \u201cmay in any event be required to disclose the underlying facts or data on cross-examination.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">Here, the North Carolina Supreme Court clearly identified the issue before it as a Confrontation Clause challenge to the admissibility of the underlying statements on cross-examination. Only then did it turn to a discussion of North Carolina\u2019s Rules of Evidence and its <em>Allen </em>decision. In <em>Allen, </em>the North Carolina court had noted little distinction between the \u201creasonable reliance\u201d standard articulated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>North Carolina\u2019s rule of evidence governing expert testimony and the \u201cinherently rehable\u201d standard it had applied to such testimony prior to the adoption of the rule. And in <em>State v. Huffstetler, </em>312 N.C. 92, 322 S.E.2d 110 (1984), cited in <em>Allen, </em>the court had specifically rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that his Sixth Amendment \u201cright to confront his accusers\u201d was violated \u201cbecause he could not cross examine the person who actually performed some of the tests\u201d upon which the expert witness had relied. <em>Id. </em>at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Under a fair reading of the North Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s decision in this case, and the <em>Allen </em>and <em>Huffstetler </em>cases cited therein, it is apparent that the North Carolina court was well aware of the Confrontation Clause claim before it, and followed its prior holdings that reports which are of the \u201ctype reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences\u201d are \u201cinherently reliable.\u201d As such, they may be brought out by the proponent on direct examination, or by the adverse party on cross-examination, pursuant to Rule 703 or 705, without running afoul of the Confrontation Clause. We cannot say that this adjudication of Simpson\u2019s confrontation claim is contrary to <em>Roberts </em>simply because it referenced state evidentiary rules in the analysis, nor do we view its adjudication of the claim as having resulted in a decision that was unreasonable in light of the governing Supreme Court precedents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">Simpson next argues that he is entitled to habeas relief because the state trial court excluded allegedly relevant mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his trial, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">Under the Eighth Amendment, juries may not be precluded from considering any relevant, mitigating \u201cfacets of the character and record of the individual offender\u201d during capital sentencing proceedings. <em>Skipper v. South Carolina, </em>476 U.S. 1, 8, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986); see <em>also Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 113-14, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982) (\u201cJust as the State may not by statute preclude the sentencer from considering any mitigating factor, neither may the sentencer refuse to consider, <em>as a matter of law, </em>any relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d); <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 978 (1978) (holding that juries may \u201cnot be precluded from considering, <em>as a mitigating factor, </em>any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>basis for a sentence less than death\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">During the penalty phase of Simpson\u2019s trial, the prosecution presented overwhelming evidence of the brutal nature of this crime, not the least of which was Simpson\u2019s sixteen-page detailed confession of the events. Simpson\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim arises from limitations placed by the trial court upon the scope of the testimony offered by Simpson\u2019s social worker, Ms. Landreth.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Ms. Landreth\u2019s testimony regarding Simpson was derived from his foster care records and her personal interactions with him from the time that he was ten years old until he was seventeen years old. Specifically, she testified that Simpson was placed into the foster care system when he was ten days old, and that he remained there until he reached the age of majority. She offered extensive and detailed testimony regarding the difficulties that her office had in establishing a permanent plan for Simpson and the frequent relocations of Simpson within the foster care system, including brief stays with his grandmother that did not work out for him and that were particularly disappointing to him. She also testified regarding the effect these moves had upon his education and, in particular, testified that he developed academic and behavioral problems during this time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Ms. Landreth also provided testimony regarding Simpson\u2019s family history. She testified that Simpson\u2019s older brother Joe, Jr., had been institutionalized, that Simpson\u2019s grandmother kept and raised his older brother Daryl, that his younger brother Anthony had been released to be adopted, and that his younger sister Charita was allowed to live with and be raised by their mother. However, Ms. Landreth testified that neither of Simpson\u2019s parents wanted to release him for adoption. She testified that Simpson was aware of the location of his siblings as he grew up, and that she and Simpson \u201coften talked about his brothers and sisters and his family.\u201d J.A. 144. According to Ms. Landreth, Simpson \u201chad a great deal of frustration and a great deal of lack of understanding about why his siblings could be raised by family members and he could not be.\u201d J.A. 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Simpson\u2019s specific complaint stems from the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow Ms. Landreth <em>also </em>to testify that Simpson had been placed in foster care immediately upon his birth because his parents had severely abused his older brother Joe, Jr., and to allow Ms. Landreth to elaborate upon a conversation she had with Simpson about the adoption decision made by his parents. On voir dire, Ms. Landreth testified that Simpson had a number of questions as to why he could not stay in one place, which led to discussions about adoption and his parents\u2019 unwillingness to give him up for adoption. However, Ms. Landreth testified that \u201c[h]is reaction was not to not being adopted, but rather to not having a permanent place to stay, and his reactions ranged from being really sad and tearful to being very angry.\u201d J.A. 98. Simpson also takes issue with the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow Ms. Landreth, who had been qualified as an expert in child placement and permanency planning, to testify that Simpson was under the influence of mental and emotional disturbances as he grew up and that his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">The state trial court ruled that Ms. Landreth could testify that Simpson was placed into foster care at birth and to testify without restriction \u201cabout any discussion she had about his being moved so many times and his reaction to that.\u201d J.A. 100. However, the court ruled that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>abuse of Joe, Jr., prior to Simpson\u2019s birth was not relevant, mitigating evidence, and that Simpson\u2019s parents\u2019 refusal to release him for adoption was not admissible because this was something Ms. Landreth had told Simpson in response to questions he had asked about the lack of a permanent place to stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">On direct appeal, the North Carolina Supreme Court rejected Simpson\u2019s claim with regard to the first two categories of evidence, holding that Ms. Landreth\u2019s additional testimony regarding Joe, Jr., and Simpson\u2019s parents was not relevant to the mitigation of Simpson\u2019s crime. With regard to the balance of the excluded testimony by Ms. Landreth, the North Carolina Supreme Court assumed, without deciding, that it was error for the trial court to exclude the evidence, but concluded that any error was harmless because the testimony would have been merely cumulative of Dr. Coleman\u2019s expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">On federal habeas review, we must deny relief if the North Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s adjudication of Simpson\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim resulted in a decision that was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. However, even if we assume that the excluded testimony of Ms. Landreth would have supported one or more of the mitigating circumstances Simpson offered to the jury, we must still deny habeas relief unless \u201cthe error had a \u2018substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict,\u2019 \u201d <em>Fullwood, </em>290 F.3d at 679 (quoting <em>Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 637), or we are \u201cin \u2018grave doubt\u2019 as to the harmlessness of [the] error,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, </em>513 U.S. 432, 436, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-7\">In order for an error to have a substantial and injurious effect or influence, it must have affected the verdict. Because juries have a limited number of responses to give in a criminal trial \u2014 guilty, innocent, or cannot decide \u2014 an error is harmless when the error did not substantially sway or substantially influence the response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-9\">Thus, if the evidence is not merely sufficient, but so powerful, overwhelming, or cumulative that the error simply could not reasonably be said to have substantially swayed the jury\u2019s judgment, then the error is not harmful. On the other hand, if the federal court is in grave doubt about whether the trial error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the verdict and therefore finds itself in virtual equipoise about the issue, the error is not harmless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-10\"><em>Cooper v. Taylor, </em>103 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">In this case, the aggravating evidence supporting the imposition of the death sentence was quite compelling. According to Simpson\u2019s confession, which was consistent with the physical evidence, he and Eury approached Reverend Darter\u2019s home, accepted his hospitality and assistance, and then plotted and planned to return the next day to rob him. When they returned, Simpson forced his way into the home, attacked Reverend Darter, who was 92 years old at the time, strangled him with his bare hands while demanding money, and then strangled him with a belt that had been tied around his neck until it broke. He then tied a second, stronger belt around Reverend Darter\u2019s neck to strangle him, and used this belt to tie the Reverend\u2019s neck to the bedpost. To \u201cfinish him off,\u201d Simpson then beat Reverend Darter with a glass bottle until it broke and bloodied him and used a razor blade to slit the Reverend\u2019s arms from his biceps to his wrists. <em>Simpson, </em>462 S.E.2d at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>Weighed against this aggravating evidence, Simpson advanced mitigating evidence that he had been raised since birth in a foster care setting, that he was never placed permanently with a foster family, and that as a result of this lack of permanency, he was mentally and emotionally impaired and had difficulty controlling his behavior. Indeed, at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, one or more jurors found, as mitigating circumstances, that Simpson committed the murder while under the influence of a mental or emotional disturbance, that his mental or emotional age was a mitigating circumstance, that his development was adversely affected by the lack of permanence in his life due to the frequent foster home and school placement changes, that he was taken into and then removed from the home and care of his grandmother during which time his brother, Daryl, continued to remain in the home and care of his grandmother, that he experienced mental or emotional disturbance beginning at an early age, that his mental or emotional disturbance adversely affected his ability to perform in school, and that his mental or emotional disturbance adversely affected his ability to sustain employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Having throughly reviewed the record in this case, it is clear that Simpson\u2019s jury was provided with substantial evidence of Simpson\u2019s unfortunate childhood and the problems he developed as a result of his lack of a permanent home, yet unanimously found this background to be insufficient (even combined with six additional mitigating circumstances not related to his background) to outweigh the heinous nature of the murder of Reverend Darter. We are satisfied that the additional testimony of Ms. Landreth, excluded by the state trial court, would have added little to the factual description of Simpson\u2019s background, and that the North Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s holding that Ms. Landreth\u2019s opinion testimony, also excluded by the trial court, was largely cumulative of the opinions expressed by Dr. Coleman, a forensic psychologist that had been retained and qualified to evaluate and offer expert opinions regarding Simpson\u2019s mental and emotional status in the context of his background. In sum, given the strength of the aggravating evidence compared to the relative weakness of the admitted and excluded evidence offered in mitigation, we are confident that the exclusion of the additional testimony by Ms. Landreth did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the outcome of the sentencing proceeding. Therefore, even if we assume that the state trial court\u2019s exclusion of the testimony violated Simpson\u2019s Eighth Amendment right to introduce relevant, mitigating evidence, he is not entitled to federal habeas relief as a result of the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Simpson\u2019s final claim is that his plea of guilty was not given knowingly and voluntarily, as required by <em>Godinez v. Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">It is well settled that \u201c[a] criminal defendant may not be tried unless he is competent, and he may not waive his right to counsel or plead guilty unless he does so competently and intelligently.\u201d <em>Godinez, </em>509 U.S. at 396 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). However, \u201c[a] finding that a defendant is competent to stand trial ... is not all that is necessary.... In addition to determining that a defendant who seeks to plead guilty ... is competent, a trial court must satisfy itself that the waiver of his constitutional rights is knowing and voluntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400; <em>see also Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>(\u201cWaivers of constitutional rights not only must be voluntary but must be knowing, intelligent acts done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\u201d). The competency inquiry focuses on \u201cthe defendant\u2019s mental capacity; the question is whether he has the <em>ability </em>to understand the proceedings.\u201d <em>Godinez, </em>508 U.S. at 401 n. 12. The \u201c \u2018knowing and voluntary1 inquiry, by contrast, is to determine whether the defendant actually <em>does </em>understand the significance and consequences of a particular decision and whether the decision is uncoerced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe standard for determining whether a guilty plea is constitutionally valid is whether the guilty plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant. In applying this standard, courts look to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the guilty plea, granting the defendant\u2019s solemn declaration of guilt a presumption of truthfulness.\u201d <em>Walton v. Angelone, </em>321 F.3d 442, 462 (4th Cir.2003) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">As recounted above, Simpson confessed to the murder of Reverend Darter shortly after his arrest, describing in detail how he and Eury planned the crime, forced then-way into the residence, and carried out the gruesome murder. After unsuccessfully attempting to suppress the confession on the grounds that it was coerced, Simpson withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty to first degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and armed robbery. Under the plea agreement, Simpson reserved his right to appeal the state trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the confession and the prosecution agreed to dismiss the charge of first degree burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">On March 4, 1985, the state trial judge accepted Simpson\u2019s plea of guilty after questioning him twice concerning the voluntariness of the plea.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Q\">Q: Now Mr. Simpson, I will ask you again the various questions.

Specifically, Simpson claimed that \u201chis mental and developmental condition caused by his chaotic upbringing prevented him from fully understanding what he was doing.\u201d J.A. 1207. Simpson also claimed that \u201che pled guilty based on a misunderstanding about the penalty and that he was pressured to plead guilty\u201d by his attorneys. J.A. 1207.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-21\">The state MAR court held an evidentiary hearing on the claim, during which Simpson again presented the testimony of Ms. Landreth and Dr. Coleman, as well as testimony by Dr. Minta Saunders. Ms. Landreth testified that, in her opinion, Simpson\u2019s frequently changing foster care placements adversely affected his decision-making skills and caused him to be dependent upon authority figures for decision-making. Dr. Coleman testified that, based upon her evaluation in 1989, Simpson\u2019s ADHD had a moderate effect upon his ability to process, remember, and reflect upon information, and to consider, generate, and weigh alternatives. This effect, in turn, had \u201csome negative influence on [his] decisionmaking capabilities\u201d in 1985. J.A. 1131. She acknowledged, however, that she had not reviewed the plea colloquy from March of 1985 in formulating her opinion, and testified that she was only \u201casked the general question of whether or not [Simpson\u2019s] ADHD would affect his decision-making capabilities,\u201d not any \u201cspecific question\u201d about his plea hearing. J.A. 1134-35. Dr. Saunders, a clinical psychologist who evaluated Simpson and testified at his first sentencing hearing, opined that Simpson suffered from auditory problems, ADHD, and a borderline personality disorder that rendered him unable to make a knowing and voluntary plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-22\">Simpson\u2019s trial attorney also testified at the MAR hearing. In her view, Simpson appeared at times to have difficulty focusing, but she believed he understood her when she discussed the case. Although she testified that \u201cthere were times when ... I don\u2019t think he heard a word that we said,\u201d she also pointed out that \u201cthere were other times when he would sit there and he was much calmer and we tried to talk to him and tell him what was going on and why we felt he should plead guilty, and I felt like he knew what we were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>saying. If I didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have pled him guilty at the time.\u201d J.A. 1108. Although counsel acknowledged having serious reservations at the time about recommending that Simpson plead guilty to the murder charge, they ultimately decided that it was the best option in view of the detailed confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Simpson also testified at the MAR hearing, asserting generally that he did not understand the implications of the guilty plea and that he only pled guilty because he thought he would avoid a death sentence by doing so. Simpson\u2019s specific testimony, however, reveals a great deal of understanding of the significance and consequences of his decision. For example, Simpson testified that trial counsel advised him to plead guilty after them motion to suppress the confession had been denied. He testified that counsel discussed with him the fact that he could still appeal the denial of the motion to suppress. Simpson testified that counsel explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1u\">once I entered the guilty plea [the] only thing that probably could happen was the jury might would feel kind of sympathetic toward me---- [T]hey said I go in the courtroom and plead not guilty and the statement come up saying I\u2019m guilty as sin, there\u2019s no way a jury believe nothing I got to say. That\u2019s what they said, \u2018Tour best bet go ahead and plead guilty and maybe things will work out that they might feel sympathetic for you and give you life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">J.A. 1015. In sum, Simpson admitted that he understood what the \u201cdefense strategy at the time was going to be by entering the guilty plea[] maybe the jury would have some mercy and sentence [him] to life in prison.\u201d J.A. 1015. Simpson testified that he understood that, after the guilty plea was entered, a jury would be chosen to hear the evidence and determine whether or not to impose a sentence of life or death and admitted that he was never told or informed by his attorneys that his plea of guilty would result in a life sentence rather than death.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">In response, the state presented the testimony of Dr. Robert Rollins, a forensic psychiatrist who evaluated Simpson for competence to stand trial in 1984. It was Dr. Rollins\u2019 opinion that Simpson was competent to stand trial, that he had an understanding of his legal situation, and that he was able to cooperate with his attorneys at the time. He diagnosed Simpson with a mixed personality disorder marked by antisocial and emotionally unstable features. He testified that he did not make a diagnosis of ADHD at the time, but felt that it was a reasonable one. Dr. Rollins also testified that, in preparation for the MAR hearing, he was asked to review the case and render an opinion as to whether Simpson was also competent to enter a guilty plea in March of 1985. Dr. Rollins testified that Simpson\u2019s ADHD would have had \u201csome impairment of his overall function,\u201d but that based upon his assessment \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be such to make him not competent.\u201d J.A. 1164. He further testified that, although he had no independent recollection as to whether Simpson \u201cappeared to understand the questions that [he] asked of him back at that time period,\u201d he had noted in his report at the time an \u201copinion that Simpson was capable of understanding.\u201d J.A. 1165.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, and after examining the state court and MAR record, including the transcript of the plea and plea hearing, the state MAR court found that Simpson was competent to enter the plea of guilty, that he was not misled by his counsel, and that his plea was voluntarily, intelligently, and understandingly made in compliance with <em>Godinez. </em>The MAR court found unpersuasive Dr. Saunders\u2019 testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Simpson was not able to make a knowing decision, pointing out that Dr. Saunders was not present when Simpson was questioned or when he entered the guilty plea. Furthermore, Dr. Saunders did not review the transcript of the plea proceeding. She also had not questioned Simpson about his understanding of the plea and, although her opinion regarding his decision-making abilities was based upon the information that was available to her and reviewed in March of 1985, she did not alert Simpson\u2019s attorneys of any such problem or talk to counsel at the time about Simpson\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The state MAR court also found that Simpson\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing demonstrated that he understood the strategy behind pleading guilty at the time, and that he understood the possibility that the jury might sentence him to death even if he pled guilty. According to the findings of the state MAR court, Simpson knew that it was his decision to plead guilty, and \u201cpresented no credible evidence that [his attorneys] ever affirmatively told him he would receive a life sentence if he entered the plea of guilty to first-degree murder of Reverend Darter.\u201d J.A. 1212. The state court also found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2R\">Simpson\u2019s sworn representations to Judge Rousseau in open court contradict his present allegations that he really did not understand the consequences of his guilty pleas, and that because of his severe mental and emotional disorders, he was unable to make an informed, knowing, and intelligent decision to enter the pleas. Judge Rousseau carefully questioned Simpson twice about the guilty pleas, Simpson\u2019s condition at the time, the plea arrangement, Simpson\u2019s understanding of the charges and the consequences, Simpson\u2019s understanding that he still faced the possibility of the jury recommending a death sentence, Simpson\u2019s satisfaction with his attorneys, the constitutional right to a jury trial on guilt, and whether Simpson entered the pleas of his own free will, understanding what he was doing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">J.A. 1212. Finally, the court observed that, despite the neurological, mental, and emotional disorders which affected his decisionmaking skills, it appeared that \u201cSimpson could handle most of the practical aspects of daily living,\u201d and \u201cwas able to communicate with people and respond appropriately to questions.\u201d J.A. 1209. Hence, the court concluded that Simpson had failed to show that, despite his in-court representations, he was not able to and did not knowingly and voluntarily enter the pleas of guilty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-7\">The evidence on which Simpson relies is primarily Dr. Saunders\u2019 opinions and the testimony from Dr. Coleman and Ms. Landreth concerning Simpson\u2019s limited decision-making skills.... Dr. Saunders did not take into account what was actually said or explained to Simpson before his plea or the actual Court proceedings when he pled guilty. Even accepting Dr. Coleman\u2019s and Ms. Landreth\u2019s testimony concerning Simpson\u2019s limitations, that does not necessarily mean that on March 4, 1985, Simpson did not know what he was doing. The persuasive evidence from the people who were there is that Simpson understood what he was doing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">J.A. 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">We hold that the state MAR court reasonably concluded that the evidence failed to support an assertion that Simpson did not enter his plea knowingly and voluntarily. Simpson\u2019s own testimony revealed that, although hindsight and three death sentences now tell him that he had nothing to lose by going to trial on the murder charge, he was aware of what he was doing when he pled guilty to the murder of Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>verend Darter, understood why he was doing it and what he hoped to gain by doing it, and understood the risks and possible outcomes of that decision. Simpson has failed to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the factual determinations made by the state MAR court on this issue are not entitled to a presumption of correctness, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(e)(1), that the state court\u2019s factual determinations were unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in those proceedings, or that the state court\u2019s adjudication of this claim was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Simpson\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus. *</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-9\">. In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the Supreme Court overruled <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). When the death sentence was imposed upon Simpson, however, <em>Roberts </em>was the controlling precedent. <em>See Yarborough v. Alvardo, </em>541 U.S. 652, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 2147, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004) (\"For purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), clearly established law as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>determined by th[e] Court \u2018refers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of th[e] Court's decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\u2019 \u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b819-6\">. The State argued that Simpson\u2019s application for federal habeas relief should also be denied under \u00a7 2254(d) because it was not \"clearly established\u201d that the Confrontation Clause even applied to state capital sentencing proceedings when Simpson\u2019s death sentence became final in 1995. <em>Compare Maynard v. Dixon, </em>943 F.2d 407, 414 n. 5 (4th Cir.1991); <em>Bassette v. Thompson, </em>915 F.2d 932, 939 (4th Cir.1990); <em>with Proffitt v. Wainwright, </em>685 F.2d 1227, 1254 (11th Cir.1982). The Supreme Court of North Carolina, however, has held that the Confrontation Clause applies to capital sentencing hearings, <em>see State v. McLaughlin, </em>341 N.C. 426, 462 S.E.2d 1, 19 (1995), and did not address or reject Simpson\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim based upon a holding that the right was inapplicable to capital sentencing proceedings. Because we conclude that the North Carolina court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on the merits of the Confrontation Clause issue was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent pertaining to that Clause, we need not reach the question of whether it would also be appropriate to deny relief under \u00a7 2254(d) on the basis that it was not \"clearly established\u201d that the protections of the Confrontation Clause applied to the state sentencing proceedings at the time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b823-6\">. After engaging Simpson in the first series of questions, the trial court realized that he had forgotten to swear Simpson to tell the truth and repeated the colloquy a second time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
