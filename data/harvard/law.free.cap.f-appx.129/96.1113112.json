Garcia argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (b)(2) are unconstitutional and that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), should be overruled. He also contends, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that the district court plainly erred in sentencing him because the court believed that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory, rather than advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">Because Garcia raises these issues for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 513 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 04-9517, \u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (U.S. Mar. 31, 2005). Although the decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been called into question, <em>see Shepard v. United </em>States,U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1264, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring), the Supreme Court has not overruled it. Accordingly, Garcia\u2019s first argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-23\">Garcia\u2019s assertion that prejudice should be presumed from the sentencing court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>error is without merit. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-522. Garcia is not challenging the calculation of his criminal history score or the characterization of his prior conviction as an aggravated felony. Although Garcia argues that there is a reasonable probability that he would have received a lower sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme, he concedes that \u201c[i]t is impossible to know for certain what the judge might have done if freed of the constraints of the mandatory Guidelines.\u201d Under <em>Mares, </em>this is insufficient to establish that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 522. Accordingly, Garcia has not established plain error with respect to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b125-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
