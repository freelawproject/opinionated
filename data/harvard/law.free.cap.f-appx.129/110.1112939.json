The McNeals\u2019 claims stem from searches of Damita\u2019s person conducted by Officer Montgomery and Officer Mack. The officers were called after security sensors activated as Damita was exiting a Burlington Coat Factory and Warehouse store in Shreveport, Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Damita claimed that she was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment and to an illegal body cavity search, in violation of the Fourth and Eighth Amendments. She asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1988 and 1988 against Roberts, Montgomery, and Mack, as well as a tort claim against the City under the doctrine of respondeat superior. James asserted a claim for loss of consortium and society.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The McNeals argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on Damita\u2019s Fourth Amendment illegal search claim. They contend that Damita\u2019s consent to search was not freely and voluntarily given, and that Officer Montgomery and Officer Mack are not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The McNeals came forward with evidence that, prior to the officers\u2019 arrival, a store employee told Damita that she was not free to leave until she was searched. In view of this evidence, we agree with the McNeals that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to the voluntariness of Damita\u2019s consent. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>United States v. Tompkins, </em>130 F.3d 117, 121 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">We affirm, however, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Officer Montgomery and Officer Mack on grounds of qualified immunity. The doctrine of qualified immunity shields an officer from suit if the officer\u2019s actions were reasonable \u201cin light of clearly established law and the information the ... officers possessed.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). Here, Damita\u2019s deposition reveals that she told Officer Montgomery that she had no objection to being searched and that she stated that she had no objection to a female officer (Mack) being called. Damita\u2019s testimony also reveals that she cooperated with the officers and did not refuse any of their requests. In view of the evidence, Officers Montgomery and Mack are entitled to summary judgment because their actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances. <em>See Mangieri v. Clifton, </em>29 F.3d 1012, 1016 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">The McNeals have briefed no contentions on appeal regarding the district court\u2019s dismissal of Damita\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim or its dismissal of her claims against Roberts, her claims against the City of Shreveport, or James\u2019s claim for loss of consortium. <em>See id. </em>The McNeals have waived these claims by failing to brief them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b138-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
