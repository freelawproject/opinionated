Dretke, </em>No. 04-10116, slip op. at 3 (5th Cir. June 29, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-17\">Whitlock argues that the district court should have granted him habeas relief because the state habeas court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), was unreasonable. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The state court\u2019s factual findings \u201cshall be presumed to be correct\u201d unless the petitioner rebuts the presumption \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). This presumption of correctness applies to explicit and implicit findings of fact which are necessary to the state court\u2019s conclusions of mixed law and fact and to the state court\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>Valdez v. Cockrell, </em>274 F.3d 941, 948 n. 11 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Galvan v. Cockrell, </em>293 F.3d 760, 764 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-18\">The state habeas court found Whit-lock\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s affidavit to be credible and implicitly found that counsel did not call the individuals who filed affidavits purporting to support Whitlock\u2019s alibi testimony because either they were unavailable to testify or their testimony would not have supported Whitlock\u2019s alibi. The district court found that Whitlock had not rebutted this credibility determination with clear and convincing evidence. The district court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous because the state court\u2019s decision did not involve an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-19\">Whether the district court erred in denying Whitlock an evidentiary hearing is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2). Whit-lock has not explained why he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing under this standard, nor do we independently discern any basis for a hearing. Even if a evidentiary hearing is not barred by \u00a7 2254(e)(2), Whitlock makes only a conclusional assertion that he was denied a full and fair hearing. He has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion in denying a hearing. <em>See Murphy v. Johnson, </em>205 F.3d 809, 815 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b909-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
