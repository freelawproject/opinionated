It is undisputed that Martinez drove a pickup truck into the United States from Mexico and that the authorities discovered marijuana in a hidden compartment underneath the truck bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Martinez contends that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction because the Government failed to prove that she knew about the illicit cargo in the truck\u2019s hidden compartment. The jury could have inferred from testimony about Martinez\u2019s demeanor during her initial questioning and from her changing accounts of events that she had knowledge of the contraband secreted in the hidden compartment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Martinez\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Martinez also contends that the district court erred by failing to give her proposed instruction regarding evidence of nervousness. We review the refusal to give a defense-tendered instruction for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A district court may refuse \u201cto give a requested instruction which incorrectly states the law, is without foundation in the evidence, or is stated elsewhere in the instructions.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cA court commits reversible error where (1) the requested instruction is substantially correct; (2) the requested issue is not substantially covered in the charge; and (3) the instruction concerns an important point in the trial so that the failure to give it seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to effectively present a given defense.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Martinez has not demonstrated that the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"ABt7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
