We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err in denying Teresa\u2019s motion for a new trial?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\"><em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in awarding costs on a bill of costs that was not properly verified </em>?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u00b63 In November 2007, Teresa and her husband, Dominic Dee Carest\u00eda (Dee), were involved in a motor vehicle accident in Fergus County, Montana. The Carest\u00edas brought suit against Jeffrey Robey (Jeffrey), the driver of the other vehicle, claiming personal injury and property damages resulting from the accident. On November 1, 2011, the case proceeded to jury trial. On November 4, 2011, the jury returned a special verdict finding that Jeffrey1 s negligence was a cause of the accident. The jury also determined Dee was contributorily negligent, and it apportioned fault between Dee and Jeffrey, with Dee 15% at fault and Jeffrey 85% at fault. Teresa sought to recover medical expenses in the sum of $4,312.32, which was comprised primarily of massage therapy and chiropractic expenses. The jury awarded her only $872 in medical expenses, and awarded nothing for her past and future pain and suffering or loss of capacity to pursue her established course of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">\u00b64 Five days after the filing of the jury verdict, on November 9,2011, Jeffrey filed a bill of costs pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 68(d). On November 10, 2011, the Carest\u00edas filed their own bill of costs. The \u201ccompeting bills of costs then gave rise to [an] extraordinary flurry of briefing,\u201d a summary of which is unnecessary for our analysis. On September 18, 2012, the District Court entered an order allowing the Carest\u00edas to recover costs from Jeffrey and allowing Jeffrey to recover costs from the Carest\u00edas.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">\u00b65 The Carest\u00edas filed a motion for a new trial. The District Court failed to rule on the motion, so it was deemed denied. M. R. Civ. P. 59(f). The Carest\u00edas filed this appeal in December 2012.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Teresa requests that the decisions of the District Court be reversed pursuant to Rule 19 of the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure, that the case be remanded for a new trial, and that she be awarded her costs on appeal. Teresa argues the evidence of her injuries, expenses, and ongoing discomfort was undisputed and the District Court should have granted her motion for a new trial. She further argues that the District Court abused its discretion by extending the time within which Jeffrey could submit a verified bill of costs when Jeffrey made no showing of excusable neglect as required under M. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(1)(B). She therefore requests that we strike the award of costs to Jeffrey.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b66 Jeffrey counters that the jury\u2019s award of $872 in medical expenses was proper because that sum was the total for her expenses. He argues Teresa failed to establish that her massage and chiropractic treatments were reasonable or necessary and did not offer records of those treatments into evidence. Jeffrey further argues his award of costs should be affirmed because the District Court properly exercised its discretion in considering his bill of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b67 When the basis of a motion for a new trial is insufficiency of the evidence, we review the denial of the motion de novo and determine whether there was substantial evidence to support the verdict. <em>Styren Farms Inc. v. Roos, </em>2011 MT 299, \u00b6 11, 363 Mont. 41, 265 P.3d 1230 (internal citation omitted). Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it may be less than a preponderance of the evidence, but must be more than a \u201cmere scintilla.\u201d <em>Styren Farms, </em>\u00b6 11 (internal citation omitted). We review a district court\u2019s award of costs to determine if the district court abused its discretion. <em>Mularoni v. Bing, </em>2001 MT 215, \u00b6 22, 306 Mont. 405, 34 P.3d 497 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">\u00b68 <em>1. Did the District Court err in denying Teresa\u2019s motion for a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">\u00b69 After the jury returned its verdict denying Teresa past and future pain and suffering damages, she sought a new trial pursuant to Rules 50 and 59(e) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. The basis for the motion was that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, and the verdict was contrary to the law. The District Court did not rule on the motion, and it was deemed denied pursuant to M. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Civ. P. 59(f). M. R. Civ. P. 59(a)(1)(A) provides a new trial may be granted \u201cafter a jury trial, for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in Montana state court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A0s\">\u00b6 10 Teresa contends Montana case law \u2018Requires the granting of a new trial so [she] can present her damage claims to a new jury in Great Falls.\u201dTeresa cites <em>Thompson v. City of Bozeman, </em>284 Mont. 440, 945 P.2d 48 (1997), <em>Renville v. Taylor, </em>2000 MT 217, 301 Mont. 99, 7 P.3d 400, and <em>Hoffman v. Austin, </em>2006 MT 289, 334 Mont. 357, 147 P.3d 177 (overruled in part on other grounds), as examples of cases in which \u201cthe jury found that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused the plaintiffs injury and a new trial was granted due to the jury\u2019s failure to award uncontested damages ... such as pain and suffering, mental and emotional distress and loss of established course of life activities among others.\u201d Teresa argues a new trial is similarly appropriate in this case because no witness at trial disputed that she had been injured, and Jeffrey conceded that she had been injured, telling the jury \u2018it\u2019s up to you to what degree that injury should be compensated.\u201d She also argues that the award of medical expenses was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">\u00b611 Jeffrey counters that the record supports the jury\u2019s award for medical expenses because no records of her massage and chiropractic expenses were offered into evidence. Further, the two medical providers called by Teresa who had actually examined her had seen her only once and did not recommend massage therapy or chiropractic treatment for her injuries. Addressing her complaint that the jury was required to compensate Teresa for her pain and suffering, Jeffrey argues her failure to offer a properjury instruction consistent with her theory of the case and evidence precludes her from assigning error on this issue. According to Jeffrey, if Teresa \u2018is correct that it was <em>mandatory </em>for the jury to award the requested damages, then she was required to offer jury instructions consistent with her position\u201d instead of agreeing with the instruction that the award \u201cshould include reasonable compensation for any pain and suffering experienced\u201d (emphasis in original). Jeffrey concedes that if we determine Teresa did not waive the issue of pain and suffering damages by failing to offer properjury instructions, she is entitled to a new trial on the issue of her past pain and suffering damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b612 As an initial matter, we conclude Teresa did not waive her argument with respect to past pain and suffering by failing to offer proper jury instructions. In similar cases, we have not required the plaintiff to offer jury instructions stating that awarding such damages is mandatory as a prerequisite to granting a motion for a new trial. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>e.g. Hoffman; Renville </em>(both cases were remanded on the issue of damages, even though the jury instructions stated \u201c... your award should include reasonable compensation for Moreover, we note Teresa is not arguing that it was <em>mandatory </em>for the jury to award her damages. Rather, she is arguing that insufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s zero damage award, and that it should have awarded her pain and suffering damages based on the evidence before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b613 Teresa presented substantial evidence to support an award of damages for past pain and suffering. Summarized briefly, that evidence included Teresa\u2019s testimony that her right shoulder and neck started to hurt on the evening of the accident. Teresa testified that her pain got worse throughout the evening and that, on the following morning, her neck was stiff, her shoulder hurt, and she had a new pain around her ribs. She went to the urgent care facility in Billings, and the physician\u2019s assistant who saw her testified that Teresa had slight tenderness in her neck, lower back, shoulder, and right arm. The radiologist who had interpreted Teresa\u2019s x-rays testified that he found a minimally displaced fracture of her right sixth rib. On June 25,2008, Teresa saw another physician\u2019s assistant who testified Teresa voiced discomfort, he found an area that was tender to palpation, and he had no reason to question Teresa\u2019s veracity. Teresa visited the chiropractor 38 times in 2008. She testified at trial that she was still having problems with her rib, four years after the accident, and that the pain limited\u2019her participation in certain activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b614 There was no evidence that Teresa had any pre-existing injuries. Teresa and Dee testified that she had no prior injury, and Jeffrey did not impeach this evidence. In <em>Murray v. Whitcraft, </em>2012 MT 298, \u00b6 13, 367 Mont. 364, 291 P.3d 587, the defendant presented evidence and cross-examined the plaintiffs witnesses to suggest that the collision had caused little, if any, impact to the plaintiffs shoulder, and that he had re-injured the shoulder on a later occasion while bow hunting. In this case, Jeffrey suggested that Teresa may have re-injured herself while engaged in physical activities unrelated to the accident, but he did not provide any evidence to support this assertion. While Jeffrey may have questioned the extent of Teresa\u2019s pain and suffering, he did not controvert the evidence that she had pain and suffering as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b615 We distinguished <em>Murray </em>from the line of cases Teresa has cited <em>{Hoffman, Thompson, </em>and <em>Renville) </em>because Murray offered only a general verdict form. Therefore, we could not \u201cdetermine the degree to which the jury found [the defendant\u2019s] negligence caused Murray\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>injuries and the precise nature of the damages the jury awarded to Murray.\u201d <em>Murray, </em>\u00b6 22. Here, unlike in <em>Murray, </em>we are able to ascertain that the jury awarded zero damages for pain and suffering because the verdict form itemized the categories of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b616  \u201cWe have previously held that, although it is within the jury\u2019s province to weigh the evidence and determine credibility, a jury is not free to disregard uncontradicted, credible, nonopinion evidence.\u201d <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>Thompson, </em>284 Mont. at 443, 945 P.2d at 50). We conclude that Teresa was entitled to some award of damages for her past pain and suffering proven in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b617 We reject Teresa\u2019s request that we remand for a new trial on her past and future medical expenses, her future pain and suffering, and her loss of established course of life. As indicated, Teresa did not offer her medical bills into evidence nor did she offer any testimony that the massage and chiropractic treatments she underwent were medically necessary. Further, there was no evidence that Teresa was likely to incur future medical expenses. In fact, in light of the Carest\u00edas\u2019 failure to supplement discovery responses, counsel for the Carest\u00edas advised the court that they would seek damages only for the year 2008. There is therefore no basis for a remand on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u00b618 Accordingly, we conclude that a portion of the jury\u2019s damage award was not supported by substantial credible evidence. For that reason, we set aside the portion of the jury\u2019s verdict that awarded no damages for past pain and suffering and remand to the District Court for a new trial limited to the sole issue of Teresa\u2019s past pain and suffering. We note that Jeffrey has not appealed the jury\u2019s finding that Teresa was injured as a result of the parties\u2019 collision. Therefore, upon retrial that fact need not be re-established. The remainder of the verdict is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\u00b619 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in awarding costs on a bill of costs that was not properly verified?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\u00b620 On September 18, 2012, the District Court entered its ordering awarding both parties their costs. The Carest\u00edas argue that Jeffrey\u2019s bill of costs did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, because it was not verified, and that the District Court abused its discretion in allowing Jeffrey to cure this defect by affidavit. The District Court relied on M. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(1)(B) for the authority to extend the time for good cause. The District Court determined good cause existed because Jeffrey filed a curative affidavit in a reasonably prompt manner upon notice of the defect. Moreover, briefing on the parties\u2019 costs was still at an early stage, and an extension would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>prejudice the Carest\u00edas. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the Carest\u00edas\u2019 objection to Jeffrey\u2019s bill of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b621 Finally, we decline Teresa\u2019s request that we award her costs on appeal as the prevailing party, pursuant to M. R. App. P. 19(3)(a). While Teresa prevailed on one claim, she did not prevail on others. The foregoing rule provides that in the event of a dispute over which party has prevailed, that dispute, as well as the matter of costs, shall be resolved by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b622 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse in part and affirm in part. We remand this case for a trial on the sole issue of damages for past pain and suffering.</p>\n<judges id=\"b474-7\">JUSTICES MORRIS, McKINNON, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-12\"> In March 2013, the parties participated in appellate mediation.
