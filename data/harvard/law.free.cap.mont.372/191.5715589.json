Aut. Ins. Co. v. Freyer (Freyer I), </em>2010 MT 191, 357 Mont. 329, 239 P.3d 143. Generally, Heath Freyer (Heath) and Vail Freyer (Vail), who were married and the parents of Alicia Freyer (Alicia), were all riding in their vehicle, which was insured by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm). Vail was driving when the vehicle was involved in a rollover accident that resulted in Heath\u2019s death. In <em>Freyer I, </em>we held, based upon the language of the subject policy\u2019s \u2018Limits of Liability\u201d clause, that there was coverage for Alicia\u2019s claim for derivative damages stemming from the death of her father, Heath, under her own \u2018Each Person\u201d policy limit of $50,000, contrary to State Farm\u2019s position that all damages arising from Heath\u2019s death were covered only by the \u2018Each Person\u201d policy limit of $50,000 applicable to him. <em>Freyer </em>I, \u00b6\u00b6 13-16. After remand, State Farm paid the contested coverage amounts. Appellants then brought claims against State Farm under several theories for the wrongful denial of coverage for Alicia\u2019s derivative claims. The District Court granted summary judgment to State Farm on all of those theories, which Appellants challenge on appeal. We reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand for further proceedings. We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the District Court err in concluding that State Farm had not breached the insurance contract when it failed to indemnify Vail for Alicia\u2019s derivative claims because it had a \"reasonable basis in law\u201dto challenge coverage of those claims ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to State Farm on the common-law bad faith and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u00b64 <em>3. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to State Farm on the Unfair Trade Practices Act claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\u00b65 <em>4. Did the District Court err in concluding State Farm waived its statute of limitations affirmative defenses?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">\u00b66 In October 2003, Vail was driving a family vehicle in the Bozeman area, and Heath and three-month-old Alicia (collectively the Freyers), were passengers. Vail maneuvered the vehicle to pass a string of cars ahead of them, but when they were nearly even with the lead vehicle, driven by Michelle Manning (Manning), Manning executed a left-hand turn. The vehicles collided, sending the Freyers\u2019 vehicle off the road, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>where it overturned. Heath was ejected and suffered fatal injuries. Alicia, who was confined by her car seat, suffered minor injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b67 State Farm insured the Freyers\u2019 three vehicles against liability arising from Vail\u2019s driving. On the subject vehicle, State Farm\u2019s automobile liability policy provided coverage limits of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident, as well as underinsured motorist coverage of $50,000. Within days of the accident, State Farm offered to pay Heath\u2019s Estate the $50,000 per person coverage limit for Heath\u2019s injuries, but Vail\u2019s attorney asked State Farm to wait on payment until a probate proceeding had been initiated. Heath\u2019s father, Frank Freyer (Frank), was appointed as personal representative of Heath\u2019s Estate and as conservator of Alicia\u2019s Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b68 On August 4,2004, Frank requested by letter that State Farm pay the $50,000 it had previously offered to Heath\u2019s Estate. Frank also advised State Farm that he would be demanding $50,000 for settlement of Alicia\u2019s claims. The next day, State Farm sent Frank a check for $49,723.22, the balance of the $50,000 per person coverage limit for Heath\u2019s Estate\u2019s claim after deduction for payments made for Heath\u2019s funeral and medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b69 In September 2004, State Farm filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court in an unrelated case that sought a declaration that the \u2018Limits of Liability\u201d clause in its auto liability policy limited coverage to $50,000 for all claims arising from the bodily injury to one person. <em>See State Farm Mut. Aut. Ins. Co. v. Bowen (Bowen I), </em>No. 04-63-BU-RFC (D. Mont. Aug. 3, 2005). The Limits of Liability clause at issue in <em>Bowen I </em>was identical to the one in the policy insuring Vail. That clause provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">The amount of bodily injury liability coverage is shown on the declarations page under \u2018Limits of Liability-Coverage A-Bodily Injury [-W-], Each Person, Each Accident.\u201d <em>Under \u2018Bach Person\u201d is the amount of coverage for all damages due to bodily injury to one person. \u2018Bodily injury to one person\u201d includes all injury and damages to other persons, including emotional distress, sustained by such other persons who do not sustain bodily injury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjN\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">\u00b610 On November 18, 2004, Frank demanded by letter that State Farm also pay $50,000 to satisfy Alicia\u2019s claims against Vail. Frank asserted that because Alicia suffered \u2018bodily injury,\u201d she was entitled to payment for all her damages, including her derivative claims arising from her father\u2019s death, out of her own $50,000 \u2018Each Person\u201d limit. Frank also asserted that Alicia had personally sustained over $50,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>in damages because she had suffered a \u201cclosed head injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\">\u00b611 Four days later, State Farm contacted its in-house counsel, Jo Ridgeway (Ridgeway), concerning Frank\u2019s interpretation of the Limits of Liability clause. Two days later, Ridgeway advised State Farm that the majority rule from courts that had interpreted the clause was that all \u201cderivative claims\u201d-damages arising from another person\u2019s injury or wrongful death-were subject to the $50,000 Each Person coverage limit. In other words, any derivative claim Alicia had pertaining to Heath\u2019s death was subject to the $50,000 Each Person coverage limit for his claims, which had already been paid to Heath\u2019s Estate. Based on this advice, State Farm informed Frank that it had already paid the available coverage limits for damages stemming from Heath\u2019s death. Further, State Farm advised that, based upon Alicia\u2019s medical records indicating that her head CT scan was normal, and her doctor\u2019s conclusion that she suffered only \u201cminor bruising,\u201d it would settle her personal bodily injury claim against Vail for $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\u00b612 On January 27,2005, Frank rejected the $5,000 offer and renewed his demand for $50,000. Frank advised that, if State Farm tendered that amount, he would provide a full release for all claims against Vail. State Farm rejected that offer, responding that it had changed neither its position regarding the interpretation of the policy nor its $5,000 valuation of damages for Alicia\u2019s own physical injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b613 On August 3, 2005, the U.S. District Court for Montana ruled in <em>Bowen I </em>that a derivative claim was subject to the same Each Person coverage limit as other claims for that person. <em>See Bowen </em>7, at 9. That decision was ultimately affirmed by the Ninth Circuit. <em>State Farm Mut. Aut. Ins. Co. v. Bowen (Bowen </em>77), 247 Fed. Appx. 901, 902-03 (9th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u00b614 On September 19, 2006, Frank, in his capacity as personal representative of Heath\u2019s Estate and conservator of Alicia\u2019s Estate, sued his daughter-in-law Vail for the damages sustained in the accident due to Vail\u2019s negligent driving. State Farm accepted defense of the lawsuit and retained counsel to defend Vail.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b615 On October 30, 2007, State Farm filed an action seeking a declaration that it had complied with the payment obligations under the Limits of Liability clause. In their answers, Frank, on behalf of Heath\u2019s Estate and Alicia, and Vail asked the court to declare that the policy provided the additionally claimed coverage, and counterclaimed that State Farm had breached the insurance contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violated Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA) by its mishandling of Alicia\u2019s and Heath\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Estates\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b616 Two days later, Frank sent to State Farm a settlement letter demanding $2.6 million to settle all of the claims against Vail. According to Frank, $1.7 million of that settlement represented the \u2018low range\u201d of the economic loss to Heath\u2019s Estate because of his death, while approximately $1 million represented the loss of support, loss of companionship, loss of established course of life, and emotional distress damages stemming from Alicia\u2019s loss of her father. Frank subtracted from the $2.7 million the $100,000 he had already been paid ($50,000 from State Farm and $50,000 from Manning\u2019s insurer). Although State Farm did not change its position regarding interpretation of the policy, it paid an additional $150,000 to Heath\u2019s Estate for three stacked $50,000 underinsured motorist coverages for the Freyers\u2019 three vehicles insured by State Farm on June 4, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"Abv\">\u00b617 On July 21, 2008, Frank and Vail executed a $2.6 million stipulated judgment that is the center of controversy in this case. The settlement agreement stated that $2.6 million was \u201ca fair and reasonable\u201d amount for settlement of Heath\u2019s Estate\u2019s claims <em>and </em>Alicia\u2019s claims. In return for Vail\u2019s confession of negligence and the assignment of all claims she may have against State Farm, Frank signed a covenant not to execute against Vail\u2019s personal assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b618 On May 4, 2009, in the declaratory proceeding, the District Court ruled that State Farm had correctly interpreted the Limits of Liability clause of its policy. However, the Freyers appealed, and on August 27, 2010, this Court reversed, ruling that coverage for Alicia\u2019s derivative claims was not limited to Heath\u2019s Each Person limit. <em>See Freyer I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-16. State Farm then paid another $50,000 to Alicia under the Each Person coverage limit applicable to her, and paid $20,000 in attorney fees to compensate Vail\u2019s attorney for his work in the declaratory judgment action. Further, because <em>Freyer I </em>had found there was coverage for Alicia\u2019s derivative claims, State Farm also paid her $150,000 in stacked underinsured motorist coverage, as it had for Heath\u2019s Estate. Thus, State Farm paid Freyers a total of $400,000-$200,000 to Heath\u2019s Estate and $200,000 to Alicia.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b619 In January 2011, Vail and Frank filed amended counterclaims in the proceeding. Vail alleged an additional violation of Montana\u2019s UTPA, and asked for a declaration that the $2.6 million stipulated judgment was valid and enforceable against State Farm. Frank also sought enforcement of the stipulated judgment against State Farm. State Farm denied and countered that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u00b620 All parties moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Frank\u2019s and Vail\u2019s motions. The court concluded that it was reasonable for State Farm to interpret its policy as it did because \u201c \u2018every other court faced with the issue before this Court has concluded that the \u2018Each Person\u201dlimitation applies to a wrongful death claim.\u2019 \u2019\u2019(Quoting <em>Bowen I </em>at 9.) While the District Court acknowledged that additional coverage was found in <em>Freyer I, </em>it concluded that State Farm had not been unreasonable in the determination about coverage it had made. Because State Farm had a \u201creasonable basis in law\u201d to contest coverage, the District Court dismissed all of Frank\u2019s and Vail\u2019s claims. As to State Farm\u2019s statute of limitations defense, the court concluded that Vail\u2019s and Frank\u2019s 2011 amended complaints were filed merely to reflect the shift in the parties\u2019 respective positions pursuant to the assignment of rights, and therefore did not \u201cstate any new theory or claim for relief\u2019from their 2008 counterclaims. Thus, State Farm had waived its statute of limitations defense by failing to assert the defense in its answer to the counterclaims filed in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\">\u00b621 All parties appeal the District Court\u2019s order. Vail and Frank appeal from the District Court\u2019s order disposing of all of their claims. State Farm cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s order dismissing its statute of limitations defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b622 A district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment is reviewed de novo, utilizing the same analysis as the district court pursuant to Rule 56 of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6 36, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186. \u2018The interpretation of an insurance contract [is] a question of law.\u201d <em>Modroo v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 275, \u00b6 23, 345 Mont. 262, 191 P.3d 389. A district court\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed for correctness. <em>Crane Creek Ranch, Inc. v. Cresap, </em>2004 MT 351, \u00b6 8, 324 Mont. 366, 103 P.3d 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b623 Frank and Vail assert that the District Court erred by dismissing their (1) breach of contract claims and (2) \u00a733-18-201(1) UTPA claims. In addition, Frank asserts that the District Court erred by dismissing his third-party bad-faith claim against State Farm and his first-party claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing that was assigned to the Estate by Vail. The District Court held that State Farm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>was entitled to summary judgment on all of these claims because it had a \u201creasonable basis in law\u201d to dispute coverage. We address these claims in turn, and hold that the District Court erred by applying a \u2018Reasonable basis in law\u201d defense to Frank and Vail\u2019s breach of contract claim, but did not err by applying that defense to the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b624 <em>1. Did the District Court err by concluding that State Farm had not breached the insurance contract when it failed to indemnify Vail for Alicia\u2019s derivative claims because it had a \u2018Reasonable basis in law\u201d to challenge coverage of those claims ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b625 Frank and Vail argue that, under contract law, a breach is a breach-it does not matter if the breaching party was \u2018Reasonable\u201d in its breach. They assert the District Court erred by concluding that State Farm did not breach its duty to pay Alicia\u2019s claims when it wrongfully denied coverage for her derivative claims because State Farm had a \u2018Reasonable basis in law\u201d to contest coverage for those claims. State Farm responds that its payment of policy limits, prejudgment interest and Freyers\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees in pursuing the coverage determination leading to <em>Freyer I </em>has mooted Frank\u2019s and Vail\u2019s breach of contract claims and, in any event, the District Court properly applied the reasonable basis in law defense. We reject the mootness argument. An issue is moot when \u201c \u2018the court is unable due to an intervening event or change in circumstances to grant effective relief or to restore the parties to their original position ....\u2019 \u201d <em>Gateway Opencut Mining v. Bd. of Co. Commrs., </em>2011 MT 198, \u00b6 16, 361 Mont. 398, 260 P.3d 133 (quoting <em>Greater Missoula Area Fedn. of Early Childhood Educators v. Child Start, Inc., </em>2009 MT 362, \u00b6 23, 353 Mont. 201, 219 P.3d 881). Freyers are seeking damages for breach of the insurance contract beyond the payments made by State Farm. As further developed herein, it is possible that further relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b626  The duty to defend and the duty to indemnify are different, and those differences compel the results ultimately reached herein. The duty to indemnify is independent of and narrower than the duty to defend. Unlike an insurer\u2019s duty to defend, which arises \u201cwhen \u2018a complaint against an insured <em>alleges facts, which if proven, </em>would result in coverage[,]\u2019 \u201d an insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify arises only if coverage under the policy is actually established. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Schwan, </em>2013 MT 216, \u00b6 15, 371 Mont. 192, 308 P.3d 48 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 21, 321 Mont. 99, 90 P.3d 381, in turn citing <em>St. Paul </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Thompson, </em>150 Mont. 182, 188, 433 P.2d 795, 799 (1967) and <em>Grindheim v. Safeco Ins. Co., </em>908 F. Supp. 794, 800 (D. Mont. 1995)). Put another way, while an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is triggered by allegations, \u201c[a]n insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify hinges not on the facts the claimant alleges and hopes to prove but instead on the facts, proven, stipulated or otherwise established that actually create the insured\u2019s liability.\u201d43 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Insurance </em>\u00a7676 (West 2013). \u00b627 \u2018Insurance agreements are contracts that are subject to the general rules of contract law.\u201d <em>Fisher ex rel. McCartney v. State Farm Mut. Aut. Ins. Co., </em>2013 MT 208, \u00b6 25, 371 Mont. 147, 305 P.3d 861 (citing <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Ribi Immunochem Research, Inc., </em>2005 MT 50, \u00b6 17, 326 Mont. 174, 108 P.3d 469). This general principle includes the determination of whether an insurer has breached a provision of the insurance contract. Under contract law, \u201ca breach of contract is a failure, without legal excuse, to perform any promise that forms the whole or part of a contract.\u201d Richard A. Lord, <em>Williston on Contracts </em>vol. 23, \u00a763:1 at 434 (4th ed., West Group 2002). Hence, the contractual duty to indemnify is breached when an \u2018insurer has wrongfully refused to provide coverage to an insured.\u201d <em>Yovish v. United Servs. Aut. Assn., </em>243 Mont. 284, 291, 794 P.2d 682, 686 (1990) <em>overruled on other grounds in Mt. West Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Brewer, </em>2003 MT 98, \u00b6 20, 315 Mont. 231, 69 P.3d 652; <em>accord Davis v. Criterion Ins. Co., </em>754 P.2d 1331, 1332 (Alaska 1988). An insurer thus breaches the duty to indemnify by failing to provide coverage when (1) the established facts trigger coverage under the terms of the policy, and (2) the extent of the claimant\u2019s damages are undisputed or clearly exceed policy limits. <em>Cf. Yovish, </em>243 Mont. at 286-88, 794 P.2d at 684-85 (USAA breached duty to indemnify because it denied coverage based on non-renewal even though clear terms of policy, and Montana law, required insurer to provide adequate notice of cancelation or non-renewal of coverage, and the property damage to insured\u2019s car and other car was undisputed); <em>Brewer, </em>\u00b6 36 (insurer breached duty to indemnify when it incorrectly interpreted policy to exclude newly acquired car from coverage) (factual history in <em>Christensen v. Mt. West Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., </em>2000 MT 378, 303 Mont. 493, 22 P.3d 624). \u2018Established facts\u201din this context are facts that are either undisputed or are initially disputed but subsequently determined by the fact finder. When facts necessary to determine the existence of coverage are contested in an underlying action, the insurer cannot be said to have yet breached the duty to indemnify. <em>See Skinner v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2005 MT 323, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 329 Mont. 511, 127 P.3d 359 (court could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>not issue order determining duty to indemnify because issues of personal liability of the insured were yet to be determined in an underlying case); <em>Northfield Ins. Co. v. Mont. Assn. of Cos., </em>2000 MT 256, \u00b6 17, 301 Mont. 472, 10 P.3d 813 (court could not determine secondary insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify because underlying litigation had not determined insured\u2019s liability and primary insurer\u2019s coverage cannot be said to have been exceeded).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b628  Here, Freyers asserted derivative claims for damages sustained by Alicia arising from her father\u2019s death caused by Vail\u2019s negligent driving, and argued for coverage under State Farm\u2019s policy. State Farm did not challenge Frank\u2019s assertion that the value of Alicia\u2019s derivative claims exceeded the $50,000 Each Person limits of the policy. This Court held that State Farm incorrectly interpreted its policy by applying a single Each Person coverage limit and refusing further payment for Alicia\u2019s claims. <em>Freyer I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-16. Consequently, State Farm breached its duty to indemnify Vail to the proper limits of its policy against Alicia\u2019s derivative claims, and it breached the insurance contract by so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b629 A breach of contract cannot be ameliorated by the reasonableness of the breaching partys actions. The District Court thus erred by permitting State Farm to raise a \u201creasonable basis in law\u201d defense to Frank\u2019s and Vail\u2019s breach of contract claims. See Kerry B. Harvey &amp; Thomas A. Wiseman III, <em>First Party Bad Faith: Common Law Remedies and a Proposed Legislative Solution, </em>72 Ky.

Milk &amp; Cream Co. v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>68 Mont. 152, 156-57, 216 P. 1109, 1110 (1923); <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20, 24, 27, 31; <em>Lee v. USAA Cas. Ins.

However, as State Farm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>correctly notes, all of these cases cited by Vail involve breaches of the duty to defend, not the duty to indemnify, and \u201cthis Court has never approved a confessed judgment as the proper measure of damages where the insurer defended its insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\">\u00b631 We start with the principle that an insurer\u2019s wrongful refusal to indemnify entitles its insured to recover consequential damages. <em>See Mont.

Co. v. Ross, </em>180 P.3d 427 (Colo. 2008) (en banc). Surviving spouses and children (the Rosses) of two passengers who died in a plane crash sued the airline company for their wrongful deaths. <em>Old Republic, </em>180 P.3d at 428. The airline company was insured by Old Republic under an aviation policy and a commercial general liability policy. <em>Old Republic, </em>180 P.3d at 429. At the outset of litigation, Old Republic tendered $200,000 to the Rosses, which it believed was the maximum coverage available under the aviation policy. <em>Old Republic, </em>180 P.3d at 429. Old Republic disputed coverage under the commercial general liability policy, which had a policy limit of $1 million, and therefore, rejected the Rosses\u2019 settlement demand of $800,000. <em>Old Republic, </em>180 P.3d at 429. Old Republic filed an action in federal court seeking a declaration that its policy interpretation was correct and that its contractual obligation to the Rosses had been fulfilled by the $200,000 payment. <em>Old Republic, </em>180 P.3d at 429. While the declaratory action was pending, the Rosses entered a settlement with the airline company wherein the airline company confessed judgment in the amount of $4 million, plus prejudgment interest of $1.3 million, for a total stipulated settlement of $5.3 million. Rosses agreed not to execute upon the airline company. <em>Old Republic, </em>180 P.3d at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b633 In the declaratory action, Old Republic contended that coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>under the aviation policy was limited to $100,000 for each passenger, or $200,000 total for the two passengers, and did not provide additional coverage for the derivative claims of mental anguish brought by deceased passengers\u2019 family members. <em>Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Durango Air Service, Inc., </em>283 F.3d 1222, 1226-27 (10th Cir. 2002) (hereinafter <em>Old Republic Declaratory Action). </em>The Tenth Circuit for the United States Court of Appeals ultimately concluded that the aviation policy provided $700,000 in coverage for the plane crash, and construed an ambiguity in the commercial general liability policy in favor of additional coverage for the airline company. <em>Old Republic Declaratory Action, </em>283 F.3d at 1227-28, 1230. Thus, the Tenth Circuit concluded that the two policies provided $1.7 million in coverage. <em>Old Republic Declaratory Action, </em>283 F.3d at 1231.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfL\">\u00b634 Consequently, there were now two judgments: the state court stipulated judgment against the airline company for $5.3 million, and the federal judgment declaring coverage limits of $1.7 million under the policies. <em>Old Republic, </em>180 P.3d at 429. Old Republic paid $1.7 million to satisfy the declaratory judgment of policy limits, but refused to pay any further amount toward the stipulated judgment. <em>Old Republic, </em>180 P.3d at 429. Similar to the case before us, the Rosses asked the Colorado Supreme Court to enforce the stipulated judgment with the airline company as the proper measure of damages for Old Republic\u2019s incorrect interpretation of both its policies. <em>Old Republic, </em>180 P.3d at 428. In rejecting the Rosses\u2019 request, the court surveyed the jurisdictions that had addressed the enforcement of pretrial stipulated judgments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">We find no jurisdiction that would enforce a pretrial stipulated judgment against an insurer who was not a party to the underlying settlement agreement unless the insurer acted in bad faith, denied coverage, or refused to defend the claim on behalf of the insured. We therefore decline to extend [Colorado law] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>encompass a settlement agreement entered under these circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-3\">The majority rule in states that have considered this issue is that <em>a pretrial stipulated judgment may be enforceable against the defendant\u2019s liability insurer if the insurer breaches its contractual obligation to defend the insured. </em>Under the majority view, when an insurer improperly abandons its insured, the insured is justified in taking steps to limit his or her personal liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">A number of states have adopted a modification of the majority rule, demonstrating a willingness to enforce pretrial stipulated judgments under various enumerated circumstances.... In sum, many states broaden the circumstances under which a stipulated judgment may be enforceable, <em>but none of these states has enforced a pretrial stipulated judgment against an insurer where the insurer has conceded coverage and defended its insured, and where there has been no finding of bad faith against the insurer.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">We conclude that under the facts of this case, where the insurer has conceded coverage and defended its insured, and where there has been no finding of bad faith against the insurer, a stipulated judgment entered before trial, to which the insurer is not a party, cannot be enforced against the insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\"><em>Old Republic, </em>180 P.3d 432-34 (emphasis added; internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b635 The California Supreme Court has likewise disapproved of stipulated judgments as a measure of an insured\u2019s damages when the insurer has provided a defense for the insured. In <em>Hamilton v. Maryland Cas. Co., </em>41 P.3d 128, 131 (Cal. 2002), the insurer defended its insureds but refused the claimants\u2019 demand for the $1 million policy limits, instead countering with a $150,000 offer to settle. The insureds and claimants subsequently entered into a stipulated judgment of $3 million; the insureds assigned any breach of contract claims they might have against the insurer, and, in return, the claimants agreed not to execute the $3 million judgment against the insureds. <em>Hamilton, </em>41 P.3d at 131. The claimants then sued the insurer for breach of contract arising from its failure to accept the claimants\u2019 settlement offers, asserting that the $3 million stipulated judgment was the appropriate measure of damages for the breach. <em>Hamilton, </em>41 P.3d at 131-32. The California Supreme Court disagreed, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">Where, as here, the insured, without the insurer\u2019s agreement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>stipulates to a judgment against it in excess of both the policy limits and the previously rejected settlement offer, and the stipulated judgment is coupled with a covenant not to execute, the agreed judgment cannot fairly be attributed to the insurer\u2019s conduct, even if the insurer\u2019s refusal to settle within the policy limits was unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><em>Hamilton, </em>41 P.3d at 137. Importantly, the <em>Hamilton </em>Court distinguished cases where the insurer had failed to defend from cases where the insurer did defend, and reasoned that a stipulated judgment was presumptively enforceable as the measure of damages only in the former instance, because the non-defending insurer has left its insured on its own to challenge liability, and the insurer should not be able to \u201creach back\u201d and interject itself into a controversy it has sidestepped to \u2018Void a deal the insured has entered to eliminate personal liability.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>41 P.3d at 135 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Conversely, however, when \u201cthe insurer has <em>accepted </em>defense of the claim, and might have prevailed at trial had the insured and the claimants not settled without the insurer\u2019s participation, no presumption of the insured\u2019s liability generally arises from the fact or amount of settlement.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>41 P.3d at 135 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b636 These cases are representative of what occurred in the case before us, and we find their reasoning persuasive. When an insurer defends the insured against a claim, and challenges coverage in a separate declaratory action, a stipulated settlement that relieves the insured of any financial stake in the outcome of the case does not represent the damages \u201cwithin the contemplation of the parties when they entered into the [insurance] contract, and such as might naturally be expected to result from its violation.\u201d <em>Crumleys, </em>\u00b6 64 (internal quotation omitted). The insured has little incentive to minimize the settlement amount in negotiating a stipulated judgment. Nor is there any assurance that a stipulated judgment represents a proper calculation of the actual damages incurred by way of the breach. These concerns are clearly evident in the case before us. First, under the settlement, Vail has escaped all risk by simply assigning her insurance dispute with State Farm to Frank. The size of the judgment was essentially irrelevant to her. Then, the stipulated judgment does not, by its own terms, represent the correct measure of damages for the denial of <em>Alicia\u2019s </em>claims4;he only denial forming State Farm\u2019s breach. As explained above, the settlement agreement provides that $1.7 million of the $2.7 million total represents the economic loss to <em>Heath\u2019s Estate. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Yet, State Farm did not err in any way in adjusting and settling the claims made by Heath\u2019s Estate. State Farm tendered the full $50,000 Each Person coverage limit to Heath\u2019s Estate and did not breach its duty to indemnify Vail for Heath\u2019s claims. Thus, the bulk of the face amount of the stipulated judgment does not represent any measure of damages resulting from State Farm\u2019s breach of its duty to indemnify Vail for Alicia\u2019s claims. Alicia would not be entitled to the $1.7 million in damages Heath\u2019s Estate suffered even had the case proceeded to trial. The economic loss the decedent\u2019s estate suffers, as measured by the \u201cpresent value of [the decedent\u2019s] reasonable earnings during his life expectancy,\u201d is \u201cpersonal to the decedent\u201d and does not \u2018include any damages suffered by the decedent\u2019s widow, <em>children, </em>or other heirs.\u201d <em>Swanson v. Champion Intl. Corp., </em>197 Mont. 509, 515, 646 P.2d 1166, 1169 (1982) (emphasis added; citations omitted). Alicia\u2019s claims, on the other hand, were to compensate her personal loss of her fatherdoss of support, loss of companionship, loss of established course of life, etc. These wrongful-death claims are measured, not by the economic loss to the decedent\u2019s estate, but, rather, the emotional, physical, and monetary support the decedent would have provided the heir. <em>Swanson, </em>197 Mont. at 517-18, 646 P.2d at 1170-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">\u00b637 The rule articulated by these jurisdictions is even more appropriate for Montana, given that State Farm pursued the action we have repeatedly admonished insurers to take if there is a coverage question-defend the insured and file a declaratory judgment action to discern coverage. <em>See e.g. Palmer by Diacon v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>261 Mont. 91, 102-03, 861 P.2d 895, 902 (1993); <em>see also St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Cumiskey, </em>204 Mont. 350, 358, 665 P.2d 223, 227 (1983) (\u201can insurer may use this procedural device in order to obtain a determination of the validity, continuance, or coverage of an insurance policy; a determination of the extent of liability; <em>or a determination of the insurer\u2019s duties under the policy.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 28 (\u201cIf FUMIC wished to dispute coverage, it could have defended Staples under a reservation of rights and later sought judicial determination through a declaratory judgment action to determine whether coverage existed.\u2019); <em>Brewer, </em>\u00b6 30; <em>see also Nielsen, </em>442 F. Supp. 2d at 977. This practice is also urged by leading commentators. <em>See </em>Appleman, <em>Insurance Law &amp; Practice </em>vol. 20, \u00a7 11354 at 332-33 (West Publg. 1980) (\u2018The insurer thus has a right to test [through a declaratory judgment action] its liability to pay judgments which may be recovered against the insured, or to test its liability for penalties and interest.\u2019) (collecting cases); Allan D. Windt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>Insurance Claims &amp; Disputes:Representation of Insurance Companies &amp; Insureds </em>vol. 2, \u00a78.3 at 8-5 to 8-6 (6th ed., Thomson Reuters 2013) (noting it is appropriate for insurer to institute declaratory action after insured suffers loss so insurer can \u201cdetermine whether the company is obligated to pay all or any part of the judgment or loss.\u201d); <em>Couch on Insurance </em>vol. 16, \u00a7232:47 (Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, eds., 3d ed., Thomson/West 2005) (\u2018In essence, where language in the insurance contract is thought to need clarification in order to determine the legal positions of the parties, declaratory action is appropriate.\u201d). Lord, <em>Williston on Contracts </em>vol. 11, \u00a7 30:2 at 36-37 (West 2012) (\u201cA frequently employed means of demonstrating in an authoritative manner the intent of the parties to a contract, either for the purpose of establishing rights or the nonexistence of liabilities, is the petition for declaratory judgment. Insurance companies have often used this procedure in seeking a declaration from the courts that because of some exclusionary provision or false representation by the insured, they are not liable on a given policy which they have issued.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The rule also recognizes the distinctions between the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify. The broader duty to defend requires an insurer to act immediately to defend the insured from a claim. The insurer must do so on the basis of mere allegations that could implicate coverage, if proven. <em>Schwan, </em>\u00b6 15. On the other hand, the narrower duty to indemnify typically involves complicated interpretational questions that often require legal opinions and separate declaratory actions to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b638 A rule to the contrary would allow insureds to unilaterally inflate policy limits anytime an insurer tests coverage through a declaratory action. As State Farm notes, \u2018tb]asically, Frank\u2019s and Vail\u2019s position is that all an insured has to do is file suit, enter a confession of judgment, obtain a covenant not to execute, and the insurer becomes liable for the confessed judgment, regardless of whether the insurer pays limits as asked or has a reasonable basis in fact or law for disputing the amount of the claim and defending the underlying action.\u2019Tndeed, while Frank was willing to settle all claims against Vail for $100,000 if State Farm would foot the bill, the demand ballooned to $2.6 million when Vail\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>financial responsibility was removed from the equation.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\">\u00b639 Vail points to several cases which, when closely analyzed, do not address the issue here. In <em>Ariz. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Fund v. Helme, 735 </em>P.2d 451, 460 (Ariz. 1987), the Arizona Supreme Court held that doctors sued for malpractice did not breach their <em>duty to cooperate </em>with their insurer\u2019s defense of them by entering a settlement with the claimants after the insurer breached its duty to indemnify. The insurer erroneously interpreted the coverage available as limited to a per occurrence limit of $99,900. <em>Helme, 735 </em>P.2d at 454, 457. In a declaratory action, a court determined that there had been two occurrences. <em>Helme, </em>735 P.2d at 455. Meanwhile, the doctors settled with the claimants for $350,000 in exchange for the claimants\u2019 covenant not to execute against the doctors. <em>Helme, 735 </em>P.2d at 455. The insurer sought a declaration that it was not obligated to pay the survivors <em>on the second </em>claimsot the total settlement amount of $350,000-because the doctors had settled without the insurer\u2019s permission. <em>Helme, 735 </em>P.2d at 458. The Court disagreed, holding that the insurer\u2019s breach of its duty to indemnify under the policy permitted the insured to take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to save himself from the financial disaster of an excess judgment, including settling with the claimants. <em>Helme, 735 </em>P.2d at 460. However, the Court specifically noted that it was not determining whether that settlement would be binding on the insurer: \u2018The parties have not argued, and this opinion does not reach, any issue regarding the extent to which the stipulations which form part of the settlement agreement are binding upon the insurer.\u201d <em>Helme, 735 </em>P.2d at 460. Put another way, the Arizona Court did not hold that the insurer was bound to pay the stipulated judgment, but rather concluded the insurer was required to pay the appropriate policy limits for two occurrences, even though the insureds had settled without its permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b640 Vail also cites <em>Miller v. Shugart, </em>316 N.W.2d 729 (Minn. 1982). There, while the insurer was litigating whether it had coverage, the insured stipulated to a $100,000 judgment-twice the $50,000 limit of the policy-with the claimant in exchange for a covenant not to execute against him. <em>Miller, </em>316 N.W.2d at 731-32. After the Court had determined that coverage existed, the claimant sought to enforce only $50,000 of the stipulated judgment, which represented the policy limits. The insurer countered that it owed nothing because the insured had breached the cooperation clause of the policy. <em>Miller, </em>316 N.W.2d at 732. The Minnesota Supreme Court, like the Arizona Supreme Court in <em>Helme, </em>concluded that because the insurer had failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>indemnify its insured, the insured did not breach his duty to cooperate by entering a settlement to protect his personal finances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">If, as here, the insureds are offered a settlement that effectively relieves them of any personal liability, at a time when their insurance coverage is in doubt, surely it cannot be said that it is not in their best interest to accept the offer. Nor, do we think, can the insurer who is disputing coverage compel the insureds to forego a settlement which is in their best interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\"><em>Miller, </em>316 N.W.2d at 733-34. While the Court ultimately concluded that the stipulated judgment was enforceable upon the insurer, it was only enforceable <em>up to the policy </em>limits: \u2018Nor is there anything wrong with the insureds\u2019 confessing judgment in an amount double the policy limits, since plaintiff, in her motion for summary judgment, has recognized [the insurer\u2019s] coverage is only $50,000 and seeks to recover no more than that sum from [the insurer].\u201d <em>Miller, </em>316 N.W.2d at 734. In sum, the Minnesota Supreme Court never approved binding the insurer to a stipulated judgment in excess of policy limits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXl\">\u00b641 The other cases Vail cites are also unavailing because they are either cases involving a breach of the duty to defend <em>and </em>the court refused to enforce the stipulated judgment on the insurer, <em>Great Divide Ins. Co. v. Carpenter ex rel. Reed, </em>79 P.3d 599 (Alaska 2003) or, like the cases above, hold that the insured did not breach its duty to cooperate, and therefore is entitled to be indemnified for the settlement up to policy limits. <em>See Presrite Corp. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>680 N.E.2d 216, 217, 220-21 (Ohio App. 8th Dist. 1996) (insurer required to pay settlement the \u201cpolicy afforded\u201d because insured did not breach duty to cooperate when it settled lawsuit after insurer denied coverage thereby exposing insured to entire amount of potential damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>award).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In sum, none of the cases urged by Vail support the holding she asks for today: a stipulated judgment in excess of policy limits coupled with a covenant not to execute against the insured is the proper measure of damages when an insurer is defending its insured but contesting coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">\u00b642 As noted above, an insurer\u2019s wrongful refusal to indemnify entitles its insured to recover consequential damages. <em>Crumleys, </em>\u00b6 64. In <em>Crumleys, </em>we awarded the insured\u2019s assignee the \u201cadministrative costs\u201d incurred when the insurer denied coverage to extract an underground storage tank and remediate the area for leaking gasoline. <em>Crumleys, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 70-71. We reasoned that the property liability policy contemplated management and oversight costs of pollutant cleanup and that the administrative costs incurred in coordinating and managing the extraction and remediation were the natural consequence of the insurer\u2019s failure to step in and begin that cleanup. <em>Crumleys, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 70-71. An insurer is also \u2018liable for attorney fees when the insurer breaches its duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>Brewer, </em>\u00b6 36. Other courts have permitted insureds to recover lost profits as consequential damages from the wrongful denial or delay of coverage. <em>See Lawrence v. Will Darrah &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>516 N.W.2d 43 (Mich. 1994) (permitting insured to recover payment under an insurance policy for a stolen truck and for lost profits arising from insurer\u2019s breach of duty to indemnify); <em>Bettius &amp; Sanderson, P.

On behalf of Heath\u2019s Estate and Alicia, he asserts that State Farm committed bad faith when it failed to settle for this amount (third party claims). The District Court dismissed these claims on the ground that State Farm had a reasonable basis in law to contest coverage, which it reasoned was a complete defense to these causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b646 In <em>Jessen v. O\u2019Daniel, </em>210 F. Supp. 317 (D. Mont. 1962), Judge Jameson provided an early explanation of the origins of an insurer\u2019s duty to settle. Although insurance policies do not contain explicit contractual provisions requiring an insurer to accept reasonable settlement offers within the policy limits, a duty of \u201cgood faith\u201d consideration of settlement offers arises by implication from the policy\u2019s delegation to the insurer the authority to settle third-party claims. <em>Jessen, </em>210 F. Supp. at 325-26. Judge Jameson pointed out that an insurer\u2019s \u2018tejrror in judgment in not settling a case within the policy limits is not in itself sufficient to impose liability upon the insurer for any recovery in excess of the limits; nor is the mere fact that the insurer was unsuccessful in the trial of the case sufficient to show that the defense was not made in good faith.\u201d <em>Jessen, </em>210 F.

In <em>Redies, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-35, we reconciled our previous cases analyzing whether reasonableness is a question of fact for the jury or a question of law for the court. We concluded that although the determination of whether a party acted reasonably was typically a question of fact for the jury, whether an insurer was reasonable in its interpretation of legal precedent in its coverage determination was a question of law for the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>[W]e now clarify that while the assessment of reasonableness generally is within the province of the jury (or the court acting as fact-finder), <em>reasonableness is a question of law for the court to determine when it depends entirely on interpreting relevant legal precedents and evaluating the insurer\u2019s proffered defense under those precedents. </em>This distinction not only reflects the principle that the jury does not decide or determine the law, but also honors the relevant language of the [UTPA\u2019s reasonable basis in law defense].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><em>Redies, </em>\u00b6 35 (emphasis added; citations omitted). Then, the court must assess the insurer\u2019s proffered defense in light of that legal landscape. The reviewing court is not to ask whether it \u201cagree[s] with the plaintiffs theories of liability in the underlying suit but, rather, whether the insurer\u2019s grounds for contesting those theories were reasonable under the existing law.\u201d <em>Redies, </em>\u00b6 38. In the absence of caselaw on point, \u201cthe determinative question\u201d is whether the law in effect at the time, caselaw or statutory, provided sufficient guidance to signal to a reasonable insurer that its grounds for denying the claim were not meritorious. <em>See Redies, </em>\u00b6 43 (\u201cAccordingly, the determinative question is whether this progression in our case law toward holding an attorney liable to certain nonclients had, by the time [the plaintiff] stated her claims against [her lawyer], reached the point at which [the insurer\u2019s] assertion that [it] owed her no duty no longer constituted \u2018a reasonable basis in law\u2019 for contesting her claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b649 State Farm contested coverage for Alicia\u2019s derivative claims because it believed the \u2018Each Person\u201d limit in the policy unambiguously limited coverage to $50,000 for all claims related to Heath\u2019s <em>death.Freyer I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 7. State Farm asked its in-house counsel, Ridgeway, for an opinion about whether the policy covered Alicia\u2019s derivative claims. Ridgeway advised that courts interpreting the clause had concluded that derivative claims were subject to the same each person limit as the survivorship claim. <em>See McKinney v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>722 N.E.2d 1125 (Ill. 1999) (\u201cper person\u201d limit of liability clause \u201cclearly limited\u201d all claims arising out of the decedent\u2019s death to a single per person limit); <em>Geico Gen. Ins. Co. v. Arnold, </em>730 So. 2d 782 (Fla. Dist. App. 3d Dist. 1999) (\u201ceach person\u201d limit of liability clause not ambiguous and limited wrongful death and survival claims); <em>Cradoct v. Employers Cas. Co., </em>733 S.W.2d 301 (Tex. App. El Paso 1987) (\u201cper person\u201dlimitation applied to person injured in accident, not other persons suffering loss because of that injury). Thus, State Farm took the position that, once it paid the $50,000 Each Person limit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Heath\u2019s Estate, it had fulfilled its contractual obligation under the policy for claims related to his death. <em>Freyer I, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">\u00b650 The state of Montana precedent, discussed below, and this \u2018legal landscape\u201d across numerous jurisdictions certainly gave credence to State Farm\u2019s decision to contest coverage for Alicia\u2019s derivative claims. However, that did not end the inquiry, as State Farm was also required to analyze the claim in light of the specific language of the Limit of Liability clause in Vail\u2019s policy, which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">The amount of bodily injury liability coverage is shown on the declarations page under \u2018Limits of Liability-Coverage A-Bodily Injury [-W-], Each Person, Each Accident.\u201d <em>Under \u2018Each Person\u201d is the amount of coverage for all damages due to bodily injury to one person. \u2018Bodily injury to one person\u201d includes all injury and damages to other persons, including emotional distress, sustained by such other persons who do not sustain bodily injury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN7\">(Emphasis added.) State Farm\u2019s position was that the first emphasized sentence limited the amount of coverage for any and all claims arising from the bodily injury to one person to the $50,000 \u2018Each Person\u201d limit. Therefore, because Alicia\u2019s derivative claims stemmed from her father\u2019s death, and not her own bodily injury, those claims were subject to the same $50,000 limit as Heath\u2019s Estate\u2019s claims. As to the second sentence, State Farm read it as clarifying that emotional distress claims were likewise subject to the same $50,000 \u2018Each Person\u201d limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b651 Montana precedent that came closest to addressing this issue was <em>Bain v. </em>Gleason, 223 Mont. 442, 726 P.2d 1153 (1986) and <em>Treichel v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. </em>Co., 280 Mont. 443, 930 P.2d 661 (1997). In <em>Bain, </em>the plaintiffs wife was injured by a negligent driver who was insured under a $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident policy. <em>Bain, </em>223 Mont. at 444, 726 P.2d at 1154. The insurer paid the $25,000 per person limit, arguing that it constituted the \u2018full extent of and the limit\u201d of coverage under its policy. <em>Bain, </em>223 Mont. at 445, 726 P.2d at 1154. The policy limited the insurer\u2019s liability applicable to \u201ceach person\u201d to $25,000 \u2018for all damages arising out of bodily injury sustained by one person in any one occurrence.\u201d <em>Bain, </em>223 Mont. at 447, 726 P.2d at 1156. Plaintiff-husband brought a loss of consortium cause of action seeking to recover the additional $25,000 under the per accident limit. We rejected the plaintiffs claim because it was \u201cplain under our statutes, and under the policy provisions here that the \u2018each person\u2019 limitation refers to all damages imposed by law by whomever suffered resulting from one bodily injury and one accident; the \u2018each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>accident\u2019 limitation applies when two or more persons suffer bodily injury in the same accident.\u201d <em>Bain, </em>223 Mont. at 451, 726 P.2d at 1158. <em>Bain </em>did not specifically answer the question in <em>Freyer </em>/because there was only one person injured in the accident. However, its holding, especially when coupled with our analysis of the statutory minimum mandatory limits, suggested that the \u2018Each Person\u201d policy language restricting coverage to $25,000 \u2018for all damages arising out of bodily injury sustained by one person in any one occurrence\u201d meant that no matter how many others were injured in the accident, they could not use their own bodily injury to obtain additional \u2018Each Person\u201dcoverage for derivative damages stemming from another\u2019s bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b652 In <em>Treichel, </em>we analyzed another automobile liability policy that limited coverage to $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident. <em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 445, 930 P.2d at 663. The operative provision read: \u2018Under \u2018Each person\u2019 is the amount of coverage for all damages due to bodily injury to one person.\u201d <em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 445, 930 P.2d at 663. The plaintiff was riding her bicycle some distance behind her husband when she witnessed a motorist, insured with the above-described policy, strike her husband and throw him into the air- she also saw the \u201csevere head wound [the husband] received when his head hit the vehicle\u2019s windshield before he fell to the pavement.\u201d <em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 444-45, 930 P.2d at 662. The insurer, State Farm, paid the husband\u2019s estate the $25,000 per person coverage, but denied paying the plaintiff the remaining $25,000 because her claim was similar to the claim for loss of consortium presented in <em>Bain. Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 448, 930 P.2d at 664. We disagreed with State Farm, distinguishing <em>Bain </em>because the loss of consortium claims pursued by the husband there were materially different from the \u201con the scene, direct physical and emotional impact\u201d the wife suffered in personally watching her husband\u2019s grisly death in Treichel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">As the District Court pointed out in the case before us \u201cit is this personal, on the scene, direct physical and emotional impact which distinguishes emotional distress claims under <em>Sacco </em>from loss of consortium claims.\u201d [The plaintiff] was a separate person who received an independent and direct injury at the accident scene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\"><em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 449, 930 P.2d at 665. Treichel\u2019s holding suggested that, unlike derivative claims that were not considered \u2018bodily injury\u201d under <em>Bain, </em>emotional distress claims would be considered stand-alone bodily injury claims because they stemmed from the personal trauma experienced by an on-the-scene witnessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>of bodily injury to another. State Farm then decided that the \u2018Each Person\u201d policy provisions of the kind at issue in <em>Bain </em>and <em>Treichel </em>needed to be revised. State Farm thereafter modified the language of its \u2018Each Person\u201d limit by adding the sentence at issue in <em>Freyer I: </em>\u2018Bodily injury to one person includes all injury and damages to other persons, including emotional distress, sustained by such other persons who do not sustain bodily injury.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, the \u2018legal landscape\u201d for State Farm\u2019s interpretation of the policy language as applied to derivative claims was even more favorable than the landscape that was sufficient to shield the insurer in <em>Redies. </em>There, despite noting a \u201cprogression in our case law\u201d away from the insurer\u2019s coverage position, <em>Redies, </em>\u00b6 43, we nonetheless agreed with the insurer that at the time of the coverage decision, the law was not reasonably clear. <em>Redies, </em>\u00b6 57. Here, although <em>Bain </em>did not involve a situation where two people suffered bodily injury, it appeared to hold that derivative claims were subject to the \u2018Each Person\u2019Timit of the deceased person. <em>Treichel </em>appeared to nuance <em>Bain </em>by holding that emotional distress claims arising from on-the-scene traumatic experiences would also constitute a bodily injury of the observing person. Then, State Farm took action in response to <em>Treichel </em>by supplementing the language of the Limit of Liability clause-which, according to <em>Bain, </em>already provided that derivative claims were subject to the deceased person\u2019s \u2018Each Person\u201d limit-with an additional sentence that specified that emotional distress claims were likewise subject to the \u2018Each Person\u201d limits of the deceased person. While this drafting fix failed to accomplish its intended purpose in <em>Freyer I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-14 (interpreting by negative inference the clause\u2019s specific mention of \u201cpeople who do not sustain bodily injury\u201d to mean that derivative claims of those who <em>did </em>suffer bodily injury were not subject to \u2018Each Person\u201d limits of the deceased person), its interpretation, while ultimately wrong, was clearly not unreasonable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u00b653 Because under \u2018Montana common law, an insurer cannot be held liable for bad faith in denying a claim if the insurer had a reasonable basis for contesting the claim,\u201d State Farm did not breach the covenant of good faith and fair dealing with Vail, nor commit bad faith by failing to settle with Frank. <em>Ellinghouse, </em>223 Mont. at 248, 725 P.2d at 223; <em>Palmer by Diacon, </em>261 Mont. at 102, 861 P.2d at 901-02; <em>White, </em>\u00b6 24.

D-2 Trucking, Inc., </em>2003 MT 122, 315 Mont. 519, 70 P.3d 721, citing an insurer\u2019s obligation to attempt to settle within policy limits when \u2018liability is reasonably clear,\u201d and the possibility that a \u201creasonable jury could conclude ... State Farm breached its obligation to attempt settlement within policy limits, thus placing the insured in jeopardy.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 68. However, this case is not a <em>Shilhanek </em>situation, because <em>Shilhanek </em>did not involve a coverage issue. Without coverage, a duty to settle does not arise, even if the facts of the accident indicate that the insured\u2019s liability, i.e., her negligence, is reasonably clear. <em>See Mowry v. Badger St. Mut. Cas. Co., </em>385 N.W.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>171, 178 (Wis. 1986) (the insurer\u2019s \u201cduty to settle is dependent upon whether the policy extends coverage for the circumstances underlying the harm sustained.\u201d). Here, State Farm contested, not whether Vail\u2019s liability for the accident was reasonably clear, but whether there was coverage at all for the claim. The Dissent notes there was no question about Vail\u2019s liability for the accident. Had there had been no coverage issues, and State Farm had still refused to budge from its $5,000 offer, <em>Shilhanek </em>would have been implicated and this would be a different case.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">\u00b655 The Dissent cites <em>Dean v. Austin Mut. Ins. </em>Co., 263 Mont. 386, 869 P.2d 256 (1994), for the proposition that reasonableness is a jury question. <em>See </em>Dissent, \u00b6 71. Oddly, the Dissent does not discuss <em>Redies, </em>in which we expressly concluded that the general rule stated in <em>Dean </em>did not apply when the insurer raises a \u201creasonable basis in law\u201d defense because questions of law are resolved by the courts, reflecting \u201cthe principle that the jury does not decide or determine the law.\u201d <em>Redies, </em>\u00b6 35; <em>see also White, </em>\u00b6 24. While the issue did go to the jury in <em>Palmer by Diacon, </em>coverage there was denied because of <em>factual </em>disputes about the underlying accident that required resolution by the trier of fact. <em>Palmer by Diacon, </em>261 Mont. at 102, 861 P.2d at 902 (\u201cIn this case, Farmers contested liability, contending that Palmer\u2019s accident was not caused by another motorist, and therefore, Palmer\u2019s uninsured motorist policy did not cover the accident.\u201d). <em>Ellinghouse </em>is likewise consistent with our analysis. There, we held it was error for Ellinghouse to introduce evidence and argue to the jury on the question of whether the insurer had a reasonable basis in law defense, but concluded the error was harmless in light of other circumstances. <em>Ellinghouse, </em>223 Mont. at 251, 725 P.2d at 224-25. None of our cases declare this issue of law to be a jury question, and <em>Redies </em>clearly resolved any doubt on the issue. Factual disputes affecting coverage are certainly decided by the trier of fact, and this opinion does not change that.

The Court\u2019s decision was founded on the practical point that, without such a rule, insureds could unilaterally bind insurers to settlements in every case where coverage was contested. <em>Buysse, </em>448 N.W.2d at 872.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b239-4\"> Amicus MTLA and Vail argue that <em>Peris v. Safeco Ins. Co., </em>276 Mont. 486, 493-94, 916 P.2d 780, 785 (1996) controls here. However, like the other cases cited, <em>Peris </em>does not stand for the proposition that an insurer who defends the insured while contesting coverage is <em>bound </em>to a stipulated judgment if it is later determined the insurer was wrong on the coverage issue. Instead, like <em>Helme </em>and <em>Miller, Peris </em>merely holds that the insured is permitted, without voiding the insurance contract via its duty to cooperate with the insurer, to enter settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b245-3\"> The record contains communications between State Farm and the State Auditor\u2019s Office. State Farm advised the Auditor\u2019s Office that it was amending its policy fin response to the court case of <em>Treichel vs. State Farm. </em>\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b245-4\"> The reasonableness of State Farm\u2019s position is further evidenced by the fact that Montana\u2019s federal district court had agreed with it. Prior to <em>Freyer I, </em>Hon. Richard Cebull held that even in a case involving bodily injury to two passengers, the \u2018Limits of Liability\u201d clause prohibited an injured person from recovering derivative claims under their own \u201cEach Person\u201d policy limits. <em>See Bowen I. </em>There, like here, two people suffered bodily injury in an accident. A wife suffered \u201cabrasions to her face, a broken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>right arm, glass imbedded in her forehead, chest contusions, and post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d The husband died from his injuries. <em>Bowen I </em>at 1. The vehicle was insured for policy limits of $100,000 for \u2018Each Person\u201d and $300,000 for \u2018Each Accident.\u201d After State Farm paid policy limits to the husband\u2019s estate, the wife sought derivative damages for her husband\u2019s death. <em>Bowen I </em>at 1-2. State Farm filed a declaratory judgment action, \u201cseeking a judicial determination of whether the \u2018Each Person\u2019 limit contained in the Bowens\u2019 policies applies when there are survival and wrongful death claims arising out of the injury and death of a single insured.\u201d <em>Bowen I </em>at 2. Judge Cebull analyzed <em>Bain </em>and <em>Treichel </em>and concluded that the key question was \u201cwhether wrongful death and survival claims are more like the loss of consortium claims encountered in <em>Bain </em>or the emotional distress claims in <em>Treichel.\u201d Bowen </em>I at 5. Judge Cebull concluded that they were more akin to <em>Bain </em>because of the fundamental difference between emotional distress claims and wrongful death/survival claims. <em>Bowen I </em>at 8, <em>aff'd, </em>247 Fed. Appx. 901 (9th Cir. 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b246-13\"> Vail briefly argues that pursuant to our decision in <em>Freyer I, </em>the law-of-the-case doctrine and collateral estoppel prevent State Farm from arguing it had a reasonable basis in law to challenge coverage. To the extent Vail is arguing that because <em>Freyer I </em>turned on the Court\u2019s interpretation of policy language, instead of case law, her argument is unavailing because the \u2018interpretation of an insurance contract presents a question of law.\u201d <em>Modroo, </em>\u00b6 23. Collateral estoppel is likewise inapplicable because <em>Freyer I </em>did not decide that State Farm\u2019s interpretation was unreasonable. Thus, State Farm is not reopening an issue already decided by this Court. <em>See Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2006 MT 51, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 281, 130 P.3d 1267.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b247-4\"> Of note, the Dissent relies heavily on the fact that State Farm revised its policy language after this claim was made to urge reversal. <em>See </em>Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 67, 69. However, there is no indication in the record that State Farm\u2019s subsequent language revision, which was applicable prospectively to future claims, was done as a result of this claim. Courts must he cautious about permitting evidence of post-claim actions to assess the reasonableness of claim decisions when no relation to the claim has been demonstrated. To do otherwise would prompt speculation and raise questions of relevance and prejudice. The question turns on an analysis of \"the legal landscape as it existed during the relevant time period.\u201d <em>Redies, </em>\u00b6 29. In any event, State Farm\u2019s post-claim actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>here did not change the clear authority that existed in favor of State Farm\u2019s interpretation of its policy at the time of the claim, and do not raise a material fact prohibiting summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b249-5\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"A6S\">concurs and dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b664 I concur with the Court\u2019s disposition of Issue One. I would reverse and remand Issues Two and Three for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b665 Issue Two presents the question of whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to State Farm on the common-law bad faith and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims presented by Frank. Frank asserts two claims. In his first-party claim, in which he stands in the shoes of Vail pursuant to assignment, Frank argues that State Farm breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing to Vail, by refusing to accept Frank\u2019s reasonable demand to settle Alicia\u2019s claims against Vail for the additional $50,000 available under the policy. He presents a similar third-party claim on behalf of Heath\u2019s estate and Alicia. The Court agrees with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that summary judgment was appropriate because State Farm had a reasonable basis in law to contest coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\u00b666 Frank points out that by refusing to accept his demand, and by offering only $5,000 and refusing to further negotiate, State Farm put Vail in jeopardy of having an excess judgment entered against her. Vail asked State Farm to defend her in the underlying liability suit and indemnify her without limits, both of which State Farm refused to do. In fact, in a letter written to Vail in 2008, State Farm not only refused to indemnify her, but also indicated it would not pay for the defense of the declaratory judgment action that it had filed against her. Frank further points out that it was almost three years after he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>made a demand for the limits of liability upon State Farm that the company even began considering the filing of a declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b667 In addition to the foregoing, it bears noting that in 2006, a year <em>before </em>it filed its declaratory action defending its limits of liability clause in the <em>Freyer I </em>litigation, State Farm amended its automobile policies in Montana to remove the key phrase in the limits of liability clause that reads \u201csustained by such other persons who do not sustain bodily injury.\u201d This fact was not disclosed to Frank or Vail at all until December 2011 and only then because State Farm was asked in discovery to produce the text of the \u2018Limits of Liability\u201d clauses it had used both before and after the issuance of Freyer\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b668 The Court errs in its analysis of Issue Two in two major respects. First, it focuses solely on the question of whether State Farm had a reasonable basis in law to contest coverage. It apparently concludes that the question of whether State Farm refused to settle within policy limits where liability is reasonably clear is wholly subsumed within the \u201creasonable basis in law\u201d analysis. The questions are related but nonetheless distinct. There is no question of Vail\u2019s liability for the accident. Where liability is reasonably clear, an insurer has an obligation to attempt to settle within policy limits so as to protect its insured from the prospect of a judgment in excess of policy limits. <em>Shilhanek v. D-2 Trucking, Inc., </em>2003 MT 122, \u00b6 25, 315 Mont. 519, 70 P.3d 721. A reasonable jury could conclude that by refusing over a period of three years to budge from a $5,000 offer under the foregoing circumstances, State Farm breached its obligation to attempt settlement within policy limits, thus placing its insured in jeopardy. The Court cites <em>Jessen </em>with approval in \u00b6 46, but then disregards the very point of the discussion: the question of whether an insurer acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d is to be made on a case-by-case basis. As noted below, the question is one of fact, not law.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b669 Second, the Court errs in construing all facts in favor of State Farm in reaching its conclusion that State Farm had a reasonable basis in law to contest coverage. It presumes throughout its analysis that State Farm acted in complete good faith, weaving into the Opinion an analysis of our case law so as to justify the amended language that State Farm added to its \u201ceach person\u201d limit-language which this Court later interpreted against it. Noticeably, however, the Court does not even address the fact that State Farm again amended its automobile policies in Montana a year before filing this declaratory action, so as to remove the key phrase from its limits of liability clause. Given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>timing of this policy revision, and the fact that it occurred while State Farm was steadfastly refusing to negotiate with Frank, a reasonable jury could certainly conclude that State Farm made the conscious decision to change its policy midstream because it concluded it may <em>not </em>have a reasonable basis in law for contesting such claims after all.</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">\u00b670 On summary judgment, a court should not be weighing the evidence or choosing one disputed fact over another. <em>Cole v. Valley Ice Garden, L.L.C., </em>2005 MT 115, \u00b6 4, 327 Mont. 99, 113 P.3d 275. This covert policy change in the midst of a settlement standoff plays an important role in Freyers\u2019 argument that State Farm engaged in bad faith. The Court errs in choosing to wholly disregard this significant factor and the potential bearing it could have on a jury\u2019s analysis of State Farm\u2019s reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\">\u00b671 Unfortunately, making reasonableness determinations at the summary judgment stage is becoming a trend. In <em>White </em>(Cotter, J., concurring and dissenting), we upheld summary judgment in favor of State Fund, concluding that White\u2019 shad faith claims must fail because State Fund had a reasonable basis in law for terminating his benefits. In so doing, we ignored a time-honored premise. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 28. In <em>Dean v. Austin Mut. Ins. Co., </em>263 Mont. 386, 389, 869 P.2d 256, 258 (1994), we said that \u201creasonableness is generally a question of fact; therefore, it is for the trier of fact to weigh the evidence and judge the credibility of the witnesses in determining whether the insurer had a \u2018reasonable basis\u2019 for denying a claim.\u201dAs in <em>White, </em>we again ignore <em>Dean\u2019s </em>caution by concluding here that reasonableness is susceptible to determination on summary judgment, and by selecting the facts that support our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\u00b672 The Court cites three cases for the proposition that an insurer cannot be held liable for bad faith if the insurer had a reasonable basis for contesting the claim. Opinion, \u00b6 55. <em>White </em>is one of those cases. In the other two cases we <em>cite-Ellinghouse </em>and <em>Palmer by </em>Diacon-4he question of whether the insurer engaged in bad faith was resolved by a jury. Though the verdict in favor of Palmer was reversed on other grounds, we stated in <em>Palmer </em>that the district court did not err \u201cby concluding that reasonable people could draw different conclusions about whether Farmers\u2019 had a reasonable basis for contesting Palmer\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Palmer, </em>261 Mont. at 104, 861 P.2d at 903. As in <em>White, </em>I again maintain here that while reasonable people could ultimately determine that State Farm had a reasonable basis for denying a claim, they could also conclude to the contrary. The point is that the reasonableness of State Farm\u2019s conduct is for the trier of fact to determine. I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>therefore reverse and remand for a jury\u2019s determination Freyers\u2019 common-law bad faith claims and their claims that State Farm breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b673 Finally, as to Issue Three, I conclude consistent with the above analysis that the Court also errs in upholding summary judgment on the UTPA claims. I would reverse and remand the UTPA claims for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b674 I therefore concur and dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-6\">JUSTICE WHEAT joins the Concurrence and Dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
