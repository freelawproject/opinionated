We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\u00b63 <em>Whether Mederos\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ABW\">\u00b64 A.R. and A.S. were both seven years old at the time that they alleged Mederos sexually assaulted them. A.S. lived with her mother Laura. A.R. lived with her mother, Laura\u2019s sister, Kelley. Mederos was married to Kelley, so he also lived with A.R. A.S. and A.R. were close friends and spent lots of time together.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">\u00b65 In 2011, A.S. told Laura that she did not want to go to her Aunt Kelley\u2019s apartment because Mederos had been \u201csexing\u201dher. A.S. also told Laura that Mederos had engaged in sexual contact with A.R. Laura contacted Kelley and the girls\u2019 grandfather, Larry. Laura, Kelley, and Larry confronted Mederos. Mederos denied the claims. Laura reported Mederos to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">\u00b66 Forensic investigators interviewed the girls. The girls provided vague and unclear accounts during the forensic interviews. Medical examinations showed some signs of trauma, but ultimately proved inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">\u00b67 Mederos denied the charges at trial. The two girls testified at trial. Both girls offered disjointed and, at times, contradictory testimony about what happened. A.R. and A.S. often responded that they did not remember what happened when counsel for the State or Mederos\u2019s counsel asked them for more details.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">\u00b68 Laura, Kelley, and Larry all testified at trial about the events of the night that A.S. told Laura that Mederos had been \u201csexing\u201dher. The State also presented the testimony of other witnesses. These other witnesses included clinical social worker Dawn English (English), pediatrician Dr. Kenneth Graham (Graham), and forensic interviewers Shawna Guay (Guay) and Sue Casey (Casey). English testified about her therapy sessions with A.R. and A.S. She commented that A.S. had made consistent statements during therapy. Graham discussed his medical examination of the girls and what he had reported in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>forensic medical reports. Both Guay and Casey testified about their forensic interviews with the girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b69 A jury convicted Mederos of both counts of sexual assault. The District Court sentenced Mederos to concurrent 100 year sentences at Montana State Prison, with 50 years of each sentence suspended. Mederos appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b610 Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel present mixed issues of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>State v. Clary, </em>2012 MT 26, \u00b6 12, 364 Mont. 53, 270 P.3d 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\u00b611 Mederos argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in two areas. Mederos first contends that his counsel failed to object to numerous incidences of hearsay testimony by various witnesses. He also argues that his counsel improperly stipulated to the admission of multiple items of evidence that contained otherwise inadmissible hearsay statements. Mederos contends that this evidence bolstered A.R.\u2019s and A.S.\u2019s testimony and raises a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different if this additional, cumulative evidence had not been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">\u00b612 We evaluate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-prong test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984). <em>State v. Howard, </em>2011 MT 246, \u00b6 20, 362 Mont. 196, 265 P.3d 606. A defendant must establish that: (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. <em>Rosling v. State, </em>2012 MT 179, \u00b6 23, 366 Mont. 50, 285 P.3d 486. A defendant must establish both prongs of the test. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 11, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. We will not address both prongs if a defendant fails to establish either prong. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">\u00b613 A deficient performance falls \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20. We have recognized \u2018\u201ca strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 15, quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065. A petitioner who argues that his counsel\u2019s \u2018failure to object rendered counsel ineffective must show that counsel\u2019s trial objection would have been proper and that the court likely would have sustained the objection.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>Rogers v. State, </em>2011 MT 105, \u00b6 16, 360 Mont. 334, 253 P.3d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b614 Mederos argues first that his counsel failed to object to multiple and repeated instances of hearsay testimony. Mederos posits that Laura, Kelley, and Larry offered impermissible hearsay testimony regarding earlier statements made by A.R. and A.S. Mederos also argues that Graham, English, Guay, and Casey improperly testified to the girls\u2019 out-of-court statements and identifications of Mederos as the perpetrator. The State argues that Mederos\u2019s trial counsel used testimony from these witnesses to cast doubt on the girls\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"AKe\">\u00b615 Not all out-of-court statements constitute hearsay. Montana Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1) specifically excludes from the hearsay rule a prior statement by a witness where \u2018the declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement\u201d under two separate circumstances relevant here. The first circumstance involves a statement that is \u201cinconsistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony.\u201d M. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A). The second circumstance involves a statement that is \u201cconsistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of subsequent fabrication, improper influence or motive.\u201d M. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b616 Mederos must show that hearsay objections would have been proper and that the trial court would have sustained the objection to support his claims of ineffective assistance. <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 16. A.R. and A.S. both testified at trial and Mederos\u2019s counsel cross-examined each regarding their earlier statements. Many of A.R.\u2019s and A.S.\u2019s prior statements likely would qualify as prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b617 A claimed lapse of memory represents an inconsistency under M. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A). <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 31, citing <em>State v. Lawrence, </em>285 Mont. 140, 159, 948 P.2d 186, 198 (1997). A.R. and A.S. frequently responded that they did not know or could not remember answers to questions during direct and cross-examination. The girls\u2019 testimony charitably can be described as vague at times and somewhat unclear. The repeated lapses in memory in the girls\u2019 testimony allowed the State to introduce other witnesses to testify about the girls\u2019 prior inconsistent statements. <em>See Howard, </em>\u00b6 31, citing <em>Lawrence, </em>285 Mont. at 159, 948 P.2d at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b618 Laura\u2019s, Kelley\u2019s, and Larry\u2019s testimony introduced the girls\u2019 prior inconsistent statements. A court may admit consistent statements in conjunction with inconsistent statements where the nature of a witness\u2019s testimony makes it difficult for the court to separate the consistent from the inconsistent portions of the prior statement. <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 31, citing <em>Lawrence, </em>285 Mont. at 160, 948 P.2d at 198. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>witnesses admittedly mixed consistent statements with inconsistent ones. The record indicates that to parse the consistent statements from the inconsistent statements likely would have made the witnesses\u2019 testimony disjointed and confusing. <em>See Howard, </em>\u00b6 31, citing <em>Lawrence, </em>285 Mont. at 160, 948 P.2d at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b619 For example, A.S. testified that she had talked to her mother about Mederos on February 28,2011. Mederos\u2019s counsel asked A.S. on cross-examination when she first had told her mother that Mederos had been molesting her. A.S. responded that she did not remember. A.S.\u2019s disjointed testimony failed to provide a clear picture of what actually happened on February 28, 2011. Laura testified about events that happened the night that A.S. told Laura that Mederos had been \u201csexing\u201d her. Laura\u2019s testimony clarified what she and A.S. had discussed on February 28, 2011, and what A.S. had told her about Mederos. For the District Court to have admitted only parts of Laura\u2019s testimony would have led to a piecemeal picture of what had happened that likely would have further confused the jury. Laura\u2019s testimony provided a time frame and context for A.S.\u2019s testimony about what happened when she told her mother about Mederos.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b620 Mederos\u2019s counsel may have had strategic reasons for not objecting even if all of Laura\u2019s, Kelley\u2019s, and Larry\u2019s testimony did not fall under M. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A). We have held that counsel\u2019s use of objections \u2018lies within his or her discretion.\u201d <em>Riggs v. State, </em>2011 MT 239, \u00b6 53, 362 Mont. 140, 264 P.3d 693. <em>Riggs </em>also involved a sexual assault case against minors. Riggs raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on his counsel\u2019s failure to object when several witnessesAhe victims\u2019 mothers, social workers, and law enforcement officers-effered prior consistent statements made by the victims. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b621 Riggs\u2019s counsel testified at an evidentiary hearing on Riggs\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief that he had not objected to these witnesses\u2019 statements because he wanted to point out the numerous inconsistencies in the victims\u2019 <em>statements.Riggs, </em>\u00b6 53. We recognized that different counsel have different trial strategies and that Riggs\u2019s counsel\u2019s strategy was objectively reasonable. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 54. As in <em>Riggs, </em>Mederos\u2019s counsel may have opted not to object to Laura\u2019s, Kelley\u2019s, and Larry\u2019s testimony in order to highlight inconsistencies in the girls\u2019 stories. Mederos\u2019s counsel had discretion not to object. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"AXp\">\u00b622 Mederos next asserts that Graham, the examining pediatrician, improperly testified to A.R.\u2019s out-of-court statements recorded by the forensic interview team. Mederos classifies this testimony by Graham as hearsay within hearsay. Mederos ignores the fact that the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>previously had stipulated to the admission of A.R.\u2019s forensic interview. Graham simply testified to matters previously admitted into evidence through the forensic interviews and forensic medical reports that he had prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b623 Mederos also argues that Graham offered impermissible hearsay that A.S. \u2018had disclosed digital/vaginal penetration.\u201d The parties previously had stipulated to the admission of A.S\u2019s forensic medical report created by Graham. Graham\u2019s testimony repeated statements that he had made in A.S.\u2019s forensic medical report, including the notion that A.S. \u2018had disclosed digital/vaginal penetration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b624  Presentation to a jury of admissible evidence that proves the same facts as tainted evidence usually amounts to harmless error when the tainted evidence qualifies as cumulative of the admissible evidence. <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 47, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735. We have characterized as cumulative a witness\u2019s testimony regarding out-of-court statements, and, thus, harmless error, as the statements mirrored those made on a 911 tape that the trial court earlier had admitted without objection. <em>State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, \u00b6 26, 330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b625 Graham\u2019s testimony repeated statements made in A.R.\u2019s forensic interview and A.S.\u2019s forensic medical report. Both documents earlier had been admitted without objection. Graham\u2019s testimony would qualify as cumulative of the previously admitted documents. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. The District Court\u2019s admission of Graham\u2019s statements, regardless whether Mederos\u2019s counsel objected, would be subject to harmless error analysis. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. \u201cAn ineffective assistance of counsel claim cannot succeed when predicated on counsel\u2019s failure to take an action which, under the circumstances, would likely not have changed the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>State v. Haldane, </em>2013 MT 32, \u00b6 37, 368 Mont. 396, 300 P.3d 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b626 Mederos contends that social worker English repeated hearsay statements in her testimony when the State asked English whether A.S. had been consistent about her allegations and the identity of her abuser. English testified that A.S. had been \u201ccompletely consistent.\u201d English\u2019s testimony regarding A.S.\u2019s prior consistent statement likely would not qualify as hearsay under M. R. Evid. 801(c). English did not restate A.S.\u2019s prior statements in court to prove the \u2018truth of the matter asserted\u201din the statements. M. R. Evid. 801(c). Rather, English testified in response to Mederos\u2019s attacks on A.S.\u2019s veracity as a witness. <em>See State v. Robins, </em>2013 MT 71, \u00b6 11, 369 Mont. 291, 297 P.3d 1213 (discussing situations in which it would be appropriate for an expert witness to testify about a child sexual abuse victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>credibility). English contended that A.S. consistently had alleged that Mederos had engaged in sexual conduct with her. Mederos\u2019s counsel legitimately could have believed that he did not have grounds to object to the statement as hearsay. <em>See State v. Aker, </em>2013 MT 253, \u00b6 36, 371 Mont. 491, 310 P.3d 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b627 Mederos also argues that forensic interviewers Guay and Casey presented hearsay statements. Guay and Casey testified regarding statements made by A.R. and A.S. during forensic interviews. The parties previously had stipulated to the admission of the forensic interviews. The statements would qualify as cumulative of the previously admitted forensic interviews. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 26; <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. Cumulative evidence will be deemed harmless \u201c \u2018unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019State v. Hansen, </em>1999 MT 253, \u00b6 86, 296 Mont. 282, 989 P.2d 338, quoting <em>State v. Carter, </em>285 Mont. 449, 459, 948 P.2d 1173, 1178-79 (1997); \u00a746-20-701(1), MCA. Unfairly prejudicial evidence \u201carouses the jury\u2019s hostility or sympathy for one side without regard to its probative value.\u201d <em>State v. Ugalde, </em>2013 MT 308, \u00b6 47, 372 Mont. 234, 311 P.3d 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b628 Mederos\u2019s counsel could exercise discretion regarding when to object. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 53. He may have chosen not to object for a variety of reasons, even when a witness proffered hearsay testimony. Testimony from Laura, Larry, Kelley, Graham, Guay, and Casey contradicted the girls\u2019 vague and erratic testimony throughout trial. Mederos\u2019s counsel successfully brought out these contradictions through cross-examination. Mederos\u2019s counsel may have anticipated that these witnesses\u2019 testimony would create a tangled story that ultimately would undermine the girls\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b629 Mederos next challenges the District Court\u2019s admission of various items of evidence in the record that he argues should have been excluded as hearsay. A statement can be oral or written for purposes of hearsay. M. R. Evid. 801(a). Mederos\u2019s counsel stipulated to the admission of all the State\u2019s exhibits before trial. This stipulation included four main items: (1) video recordings of the girls\u2019 forensic interviews, (2) drawings and pictures created during the girls\u2019 forensic interviews, (3) reports from the girls\u2019 forensic medical exams, and (4) A.S.\u2019s emergency room medical report.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u00b630 The girls frequently mentioned that they could not remember certain events throughout their testimony. As discussed previously, lapsed memories constitute inconsistent statements under M. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A). <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 31, citing <em>Lawrence, </em>285 Mont. at 159, 948 P.2d at 198. The girls also made statements at trial directly inconsistent with statements they had offered during the forensic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>interviews. For example, A.S. told Casey during her forensic interview that Mederos had twice put his finger in her \u201cpee-pee.\u201d A.S. testified in trial, though, that Mederos put his finger in her \u201cpee-pee\u201d three times and that she \u201cremember[ed] telling everyone that. he put his finger in [her] pee-pee three times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b631 Mederos\u2019s counsel cross-examined A.R. and A.S. and the other witnesses presented by the State regarding these inconsistent statements. Mederos\u2019s counsel highlighted the fact that A.S. testified differently at trial than she had testified during the forensic interviews. These inconsistencies may have prompted Mederos\u2019s counsel to stipulate to the admission of the forensic reports for strategic reasons to help undermine the girls\u2019 testimony through cross-examination. Counsel\u2019s actions, taken in this light, do not appear to fall \u2018below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b632 The State introduced pictures and drawings from the girls\u2019 forensic interviews. A.R. labeled body parts on a picture of the human body during her forensic interview. The State used the picture to establish how A.R. identified different body parts. The State did not use the picture with A.R\u2019s annotations to establish that the picture presented a true and accurate representation of the human body. The State instead introduced the picture to demonstrate to, and clarify for, the jury the names that A.R. used for different body parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b633 A.S. drew a picture during her forensic interview. A.S.\u2019s drawing depicted events that A.S. claimed had happened in the bedroom with Mederos. A.S. denied at trial having made the drawing. The admission of the drawing, coupled with A.S.\u2019s denial of having made the drawing, undermined A.S.\u2019s credibility as a witness. The decision by Mederos\u2019s counsel to stipulate to admission of the drawing had the potential to help Mederos\u2019s case as evidenced by A.S.\u2019s denial that she had made the drawing.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u00b634 Graham created separate forensic medical reports for A.S. and A.R. Both medical reports contain fertile ground for cross-examination. A.S.\u2019s medical report illuminates inconsistencies in her claims. A.S. states in the report that Mederos had touched her in January. A.S.\u2019s mother testified at trial, however, that A.S. had not been to Mederos\u2019s house in January. A.R.\u2019s medical report indicates that she previously had been to the Child Evaluation Center based on allegations of possible sexual abuse by a different family member. Both reports provide inconclusive physical evidence of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">\u00b635 The State also introduced a medical report from A.S.\u2019s emergency room visit after Laura had reported the case to the police. A.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>reported the presence of \u201cwhite stuff\u2019 in her vaginal area after Mederos had molested her. One might deduce that the \u201cwhite stuff\u2019 had been semen. The emergency room medical report offers another possible explanation, however, for \u201cwhite stuff\u2019found in A.S.\u2019s vaginal area. The report speculates that A.S. might have had a yeast infection. Mederos\u2019s counsel reasonably could have anticipated that the admission of these medical reports would benefit his client. This interpretation would position Mederos\u2019s counsel\u2019s actions within the standard of reasonable professional assistance. <em>See Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 14, citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S. Ct. at 2065.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b636 We ask \u201cwhy\u201d Mederos\u2019s counsel did or did not perform as alleged in evaluating Mederos\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance throughout <em>trial.Aker, </em>\u00b6 34, citing <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 21. We look to the record to answer this question. <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 34, citing <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 21. We cannot address a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal if the defendant bases his claim on matters outside of the record. <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 34, citing <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095. A petition for post-conviction relief would allow Mederos to develop a record to explain \u2018Why\u201d his counsel acted as he did at trial. <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 34. A reviewing court then could determine \u201c \u2018whether counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective or merely a tactical decision.\u2019 <em>\u201dAker, </em>\u00b6 34, quoting <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b637  The evidence as a whole illuminates inconsistencies in the girls\u2019 story and undermines their veracity as witnesses. Mederos\u2019s counsel addressed these inconsistencies in his closing statements. Mederos\u2019s counsel also may have perceived that all of the statements and evidence contested by Mederos did not actually violate hearsay rules. The trial record does not include an explanation for Mederos\u2019s counsel\u2019s trial strategy. We decline to speculate on the claimed error on direct appeal as Mederos\u2019s allegations of ineffective counsel implicate questions of trial strategy that exceed the scope of the record. <em>See Aker, </em>\u00b6 37, citing <em>State v. Dyfort, </em>2000 MT 338, \u00b6 11, 303 Mont. 153, 15 P.3d 464. A petition for post-conviction relief represents the appropriate route for Mederos to develop a record to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u00b638 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
