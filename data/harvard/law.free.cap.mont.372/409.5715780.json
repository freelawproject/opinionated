The five employees had been disciplined by the City for inappropriate computer usage on their work computers. The Billings Gazette <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>(Gazette) sought access to documents detailing the investigation into and punishment of the misconduct. The City disclosed some documents but refused to release the disciplinary corrective action forms, and redacted all information that could be used to identify the five employees or uninvolved third parties alleging that to do so would violate the employees\u2019 right to privacy. The District Court ruled in favor of the Gazette and ordered that unredacted copies of all documents, including the corrective action forms, be provided to the newspaper. The City appealed, and obtained an order staying judgment through appeal as to the identifying information, but not as to the corrective action forms. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">\u00b62 We restate and consider the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court err by ordering that identifying information for five City employees disciplined for accessing pornography on their government computers be released to the Gazette?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AgJ\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying the Gazette\u2019s request for attorney </em>fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b65 Between March and June of 2012, the City discovered five city employees (Employees) had possibly been using their respective public City computers to access adult and/or pornographic material on the Internet during work hours. The City conducted separate internal investigations into the Internet activity of each Employee. Upon conclusion of each investigation, the City issued a written corrective action determination to each Employee, setting forth a summary of the evidence gathered during the investigation and the disciplinary action being taken by the City as a result. Each of the Employees was suspended for five days without pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u00b66 On August 24, 2012, the Gazette requested copies of \u201call written reprimands or records of other disciplinary actions affecting employees of the City Attorney s office between February 1, 2012 and August 24, 2012.\u201d On August 28, 2012, the Gazette requested the City provide a list of all city employees who had been disciplined within the prior six months. On August 31, 2012, the Gazette requested \u201cdocumentation of the s\u00e9arches/filtering that indicated a pattern of attempts to access blocked sites in the cases involving the five city workers suspended for accessing (or attempting to access) inappropriate websites[;] any reports by [the City\u2019s Chief Information Office] regarding such searches; any communications between city employees... [and] any due process letters resulting from these incidents.\u201d The City denied the first two requests, citing the employees\u2019 privacy rights but, in response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>to the third request, provided copies of its investigative documents relating to the Internet activity of the Employees and email correspondence sent in connection with the City\u2019s internal investigation of the Employees. These documents were redacted to omit the names and other identifying information of the Employees and uninvolved third persons. The City did not provide copies of the disciplinary corrective action forms for any of the Employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b67 The Gazette filed a Petition for Declaratory Relief and Writ of Mandamus. The Gazette asserted the documentation compiled by the City during and as a result of the investigation into unauthorized computer usage by disciplined City employees was subject to release under the \u201cright to know\u201d provision of Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution and \u00a7 2-6-102, MCA, and that any privacy interest the disciplined employees may have in the information being requested did not clearly exceed the public\u2019s right to know. The Gazette also requested its attorney fees incurred in enforcing its constitutional rights, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a72-3-221 and 27-8-313, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b68 The City filed a Motion for <em>in camera </em>inspection of the demanded documents to determine whether the demands of privacy outweighed the public\u2019s right to know under these circumstances. On December 5, 2012, following the inspection, the District Court entered its Order and Decision granting the Gazette\u2019s petition for declaratory judgment but denying its request for attorney fees. The District Court ordered the City to turn over the corrective action forms and all other requested documents, with redactions only for identifying information concerning uninvolved third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u00b69 The City simultaneously filed this appeal and a motion before the District Court to stay the order pending appeal to prevent the issues from being rendered moot. The District Court granted the motion to stay with regard to redactions for names and identifying information of the Employees, but found that the Gazette was entitled to redacted copies of the corrective action forms. The District Court attached redacted copies of the corrective action forms to its order granting a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">\u00b610 A district court\u2019s interpretation of law is reviewed to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Jefferson Co. v. Mont. Stand., </em>2003 MT 304, \u00b6 9, 318 Mont. 173, 79 P.3d 805. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re M.A.L., </em>2006 MT 299, \u00b6 17, 334 Mont. 436, 148 P.3d 606. We review a district court\u2019s award or denial of attorney fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>for an abuse of discretion. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>Disability Rights Mont. v. State, </em>2009 MT 100, \u00b6 13, 350 Mont. 101, 207 P.3d 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b611 <em>1. Did the District Court err by ordering that identifying information for five City employees disciplined for accessing pornography on their government computers be released to the Gazette ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AMvZ\">\u00b612 Montana\u2019s right to privacy is established in Article II, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\"><em>Right of privacy. </em>The right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b613 Often at issue with this provision is the public right to know, also established in the Montana Constitution. Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\"><em>Right to know. </em>No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, <em>except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">\u00b614 We have held that these competing interests must be balanced \u201cin the context of the facts of each case, to determine whether the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure. Under this standard, the right to know <em>may </em>outweigh the right of individual privacy, depending on the facts.\u201d <em>Missoulian v. Bd. of Regents of Higher Educ., </em>207 Mont. 513, 529, 675 P.2d 962, 971 (1984) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">\u00b615 An examination of a request under the public right to know provision of the Montana Constitution requires a three-step process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARj\">First, we consider whether the provision applies to the particular political subdivision against whom enforcement is sought. Second, we determine whether the documents in question are \u201cdocuments of public bodies\u201d subject to public inspection. Finally, if the first two requirements are satisfied, we decide whether a privacy interest is present, and if so, whether the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-10\"><em>Becky v. Butte-Silver Bow Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>274 Mont. 131, 136, 906 P.2d 193, 196 (1995). No single rule or policy can be used to determine what information may be released upon public request because each request requires a fact specific, case-by-case analysis of the interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>at issue and a balancing of the demands of individual privacy and the merits of public disclosure. <em>Havre Daily News v. Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6 17, 333 Mont. 331, 142 P.3d 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b616 The City does not dispute that it is subject to Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution. The City argues that the inquiry should end with the second prong of the test: whether the investigative records and corrective action forms at issue are \u201cdocuments of public bodies.\u201d Though not raised by the Gazette, mootness is a threshold issue the Court must resolve before the merits of the dispute can be decided. <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 31. \u201c\u2018A matter is moot when, due to an event or happening, the issue has ceased to exist and no longer presents an actual controversy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 31 (quoting <em>Shamrock Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>1999 MT 21, \u00b6 19, 293 Mont. 188, 974 P.2d 1150).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b617 We decline to address the issue of whether the documents requested by the Gazette are public documents because all of the requested documents have already been disclosed. The investigative records were voluntarily released to the Gazette with only Employee and third-party names and identifying information redacted. Additionally, the corrective actions forms with redactions only for Employee identifying information (name, job title, and department) have been turned over to the Gazette. Though the corrective action forms were disclosed by the District Court in its order granting a stay, rather than by the City, the forms have nevertheless been disseminated and any further discussion as to whether these forms are considered public documents has been rendered moot. Thus the only remaining issue is whether the Employees had a reasonable expectation of privacy in their identifying information in relation to the internal disciplinary proceedings that outweighs the public\u2019s right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">A. Constitutionally Protected Privacy Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\u00b618  To determine whether a person has a constitutionally protected privacy interest, we consider (1) whether the person has a subjective or actual expectation of privacy, and (2) whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable. <em>Mont. Human Rights Div. v. Billings, </em>199 Mont. 434, 442, 649 P.2d 1283, 1287 (1982). Actual expectation of privacy is necessarily a question of fact that requires a determination of whether the individual whose privacy is at issue had notice of possible disclosure. <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Disability Rights Mont., </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\u00b619 The District Court found \u201cthe Employees did expect the fact they were disciplined for having misused public computers and the specifics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>regarding that misuse would be and remain private.\u201d The Gazette counters that no actual expectation of privacy could exist here because the City\u2019s Internet use policy for employees provides that \u2018tu]sers using City-provided Internet accounts should not assume they are provided any degree of anonymity.\u201d Additionally, the policy states that Tu]se of the Internet may be monitored by the City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\">\u00b620  The precise question is whether the Employees had an actual expectation of privacy in their identities in relation to internal disciplinary proceedings, not as to their employer\u2019s knowledge of their Internet usage. Only the latter is addressed by the City\u2019s policy. If the question was whether they held an actual expectation that the City would not monitor their usage, clearly the answer would be no. However, the City\u2019s Internet usage policy alone is insufficient to render clearly erroneous the District Court\u2019s finding that the Employees had an actual expectation that \u201cthe fact they were disciplined for having misused public computers ... would be and remain private.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b621 Having concluded the Employees had an actual or subjective expectation of privacy, we next must determine whether society would be willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable. Whether society is willing to accept an expectation of privacy as reasonable is a determination of law that requires</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">reasoned consideration of the specific facts underlying the dispute. To provide but a few examples, the following inquiries may prove relevant in evaluating the reasonableness of an individual\u2019s expectation of privacy: (1) attributes of the individual ... and whether the individual holds a position of public trust; (2) the particular characteristics of the discrete piece of information; and (3) the relationship of that information to the public duties of the individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\"><em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 23 (citations omitted). The reasonableness of an expectation of privacy \u201cmay vary, even regarding the same information and the same recipient of that information.\u201d <em>Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>199 Mont. at 443, 649 P.2d at 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u00b622 In order to examine this fact specific question of law, it is important to undertake a review of our prior decisions relating to the reasonableness of public employees\u2019 expectations of privacy when balanced against the public\u2019s right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">\u00b623 In <em>Montana Human Rights Division, </em>the Human Rights Commission (HRC) requested personnel records of complainants and certain other employees in order to investigate allegations of discrimination based on sex, race, marital status, and/or union membership. 199 Mont. at 436, 649 P.2d at 1284-85. The City refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>to release non-complainant files, citing those individuals\u2019 right to privacy. <em>Mont. Human Rights </em>Div., 199 Mont. at 437, 649 P.2d at 1285. We noted that employment records reasonably contain references to family, health, or substance abuse problems, employer criticisms, test scores, prison or military records, and many other things an employee would reasonably expect to be confidential. <em>Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>199 Mont. at 442, 649 P.2d at 1287-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b624 We ultimately held that, though the information being requested was subject to the right to privacy, the right was nevertheless outweighed by other considerations, including the right to equal protection and the HRC\u2019s authority to investigate claims of discrimination. <em>Mont. Human Rights </em>Div., 199 Mont. at 442-44, 649 P.2d at 1287-89. We rejected the City s argument that redaction of the names could reduce the intrusion on the non-complainants\u2019 privacy because the names alone could be indicators of sex, race, or even marital status, information which may not be available in the rest of the file. <em>Mont. Human Rights </em>Div., 199 Mont. at 446, 649 P.2d at 1289. Though we found that the right to privacy was outweighed by the HRC\u2019s right to know, we required a protection order to restrict release of identifying information to the public. <em>Mont. Human Rights </em>Div., 199 Mont. at 449, 649 P.2d at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b625 Two years later, in <em>Missoulian, </em>we held that the individual privacy interests of six university presidents in confidential job performance evaluations clearly exceeded the merits of public disclosure. 207 Mont. at 533, 675 P.2d at 973. The Missoulian had sought access to a meeting of the Board of Regents (Board) and the Commissioner of Higher Education (Commissioner) where the presidents\u2019 job performance was discussed, as well as evaluation documents considered by the Board. <em>Missoulian, </em>207 Mont. at 517, 675 P.2d at 964-65. The request was denied by the Board due to privacy concerns. <em>Missoulian, </em>207 Mont. at 517, 675 P.2d at 964-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b626 We held that \u201ctime, place and status are factors in the reasonableness determination.... [T]he determination should include consideration of <em>all </em>relevant circumstances, including the nature of the information sought.\u201d <em>Missoulian, </em>207 Mont. at 523, 675 P.2d at 968 (emphasis in original). \u201c[M]ere status does not control the determination. University presidents do not waive their constitutional protections by taking office.\u201d <em>Missoulian, </em>207 Mont. at 526, 675 P.2d at 969. Confidentiality in personnel records and evaluations is especially important because such records include subjective opinions of the employee\u2019s performance that will vary with the person evaluating the employee, public disclosure could impede candid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>communication between employer and employee, and a supervisor could use the public nature of evaluations or ratings as a vindictive mechanism against employees she disliked. <em>Missoulian, </em>207 Mont. at 527, 675 P.2d at 970 (citing <em>Trenton Times Corp. v. Bd. of Educ., </em>351 A.2d 30, 33 (N.J. Super. App. Div., 1976)). We found it reasonable to expect that information that has a \u201c Tack of objective criteria, the potential for vindictiveness, the lack of an opportunity for the employee to rebut statements... and a substantial potential for abuse\u2019 \u201d will be kept confidential. <em>Missoulian, </em>207 Mont. at 527, 675 P.2d at 970 (quoting <em>Trenton Times, </em>351 A.2d at 33). We concluded the presidents\u2019 right to privacy clearly outweighed general assertions that public disclosure would \u201cfoster[ ] public confidence in public institutions, maintain[ ] the accountability of public officials, assur[e] public access to information to allow evaluation of public expenditures, and prevent[ ] the secret conduct of government and usurping of the people\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d without a showing of <em>how </em>any of these interests would be furthered or hindered by public disclosure. <em>Missoulian, </em>207 Mont. at 532, 675 P.2d at 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\">\u00b627 In <em>Great Falls Tribune v. Cascade County Sheriff, </em>238 Mont. 103, 107, 775 P.2d 1267, 1269 (1989), we held that the privacy interests in the identity of law enforcement officers disciplined for unlawful acts while on duty did not clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure. City police officers and county sheriffs deputies were involved in a chase to apprehend a suspect. <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>238 Mont. at 104, 775 P.2d at 1267. A deputy sheriff ran his car up onto a city sidewalk and struck the suspect, then on foot, but did not take him for medical treatment. <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>238 Mont. at 104, 775 P.2d at 1267. An investigation into the suspect\u2019s injuries resulted in one deputy being suspended, one police officer being fired, and two other police officers resigning when given the option to resign or be discharged. <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>238 Mont. at 104, 775 P.2d at 1267. The Great Falls Tribune sought the names of the disciplined officers. <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>238 Mont. at 104, 775 P.2d at 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b628 We affirmed the District Court\u2019s conclusion that society would not recognize a very strong expectation of privacy in the identity of law enforcement officers disciplined for serious misconduct while in the line of duty. <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>238 Mont. at 107, 775 P.2d at 1269. Law enforcement officers occupy positions of public trust because the \u201cpublic health, safety, and welfare are closely tied to an honest police force. The conduct of our law enforcement officers is a sensitive matter so that if they engage in conduct resulting in discipline for misconduct in the line of duty, the public should know.\u201d <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>238 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Mont. at 107, 775 P.2d at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b629 In <em>Flesh v. Board of Trustees of Joint School Dist. No. </em>2, 241 Mont. 158, 166, 786 P.2d 4, 9 (1990), we concluded that an assistant school administrator had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a meeting to discuss allegations of wrongdoing that outweighed the public\u2019s right to know. Robert Flesh (Flesh) filed a complaint to void any decision made during the closed portion of a meeting where the school board heard a grievance filed by Flesh alleging that the assistant school administrator had maliciously made false statements against him. <em>Flesh, </em>241 Mont. at 160, 786 P.2d at 6. Over Flesh\u2019s objections, the school board closed the presentation and deliberation portions of the meeting to the public. <em>Flesh, </em>241 Mont. at 161, 786 P.2d at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b630 We noted that the grievance specifically asked the school board to take disciplinary action against the administrator, a request that would necessitate a review of his personnel record. <em>Flesh, </em>241 Mont. at 166, 786 P.2d at 9. We held that \u201csociety is willing to recognize a privacy interest in a public employer\u2019s consideration of allegations involving an employee\u2019s character, integrity, honesty, and personality.\u201d <em>Flesh, </em>241 Mont. at 165, 786 P.2d at 9. Since there was no showing of any public interest to be served by opening the meeting to the public, the privacy interest of the employee clearly outweighed the public\u2019s right to know. <em>Flesh, </em>241 Mont. at 166, 786 P.2d at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b631 In <em>Citizens to Recall Mayor Whitlock v. Whitlock, </em>255 Mont. 517, 522-23, 844 P.2d 74, 77-78 (1992), we held that a mayor, as an elected official, has no reasonable expectation of privacy in regard to an investigation of allegations of \u201csexually harassing public employees or of other misconduct related to the performance of his official duties.\u201d Then-Mayor James Whitlock of Hamilton had been accused by City Judge Martha Bethel of sexual harassment and discrimination. A citizens group filed suit seeking release of the investigatory report. <em>Whitlock, </em>255 Mont. at 519-20, 844 P.2d at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u00b632 In affirming the District Court\u2019s order to release the report, we noted two important reasons that the mayor could not allege a reasonable expectation of privacy. <em>Whitlock, </em>255 Mont. at 522-23, 844 P.2d at 77-78. First, an elected official must be subjected to public scrutiny because it is the public that has the responsibility for \u2018hiring, disciplinary action, and supervision.\u201d <em>Whitlock, </em>255 Mont. at 522, 844 P.2d at 77. Second, we noted that the nature of the information being sought was the result of an investigation into misconduct related to the performance of his official duties, rather than general performance evaluations or discussion of Whitlock\u2019s character, integrity, honesty, or personality. <em>Whitlock, </em>255 Mont. at 523, 844 P.2d at 78. We held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>that sexual harassment allegations went directly to Whitlock\u2019s ability to properly carry out his public duties, and the report was therefore properly disclosed. <em>Whitlock, </em>255 Mont. at 522, 844 P.2d at 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\">\u00b633 In <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle v. Bozeman Police Department, </em>260 Mont. 218, 220, 859 P.2d 435, 436 (1993), a cadet at the Law Enforcement Academy in Bozeman made an allegation of sexual intercourse without consent against an off-duty Bozeman city police officer. Following investigation, no criminal charges were filed, but the special prosecutor opined that \u201c[the police officer] should not be allowed to continue working as a law enforcement officer because of inappropriate use of his position in relation to his contacts with women.\u201d <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>260 Mont. at 220, 859 P.2d at 436-37. The officer resigned the next day. <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>260 Mont. at 220, 859 P.2d at 437. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle (Chronicle) sought the name of the officer and the investigative documents. <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>260 Mont. at 221, 859 P.2d at 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b634 We upheld the District Court\u2019s order to release the name, and reversed its order shielding the investigative documents. <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>260 Mont. at 221, 229, 859 P.2d at 437, 442. Though the officer had been off duty at the time of the alleged misconduct, and had resigned by the time of the Chronicle\u2019s request, we noted that \u2018the nature of the alleged misconduct ran directly counter to the police officer\u2019s sworn duty to uphold the law, to prevent crime, and to protect the public.... [S]uch alleged misconduct went directly to the police officer\u2019s breach of his position of public trust [and] therefore, this conduct is a proper matter for public scrutiny.\u201d <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>260 Mont. at 227, 859 P.2d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b635 In <em>Jefferson County, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-5, the Montana Standard sought information regarding the arrest for DUI of Beaverhead County Commissioner Donna Sevalstad (Sevalstad). Sevalstad pled guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol and driving with an expired license. <em>Jefferson Co., </em>\u00b6 4. We cited our decision in <em>Whitlock </em>in affirming the District Court\u2019s order to release the requested information. <em>Jefferson Co., </em>\u00b6 16.

Antoinette Svaldi (Svaldi), a teacher in the Anaconda public school system for approximately 25 years, was alleged by several parents to have assaulted or verbally abused their children. <em>Svaldi, </em>\u00b6 5. Svaldi filed an action against the County alleging that her right to privacy was violated when the County Attorney informed a reporter from a local paper that his office was discussing a deferred prosecution agreement with Svaldi\u2019s attorney in exchange for Svaldi\u2019s promise to resign from teaching. <em>Svaldi, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11. We affirmed the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the County, even though no criminal charges were ultimately filed and no deferred prosecution agreement was ever entered, because she was in a position of public trust and the allegations of assault against her students \u201cwent directly to her ability to properly carry out her duties.\u201d <em>Svaldi, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b637 In <em>Yellowstone County v. Billings Gazette, </em>2006 MT 218, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 333 Mont. 390, 143 P.3d 135, we held that an interim chief public defender did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his deposition testimony for an employment discrimination lawsuit that outweighed the public right to know. Following the resignation of the Yellowstone County Chief Public Defender, Curtis Bevolden (Bevolden) was hired as the interim chief. <em>Yellowstone Co., </em>\u00b6 4. Bevolden fired the Deputy Chief Defender, Roberta Drew (Drew), who had also applied for the interim chief position, but an internal grievance proceeding resulted in Drew\u2019s reinstatement. <em>Yellowstone Co., </em>\u00b6 4. Drew filed a federal discrimination suit against the County, Bevolden, and other officials. <em>Yellowstone Co., </em>\u00b6 4. The Gazette requested Bevolden\u2019s unredacted deposition transcript from the suit. <em>Yellowstone Co., </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b638 In holding that the public right to know was not clearly outweighed by any privacy interest Bevolden may have in the redacted information, we noted that public defenders have the duty to safeguard the constitutional rights to counsel and a fair and speedy trial, and are essential to preserving public trust in our judicial system. <em>Yellowstone Co., </em>\u00b6 22. We also held that the redacted information of the transcript \u201cbears directly on Bevolden\u2019s professional judgment, the management decisions he made as Interim Chief Public Defender, and his official conduct.\u201d <em>Yellowstone Co., </em>\u00b6 23. Because the information being sought related directly to the official duties of a person in a position of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>trust, Bevolden could not assert a right to privacy that outweighed the public\u2019s right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\">\u00b639 In 2011, we decided <em>Billings Gazette v. Billings, </em>2011 MT 293, 362 Mont. 522, 267 P.3d 11. Deanna Anthony (Anthony), a Police Department Senior Administrative Coordinator authorized to use a police department credit card, was investigated for allegations that she had made thousands of dollars of personal purchases using the card. <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3, 25. Following the investigation, Anthony was issued a 16-page \u201cdue process letter\u201d notifying her of a due process hearing to respond to the allegations against her, and detailing the evidence gathered during the investigation. <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 4. The City denied the Gazette\u2019s request for the letter. <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"AH6\">\u00b640 We held that even though she was an administrative employee, Anthony held a position of public trust because she was in a job that \u201callowed her to spend large amounts of public monies.\u201d <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 22. Because the information being sought related directly to an investigation for allegations of misappropriating public funds, \u201cthe very aspect of her job that render[ed] it a \u2018position of public trust,\u2019 \u2019\u2019the due process letter was properly subject to public disclosure. <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 22. However, we also pointed out that not \u201cevery public employee with purchasing power can have no expectation of privacy in her personnel matters.\u201d <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 27. Based on the facts of the case (\u201cthe alleged embezzlement of large sums of [public] money over a protracted period of time\u201d), we held that information relating to a public employee\u2019s violation of the public trust implicit in her duties should be released to the public. <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b641 Having reviewed our prior cases, we turn to the case at bar. The information at issue in this case is limited to the identity of the Employees, including identifying information such as job title and department, as all other aspects of the misconduct, including the nature of the misconduct, the websites visited, the investigation process, and the discipline issued, has been disclosed to the Gazette. Initially, we note that the specific allegations of misconduct, accessing adult or pornographic websites, are not a focus of this analysis. We have held that a public employee is not entitled to heightened privacy protections simply because the information at issue was sexual in nature. <em>Harris v. Smartt, </em>2002 MT 239, \u00b6 66, 311 Mont. 507, 57 P.3d 58 (Justice of the Peace not entitled to heightened privacy rights in pornography downloaded to his county-owned computer). However, neither is a public employee given less of a privacy right due to the sexual nature of the information. The fact that the images viewed on the Employees\u2019 computers \u2018had sexual content does not influence the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>privacy analysis.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b642 The City averred that the Employees were not elected officials, department heads, or high management. After <em>in-camera </em>review of the unredacted Corrective Action Forms, the District Court did not make any finding that any of the Employees hold any particular position of trust with regard to public spending or public safety. Our review of the unredacted forms does not convince us otherwise. Additionally, the Internet usage of the Employees was not related to their public duties. The Gazette has not argued to this Court that disclosure of the Employees\u2019 positions or titles, separate and distinct from the Employees\u2019 names, was necessary in order to analyze their respective expectations of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b643 Rather, the Gazette argues that there can be no reasonable expectation of privacy in the identity of any public employee if the employee was disciplined for misconduct. The Gazette argues that this holding follows from our decision in <em>Great Falls Tribune </em>where we stated: fit is not good public policy to recognize an expectation of privacy in protecting the identity of a law enforcement officer whose conduct is sufficiently reprehensible to merit discipline.\u201d <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>238 Mont. at 107, 775 P.2d at 1269. We reiterated this in <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>260 Mont. at 225, 859 P.2d at 439. However, there are key distinctions between those cases and this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b644 First, in both prior cases the discipline was severe. <em>See Great Falls Tribune, </em>238 Mont. at 104, 775 P.2d at 1267 (one officer was fired and two others were given the option to resign or be terminated); <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>260 Mont. at 220, 859 P.2d at 436-37 (officer resigned after it was recommended that he not be allowed to continue in law enforcement). Here the employees were given a five-day suspension without pay, a far cry from being discharged or forced to resign. If we were to give the statement from <em>Great Falls Tribune </em>the meaning urged by the Gazette, any disciplinary action, no matter how trivial, would trump an employee\u2019s right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b645 Other important distinctions in the case here are the positions held by the disciplined Employees and the relation of their positions to the alleged misconduct. In <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>the employees whose identities were being sought were law enforcement officers who had engaged in misconduct in the line of their official duties. We held that law enforcement officers hold a particular position of public trust due to their sworn duty to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>238 Mont. at 107, 775 P.2d at 1269. Allegations of misconduct in apprehending a suspect and failing to seek medical attention for his injuries clearly violate this duty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>we noted that allegations of criminal conduct, even while off duty, ran directly counter to the officer\u2019s duty to uphold the law and prevent crime. <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>260 Mont. at 227, 859 P.2d at 440. Also, the officer\u2019s position was implicated by the victim\u2019s status as a police cadet. No similar connection can be made with regard to the Employees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AF7\">\u00b646 The Dissent argues that the Employees\u2019 actions could be considered illegal conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as Montana\u2019s Unlawful Computer Use, Theft, and Official Misconduct statutes. Dissent, \u00b6 68. However, no criminal charges have been filed or are contemplated in this case. Notably, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an employee\u2019s misuse of an employer\u2019s computer is not a crime under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. <em>U.S. v. Nosal, </em>676 F.3d 854, 860 (9th Cir. 2012) (refusing to read the CFAA as policing employer personnel policies through criminal law). In any event, the misconduct in this case does not rise to the level of illegal conduct that was present in <em>Great Falls Tribune, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, or Billings Gazette.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\">\u00b647 Additionally, we have previously held that matters relating to employee misconduct can be protected from the public right to know. In <em>Montana Human Rights Division, </em>we held that public employees possess a privacy right in their personnel files. 199 Mont. at 443, 649 P.2d at 1288. The Court noted that personnel files can include sensitive information such as drug and alcohol problems, prison records, poor work performance, and tardiness-all forms of wrongful conduct. <em>Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>199 Mont at 442, 649 P.2d at 1288. \u201cA discussion regarding an employee\u2019s alleged wrongful conduct constituted precisely the type of communication that frequently occurred between the employer and employee.\u201d <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 48 (Morris, Rice, Baker, JJ., dissenting) (citing <em>Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>199 Mont at 442, 649 P.2d at 1288). The Court in <em>Montana Human Rights Division </em>recognized the fact that there is frequently pressure upon an employee to \u201ccommunicate these matters to his employer in the privacy of his boss\u2019s office <em>....\u2019\u2019Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>199 Mont at 442, 649 P.2d at 1288. Even without any assurance of confidentiality, the Court nevertheless concluded that \u201cemployees would reasonably expect such communication normally would be kept confidential.\u201d <em>Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>199 Mont at 442, 649 P.2d at 1288. Thus, an allegation of misconduct by a public employee does not summarily end the privacy analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b648 The Gazette also argues, and the District Court agreed, that the City\u2019s Acceptable Use Policy demonstrates that the public placed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>trust in the Employees with respect to Internet usage. It further argues that misuse of the Internet, a City resource, while at work is a violation of that public trust that relates directly to their fitness to perform a public duty. However, evident from the above discussion of our cases, not all public employees hold the same level of privacy in all disciplinary matters simply on the basis of having a public employer. We are not prepared to say that providing public employees with access to a computer on which to do their work itself \u201cevinces a public trust\u201d that can be breached by a violation of an Internet use policy. Nor are we prepared to hold that any violation of office policy by any government employee results in a violation of public trust simply because tax dollars pay that employee\u2019s salary. To do so would be tantamount to a holding that all citizens lose their constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy on the day they enter public employment. If university presidents do not automatically lose their constitutional protections by taking office, Missoulian, 207 Mont. at 526, 675 P.2d at 969, the same would certainly be true for the thousands of other public employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b649  Our past cases have held, and we reaffirm today, that the \u201c \u2018right of privacy turns on the reasonableness of the expectation, which may vary, even regarding the same information and the same recipient of that information\u2019... [T]ime, place and status are factors in the reasonableness <em>determination.\u201dMissoulian, </em>207 Mont. at 523, 675 P.2d at 968 (quoting <em>Montana Human Rights </em>Div., 199 Mont. at 443, 649 P.2d at 1288). Where the status of the employee necessitates a high level of public trust, such as an elected official or high level employee, the expectation of privacy in misconduct may be found to be significantly lower than for an administrative employee. Similarly, an employee may have a lower expectation of privacy in misconduct related to a duty of public trust, such as responsibility for spending public money or educating children.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b650  Here, the Employees are not elected officials, high-level management, or department heads, nor is there evidence that any specific duty alleged to have been violated related to the performance of a public trust function. The information being sought is merely their identities in relation to internal disciplinary action for a violation of office policy. We hold that society would be willing to accept as reasonable a public employee\u2019s expectation of privacy in his or her identity with respect to internal disciplinary matters when that employee is not in a position of public trust, and the misconduct resulting in the discipline was not a violation of a duty requiring a high level of public trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u00b651 The Dissent employs a Fourth Amendment analysis and concludes that the Employees had no reasonable expectation of privacy in their computer misuse. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 74,75. The Fourth Amendment protects persons from unreasonable searches and seizures in the criminal context. The misconduct in this case involved no criminal conduct. Further, the civil cases cited by the Dissent, including the extensive quote <em>from Muick v. Glenarye Electronics, </em>280 F.3d 741 (7th Cir. 2002), involve employee privacy claims raised against employers who sought information. Rejection of such claims by the courts in these cases was appropriately premised upon the employees\u2019 lack of an expectation of privacy as to their employers. Unlike these cases, there is here no privacy claim by the Employees against the City. The City obtained the information from the Employees\u2019 computers pursuant to the computer use policy, and proceeded to discipline the Employees. The question is whether the Gazette-a third party4s entitled to the identifying information about the Employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\">\u00b652 Montanans are provided a \u2018heightened expectation of privacy\u201d under the Montana Constitution in comparison to the U.S. Constitution, <em>State v. 1993 Chevrolet Pickup, </em>2005 MT 180, \u00b6 9, 328 Mont. 10, 116 P.3d 800, and Article II, Sections 9 and 10 of the Montana Constitution explicitly require that a balancing of the right to know and the right to privacy be conducted in this case. This Court\u2019s precedent provides the appropriate analysis of the particular state constitutional provisions that govern here, without regard to Fourth Amendment jurisprudence or federal approaches to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b653 Having found that the Employees had an actual or subjective expectation of privacy that society is willing to find reasonable, we must balance the Employees\u2019 right to privacy against the merits of public disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">B. Balancing Privacy with the Public Right to Know</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b654 The City argues that the risks mentioned in <em>Missoulian </em>with respect to performance evaluations are present in this case and necessitate a need for confidentiality in internal disciplinary matters. Specifically, it asserts that it has an interest in the confidentiality of disciplinary measures in order to effectively address and react to misconduct without fear that employer criticisms and disciplinary actions will be publicly disseminated. It argues that honest and critical communications between employers and employees will suffer, and there could be a risk of vindictive use of the discipline process, which lacks an opportunity for the employee to rebut the alleged misconduct, if disciplinary actions are subjected to public scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b655 The only argument offered by the Gazette in favor of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>disclosure is that To]penness promotes fairness and thwarts cronyism.\u2019Tt argues that without knowing the name and status of each disciplined Employee, the public cannot determine why each Employee was given the same punishment, or why an employee of a different public agency was given a harsher punishment for similar conduct. The District Court agreed, holding that public disclosure of the corrective action forms and identifying information would \u2018foster[ ] a public confidence in public institutions and maintain[ ] the accountability of public officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b656  However, as we held in <em>Missoulian, </em>general assertions that public disclosure will foster public confidence in public institutions and maintain accountability for public officers are not sufficient to establish a strong public interest. <em>Missoulian, </em>207 Mont. at 532, 675 P.2d at 972. The Gazette has already received information regarding the misconduct of the Employees, the investigation by the City, and the discipline meted out to each Employee. If the public is dissatisfied with the discipline chosen by the City, it has all the information it needs to voice its opinions and objections to the City Council, the Mayor, or the newspaper. Public knowledge of the names of the individuals disciplined will not provide the public with any greater opportunity to participate in the internal employment decisions of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b657 Unlike public officials, over whom the public has responsibilities regarding \u2018hiring, disciplinary action, and supervision,\u201d <em>Whitlock, </em>255 Mont, at 522, 844 P.2d at 77, it is the responsibility of the City to hire, fire, and discipline its employees. Such decisions necessarily involve a subjective determination on the part of the supervisor. The nature of the work to be done, the alleged misconduct, and the person making the disciplinary decision will all affect the type of discipline meted out, even for the exact same violation. As we noted in <em>Flesh, </em>these disciplinary decisions necessitate a review of the employee\u2019s entire personnel file. <em>Flesh, </em>241 Mont. at 166, 786 P.2d at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b658 Finally, to hold that the general interests of \u2018fairness and prevention of cronyism,\u201d absent any allegations that such has occurred, is sufficient to outweigh an employee\u2019s privacy interest would open all public employment decisions to public scrutiny. Decisions of whom to hire, promote, discipline, or terminate are all decisions that require a subjective evaluation by supervisors based upon past performance, personality, character, test scores, etc. Our past cases preclude such an expansive holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b659  We conclude that the Employees\u2019 reasonable expectation of privacy in their identities with regards to internal disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>proceedings clearly outweighs the limited merits of public disclosure. \u2018This information may make interesting or sensational news copy, but we conclude that public disclosure is not in the public interest.\u201d <em>Missoulian, </em>207 Mont. at 532, 675 P.2d at 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\">\u00b660 <em>2. Did the District Court err by denying the Gazette\u2019s request for attorney fees and costs?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b661 Having concluded that the District Court\u2019s order to disclose the Employees\u2019 identities was entered in error, we decline to address the Gazette\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b457-6\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"ArF\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u00b662 In my view, a City employee has no reasonable expectation of privacy in viewing pornographic materials over the Internet using a City computer during work hours-particularly when there is a policy in place which specifically advises employees that use of the Internet is not anonymous and may be monitored. Moreover, placement of a final disciplinary report (the Corrective Action Form) into an employee\u2019s personnel file does not transform the employee\u2019s open and pervasive access to pornographic material over the Internet into a private activity. The Court, by misstating the question as \u201cwhether the Employees had an actual expectation of privacy in their identities in relation to <em>internal disciplinary proceedings, </em>not as to their employer\u2019s knowledge of the Internet usage,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20 (emphasis added), redefines the inquiry in order to recognize a privacy interest that other courts have uniformly held to be unreasonable. After finding that the Employees were \u2018hot in a position of public trust\u201d and that \u201cthe misconduct resulting in the discipline was not a violation of a duty requiring a high level of public trust,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 50, the Court concludes that the name, position, and department of a City employee accessing pornography may not be disclosed to the public. In my view, it is not necessary to decide whether the Employees are in positions of \u201cpublic trust,\u201d because the Employees do not have an expectation of privacy, which Montanans are willing to accept as reasonable, in the fact that they accessed, posted, and enjoyed pornographic material while working for a public employer with an Internet use policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\u00b663 All City employees are subject to the City\u2019s \u201cAcceptable Use\u201d policy, which applies to \u201call equipment, systems and tools used for electronic communication, local area networks, computer networks, the Internet and e-mail.\u201d Among other things, the policy prohibits use of City computers to access or store \u201coffensive graphical images.\u201d It also prohibits \u2018iujsing any means to defeat security systems on any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>computer network\u201d and the \u201cpropagation of computer worms and viruses.\u201d Employees are advised that \u2018tu]se of the Internet may be monitored by the City.\u201d Moreover, the policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">The City\u2019s Internet hosts are traceable to the City. <em>Users using City-provided Internet accounts should not assume they are provided any degree of anonymity. Outside users who want to identify machines associated with the City can do so easily. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b664 In the spring of 2012, the City conducted internal investigations into the Internet activity of five City employees on City-provided computers and ultimately issued written Corrective Action Forms suspending each employee for five days without pay. The nature of the violations were set forth in the Corrective Action Forms as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">1. Daily logs of each of the five employees showed a pattern of Ts]eeking out pictures of women on the internet that were sexual in nature.\u201d These images included \u201cnude adults,\u201d \u201cpictures that were pornographic in nature,\u201d and \u201cscantily clad adults that were inappropriate for the workplace.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">2. Daily logs also showed a pattern of\u2018te]xcessive amounts of time being spent on non-work related searches while ... being compensated to perform ... assigned duties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">3. One of the employees had conducted \u201c[s]earches on blog, foreign country and image hosting sites. Specifically, links were found to a Polish site with adult content that contained file sharing functionality, subsequently increasing the potential of a virus threat to the City s computer network.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">4. Another employee had saved four images of \u201cscantily clothed and nude adults and pictures that were pornographic in nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">5. Yet another employee had sought out \u201cpictures of women associated with escort services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">As noted, the City disciplined the Employees by imposing five days of suspension on each. Although the suspensions were without pay, the City did not dock any pay of the employees for the \u201cexcessive\u201d amount of work time they had spent viewing pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">\u00b665 As the Court observes, the documents requested by the Gazette have already been disclosed. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 17. However, certain information has been redacted from those documents-information that the Gazette contends the public has a constitutional right to know. Specifically, the information redacted in the Corrective Action Forms includes the employee\u2019s name, the employee\u2019s position, the employee\u2019s department, and the name of the employee\u2019s supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">\u00b666 Despite this Court\u2019s knowledge-acquired through our in-camera <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>review of the unredacted Corrective Action Forms4hat some of the disciplined employees held upper-level positions and/or were involved in law enforcement, we refuse to apply that knowledge and analysis in resolving this case. We avoid the analysis by stating: \u2018The City <em>averred </em>that the Employees were not elected officials, department heads, or high management.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 42 (emphasis added). But the Court <em>knows </em>what positions the Employees held because we, like the District Court, reviewed the documents, which are part of the record on appeal. We nevertheless ignore the Employees\u2019 positions in spite of our precedent and the Gazette\u2019s argument that the public has a constitutional right to assess whether the City meted out discipline fairly. We avoid an analysis that incorporates consideration of the Employees\u2019 specific positions by determining that the Gazette did not advance this argument (How could it, given that the Gazette was not privy to that information?) and that \u201cthe District Court did not make any finding that any of the Employees hold any particular position of trust with regard to public spending or public safety.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 42. In failing to recognize the significance of the redacted information to the Gazette\u2019s investigation, we have subjectively limited the Gazette\u2019s inquiry and decided the direction the Gazette\u2019s investigation and reporting should take. Montana\u2019s constitutional provision embracing the citizenry\u2019s right to know is premised on the right to have information disseminated and available so that <em>the </em>public-not this Court-may draw its own inferences and conclusions from the information and thereby make informed decisions regarding their governmental bodies. The unfiltered dissemination of information is fundamental to the exercise of Montana\u2019s constitutional right to know and is limited only where an individual has a reasonable privacy interest that \u201cclearly exceeds\u201d the merits of public disclosure. Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a79.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">\u00b667 Although the Court states that \u201c[t]he only argument offered by the Gazette in favor of public disclosure is that \u2018[ojpenness promotes fairness and thwarts cronyism,\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 55 (second brackets in original), the Gazette has actually advanced several arguments in support of its request for disclosure-arguments which the Court fails to acknowledge. First, the Gazette has argued that in violating the City\u2019s Acceptable Use policy, the Employees acted to defeat the security system on the City\u2019s computer network and potentially compromised the City\u2019s workplace by breaching security devices and introducing viruses from international pornography websites. While the Court states that \u201cthe specific allegations of misconduct, accessing adult or pornographic websites, are not a focus of this analysis,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Opinion, \u00b6 41, the Gazette argues that the pornographic nature of the material and the potential for security breaches are relevant in determining what society recognizes as a reasonable expectation of privacy. We are required to examine the privacy interest \u201c \u2018in the context of the facts of each case.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Associated Press, Inc. v. Mont. Dept. of Revenue, </em>2000 MT 160, \u00b6 24, 300 Mont. 233, 4 P.3d 5 (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Missoulian v. Bd. of Regents of Higher Educ., </em>207 Mont. 513, 529, 675 P.2d 962, 971 (1984)). Accordingly, we cannot avoid examining the content of the material at issue and the security threats posed by the individuals\u2019 actions when assessing whether society would recognize the privacy interest as reasonable. I thus do not agree that Tt]he fact that the images viewed on the Employees\u2019 computers \u2018had sexual content does not influence the primary analysis.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 41. I seriously question whether society is willing to protect the privacy of a public employee who breaches security devices, thus exposing the City\u2019s computer network to damage from viruses and other malware, in order to view pornography on a public computer during work hours. The pornographic nature of the material is important, in the context of all other factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b668 Second, the Gazette maintains that the public has an interest in knowing whether public employees are violating the law. The Gazette argues that although no charges have been filed, the Employee\u2019s conduct can be characterized as illegal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030. The Gazette points to several court decisions which have held that violating the terms of an \u201cacceptable use\u201dpolicy may constitute a federal offense. <em>See e.g. U.S. v. John, </em>597 F.3d 263, 271-73 (5th Cir. 2010); <em>U.S. v. Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2010); <em>cf. U.S. v. Teague, </em>646 F.3d 1119, 1122 (8th Cir. 2011). Significantly, Montana has its own criminal offenses relating to the unlawful use of a computer. Section 45-6-311(l)(a), MCA, prohibits a person from knowingly or purposely \u201cobtaining] the use of any computer, computer system, or computer network without consent of the owner.\u201dThe City\u2019s Acceptable Use policy clearly establishes that employees are not authorized to use City computers to access pornographic materials over the Internet. Arguably, Montana\u2019s theft statute is likewise implicated by the Employees\u2019 conduct. Pursuant to \u00a745-6-30l(2)(a), MCA, a person commits the offense of theft when the person purposely or knowingly obtains, by deception, control over another\u2019s property (money paid in the form of wages) with the purpose of depriving the owner (the City) of that property. Montana additionally has an \u201cofficial misconduct\u201d statute that makes it unlawful for a \u201cpublic servant\u201d to \u201cknowingly perform[ ] an act in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>official capacity that the public servant knows is forbidden by law.\u201d Section 45-7-401(l)(b), MCA. \u2018Public servant\u201d means \u201can officer or <em>employee of government.\u201d </em>Section 45-2-101(64)(a), MCA (emphasis added). This Court\u2019s precedent establishes that the public has the right to know about unlawful activity of public employees. <em>Great Falls Tribune Co. v. Cascade Co. Sheriff, </em>238 Mont. 103, 107, 775 P.2d 1267, 1269 (1989); <em>Bozeman Daily Chron. v. City of Bozeman Police Dept., </em>260 Mont. 218, 227, 859 P.2d 435, 440-41 (1993). Furthermore, our constitutional right to know protects the right to receive information about decisions of government officials to prosecute or commence a criminal investigation. The fact that \u2018ho criminal charges have been filed or are contemplated,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 46, puts the cart before the horse-fehis is precisely the information the public has the right to know in order to evaluate the conduct of public officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\">\u00b669 Third, the Gazette also maintains that the public has the right to scrutinize whether the discipline the City imposed on the Employees was fair. While the Court seemingly finds it significant that the punishment meted out in other cases was \u201csevere\u201d while the punishment meted out in the present case was less so, Opinion, \u00b6 44, I believe such an assessment of government discipline is best left for citizens to determine after being presented with adequate information. The Gazette specifically argued before the District Court that during the same timeframe when the Employees here were given five-day suspensions, five employees with the City landfill also received five-day suspensions for taking trash outside the City during off-work hours. The Gazette maintained that the public has a right to scrutinize the discipline imposed and to question whether there is \u201csome distinction between high-level employees\u201d who got the same punishment \u201cas the people in the landfill.\u201d Likewise, on appeal, the Gazette again questions whether \u201cthe status of the employees\u201d accounts for the punishments that the City imposed-information which the Gazette maintains the public has a constitutional right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b670 Lastly, the Gazette argues that a substantial amount of taxpayer money was wasted on time the Employees spent accessing pornographic materials and that the investigation likewise has cost taxpayers money and public resources. The Gazette maintains that the public has an interest in how their government spends public funds, just as the public had a right to know the identity of the police department employee who misappropriated public funds in <em>Billings Gazette v. City of Billings, </em>2011 MT 293, \u00b6\u00b6 22-27, 362 Mont. 522, 267 P.3d 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u00b671 In light of the foregoing, the Gazette\u2019s arguments for public disclosure cannot be dismissed as merely seeking to promote fairness and thwart cronyism. Opinion, \u00b6 51. Rather, in my opinion, the Gazette has set forth these particular arguments as components of a more general argument that disclosure fosters public confidence in public institutions and maintains accountability of public officers.</p>\n<p id=\"A1IN\">\u00b672 Determining whether public documents must be disclosed requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to know with any competing privacy interests.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7\u00a79, 10. Again, the balancing must be done in the context of the facts of each case. <em>Yellowstone Co. v. Billings Gazette, </em>2006 MT 218, \u00b6 20, 333 Mont. 390, 143 P.3d 135. A person has a constitutionally protected privacy interest when (1) the person has an actual or subjective expectation of privacy and (2) society is willing to recognize that privacy expectation as reasonable. <em>Yellowstone Co., </em>\u00b6 20 <em>(citing Lincoln Co. Commn. v. Nixon, </em>1998 MT 298, \u00b6 16, 292 Mont. 42, 968 P.2d 1141).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b673 In this case, the District Court observed that neither party had disputed the first prong of the test-actual or subjective expectation of privacy-and the District Court thus found that \u201cthe Employees did expect the fact they were disciplined for having misused public computers and the specifics regarding that misuse would be and remain private.\u201dThe District Court further determined, however, that the Employees\u2019 subjective expectations of privacy were unreasonable in light of their knowledge that the City had the right to monitor their Internet usage and that they had no anonymity with respect to the sites they visited. In my judgment, the District Court\u2019s conclusion was not only correct, but also consistent with that of numerous courts which have considered a public employee\u2019s expectation of privacy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>decided that an Internet use policy negates any such expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\">\u00b674 In <em>U.S. v. Angevine, </em>281 F.3d 1130 (10th Cir. 2002), a university professor did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his computer given that the university had a computer policy explaining appropriate computer use and stating that usage could be monitored. The defendant could not have a reasonable expectation of privacy because reasonable university computer users should have been aware that network administrators and others were free to view data downloaded from the Internet. <em>Angevine, </em>281 F.3d at 1134. In <em>U.S. v. Simons, </em>206 F.3d 392 (4th Cir. 2000), government employees did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in, the information stored on their computers where a policy stated that the employer could audit, inspect, and/or monitor employees\u2019 use of the Internet. \u2018This policy placed employees on notice that they could not reasonably expect that their Internet activity would be private.\u201d <em>Simons, </em>206 F.3d at 398. In <em>Muick v. Glenayre Elecs., </em>280 F.3d 741 (7th Cir. 2002), an employee did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a laptop provided by his employer where the employer had notified the employee that it could inspect the laptop. The rationale set forth in the court\u2019s opinion is useful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">Muick had no right of privacy in the computer that Glenayre had lent him for use in the workplace. Not that there can\u2019t be a right of privacy ... in employer-owned equipment furnished to an employee for use in his place of employment. If the employer equips the employee\u2019s office with a safe or file cabinet or other receptacle in which to keep his private papers, he can assume that the contents of the safe are private. But Glenayre had announced that it could inspect the laptops that it furnished for the use of its employees, and this destroyed any reasonable expectation of privacy that Muick might have had .... The laptops were Glenayre\u2019s property and it could attach whatever conditions to their use it wanted to. They didn\u2019t have to be reasonable conditions; but the abuse of access to workplace computers is so common (workers being prone to use them as media of gossip, titillation, and other entertainment and distraction) that reserving a right of inspection is so far from being unreasonable that the failure to do so might well be thought irresponsible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKk\"><em>Muick, </em>280 F.3d at 743 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b675 Additional authority finding that a public employer\u2019s computer policy precludes a reasonable expectation of privacy includes <em>Wasson v. Sonoma Co. Junior College Dist., 4 </em>F. Supp. 2d 893, 905-06 (N.D. Cal. 1997) (policy giving employer right to access all information stored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>on employees\u2019 computers extinguished any reasonable expectation of privacy in files stored on the computers); <em>Bohach v. City of Reno, </em>932 F. Supp. 1232, 1234-35 (D. Nev. 1996) (police officers did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their use of a pager system because the police chief had issued an order notifying all users that their messages would be logged); <em>U.S. v. Hamilton, </em>778 F. Supp. 2d 651, 653-54 (E.D. Va. 2011) (public school employee lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in emails that were stored on his work computer because the computer use policy stated that the contents of the computer were subject to inspection); <em>cf. Am. Postal Workers Union v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>871 F.2d 556, 560 (6th Cir. 1989) (postal employees had no reasonable expectation of privacy in their lockers because postal regulations and collective bargaining agreements both stated that the lockers were subject to examination and inspection at any time).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u00b676 Although the above-cited authority is largely in the context of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the reasonableness of an expectation of privacy-fehat is, what society will recognize as legitimate-does not vary depending upon whether the argument is made under the Fourth Amendment or under Montana\u2019s constitutional provision regarding an individual\u2019s right of privacy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our precedent recognizes the validity of federal caselaw in the context of a right-to-know analysis, regarding whether a privacy interest is one that society is willing to recognize as reasonable. In <em>Mont. Human Rights Div. v. City of Billings, </em>199 Mont. 434, 442-43, 649 P.2d 1283, 1287-88 (1982), we applied the standard set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Katz v. U.S., </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S. Ct. 507 (1967), to evaluate what constituted a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the right to know. <em>Katz </em>was the landmark case that defined a constitutionally protected expectation of privacy, under the Fourth Amendment, as consisting of a subjective component and a reasonableness component. This Court has applied that test in search-and-seizure cases, <em>see e.g. State v. Hill, </em>2004 MT 184, \u00b6 24, 322 Mont. 165, 94 P.3d 752; <em>State v. Allen, </em>2010 MT 214, \u00b6 47, 357 Mont. 495, 241 P.3d 1045, in right-to-know cases, <em>see e.g. Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>199 Mont. at 442-43, 649 P.2d at 1287-88; <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>238 Mont. at 105, 775 P.2d at 1268; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number><em>Billings Gazette, </em>2011 MT 293, \u00b6 12, and in pure privacy cases, <em>see e.g. Hastetter v. Behan, </em>196 Mont. 280, 282-83, 639 P.2d 510, 512-13 (1982); <em>State v. Nelson, </em>283 Mont. 231, 239-42, 941 P.2d 441, 446-48 (1997); <em>Gryczan, </em>283 Mont. at 449-50, 942 P.2d at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\">\u00b677 I cannot accept that Montana citizens would recognize as reasonable, under <em>Katz, Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>or any other precedent, this Court\u2019s willingness to shield the identities, positions, departments, and supervisors of public employees who access pornographic material on their work computers during work hours after having been warned that their computer usage would be monitored and that they cannot expect anonymity. I also am not willing to carve out an exception to the well-established test for determining a constitutionally protected expectation of privacy because we want to protect particular employees from embarrassment. The reasonableness of an expectation of privacy depends on what <em>society </em>deems is legitimate, and such a test cannot logically depend on whether a claim is asserted pursuant to search-and-seizure jurisprudence or precedent interpreting the right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b678 Contrary to the Court\u2019s reasoning, <em>see </em>Opinion, \u00b6 47, the City\u2019s placement of the final disciplinary report in each Employee\u2019s personnel file does not give the document protections that it otherwise would not have. The Employee\u2019s privacy expectation has been extinguished by the Acceptable Use policy and is not resurrected by placing the Corrective Action Form into a personnel file. Actions of the Employees in choosing to access websites at work on a City computer with an Internet use policy in effect, for which there was no reasonable expectation of privacy, cannot subsequently be made private through actions of the City in placing the disciplinary report into the protective confines of the Employees\u2019 personnel files. To allow a public employer to potentially subvert the right to know by concealing the contents of the objectionable material in a personnel file would undermine the public\u2019s ability to evaluate the functioning of government and whether it is meting out discipline fairly and evenhandedly.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b679 The rationale for protecting from disclosure the contents of a personnel file does not exist in this case. Arguably, the Corrective Action Form is more akin to the \u201cdue process letter\u201d in <em>Billings Gazette, </em>2011 MT 293, which we noted was different from the job performance evaluations of university presidents in <em>Missoulian, </em>207 Mont. 513, 675 P.2d 962, and the employment applications in <em>Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>199 Mont. 434, 649 P.2d 1283. As we stated in <em>Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>199 Mont. at 442, 649 P.2d at 1287-88:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">Employment records would reasonably contain, among less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>sensitive information, references to family problems, health problems, past and present employers\u2019 criticism and observations, military records, scores from IQ tests and performance tests, prison records, drug or alcohol problems, and other matters, many of which most individuals would not willingly disclose publicly. Some testing and disclosure (e.g., past employment records, prison records, drug or alcohol use) is a necessary part of many applications for employment; other information may be compiled by present employers or may be submitted by an employee in explanation of absence from work or poor performance on the job. It is clear that there is frequently pressure upon an employee to communicate these matters to his employer in the privacy of his boss\u2019s office or on an application for employment or promotion. And while, as far as we know, respondents gave their employees no specific assurances of confidentiality, we believe that employees would reasonably expect such communication normally would be kept confidential.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b680 Significant to our decision in <em>Missoulian </em>was a written policy that provided for confidentiality of self-evaluations. We noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">the Board\u2019s written evaluation policy stated that the self-evaluations would be confidential and the evaluation meetings would be conducted in \u201cexecutive session.\u201d The anonymous interviewees who commented on the presidents\u2019 performance were promised confidentiality. It is undisputed that the six university presidents actually expected that the job performance evaluations would be private. [They] submitted their self-evaluations expecting confidentiality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\"><em>Missoulian, </em>207 Mont. at 523, 675 P.2d at 968. We held that these expectations of privacy were reasonable. <em>Missoulian, </em>207 Mont. at 527, 675 P.2d at 970.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u00b681 In contrast, the Acceptable Use policy here specifically advises that there is no confidentiality in the materials and the activities conducted on an employee\u2019s computer. Furthermore, nothing in the Corrective Action Form contains sensitive information akin to an employment record, such as family references, health problems, prison records, or drug and alcohol issues. The Corrective Action Form is the final report of the discipline a public employer has imposed on its employee. The Gazette is not requesting the Employees\u2019 entire personnel files, employment records, or performance evaluations; it is requesting the final reporUthe end product-ef the City\u2019s investigation into misconduct of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u00b682 \u2018Government offices are provided to employees for the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>purpose of facilitating the work of an agency. The employee may avoid exposing personal belongings at work by simply leaving them at home.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor v. Ortega, </em>480 U.S. 709, 725, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 1501-02 (1987) (plurality). Likewise, a public employee who is paid by taxpayers does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in viewing pornography during work hours on a City computer, particularly when he/she has been advised by the City that computer use is not anonymous.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\">\u00b683 The District Court concluded that because \u201cthe Employees\u2019 privacy expectations were unreasonable under these circumstances, their privacy rights do not clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 9. I agree with this conclusion. Although public humiliation may be an unfortunate consequence of disclosure, it is not a defense to disclosure. To the extent the Court holds otherwise, I strongly disagree.</p>\n<judges id=\"b467-4\">JUSTICE COTTER joins the Dissent of JUSTICE McKINNON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-5\"> The Court declines to address the threshold issue of whether the documents requested by the Gazette are public documents for purposes of Article II, Section 9, \u2018because all of the requested documents have already been disclosed\u201d and \u201cany further discussion as to whether these forms are considered public documents has been rendered moot.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 17. The entire contents of the requested documents have not been disclosed, however.

Doing so, I would hold that the Corrective Action Forms are the result of an investigation conducted by a public employer and are public documents within the meaning of Article II, Section 9, pursuant to <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>238 Mont. at 107, 775 P.2d at 1269-70; <em>Becky, </em>274 Mont. at 138, 906 P.2d at 197; and <em>Billings Gazette, </em>2011 MT 293, \u00b6 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-5\"> It is well established that Montana\u2019s Constitution affords individuals broader protection of privacy than does the federal constitution. <em>Gryczan v.
