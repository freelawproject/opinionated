We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Horace Mann when it determined that the Hankes\u2019 insurance policy failed to cover the Warner dispute?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court properly determined that Horace Mann\u2019s decisions to provide a defense and to pay the settlement of Warner\u2019s claims nevertheless allowed Horace Mann to pursue reimbursement for the Hankes\u2019 share of the settlement ?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>3. <em>Whether the District Court properly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Horace Mann under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act\u2019s supplemental relief provision?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b63 The dispute leading to the immediate appeal began when the Hankes offered space to Thomas Warner (Warner) to store personal belongings following Warner\u2019s eviction from his residence in Bozeman in 2004. Warner accepted the Hankes\u2019 offer. Warner stored his property in a small shed on the Hankes\u2019 property, near Three Forks in Gallatin County. Robert and Warner apparently made an oral agreement. Robert and Warner did not commit this agreement to writing. The Hankes maintained home insurance coverage from Teachers Insurance, a subsidiary of Horace Mann during this time.</p>\n<p id=\"AqY\">\u00b64 A fire completely destroyed the Hankes\u2019 home on April 20, 2005. As a result, Robert moved into a separate, larger shed on the property with his two sons. Rebecca Hanke and her daughter moved to a house in Belgrade. Robert and his sons began using Warner\u2019s personal property shortly thereafter. Robert sent Warner a letter in August 2005 in which he claimed that Warner had breached the agreement that the two previously had reached. Robert asserted ownership over Warner\u2019s property as a result of Warner\u2019s alleged breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u00b65 Warner filed an action against the Hankes for theft, conversion, and negligence in withholding Warner\u2019s property on April 9, 2007. Warner also sought punitive damages. The Hankes retained private counsel and responded to Warner\u2019s allegations. The Hankes failed to file a claim with Horace Mann to request a defense at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u00b66 The Hankes finally filed a claim with Horace Mann to request a defense against Warner\u2019s suit on December 1, 2008. Horace Mann investigated a defense for the Hankes, with a full reservation of Horace Mann\u2019s rights. Horace Mann agreed to assume the defense after investigation, with a full reservation of rights. Horace Mann retained new counsel to defend the Hankes.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">\u00b67 The new counsel that Horace Mann provided for the Hankes arranged for a settlement conference to attempt to resolve Warner\u2019s claims. Warner agreed to settle his claims for $54,000.00 at the conference. The Hankes agreed to pay $34,000.00 and Horace Mann agreed to contribute $20,000.00. The Hankes failed to obtain a loan to cover their $34,000.00 share. Horace Mann and the Hankes later reached an agreement whereby Horace Mann would advance the Hankes\u2019 $34,000.00 share. Horace Mann advanced the Hankes\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>contribution to the settlement subject to a full reservation of rights. The payment settled Warner\u2019s dispute with the Hankes.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b68 Horace Mann filed a declaratory judgment action against the Hankes before the settlement conference. Horace Mann requested that the District Court determine whether the Hankes\u2019 insurance policy required Horace Mann to defend the Hankes. Horace Mann and the Hankes filed cross-motions for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b69 The District Court determined that the Hankes\u2019 insurance policy excluded coverage for damage to Warner\u2019s personal property that had resulted from intentional acts. The District Court found that the Hankes intentionally had taken possession and intentionally had claimed ownership of Warner\u2019s property. The District Court also determined that \u201c[t]he incidental liability coverage contains a similar exclusion.\u201d The District Court further determined that the \u2018Hankes\u2019 taking possession and claiming ownership of Warner\u2019s property was just such an intentional act.\u201d The District Court concluded, therefore, that Horace Mann did not owe coverage to the Hankes for the Warner dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u00b610 Horace Mann requested that the District Court grant the costs of the defense that it had provided to the Hankes in the Warner dispute. Horace Mann further requested reimbursement for the $34,000.00 that Horace Mann had paid on behalf of the Hankes to settle the Warner dispute. Horace Mann lastly sought its attorney\u2019s fees and costs resulting from the declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\u00b611 The District Court denied Horace Mann any reimbursement of attorney fees and costs in the Warner dispute. The District Court awarded $34,000.00 to Horace Mann, however, to reimburse Horace Mann for its contribution to the settlement in the Warner dispute. The District Court further awarded $48,131.50 in attorney\u2019s fees to Horace Mann for the declaratory judgment action. The Hankes appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">\u00b612 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Bailey v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. </em>Co., 2013 MT 119, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 73, 300 P.3d 1149. This Court reviews for correctness a district court\u2019s decision as to whether legal authority exists to award attorney fees. <em>Hughes v. Ahlgren, </em>2011 MT 189, \u00b6 10, 361 Mont. 319, 258 P.3d 439. We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s order to grant or deny attorney fees if legal authority exists for the fees. <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b613 <em>Whether the District Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Horace Mann when it determined that the Hankes\u2019 insurance policy failed to cover the Warner dispute ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b614 The District Court analyzed both the property coverage and liability coverage provisions of the Hankes\u2019 insurance policy to determine whether the Hankes\u2019 insurance policy covered their claim. The District Court also examined the policy exclusions under each source of coverage. The District Court concluded that Robert\u2019s intentional acts excluded the Hankes\u2019 claim under either provision. The Hankes assert that the District Court should have relied exclusively upon the incidental liability language that includes coverage for damage to other\u2019s property. We examine separately each potential source of coverage and the accompanying exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b615 The personal property provision of the Hankes\u2019 insurance policy provides that \u2018[Horace Mann] cover[s] personal property ... in the care of an insured.\u201d The damaged property at issue undisputedly remained in the care of the Hankes. The relevant exception to the personal property provision excludes, however, \u201closs which results from an act committed by ... an insured. This includes any loss which is expected or intended by an insured.\u201d The District Court determined that the Hankes intentionally appropriated and took control of Warner\u2019s personal property. These intentional acts, according to the District Court, led directly to the damage at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u00b616 The Hankes argue that the District Court should have examined another coverage relevant to their claim: \u2018[r]egardless of an insured\u2019s legal liability, [Horace Mann] pay[s] for property of others damaged by an insured.\u201d The Hankes argue that this provision applies \u201cregardless of the Hankes\u2019 legal liability.\u201d This claim requires us to examine the exclusion relevant to liability coverage in the Hankes\u2019 policy. The exclusion provides that \u2018[Horace Mann] do[es] not pay for damage to property ... caused intentionally by an insured who has attained the age of 13.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\u00b617 The Hankes contend that Horace Mann should have covered any damage to Warner\u2019s property under this standard. The Hankes suggest that the \u201cunderlying conduct\u201d that caused the damage to Warner\u2019s personal property had not been intentional, but instead had resulted from negligent acts. The Hankes claim that much of the underlying conduct that caused damage to Warner\u2019s personal property had been the fault of the Hankes\u2019 young children. The exception for intentional acts applies only to \u201can insured who has attained the age of 13.\u201dNone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>of the Hankes\u2019 children \u00a3ha[d] attained the age of 13.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b618 Similar to the District Court, we need not determine whether the Hankes\u2019 young children acted negligently. Robert performed an intervening intentional act before his children allegedly damaged any of Warner\u2019s personal property. Robert claimed ownership of Warner\u2019s personal property in a letter to Warner on August 26, 2005, and further declared that the Hankes would use that property. The Hankes\u2019 children had access to Warner\u2019s personal property only due to the fact that Robert intentionally had claimed ownership and intentionally had used Warner\u2019s property for his own purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b619 The Hankes next argue that they potentially retained Warner\u2019s personal property with Warner\u2019s permission. The record directly contradicts this claim. The substance of Robert\u2019s August 26, 2005, letter to Warner makes clear that the Hankes\u2019 had taken Warner\u2019s property due to \u2018[Warner\u2019s] default on our original agreement.\u201dRobert clearly informed Warner that \u2018your property became mine.\u201d Robert further declared that the Hankes \u201cused Thomas Warner\u2019s personal property\u201d in an affidavit. These circumstances indicate no consent on Warner\u2019s part to the Hankes\u2019 use of his personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b620  Thus, Robert committed two intentional acts that exclude coverage. The first intentional act involves Robert\u2019s decision to take possession of Warner\u2019s property. Robert\u2019s second intentional act occurred when he claimed ownership of Warner\u2019s personal property. The damage to Warner\u2019s personal property occurred due to Robert\u2019s intervening acts of taking possession and claiming ownership. These intentional acts triggered the exception to the Hankes\u2019 insurance policy that excludes coverage for damage caused intentionally by an insured. Robert\u2019s intentional acts also extinguished any potential coverage that could have been available to apply to any later allegedly negligent acts by the Hankes\u2019 young children or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u00b621 We further note that an additional exclusion to the Hankes\u2019 incidental liability provision excludes coverage for \u201cdamage to property that is... used by... an insured.\u201dThis exclusion also appears to exclude from coverage any personal liability that Robert incurred when he damaged Warner\u2019s property after Robert had taken possession and claimed ownership of Warner\u2019s property. The District Court did not rely on this exclusion. The Hankes entirely ignored this exclusion. Horace Mann suggested only this exclusion \u2018interestingly\u201d applied. The Hankes used the personal property at issue as evidenced by Robert Hankes\u2019 affidavit. Robert Hanke testified that \u201cwe used Thomas Warner\u2019s personal property.\u201d This separate exclusion supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>District Court\u2019s determination that no coverage exists. We decline to uphold coverage under the terms of the policy. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Liss, </em>2000 MT 380, \u00b6 32, 303 Mont. 519, 16 P.3d 399. The District Court properly granted summary judgment to Horace Mann.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b622 <em>Whether the District Court properly determined that Horace Mann\u2019s decisions to provide a defense and to pay the settlement of Warner\u2019s claims nevertheless allowed Horace Mann to pursue reimbursement for the Hankes\u2019 share of the settlement ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b623 The Hankes next claim that Horace Mann took control of the defense, deprived the Hankes of their preferred counsel, and settled the case without respecting the Hankes\u2019 opportunity to have a jury determine the factual issues. The Hankes argue that these decisions should bind Horace Mann. The Hankes posit that Horace Mann may not now seek reimbursement for the settlement advancement that Horace Mann chose to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b624  The Hankes ask this Court to disregard the insurer\u2019s well-established duty to defend. An insurer\u2019s duty to defend its insured arises when an insured sets forth facts that present a risk that possibly would be covered by the terms of an insurance policy. <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 20, 321 Mont. 99, 90 P.3d 381. An insurer owes a duty to defend unless the insurer unequivocally demonstrates that the claim against the insured falls outside the policy coverage. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">\u00b625 An insurer should provide the insured a defense under a reservation of rights if the insurer believes that a question exists about the boundaries of coverage. The insurer then may file a declaratory judgment action to resolve coverage issues. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 28. The insurer may seek to recover the expenses that the insurer incurred in defending a claim outside of the insured\u2019s policy coverage in the declaratory judgment action. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 28. An insurer\u2019s failure to follow this course leaves the insurer potentially liable for defense costs and judgments. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 27; \u00a728-11-316, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">\u00b626 Horace Mann assumed the duty to defend the Hankes. Horace Mann informed the Hankes in writing on December 24, 2008, on February 26,2009, and on April 22, 2009, that Horace Mann reserved all rights in investigating the Hankes\u2019 claim, and in providing a defense. The Hankes accepted the defense that Horace Mann had offered. Horace Mann\u2019s new counsel arranged for a settlement conference on January 29, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">\u00b627 Robert, Rebecca Hanke, the new counsel that Horace Mann provided, Warner, and Warner\u2019s counsel attended the settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>conference. Warner\u2019s attorney negotiated the settlement amount to $54,000.00. Horace Mann offered to contribute $20,000.00 toward that amount. The Hankes \u201cwere expected to pay $34,000\u201d of their own money to facilitate the $54,000.00 settlement. The Hankes unsuccessfully sought to obtain a loan for $34,000.00 to fund their obligation under the terms of the settlement. Horace Mann agreed to \u2018fund the $34,000 owed by the Hankes\u201d under the settlement agreement that the Hankes and Warner had reached. Horace Mann covered the Hankes\u2019 $34,000.00 obligation under the settlement agreement without any assurance that it ever would be able to recover the advanced funds from the Hankes.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b628 Horace Mann reserved in writing on April 20, 2010, its right to recover the cost of settlement upon advancing the Hankes\u2019 their $34,000.00 contribution. Horace Mann specifically announced that its payment of \u201cthe Hankes\u2019 obligation\u201d would be subject to Horace Mann\u2019s full reservation of rights. Horace Mann argues that it paid the Hankes\u2019 $34,000.00 obligation in furtherance of its agreement with the Hankes. The Hankes fail to identify any evidence in the record that would suggest otherwise. The Hankes make only the general assertions that \u2018tn]o amount of evidence now will prove what Warner may have proved against Hankes or they may have proved in defense\u201d and that \u2018ho determination of fault or intent was made by a jury because Horace Mann decided it would pay the entire settlement.\u201d The record suggests that Horace Mann advanced funds exclusively because of its agreement with the Hankes.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b629 The Hankes received the full benefit of Horace Mann\u2019s strict adherence to the procedure that this Court has established. Horace Mann had reserved rights on multiple occasions in varying scope. Horace Mann reserved only \u201crights as allowed under the policy contract\u201d in letters on December 24, 2008 and February 26, 2009. Horace Mann reserved substantially more broadly \u2018the right to withdraw from the defense <em>and indemnity\u201din </em>a letter on April 22,2009 (emphasis added). Horace Mann reserved specifically \u2018the right to recover defense and settlement costs\u201d in a letter on April 20, 2010, upon payment of the Hankes\u2019 settlement claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u00b630 The Dissent takes issue with Horace Mann\u2019s failure to use the word \u201csettlement\u201d in an earlier letter, and its choice to use the word \u201ccosts\u201d in conjunction with \u201csettlement,\u201d in Horace Mann\u2019s April 20, 2010, letter. Dissent, \u00b6 41. The \u2018indemnity\u2019language in the April 22, 2009, letter encompasses clearly, however, Horace Mann\u2019s potential ability to recoup any amounts advanced. <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>Ribi Immunochem Research, Inc., </em>2005 MT 50, \u00b6\u00b6 48-50, 326 Mont. 174, 108 P.3d 469. Horace Mann sent this letter to the Hankes nearly twelve months before the parties reached a settlement. <em>Ribi Immunochem, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b631  The correspondence between Horace Mann and the Hankes and their counsel establishes that Horace Mann reserved its right to recover the additional $34,000.00 that it paid to the settlement with Warner. Horace Mann protected the Hankes\u2019 $54,000.00 settlement in furtherance of Horace Mann\u2019s agreement with the Hankes. Horace Mann adhered to the procedure that this Court has established to contest the boundaries of coverage and to recoup expenses. <em>Ribi Immunochem, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48-50. We affirm the District Court\u2019s award of $34,000.00 to reimburse Horace Mann for its advancement of the Hankes\u2019 share of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b632 <em>Whether the District Court properly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Horace Mann under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b633 The District Court determined that the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act\u2019s supplemental relief provision supported an award of $48,131.50 in attorney\u2019s fees to Horace Mann. A party in a civil action generally may not recover attorney\u2019s fees absent a specific contractual or statutory provision that allows for those fees. <em>Trustees of Indiana University v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, \u00b6 19, 315 Mont. 210, 69 P.3d 663. Section 27-8-313, MCA, authorizes a party to petition for supplemental relief based on a declaratory judgment \u201cwhenever necessary and proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u00b634 We determined in <em>Buxbaum </em>that an award of attorney\u2019s fees falls within the scope of the supplemental relief authorized by \u00a727-8-313, MCA. <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 46. We later clarified that a district court may award attorney fees in a declaratory relief action under \u00a727-8-313, MCA, only if equitable considerations support that award. <em>United Nat. Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 269, \u00b6 38, 352 Mont. 105, 214 P.3d 1260. Once the district court finds equitable considerations, the district court then must find that an award would be necessary and proper. <em>United Nat. Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 38. The court first must conclude that support for the award rests in equity, however, before the necessary and proper inquiry triggers. <em>United Nat. Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u00b635 We have limited the circumstances under which a court may award attorney\u2019s fees in a declaratory judgment action. <em>See United Nat. Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 39; Hughes, \u00b6 21; <em>Baxter v. State, </em>2009 MT 449, \u00b6 48, 354 Mont. 234, 224 P.3d 1211. In fact, only once have we upheld an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>award of attorney\u2019s fees in a declaratory relief action under \u00a727-8-313, MCA. <em>Renville v. Farmers Ins. </em>Exch., 2004 MT 366, \u00b6 28, 324 Mont. 509, 105 P.3d 280. We have never determined that equity supported an attorney\u2019s fees award for an insurer who makes the \u201ctactical decision\u201d to file a declaratory judgment in the normal course of assuming its duty to defend. <em>United Nat. Ins. </em>Co., \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b636 A jury awarded Renville damages for injuries that she had suffered as a passenger in a car accident. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 7. Farmers Insurance Exchange (Farmers) withheld payment on a portion of Renville\u2019s award even after this Court had affirmed the award. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-18. Renville sought declaratory relief to recover unpaid damages from Farmers. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 10. The district court granted declaratory relief and awarded Renville her attorney fees under \u00a727-8-313, MCA <em>.Renville, </em>\u00b6 18. The district court reasoned that Renville had accrued substantial attorney\u2019s fees in order to recover a small damages award. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 28. We agreed that the attorney\u2019s fees award prevented the anomalous result of Renville having been better off had she never brought the claim. <em>See United Nat. Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 38. <em>Renville </em>represents an outlier where equity supported an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>United Nat. Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 38, quoting <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 46. Horace Mann\u2019s circumstances here accordingly differ dramatically from <em>Renville.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b637 An insurer in the normal course of coverage may elect to fulfill its duty to defend by providing coverage to an insured and later contesting the boundaries of that coverage in a declaratory judgment action. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 28. Horace Mann, acting in the normal course of business, elected to fulfill its duty to provide a defense to the Hankes subject to a reservation of rights. An insurer may recover its defense costs for the underlying action when it ultimately has no duty to defend. <em>Ribi Immunochem, </em>\u00b6 50. The District Court denied Horace Mann\u2019s attempt to recoup its defense costs expended on the Hankes\u2019 behalf in the action brought by Warner, however, due to Horace Mann\u2019s failure to provide timely notice to the Hankes of its intent to recoup these costs in the event that no coverage existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u00b638  Horace Mann, also acting in the normal course of business, made the \u201ctactical decision\u201d to file a declaratory judgment action to determine definitively its coverage obligations. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 28. These actions by Horace Mann support the District Court\u2019s decision to recompense Horace Mann for its contribution to the settlement with Warner. These acts fail to rise to the level, however, that would prompt an award of attorney\u2019s fees to Horace Mann in the declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>judgment action pursuant to the analysis in <em>Renville. </em>Horace Mann simply acted in the normal course of business that an insurer would take when it exercises its duty to defend under a reservation of rights. The record fails to support an award of attorney\u2019s fees to Horace Mann under the extreme circumstances presented in <em>Renville. See United Nat. Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 39. We need not analyze whether the award was necessary and proper under the analysis <em>inBuxbaum. See United Natl. Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b639 We reverse the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Horace Mann and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b390-5\">JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b390-6\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"Al9\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"AVH\">\u00b640 I concur in the Court\u2019s resolution of Issues One and Three. I dissent from the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue Two. I would conclude that because it did not provide specific notice to Hankes prior to mediation and settlement that it intended to seek reimbursement of its contribution to any settlement, Horace Mann may not now recover its contribution to the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u00b641 As the District Court noted in its order addressing indemnification and fees, the first several letters written by Horace Mann to the Hankes undertaking their defense did not alert the Hankes of the possibility of nor the explicit reservation of the right to seek reimbursement. In fact, it was not until its letter of April 20, 2010, that Horace Mann first explicitly mentioned a right to reimbursement. This letter stated: \u2018Horace Mann\u2019s payment of the Hankes\u2019 obligation [to fund the $34,000 owed by the Hankes under the settlement agreement reached at mediation] is made under a full reservation of rights, including the right to recover defense and settlement costs should the [c]ourt rule in the declaratory judgment action that there is no coverage.\u201d Notably, this letter was sent three months after the mediation at which the parties settled the Warner claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">\u00b642 The District Court cited with approval the case of <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Ribi Immunochem Research, </em>2005 MT 50, \u00b6\u00b6 48-50, 326 Mont. 174, 108 P.3d 469, in which we held that insurers may recover the costs of defending and indemnifying their insured against uncovered claims, in certain circumstances. We said that these costs are recoverable, where the insurer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">(1) timely and explicitly reserved the right to recoup the costs; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">(2) provided specific and adequate notice to the insured of the possibility of reimbursement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Relying upon this test, the District Court properly concluded that because Horace Mann did not notify Hankes that it could later seek reimbursement for the defense costs until well after those costs had been expended, it had failed to meet its obligation to specifically and timely inform them that it would seek to recoup those amounts. I agree with this conclusion. The District Court and this Court go awry, however, in concluding that Horace Mann timely and explicitly advised Hankes that it would seek to recover the contribution it made to the settlement of the Warner claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b643 As noted above, the April 20, 2010 letter in which Horace Mann agreed to provide the remaining $34,000 toward the settlement on behalf of the Hankes stated it was doing so under a full reservation of rights, \u201cincluding the right to recover defense and settlement <em>costs\u201d </em>should the court determine in the declaratory action that there was no coverage for the Warner claims. (Emphasis added.) This letter does not timely or explicitly alert the Hankes that it intended to recoup the amounts advanced toward the settlement of the Warner claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b644 The Legislature defines the costs generally allowable to a prevailing party. Section 25-10-201, MCA, states that the allowable costs are the parties\u2019 \u201cnecessary disbursements,\u201d to include legal fees of witnesses; the expenses of taking depositions; legal fees for publication; fees paid to stenographers for filing and recording papers; expenses of printing papers for hearing; and \u201cother reasonable and necessary expenses that are taxable according to the course and practice of the court or by express provision of law.\u201d Nowhere in Montana statute or case law are \u201ccosts\u201d defined to include an insurer\u2019s contribution to a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b645 Given that <em>Ribi </em>addresses a claim for reimbursement of defense costs, and not claims for reimbursement of settlement amounts, it is arguably not even applicable here. However, there are no reported Montana cases in which this Court has approved a claim for reimbursement of a settlement contribution by an insurance company operating under a reservation of rights. I submit that a parallel version of the <em>Ribi </em>test should apply where an insurer later seeks to recover the amount it paid in settlement of a claim after there is a determination that it has no duty to indemnify. I would conclude that an insurer may later recover monies it paid in the settlement of a claim against the insured, provided the insurer (1) timely and explicitly reserved the right to recoup the settlement amount; and (2) provided specific and adequate notice to the insured of the possibility of reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\u00b646 Here, in advising the insured that it reserved the right to recover defense and settlement costs, Horace Mann did not meet the foregoing test. First, it did not timely and explicitly reserve the right to recoup the settlement amount, as it did not address reimbursement of any sums until months after the mediation. Second, it did not provide specific and adequate notice to the insured of the possibility that it would seek reimbursement of the settlement amount. I would conclude that Horace Mann was not entitled to secure reimbursement of its contribution to the settlement with Warner. I therefore dissent from the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue Two.</p>\n<judges id=\"b392-4\">\u00b647 I otherwise concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
