While Skramovsky paid Owen $10,000 down to be applied to the full purchase price of the distributorship, he took over operation of the distributorship without paying Owen the remaining balance. Owen sued Skramovsky in the Eleventh Judicial District Court of Montana for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Skramovsky counter-claimed that Owen had fraudulently and negligently misrepresented aspects of the business to Skramovsky resulting in Skramovsky\u2019s \u201cuninformed\u201d purchase. Following a bench trial, the District Court determined Skramovsky had been unjustly enriched by the transaction and awarded Owen $81,325 plus reasonable costs.

He purchased the business for $75,000 at a time when the distributorship was making less than $2,000 per week in gross sales. By the spring of 2009, the distributorship was averaging approximately $8,000 per week in gross sales. Owen testified that operation of the distributorship provided him with a comfortable living without the need for additional employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u00b69 In 2009, Owen decided to sell his business and met with Don and Tammy Skramovsky in February 2010 to discuss their interest in purchasing the distributorship. He told the Skramovskys that the business generated approximately $8,000 in weekly sales and showed them a claim slip purportedly supporting that figure. Owen and the Skramovskys also discussed the percentage of sales retained by the distributor. Owen claims he told Skramovskys they would keep 15 - 20% depending on the type of products sold, while Skramovsky insists Owen said it was a fixed 20 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\u00b610 Skramovsky asserts that he requested profit and loss statements from Owen during the February 2010 meeting and Owen agreed to provide them. Owen denies this, saying he never kept such statements but that he agreed to \u201cput together\u201d some financial information for Skramovsky\u2019s review. It is undisputed that Owen did not provide any kind of financial documentation either before or after completion of the transfer of the distributorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">\u00b611 Owen alleges that the parties discussed a purchase price of $130,000 with $10,000 as a down payment. Skramovsky claims Owen requested $120,000 with a $10,000 down payment. Owen asserts that at the close of the February 2010 meeting, he believed he had a deal with the Skramovskys to purchase his business. He nonetheless subsequently met with Don and Jan Keltner to explore their interest in purchasing the distributorship. After the meeting to discuss the sale, the Keltners accompanied Owen on the distribution route serviced by the distributorship. They later offered to purchase the distributorship for $130,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">\u00b612 In March 2010, Owen notified Skramovsky that the Keltners wished to purchase the business for more money than the Skramovsky had offered. He told Skramovsky that if he and his wife wished to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>purchase the distributorship, the price was now $140,000. It appears that Skramovsky offered $130,000 and Owen accepted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Owen informed the Keltners that the business had been sold. In April and May 2010, Skramovsky gave Owen two checks for $5,000 each. These checks constituted the $10,000 down payment discussed in the February meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\u00b613 Skramovsky applied with Mission Foods for approval to assume control over the distributorship and signed a distributor agreement with Mission Foods on April 30,2010. During May 2010, Skramovsky accompanied Owen on at least six occasions along the distribution route during which Owen instructed Skramovsky in the operation of the route. Additionally, Owen notified Mission Foods that Skramovsky would be assuming control. These events took place despite the absence of any written sales contract or agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u00b614 On June 1, 2010, Owen relinquished control and Skramovsky assumed control over the distributorship. Owen transferred the distributorship\u2019s inventory to Skramovsky at that time. On June 7, 2010, Owen presented a proposed written asset purchase agreement to Skramovsky but Skramovsky refused to sign it because it contained terms he claims were never discussed. Owen amended the proposed agreement and presented the amended document to Skramovsky on July 3,2010. Skramovsky again refused to sign claiming Owen had not completed Skramovsky\u2019s training. Owen denies that Skramovsky requested additional training. Ultimately, the parties never entered into a written purchase contract, nor did Skramovsky pay Owen any more money toward the purchase of the distributorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\u00b615 In September 2010, Owen filed a Complaint alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Skramovsky answered the Complaint, presented numerous affirmative defenses and counter-claimed for fraud and negligent misrepresentation. He sought punitive damages as well. The District Court conducted a bench trial in late October and November 2012. The court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order on December 19, 2012. It concluded Skramovsky had been unjustly enriched by his acquisition of the distributorship for a $10,000 payment and, as a result, the court awarded damages to Owen. It calculated these damages based upon \u201cthe value of the enhancement to Skramovsky\u2019s property as a result of his acquiring the distributorship.\u201d Skramovsky was ordered to pay Owen $81,325. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>court also dismissed Skramovsky\u2019s counter-claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\u00b616 Skramovsky appeals and Owen cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u00b617 We review the factual findings of a district court sitting without a jury to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. We review for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>AAA Constr. of Missoula, LLC v. Choice Land Corp., </em>2011 MT 262, \u00b6 17, 362 Mont. 264, 264 P.3d 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">\u00b618 A district court\u2019s determination of damages is also a factual finding which will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. We will not overturn such a determination unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Watson v. West, </em>2011 MT 57, \u00b6 16, 360 Mont. 9, 250 P.3d 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">\u00b619 <em>Did the District Court err in finding that Skramovsky agreed to buy the distributorship for $130,000?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">\u00b620 Skramovsky denies having agreed to buy Owen\u2019s Mission Foods distributorship for $130,000 or, for that matter, any other price. He claims that he told Owen he would \u201cconsider\u201d paying $130,000 \u201cbut only if Owen produced the financial documentation\u201d requested by Skramovsky, which Owen did not do. Skramovsky further argues in the alternative that \u201c[e]ven if [he] did agree to purchase the [distributorship for $120,000 or $130,000, he was an uniformed [sic] buyer and therefore, the price is not a \u2018fair market value\u2019 and should not be utilized for any calculation of damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">\u00b621 Owen testified that at the end of the February 2010 meeting with Skramovsky, he concluded Skramovsky had agreed to purchase the distributorship for the asking price of $130,000. After being approached by the Keltners, Owen went back to Skramovsky and told him the Keltners had offered a higher price for the distributorship. After discussing this with Skramovsky, Owen concluded that Skramovsky had agreed to purchase the distributorship for the higher price of $140,000. Owen therefore told the Keltners the distributorship had been sold and was no longer available. Subsequently, Owen began training Skramovsky on the route, Skramovsky paid $10,000 down, sought and received approval from Mission Foods to take over Owen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>distributorship and began operating the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\u00b622 It is well established that it is exclusively within the province of the trier of fact, and not this Court, to weigh evidence, including conflicting evidence, and judge the credibility of the witnesses. We have repeatedly held that we will not second-guess a district court\u2019s determinations regarding the strength and weight of conflicting testimony. <em>St. James Healthcare v. Cole, </em>2008 MT 44, \u00b6 43, 341 Mont. 368, 178 P.3d 696, <em>Varano v. Hicks, </em>2012 MT 195, \u00b6 9, 366 Mont. 171, 285 P.3d 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u00b623  The District Court was presented with conflicting evidence as to the purchase price and the existence of an agreement between the parties. It was the District Court\u2019s responsibility to determine the credibility of the witnesses and weigh the evidence presented. As there was testimony supporting the District Court\u2019s findings that Skramovsky did agree to purchase the distributorship for $130,000, the findings are not clearly erroneous nor are the court\u2019s conclusions of law in this regard incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">\u00b624 <em>Did the District Court err in finding that Skramovsky was unjustly enriched?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\u00b625 Because the parties did not enter into a written contract, the District Court concluded the doctrine of unjust enrichment applied. \u2018The doctrine of unjust enrichment is an equitable means of preventing one party from benefiting from his or her wrongful acts.\u201d In the absence of a contract between parties, the doctrine of unjust enrichment may create an implied contract in law: <em>Hinebauch v. McRae, </em>2011 MT 270, \u00b6 29, 362 Mont. 358, 264 P.3d 1098 <em>(citing Estate of Pruyn v. Axmen Propane, Inc., </em>2009 MT 448, \u00b6\u00b6 63-64, 354 Mont. 208, 223 P.3d 845). Unjust enrichment is simply \u201c[t]he retention of a benefit conferred by another, without offering compensation, in circumstances where compensation is reasonably expected.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1536 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 7th ed., West 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">\u00b626 Skramovsky argues that he did not engage in any \u201cwrongful acts\u201d such as misconduct or taking advantage of Owen. He maintains that at the time Mission Foods transferred control of the distributorship to him, he and Owen were still engaged in negotiations for the sale and that a price had not yet been established nor had Owen provided Skramovsky with requested financial documents. Skramovsky claims he felt \u201cobligated\u201d under the April 2010 distribution agreement with Mission Foods to operate the distributorship even though he had not yet purchased it. Therefore, he asserts there was no \u201cbad act,\u201d nor was it misconduct for him to operate the distributorship despite not owning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>it. Relying on the testimony of his expert witness, Donald Kisler, Skramovsky further asserts that the distributorship had \u2018ho value\u201d at the time Skramovsky assumed it and his assumption of the distributorship \u201cdid not give him any \u2018benefit\u2019 or value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">\u00b627 The District Court found that Owen agreed to sell and Skramovsky agreed to buy the distributorship but that no \u201cvalid, enforceable agreement to this effect [was consummated] between the parties.\u201dThe court also found that the value of the distributorship was clearly \u201cabove $10,000\u201d-the amount Skramovsky paid to Owen.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\u00b628 During the three-day bench trial, substantial evidence was presented as to the value of the distributorship. Some of the evidence indicated the distributorship had no value while other evidence indicated a substantial and growing value. The court found that \u2018Skramovsky, by assuming control of the distributorship and deriving all benefit therefrom without paying any further monies to [Owen] other than the previously mentioned $10,000 down payment, has clearly taken advantage of Owen.\u201d The District Court continued that \u201c[s]ince June 1, 2010, Skramovsky has been operating the distributorship, which has yielded gross weekly sales in excess of $8,000.\u201d Because the value was greater than the amount paid, and Skramovsky was reaping the benefits of operating the distributorship, the District Court concluded Skramovsky was unjustly enriched.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\u00b629  As addressed above, it is for the trier of fact to weigh the evidence and judge the credibility of the witnesses. <em>St. James Healthcare, </em>\u00b6 43. As the record contains substantial credible evidence reflecting a value to the distributorship greater than the $10,000 paid by Skramovsky, we conclude the District Court\u2019s determination that Skramovsky was unjustly enriched is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\u00b630 <em>Did the District Court apply the proper measure of damages in awarding Owen $81,325 plus costs for his unjust enrichment claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AbX\">\u00b631 The District Court determined that the proper measure of damages for Owen\u2019s unjust enrichment claim was either the <em>quantum meruit </em>value of Owen\u2019s labor and materials or the value of the enhancement to Skramovsky\u201d s property. The court concluded that because there was no evidentiary basis for measuring the <em>quantum meruit </em>value, \u2018the value of the distributorship, being the enhancement to Skramovsky\u201d s property, must be determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">\u00b632 To make such a determination, the District Court considered the value attributed to the distributorship by Owen and Skramovsky when they were negotiating a sale of the distributorship. Acknowledging that there was no enforceable agreement between the parties, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>nonetheless found that Skramovsky had agreed to purchase the distributorship for $130,000. This \u201cagreed price\u201d was premised upon Owen\u2019s representation that the distributorship had weekly gross sales of $8,000 which was subject to a 20% commission structure. Such sales and commissions would yield Skramovsky a weekly income before expenses of $1,600. Discounting sales receipts from the first six months of operations during which Skramovsky was learning how to efficiently operate the distributorship, the District Court focused on testimony revealing that during 2011, Skramovsky\u2019s commissions averaged $l,124/week, or 70.25% of the commissions Skramovsky expected to receive for his $130,000 investment. Applying 70.25% to the original purchase price of $130,000, the court concluded that a fair value for the distributorship was $91,325. This sum was offset by the $10,000 down payment, resulting in a balance of $81,325.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\u00b633 Skramovsky does not challenge the District Court\u2019s conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to determine a <em>quantum meruit </em>value. However he disagrees that a determination of the enhancement to his property should have been based upon \u201cOwen\u2019s desired selling price.\u201d Skramovsky opines that the benefit bestowed upon him has nothing to do with the price he was originally willing to pay to purchase the distributorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\u00b634  We conclude based upon the facts of this case that the District Court\u2019s determination of damages was based upon credible evidence and is not clearly erroneous. The court crafted a reasonable method for determining the value of the distributorship which represented the amount by which Skramovsky was unjustly enriched. We affirm the court\u2019s ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\u00b635 <em>Did the District Court err in finding that Skramovsky had knowledge of the falsity of Owen\u2019s representations regarding commissions and the provision of profit and loss statements?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\u00b636 Skramovsky alleged in his counter-claim that Owen misrepresented the commission structure applied to the distributorship\u2019s sales by Mission Foods and that Owen falsely represented he would provide Skramovsky with profit and loss statements reflecting the distributorship\u2019s financial performance. Owen denies both allegations. To prevail on a claim of actual fraud or negligent misrepresentation, Skramovsky must establish, among other things, that he was unaware that Owen\u2019s misrepresentations were incorrect or untrue. <em>McCulley v. Am. Land Title Co., </em>2013 MT 89, \u00b6 19, 369 Mont. 433, 300 P.3d 679 (setting forth the nine elements of an actual fraud claim); <em>Harpole v. Powell Cty. Title Co., </em>2013 MT 257, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u00b6 28, 371 Mont. 543, 309 P.3d 34 (setting forth the six elements of a negligent misrepresentation claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">\u00b637 The District Court dismissed Skramovsky\u2019s counter-claim alleging that Owen engaged in fraud and misrepresentation with respect to commissions. The court found Skramovsky\u2019s allegations incredible. It concluded that even if Owen did represent that the commission return was 20%, Skramovsky knew this to be incorrect in light of the fact that he signed the Mission Foods distributor agreement and initialed the page that set forth the actual commission structure information. Further, the court found it significant that Skramovsky was aware that Owen had not ever maintained profit and loss statements over the years he operated the business. It therefore concluded that Skramovsky could not satisfy the elements of a claim of actual fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Again, the court made its determination based upon its perception of the credibility of the witnesses. Having reviewed the record, we cannot conclude that the court\u2019s findings in this regard are clearly erroneous or that its conclusions are incorrect. We therefore affirm the court\u2019s dismissal of Skramovsky\u2019s counter-claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\u00b638 <em>CROSS-APPEAL:Did the District Court improperly apply the law to the facts underlying his unjust enrichment </em>/ quantum meruit <em>claim so as to misstate the damages due him?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">\u00b639 Owen asserts the District Court erred in determining the amount by which Skramovsky was unjustly enriched. He opines that Skramovsky was unjustly enriched by $120,000-the amount of money the Keltners were willing to pay for the distributorship ($130,000 minus Skramovsky\u2019s $10,000 down payment). Owen further argues, as noted above, that Skramovsky signed the distribution agreement with Mission Foods and knew exactly what the commission structure was because it was included in the agreement. For this reason, Owen alleges the District Court erred in using a 20% commission factor in its calculation of Skramovsky\u2019s enhanced value.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">\u00b640  While we acknowledge there may be multiple ways in which the court could have determined the enhanced value enjoyed by Skramovsky, the method utilized by the court was supported by facts presented to the District Court. And while other facts were also presented that could have supported a different calculation, it was within the province of the District Court to weigh the evidence presented and apply it accordingly. The District Court\u2019s determination is not clearly erroneous and we will not substitute our judgment for its determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">\u00b641 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s rulings. The evidence presented at trial supported the court\u2019s findings and the court\u2019s conclusions of law were correct.</p>\n<judges id=\"b570-5\">JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\"> Owen testified to both a $130,000 and a $140,000 sales price. <em>See </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
