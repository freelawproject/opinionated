Jacky (Jacky) appeals the orders denying her petition for review and her motion to set aside the judgment of the Twenty-second Judicial District Court, Carbon County. We reverse and remand for a review of the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">\u00b62 A restatement of the dispositive issue on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it denied a petition for judicial review because no supporting brief was filed?</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">\u00b64 Jacky worked as a bus driver for Big Sky Bus Lines in Great Falls, Montana. After leaving her job, she applied for unemployment benefits with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry (the Department). On July 5,2012, the Department issued a determination that Jacky was not qualified to receive unemployment benefits. The Department affirmed its initial determination on August 3, 2013. Jacky timely requested an administrative hearing, after which the hearing officer affirmed the redetermination. Jacky then filed an appeal to the Board of Labor Appeals (the Board). The Board adopted and affirmed the decision of the hearing officer on November 20,2012.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">\u00b65 After exhausting her administrative remedies, Jacky, appearing as a self-represented litigant, filed a petition for review in the District Court. Jacky attached copies of various documents to her petition, including a copy of the Board\u2019s decision. Jacky did not serve the Department with her petition. On January 18,2013, the District Court denied Jacky\u2019s petition for failure to comply with Rule 2 of the Montana Uniform District Court Rules (Rule 2) because Jacky had not filed a supporting brief or stated issues of law for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">\u00b66 Upon receiving a copy of the court\u2019s January 18 order, the Department first learned of the action in District Court. In turn, it filed a motion to set aside the judgment. The Department argued that Montana law requires a district court to review the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>record to determine whether the Board correctly applied the law and whether the factual findings of the Board are supported by substantial evidence. According to the Department, \u201c[t]he unique statutory standard of review of an unemployment insurance matter, pursuant to \u00a739-51-2410(5), MCA, preclude[d] the entry of a default judgment by the [c]ourt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b67 On January 30,2013, the District Court denied the Department\u2019s motion. The District Court stated that it \u201cunderstood] the applicable procedure explicitly,\u2019\u2019but that such procedure was not at issue because Jacky failed to \u201c[raise] any identifiable question of law for the Court\u2019s review\u201d and to \u201cstate the grounds upon which a review is sought.\u201d The District Court affirmed its initial denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b68 Jacky filed an appeal with this Court on February 11,2013. Jacky argues that Rule 2 is inapplicable because it governs motions, not petitions for review. Jacky further argues that the statutory procedure for judicial review in unemployment cases does not require parties to submit supporting briefs with their petitions for review. Jacky contends the District Court should not have dismissed her petition without first giving her leave to amend, especially as no other party would have suffered prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b69 In its answer brief, the Department also requests we reverse the District Court\u2019s order and remand this case, arguing the District Court erred by failing to conduct a review of the administrative record. The Department argues the petition for judicial review is governed by Montana\u2019s unemployment insurance law, which directs a district court to expedite judicial review of Board decisions and to conduct a review of the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b610 Denial of a petition for judicial review due to a petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with a procedural rule is a conclusion of law. We review a court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Galassi v. Lincoln Co. Bd. of </em>Commrs., 2003 MT 319, \u00b6 7, 318 Mont. 288, 80 P.3d 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err when it denied a petition for judicial review because no supporting brief was filed?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">\u00b612  On appeal, both parties contend the District Court improperly denied Jacky\u2019s petition for judicial review. We conclude that the District Court erred when it denied Jacky\u2019s petition for failure to file a supplemental brief. We decline to address the other issues raised by the parties as this issue is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>\u00b613 Section 39-51-2410, MCA, sets out the process to be followed in seeking judicial review of a Board decision on a claim for unemployment benefits. Pursuant to \u00a739-51-2410(2), MCA, \u201cany party aggrieved thereby may secure judicial review thereof by commencing an action in the district court,\u201d filing a petition \u201cstat[ing] the grounds upon which a review is sought,\u201d and \u201cserv[ing] [it] upon the commissioner of labor and industry and all interested parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b614 Rule 2 provides: \u2018The moving party shall file a supporting brief upon filing a motion.\u201dThe District Court concluded that Jacky violated this rule by failing to attach a brief to her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b615 A motion is \u201c[a] written or oral application requesting a court to make a specified ruling or order.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1106 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., West 2009). A petition, on the other hand, is merely \u201c[a] formal written request presented to a court or other official body.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>at 1261. While it is obvious that one seeking judicial review of a Board decision hopes to have the decision overturned, the petitioner is not obligated under the governing statute to file a supporting brief. Rather, she is simply invoking her statutory remedy and asking the District Court to review the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b616 Further, we note that the procedures set forth in \u00a739-51-2410, MCA, are specifically tailored to meet the purposes of the unemployment insurance chapter. \u201cWhen a general and particular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former, so a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it.\u201d Section 1-2-102, MCA; <em>see also State v. Garner, </em>1999 MT 295, \u00b6 26, 297 Mont. 89, 990 P.2d 175 (\u2018[T]he Rules of Civil Procedure apply in a post-conviction relief proceeding <em>only </em>when they are applicable and not inconsistent with post-conviction statutes.\u201d) (italics in original); <em>Rierson v. State, </em>191 Mont. 66, 70, 622 P.2d 195, 198 (1981) (\u2018Only in the broadest sense could these limitations [for written contracts or other obligations] be considered to be controlling, and since there is a more specific statute involving injury to personal property rights, of which retirement benefits are one, we are constrained to follow the more specific statute.\u201d); <em>Weston v. Cole, </em>233 Mont. 61, 63, 758 P.2d 289, 291 (1988) (holding the two-year period for filing a particular tort action such as assault and battery controls over the more general three-year statute of limitations for tort actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\u00b617  Because the specific statutory procedures set forth in \u00a739-51-2410, MCA, govern these proceedings, and because a petition is not a motion, the provisions of Rule 2 do not apply to a petition for judicial review. It is our obligation to apply the statute as written, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>inserting what has been omitted or omitting what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Garner, </em>\u00b6 22. A district court <em>may </em>require a petitioner to file a brief in support of the petition, <em>see e.g. Schneeman v. State, </em>257 Mont. 254, 260, 848 P.2d 504, 508 (1993), but such briefing is not mandated by \u00a739-51-2410, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b618 The District Court asserted that Jacky failed to raise any identifiable question of law for the court\u2019s review or to state the grounds upon which she sought relief. Jacky wrote that the Department \u2018failed to document, process and facilitate [her] unemployment claim accurately, honestly, fairly or ethically resulting in a gross miscarriage of justice.\u201d This statement is adequate for the purposes of \u201cstaffing] the grounds upon which a review is sought\u201d under \u00a739-51-2410(2), MCA. Jacky was not required to provide any discussion or legal authority to support her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b619  Jacky failed to serve the Department with her petition as required by the statute. However, \u201c[a]s a general rule, we encourage a liberal interpretation of procedural rules governing judicial review of administrative decisions, rather than taking an overly technical approach, so as to best serve justice and allow the parties to have their day in court.\u201d <em>In re McGurran, </em>1999 MT 192, \u00b6 11, 295 Mont. 357, 983 P.2d 968 <em>(overruled on other grounds by Davis v. State, </em>2008 MT 226, \u00b6 23, 344 Mont. 300, 187 P.3d 654) (citing <em>Hilands Golf Club v. Ashmore, </em>277 Mont. 324, 330, 922 P.2d 469, 473 (1996)). The Department was put on notice of the petition when the District Court denied Jacky\u2019s motion, and it appropriately intervened in the case. The Department did not argue that Jacky\u2019s petition should be dismissed for failing to comply with the service requirement, and it suffered no prejudice because of Jacky\u2019s failure to serve. Thus, Jacky\u2019s failure to properly serve the Department does not preclude a District Court review of the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b620 The Dissent complains that the petition \u201cprovides no discernible objection to any finding of fact, conclusion of law or reasoning of the agency.\u201dDissent, \u00b6 24. However, \u00a739-51-2410(6), MCA, provides that \u2018Ti]t shall not be necessary in any judicial proceeding under this section to enter exceptions to the rulings of the board ... .\u201d We will not place Jacky in error for failing to do what the statute excuses her from doing. If the District Court determines on remand that it requires briefing on any issue or question, it will be free to so instruct the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u00b621  The District Court erred when it denied Jacky\u2019s petition for failure to include a supplemental brief. Because this is the dispositive issue, it is unnecessary for us to address the remaining issues of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>whether a district court should dismiss a petition for review without first granting leave to amend and whether a district court may deny a petition for review without first reviewing the administrative record. We reverse and remand to the District Court for a full review of the administrative record in accordance with the provisions of \u00a739-51-2410, MCA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b169-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b169-5\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"A-5\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b622 The Court reverses and remands to the District Court \u2018for a full review of the administrative record.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21. This begs the question, \u201creview for what?\u201d-no cognizable legal issues have been identified, either in the petition for judicial review or in the Court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\u00b623 The Court concludes that the requirement of \u00a7 39-51-2410(2), MCA, for a petitioner to \u201cstate the grounds upon which review is sought\u201d has been satisfied by the petition\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he individuals representing the [listed Defendants] failed to document, process and facilitate the plaintiffs unemployment claim accurately, honestly, fairly or ethically resulting in a gross miscarriage of justice.\u201d It bears noting that this statement is <em>the entirety </em>of the petition\u2019s identification of the grounds upon which relief was sought.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A43\">\u00b624 I disagree with the Court\u2019s determination that this statement satisfies the statutory requirement. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 18. Just how was the claim not processed \u201caccurately, honestly, fairly or ethically?\u201d In what way did the defendants fail to \u201cdocument, process and facilitate\u201d the claim properly? The petition provides no discernible objection to any finding of fact, conclusion of law or reasoning of the agency. The District Court didn\u2019t have a clue as to any legal issue raised, and won\u2019t on remand. As we explained in <em>Arlington v. Miller\u2019s Trucking, Inc., </em>2012 MT 89, 364 Mont. 534, 277 P.3d 1198, courts reviewing wage claim determinations by the Department of Labor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">(a) the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">(i) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>(ii) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">(iii) made upon unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">(iv) affected by other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">(v) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">(vi) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-8\"><em>Arlington, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing 2-4-704(2)(a), MCA). The petition failed to state any of these bases for review, and thus failed to comply with the requirement that the petition \u201cshall state the grounds upon which review is sought.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">\u00b625 The Court is imposing upon the District Court an obligation to expend judicial resources to scour the entire administrative record (\u201ca full review,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21) in search of possible winning legal issues for the petitioner. This violates any number of legal principles, not the least of which is judicial impartiality. As the District Court correctly stated, Tt]he Court cannot serve as counsel for the petitioner.\u201d Further, as we have often stated, the courts do not owe a duty to a party \u201cto conduct legal research on his behalf, to guess as to his precise position, or to develop legal analysis that may lend support to that position.\u201d <em>Johansen v. Dept. of Natural Resources &amp; Conservation, </em>1998 MT 51, \u00b6 24, 288 Mont. 39, 955 P.2d 653; <em>see also State v. Whalen, </em>2013 MT 26, \u00b6 32, 368 Mont. 354, 295 P.3d 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">\u00b626 If the petitioner had been represented by counsel and filed this petition, we would affirm the dismissal for the utter failure to identify a legal issue-in a heartbeat. By reversing to give Jacky another chance, we are improperly granting a <em>pro se </em>litigant latitude \u201cso wide as to prejudice the other party.\u201d <em>Neil Consultants, Inc. v. Lindeman, </em>2006 MT 80, \u00b6 8, 331 Mont. 514, 134 P.3d 43. TI]t is reasonable to expect <em>pro se </em>litigants to adhere to procedural rules.\u201d NeiZ <em>Consultants, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Inc., \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b627 The Court reasons, at times, that the District Court erred by dismissing the case for Jacky\u2019s failure to file a supporting brief. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 11,12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, while mentioning the failure to file a brief, the District Court also dismissed the petition for failing to state a claim, and clearly not on the sole basis of failing to file a brief. This point was expressly clarified in the District Court\u2019s order denying the motion to set aside the judgment, which said nothing about a failure to file of a brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">[T]he <em>threshold issue </em>is whether Jacky has raised any identifiable question of law for the Court\u2019s review. Jacky provided only a conclusory statement .... This statement <em>raises no identifiable question of law </em>for the Court\u2019s review under \u00a7 39-51-2410(5), MCA. Nor did Jacky\u2019s annotations in the margins of the attached documents^which may or may not have been part of the record-raise any identifiable question of law for the Court\u2019s review. As such, <em>Jacky did not \u201cstate the grounds upon which a review is sought\u201d </em>as required under \u00a7 39-51- 2410(2), MCA. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b628 There was no issue for the District Court to decide, and nothing further to do. As it noted, even if it assumed that Jacky was questioning the sufficiency of the evidence, it \u201cwould be just that-an assumption .... [I]t is neither the province nor duty of the Court to guess what a party intends to argue and then to make a determination based on that guess. Questioning the sufficiency of the evidence is one of many possible legal issues ... .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u00b629 The District Court made no error. It could not decide something that was not presented. On remand, it will apparently be required to manufacture something to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u00b630 I would affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b171-9\">JUSTICE McKINNON joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-11\"> The Court interprets the petition as alleging something against \u201cthe Department,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 18, but even that is not necessarily correct. The petition\u2019s allegation is made against \u2018individuals representing\u201d the parties named in the petition, including two private entities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-11\"> In response to this dissent, the Court says the language in \u00a739-51-2410(6), MCA, which eliminates the need to \u201center exceptions\u201d to the Board\u2019s rulings, somehow also excuses the requirement for the petition to state a ground for review. Opinion, \u00b6 20. However, this archaic term, which has been used in this statute since its original enactment in 1937, see Laws of Montana, 1937, ch. 137, \u00a76(i), references the necessity of making a \u2018formal objection to [the Board\u2019s] ruling by a party who wants to preserve the objection for appeal.... In federal courts and most state courts, the term \u2018exception\u2019 has been superseded ... .\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>583 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 7th ed., West 1999) (emphasis added). That meaning is likewise confirmed by the context of the term\u2019s use in this statute, which provides that \u2018ti]t shall not be necessary in anyjudicial proceeding under this section to enter exceptions to the rulings of the [B]oard and no bond shall be required for entering such appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b171-10\"> The Opinion vacillates between the grounds for reversing. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 21 (the failure to permit Jacky to file a supplemental brief\u2018is the dispositive issue\u201d); <em>but see </em>Opinion, \u00b6 18 (the petition was \u201cadequate.... Jacky was not required to provide any discussion or legal authority to support her request.\u201d). The net result of the Opinion is that it was reversible error to not permit Jacky to file a supplemental brief, but it was nonetheless legally unnecessary for her to file one.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
