We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b62 The issue presented on appeal is whether the District Court erred by denying Jackson\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u00b63 On November 18, 2011, Jackson\u2019s girlfriend, Maresa Brauer, ended their relationship. Later that day, officers responded to a report of a disturbance at Brauer\u2019s residence. According to Brauer\u2019s statement to police, Jackson sent her a text that said, \u2018Game on.\u201d He then drove to her house, where she was accompanied by a female friend. Brauer said that Jackson pulled her hair, punched out the passenger side mirror on her car, slashed her car\u2019s tires, and used his truck to push her car toward the house. Brauer\u2019s friend said that Jackson also used his truck to push her van. Jackson then produced a rifle and pointed it at the two women. Brauer ran into the house and her friend hid behind a tree. Both women called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u00b64 Jackson was charged with two counts of felony assault with a weapon and two counts of misdemeanor criminal mischief. He reached a plea agreement with the State, pursuant to which he agreed to plead no contest to one count of felony criminal endangerment in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA. The State agreed to recommend a ten-year suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">\u00b65 At the change of plea hearing, the District Court first established that Jackson was aware of the nature of the allegations, had been given sufficient time to discuss the matter with counsel, and was satisfied with the performance of counsel. Jackson was then sworn and the District Court elicited testimony in support of his plea. Jackson testified that he was entering his plea knowingly and voluntarily. He testified that no improper threats or promises had been made. Upon questioning from his attorney, Jackson testified that on November 18, 2011, there had been an incident between himself and Brauer. Jackson stated that the allegations regarding that incident were contained in the information, affidavit, police report, and witness statements, which had been provided to him for review. He confirmed his intent to plead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>no contest to criminal endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b66 Jackson\u2019s attorney then asked whether, after reviewing the evidence against him, he believed it was likely that he would be convicted. Jackson replied, \u2018Due to my financial standing[,] I believe that to be true.\u201d Jackson\u2019s attorney asked if he wished to take the benefit of the bargain with the State rather than going through a trial, to which Jackson replied, \u20181 just can\u2019t afford to pay.\u201d Jackson\u2019s attorney explained that his services as a public defender were free and that he was prepared to go to trial at no cost. Jackson stated that he understood. He then confirmed that he wanted to \u201cget back to work.\u201d He also hoped to reconcile with Brauer. He testified that he understood his no contest plea would result in a conviction, but that he would not have to make specific admissions of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b67 The State then questioned Jackson, who confirmed that he believed there would be a \u201cgood possibility\u201d of serving prison time rather than receiving a suspended sentence if the matter went to trial. The State asked Jackson, \u2018So that\u2019s what you mean when you say financially, because you want to be able to stay out in the community in order to keep your job?\u201d Jackson replied that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t do much good\u201d in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b68 The District Court took judicial notice of the affidavit filed in support of the information and found that there was a sufficient basis for the plea. The District Court accepted Jackson\u2019s plea of no contest. Prior to sentencing, Jackson moved to withdraw his plea, which the District Court denied. He then received a ten-year suspended sentence in accordance with the State\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">\u00b69 On appeal of the denial of a motion to withdraw plea, this Court reviews findings of underlying fact for clear error and conclusions of law for correctness. <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 24, 327 Mont. 352, 114 P.3d 254. The voluntariness of a plea is a mixed question of law and fact, which this Court reviews de novo. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">\u00b610 Jackson claims that the District Court failed to establish a sufficient factual basis for his no contest plea. He also claims that the District Court did not determine that he believed the plea to be in his best interest. Therefore, he claims that he should be permitted to withdraw his plea, because there is doubt as to whether it was entered voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\u00b611  A plea of <em>nolo contendere, </em>or no contest, may be withdrawn for good cause at any time before judgment or within one year of final judgment. Section 46-16-105(2), MCA. We will apply the same good cause standard to a motion to withdraw a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>as we do to a motion to withdraw a guilty plea. Good cause exists where a plea was entered involuntarily. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 16. An inadequate plea colloquy may be one indication that a plea was involuntary. <em>State v. Frazier, </em>2007 MT 40, \u00b6 10, 336 Mont. 81, 153 P.3d 18 (citing <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2005 MT 234, \u00b6 14, 328 Mont. 397, 121 P.3d 521).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b612 A court may not accept a plea of guilty without determining that there is a factual basis supporting the plea. Section 46-12-212(1), MCA. The court is therefore required to \u201csolicit admissions from a defendant regarding what acts the defendant committed that constitute the offense charged.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>\u00b6 21. If a defendant does not wish to make such admissions, however, he or she may instead enter a plea of no contest. Section 46-12-212(2), MCA. The court may accept a plea of no contest \u2018if the defendant considers the plea to be in [his or her] best interest and the court determines that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d Section 46-12-212(2), MCA. Because a no contest plea exists specifically to allow a defendant to avoid making admissions, the court must look to other sources in order to establish the required factual basis. <em>State v. Locke, </em>2008 MT 423, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 347 Mont. 387, 198 P.3d 316. The information and affidavit may provide the factual basis for a no contest plea. <em>Locke, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b613 The District Court established a sufficient factual basis for the offense of criminal endangerment. Jackson testified that an incident involving Brauer had taken place on November 18, 2011. He testified that the information, affidavit, police report, and witness statements had been provided to him. He testified that he understood the allegations against him. He testified that he believed it was likely he would be convicted if the matter were to proceed to trial. The District Court also reviewed the affidavit offered by the State, which included the statements of Brauer and her friend describing the incident to officers. Brauer stated that Jackson had pulled her hair, broken the mirror on her car, slashed the tires on her car, pushed her car with his truck, and then pointed a rifle at her. Brauer\u2019s friend confirmed the account, adding that Jackson had also pushed her van with his truck. The affidavit also noted that officers had taken photos of the damaged vehicles at the scene and had observed the women to be visibly shaken and distressed. This was sufficient to establish that a factual basis existed to support the charge of criminal endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u00b614 The District Court also adequately determined that Jackson believed the no contest plea to be in his best interest. Jackson testified that he believed that he would likely be convicted if the matter went to trial. He wanted to avoid a trial and possible prison sentence so that he could return to his job and attempt to reconcile with Brauer. He wanted to receive the benefit of the State\u2019s recommendation of a suspended sentence, which he believed he was not likely to receive if he were convicted after a trial. He also understood that he had the option of proceeding to trial with an attorney at no cost. Jackson\u2019s testimony was sufficient to support the conclusion that he believed the plea was in his best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b615 Furthermore, the record supports the conclusion that Jackson\u2019s plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily. He stated that he understood the nature of the allegations against him and had received the advice of counsel. He testified that his plea was voluntary. He understood his plea would result in a conviction. He understood the State\u2019s recommendation and was aware that it was not binding on the District Court. He received the benefit of reduced charges and a suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b616  The District Court did not err by denying Jackson\u2019s motion to withdraw plea. We will not overturn a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea if the defendant was aware of the consequences of the plea, and the plea was made voluntarily. <em>Burns v. State, </em>2012 MT 100, \u00b6 6, 365 Mont. 51, 277 P.3d 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b346-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, MORRIS, McKINNON and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
