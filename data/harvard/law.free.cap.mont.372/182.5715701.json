The sole issue on appeal is whether Wolf Point is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Gourneau\u2019s negligence claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b213-16\">\u00b62 During his senior year at Wolf Point High School in Wolf Point, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Montana, seventeen-year-old Dalton committed suicide in his home. Earlier that fall, Dalton had successfully tried out for the Wolf Point varsity wrestling team. Then, on November 23, 2010, a school counselor observed Dalton \u201cputting a can of chew in his pocket.\u201d Students at Wolf Point High School are prohibited from possessing tobacco at the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b63 Dalton was familiar with Wolf Point\u2019s disciplinary procedures. Dalton\u2019s previous three years at Wolf Point High were characterized by recurrent disciplinary problems, including frequent absences, physical altercations, theft, insubordination, and verbal harassment. Wolf Point disciplined Dalton for these infractions with a variety of warnings and suspensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b64 The Wolf Point High School Parent/Student Handbook provides the school\u2019s policies and procedures for regulating student conduct, including disciplinary provisions. A violation of the prohibition against the \u201cuse or possession of drugs and/or paraphernalia, alcohol, or tobacco\u201d constitutes a \u2018level 3 offense,\u201d which at a minimum results in a suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u00b65 The Wolf Point Wolves Activities handbook provides disciplinary actions for violations of the Athletic Department Training Rules. The Athletic Department\u2019s rules prohibit the purchase, use and possession of tobacco, and also prohibit the possession of \u201cdevices specifically or reasonably associated with alcohol or tobacco or drug use.\u201d The first violation of the tobacco policy results in a sixty-day suspension from all extracurricular activities, including wrestling. Gourneau does not claim that Dalton was unaware of Wolf Point\u2019s disciplinary policies.</p>\n<p id=\"Arm\">\u00b66 Several Wolf Point staff, including Joseph Paine (Wolf Point\u2019s Principal), Henry Hamill (Superintendent), and Mike Erickson (the Athletic Director), met with Dalton and notified him that he would be suspended from wrestling because of his possession of the tobacco can. Paine advised Dalton that even if Hamill would not overturn the 60-day suspension, Dalton could still appeal the suspension to the Wolf Point School Board. Dalton became distraught when he realized his suspension from wrestling could prevent him from participating in the State tournament that year. Dalton left the school and went home. Later that afternoon, Dalton committed suicide while alone in his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u00b67 Gourneau, acting individually and on behalf of her deceased son, filed a complaint in 2011 against Wolf Point, the State of Montana, and Henry Hamill, in his individual capacity and in his official capacity as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>a District Superintendent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gourneau alleged that Dalton\u2019s death was the direct and proximate result of Wolf Point\u2019s negligence. Gourneau\u2019s complaint also alleged other counts related to her negligence claim, including \u201crespondeat superior,\u201d negligent hiring of Henry Hamill, negligent supervision, negligent training, wrongful death and survivorship claims, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The District Court granted summary judgment to Wolf Point on February 27, 2013. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b68 We review de novo an appeal from a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling. <em>Poole v. Poole, </em>2000 MT 117, \u00b6 13, 299 Mont. 435, 1 P.3d 936. We apply the same standard as the district court: summary judgment should be granted when the pleadings, discovery, and affidavits show \u2018that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56. The party seeking summary judgment initially must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. <em>Poole, </em>\u00b6 13. When the moving party has met its burden, the non-moving party must \u201csubmit evidence of sufficient facts to support a genuine issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment in favor of the movant.\u201d <em>Meadow Lake Ests. Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Shoemaker, </em>2008 MT 41, \u00b6 38, 341 Mont. 345, 178 P.3d 81. If we determine that genuine issues of fact do not exist, we must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Poole, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b69 Negligence actions ordinarily involve questions of fact. <em>Poole, </em>\u00b6 14. But if the moving party establishes that any one element of negligence lacks a genuine issue of material fact, and the non-moving party fails to come forward with proof that a genuine issue exists, summary judgment is proper. <em>Poole, </em>\u00b6 14 (quoting <em>Wiley v. City of Glendive, </em>272 Mont. 213, 216, 900 P.2d 310, 312 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b610 Negligence requires a legal duty, breach of that duty, causation, and damages. <em>Krieg v. Massey, </em>239 Mont. 469, 472, 781 P.2d 277, 278-79 (1989) (citing W. L. Prosser &amp; W. P. Keeton, <em>Prosser and Keeton on Torts </em>\u00a730, 164-65 (5th ed. 1984)). Whether a legal duty is owed is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>question of law. <em>Poole, </em>\u00b6 19. The District Court held that Wolf Point did not have a duty to prevent Dalton\u2019s suicide in light of the facts presented by the parties\u2019 submissions. Material facts are identified by looking at the substantive law governing a claim. <em>McGinnis v. Hand, </em>1999 MT 9, \u00b6 6, 293 Mont. 72, 972 P.2d 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b611 Gourneau argues that disputed material facts defeat Wolf Point\u2019s attempt to establish the absence of a special relationship with Dalton, under which it could be held to a duty to prevent Dalton\u2019s suicide. Gourneau argues that fact questions remain regarding whether Dalton actually possessed tobacco, whether Wolf Point generally disciplined its students consistently, whether Wolf Point disciplined Dalton consistently, and whether Wolf Point had knowledge of Dalton\u2019s state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b612  Whether a party owes a legal duty depends largely on whether the allegedly negligent act was foreseeable. <em>Poole, </em>\u00b6 20. \u201cAs it relates to the existence of a legal duty, foreseeability is \u2018measured on a scale of reasonableness dependent upon the foreseeability of the risk involved with the conduct alleged to be negligent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Poole, </em>\u00b6 20 (quoting <em>Lopez v. Great Falls Pre-Release Serv., </em>Inc., 1999 MT 199, \u00b6 27, 295 Mont. 416, 986 P.2d 1081). In other words, duty \u2018is measured by the scope of the risk which negligent conduct foreseeably entails.\u201d <em>Busta v. Columbus Hosp. Corp.,216 </em>Mont. 342, 363, 916 P.2d 122, 134 (1996). The question is whether the defendants reasonably could have foreseen that their conduct could have resulted in injuries to the plaintiff, though \u201cthe specific injury need not be foreseeable.\u201d <em>Hinkle ex rel. Hinkle v. Shepherd Sch. Dist. </em># <em>37, </em>2004 MT 175, \u00b6\u00b6 28-30, 322 Mont. 80, 93 P.3d 1239. Without foreseeability of any danger of direct injury or any risk from an intervening cause, no duty exists; \u2018in the absence of duty, there is no negligence.\u201d <em>Poole, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b613  Generally, a party cannot recover in negligence for the suicide of another \u201csince the act or suicide is considered a deliberate intervening act exonerating the defendant from legal responsibility....\u201d <em>Krieg, </em>239 Mont. at 471, 781 P.2d at 278. Under some circumstances, a duty to prevent a suicide may exist \u201cwhen someone is obligated to exercise custodial care over the eventual decedent, is in a position to know about the latter[\u2019s] suicidal potential, and is lax with respect to taking preventive measures.\u201d <em>Krieg, </em>239 Mont. at 471, 781 P.2d at 278. We noted in <em>Krieg </em>that \u201c[t]hese situations typically involve hospitals or prisons.\u201d <em>Krieg, </em>239 Mont. at 473, 781 P.2d at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\u00b614 Even in a custodial context, we have held that a duty does not arise unless the custodian knows or should know of the suicidal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tendencies of a prisoner. <em>Pretty On Top v. Hardin, </em>182 Mont. 311, 317, 597 P.2d 58, 61-62 (1979). For example, in <em>Pretty On Top, </em>after a prisoner committed suicide, the prisoner\u2019s wife claimed that the prison had a duty to prevent the suicide. <em>Pretty On Top, </em>182 Mont. at 314, 597 P.2d at 60. This Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the prison because the suicide was not foreseeable where the prisoner \u201cdid not have a history of mental disease or emotional disturbances, nor had he attempted suicide previously.\u201d <em>Pretty On Top, </em>182 Mont. at 314, 318, 597 P.2d at 60, 62. This Court held that \u201cthe District Court was required to follow the general rule that suicide is an intentional act and grant defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Pretty On Top, </em>182 Mont. at 318, 597 P.2d at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b615 We held in <em>Kreig </em>that this general rule applies \u201ceven more forcefully\u201d where no custodial or special relationship exists. <em>Krieg, </em>239 Mont. at 472, 781 P.2d at 279. In <em>Krieg, </em>this Court affirmed summary judgment for a landlord when a tenant committed suicide because no duty could be established absent a custodial or special relationship. We also agreed with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that no genuine issues of material fact existed regarding foreseeability because the plaintiff failed to present any evidence that the tenant\u2019s suicidal tendencies were communicated to the landlord. <em>Krieg, </em>239 Mont. at 473, 781 P.2d at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b616 We also upheld summary judgment for a defendant for an unforeseeable suicide in a Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA) case. In <em>Marazzato v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., </em>an employee of Burlington Northern Railroad Company committed suicide after being placed in an \u201cAlternative Work Location,\u201d known as a \u201crubber room\u201d among employees. <em>Marazzato v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., </em>249 Mont. 487, 489, 817 P.2d 672, 673 (1991). The plaintiff presented expert testimony to show that the confinement of an employee to an isolated room where there was no work to be done created a reasonable possibility of harm. <em>Marazzato, </em>249 Mont. at 490-91, 817 P.2d at 674-75. The plaintiff did not present evidence, however, that the railroad knew or should have known that the unsupervised rubber room could have resulted in foreseeable harm to him. We concluded that when a plaintiff fails to provide any proof that a defendant knew or should have known that its conduct created a reasonable possibility of harm, summary judgment is appropriate. <em>Marazzato, </em>249 Mont. at 492, 817 P.2d at 675.</p>\n<p id=\"ArX5\">\u00b617 In the present case, we agree with the District Court that Wolf Point owed no legal duty because Dalton\u2019s suicide was unforeseeable by Wolf Point. In support of its motion for summary judgment, Wolf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Point introduced evidence of Dalton\u2019s well-documented history of disciplinary problems-including instances where Dalton was subjected to arguably more severe punishments than his wrestling suspension. While Dalton attended Wolf Point High, various teachers formally filled out discipline referral forms for his behavior over thirty times. For these offenses, Dalton was disciplined with numerous detentions, parent-teacher conferences, in-school suspensions, and out-of-school suspensions. No evidence suggests that Dalton ever harmed himself, exhibited dangerous behaviors, or threatened suicide, even when subjected to these repeated reprimands. As the non-moving party, Gourneau had the burden of proving by \u201ccompetent evidence,\u201d rather than denial or speculation, that a genuine issue of material fact existed. <em>Bridgman v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., </em>2013 MT 289, \u00b6 20, 372 Mont. 124, 311 P.3d 416. Gourneau did not introduce any evidence indicating that any representative of the school, including Hamill, knew that Dalton presented a potential risk of suicide. Gourneau\u2019s complaint acknowledged that Dalton \u2018had no history of mental health problems or treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b618 In light of the facts in the record, Gourneau\u2019s claim of a special relationship is not supported by the law. Dalton was not subjected to any restraint on his personal liberty that triggered a custodial or special relationship. <em>See Morrow v. Balaski, </em>719 F.3d 160, 170 (3d Cir. 2013) (noting that \u201cevery other Circuit Court of Appeals that has considered this issue in a precedential opinion has rejected the argument that a special relationship generally exists between public schools and their students.\u2019); <em>Patel v. Kent Sch. Dist., </em>648 F.3d 965, 973 (9th Cir. 2011) (\u2018tcjompulsory school attendance is insufficient to invoke the special-relationship exception\u2019). A \u201cspecial relationship arising between a particular school and particular students under certain unique and narrow circumstances ... must be so significant as to forge a different kind of relationship between a student and a school than that which is inherent in the discretion afforded school administrators as part of the school\u2019s traditional <em>in loco parentis </em>authority or compulsory attendance laws.\u201d <em>Morrow, </em>719 F.3d at 171. Wolf Point did not exercise custodial care over Dalton akin to the care of a hospital or a prison. Dalton was not in custody: as the District Court stated in its order granting summary judgment, Dalton\u2019s suicide occurred in his own home \u201capproximately two hours after school had ended that day.\u201d Gourneau did not present evidence sufficient to show the existence of a special relationship that would support a duty to prevent the suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u00b619  Not one of Gourneau\u2019s alleged factual disputes otherwise raises a genuine issue as to foreseeability. The first three of Gourneau\u2019s alleged factual issueswyhether Dalton actually possessed tobacco, whether Wolf Point disciplined students consistently, and whether Wolf Point disciplined Dalton consistently-have no bearing on whether Dalton\u2019s suicide was foreseeable by Wolf Point. Gourneau admitted that Dalton \u201cacknowledged to school personnel that he had possessed chewing tobacco on November 23, 2010.\u201d Even if Gourneau had introduced evidence showing that Dalton\u2019s can of chewing tobacco was empty or that Wolf Point inconsistently disciplined its students, those facts alone still could not prove that Wolf Point reasonably could have foreseen Dalton\u2019s suicide. Gourneau\u2019s other asserted issues of factior example, whether Dalton fully understood Wolf Point\u2019s disciplinary policies or whether news on student suicides was readily available from local media sourcesTail for the same reason. School authorities frequently are called upon to impose sanctions against students violating school policies. Absent evidence demonstrating foreseeability, they cannot be held to a legal duty to predict or prevent in every instance a student\u2019s tragic decision to take his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b620 The sole remaining fact issue, whether Wolf Point had knowledge of Dalton\u2019s state of mind, could-at least in theory-impact the imposition of a duty by affecting foreseeability. The record, however, lacks evidence supporting Gourneau\u2019s assertion. Gourneau points to a response to the following request for admission: \u201cAdmit that Dalton Paige Gourneau never threatened to commit suicide.\u201d Gourneau responded, \u2018Plaintiff cannot either admit or deny this Request. It is believed that Dalton told school aide Carol Wallette on November 23, 2010[,] that he should go home and hang himself.\u201d There was no affidavit or deposition testimony from Wallette or any other person with actual knowledge of any statements Dalton may have made to any school employee or official. While we view the facts in a light most favorable to the party seeking to preclude summary judgment, we will not imagine facts to be in the record when they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b621 It is well settled that a district court may consider only admissible evidence in reviewing a motion for summary judgment. <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe v. Roman Catholic Church, </em>2013 MT 24, \u00b6 21, 368 Mont. 330, 296 P.3d 450; M. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); <em>see also Hiebert v. Cascade Co., </em>2002 MT 233, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 311 Mont. 471, 56 P.3d 848 (affidavits properly stricken when made without personal knowledge and based upon hearsay evidence). Without an affidavit or other competent evidence to support her claim, Gourneau\u2019s assertion is conclusory and \u201cdo[es] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>not raise a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Abraham v. Nelson, </em>2002 MT 94, \u00b6 26, 309 Mont. 366, 46 P.3d 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b622  The only evidence that is in the record concerning Dalton\u2019s state of mind is that he was feeling \u201cpretty low\u201d after talking with school administrators. Dalton\u2019s low emotions are certainly understandable. But suspension from athletic activities following a student\u2019s violation of school policy is an ordinary incident of school administration endemic in the relationship between a school and its students. In the absence of facts that could show the school was on notice of any suicidal tendencies, the record does not substantiate Goumeau\u2019s speculation that Wolf Point reasonably should have known Dalton\u2019s state of mind or that its conduct created a reasonable possibility of harm. We conclude that no genuine issues of material fact exist in this case and that Wolf Point is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b623 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-7\">CHIEF JSUTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\"> Gourneau did not pursue the claims against the State of Montana and did not appeal the summary judgment order in favor of Hamill.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
