We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">\u00b63 <em>Whether McVey was qualified to bring a claim pursuant to \u00a7\u00a733-18-201(4) and -242, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">\u00b64 <em>Whether the District Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of USAA regarding McVey\u2019s claim for damages arising from emotional distress.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b542-15\">\u00b65 McVey was involved in a car accident with Kent Blough (Blough) on July 26, 2007. She was crossing a two-lane bridge over the Yellowstone River south of Livingston, Montana. Blough approached in the opposite direction while pulling a swather behind his pickup. The swather was wider than the lane of travel. McVey collided with the swather\u2019s left side in her lane of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-16\">\u00b66 Montana Highway Patrol Trooper Jason Hoppert (Hoppert) filed a crash investigator\u2019s report. Hoppert determined that the vehicles had' collided in McVey\u2019s lane of travel. McVey suffered severe injuries as a result of the accident, including seven broken ribs, a fractured right wrist, and a fractured left heel. McVey endured surgeries to repair her wrist and heel and underwent extensive post-surgical rehabilitation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Blough reported the accident to McVey\u2019s insurer, USAA, the day after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b67 USAA assigned claims adjuster Danny Theda (Theda) to handle the claim. Theda took a statement from Blough. Blough claimed that he had stopped before crossing the bridge due to his concerns regarding the width of the swather. Theda spoke with McVey on August 1,2007, but she could not remember the details of the accident. Theda never interviewed Hoppert about his crash investigation. Theda interviewed no firefighters and ambulance service personnel who responded to the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b68 USAA received Hoppert\u2019s crash investigation report on September 5, 2007. Despite this information, Theda still concluded that McVey was the majority at fault for the accident. USAA paid Blough\u2019s property damages. At the time, McVey\u2019s USAA policy had coverage that included: property damage, medical payments, and UM/UIM coverage. USAA made auto collision and medical payments to McVey under the policy. USAA refused to honor McVey\u2019s $300,000 UM/UIM coverage once Theda determined that McVey was the majority at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"A4F\">\u00b69 McVey filed suit against Blough in 2009. USAA unsuccessfully tried to intervene in the lawsuit, apparently to prevent McVey from prevailing. Blough\u2019s insurer paid McVey the limit of Blough\u2019s insurance policy. Despite repeated requests, USAA refused to pay McVey any sums available under her UM/UIM coverage of $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"AYM\">\u00b610 USAA\u2019s own expert eventually reviewed accident reconstruction reports prepared by an expert for McVey and an expert for Blough. USAA\u2019s expert determined that Blough, whom USAA had already paid under McVey\u2019s policy, had been the majority at fault. USAA immediately tendered to McVey its $300,000 UM/UIM policy limit.</p>\n<p id=\"ASR\">\u00b611 McVey filed a complaint against USAA stating six claims. She asserted that USAA had breached the insurance contract and had violated sections of the Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA), specifically \u00a7\u00a733-18-201 and -242, MCA. McVey also asserted fraud and common law bad faith claims and sought punitive damages. The District Court dismissed McVey\u2019s breach of contract claim on McVey\u2019s request. The District Court later dismissed McVey\u2019s claims for fraud and common law bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u00b612 McVey retained claims for violation of the UTPA and for punitive damages. McVey filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis that USAA\u2019s investigation had not been reasonable as a matter of law, pursuant to \u00a733-18-201(4), MCA. The District Court denied McVey\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>\u00b613 USAA filed two separate motions for partial summary judgment. The first motion contended that McVey had not been a \u201cclaimant\u201d as required by the UTPA. The second motion sought dismissal of McVey\u2019s claims for damages arising from her alleged emotional distress and increased insurance premiums. The District Court granted both motions filed by USAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b614 The District Court\u2019s grant of USAA\u2019s motions for partial summary judgment resolved all remaining claims. The District Court entered judgment. McVey appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b615 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Bailey v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>2013 MT 119, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 73, 300 P.3d 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u00b616 <em>Whether McVey was qualified to bring a claim pursuant to \u00a7\u00a733-18-201(4) and -242, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">\u00b617 Section 33-18-201(4), MCA, prohibits an insurer from \u201crefusing] to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation based upon all available information.\u201dSection 33-18-242, MCA, provides that \u201c[a]n insured or a third-party claimant has an independent cause of action against an insurer for actual damages\u201d that arise from an insurer\u2019s violation of \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">\u00b618 McVey claims that USAA\u2019s failure to investigate reasonably her UM/UIM claim violated \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA. USAA responds, and the District Court agreed, that \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA, does not apply in this situation because McVey did not qualify as a \u201cclaimant\u201d at the time that Blough had filed the claim in question. USAA argues in the alternative that even if McVey had been a \u201cclaimant,\u201d USAA never refused to pay McVey\u2019s claim as it eventually paid $300,000 for her UM/UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">\u00b619 Both parties focus heavily on whether McVey had been a \u201cclaimant\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 33-18-201(4). MCA. The District Court determined that only a \u201cclaimant\u201dcould invoke \u00a733-18-201(4), MCA, based on our decision in <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. </em>Co., 2008 MT 252, \u00b6 86, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186. We stated in <em>Lorang </em>that \u201cthe UTPA is designed to protect <em>claimants </em>against insurers who would deny a claim without first conducting a reasonable investigation.\u201d <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 86 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\u00b620 Nowhere in \u00a7 33-18-201(4) or -242, MCA, however, does the language limit to \u201cclaimants\u201d those persons protected under the statutes. Section 33-18-201(4), MCA, addresses when an insurer refuses to pay a claim. Nothing in \u00a733-18-201(4), MCA, indicates who has to file the claim for the statute to apply. Section 33-18-242, MCA, refers to the \u2018insured\u201d or a \u201cthird-party claimant\u201d as possessing an independent cause of action for an insurer\u2019s violation of the UTPA. In fact, the \u201cclaimant\u201d to whom the Court referred in <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 86, was an \u2018insured\u201d who filed a claim against her health insurance provider. <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 1. The reference in <em>Lorang </em>to a \u201cclaimant\u201d did not intend to control the scope of the protections provided by \u00a733-18-201(4) and - 242, MCA, or otherwise bar an \u2018insured,\u201d such as McVey, from pursuing a claim pursuant to \u00a733-18-201(4) or -242, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b621  Blough filed a claim with USAA on July 27,2007, the day after the accident. A claim for purposes of \u00a733-18-201(4), MCA, had been filed as of July 27, 2007. The provisions of \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA, applied to USAA\u2019s actions in adjusting the claim from that day forward. The fact that Blough, rather than McVey, had filed the claim on July 27,2007, does not preclude McVey, the insured, from invoking the protections of \u00a733-18-201(4) and -242, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b622 USAA separately maintains that it did not refuse to pay, or unreasonably delay in paying, McVey\u2019s UIM claim. USAA points to the fact that it eventually paid $300,000 to McVey under her policy\u2019s UM/UIM coverage. McVey argues that USAA\u2019s determination on September 12,2007, that McVey had been the majority at fault for the accident constituted a de facto denial of McVey\u2019s UM/UIM coverage. McVey directs us to a report by David E. Bauer (Bauer), an expert witness for USAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u00b623 Bauer noted that McVey \u201cwas not eligible to recover under the UIM coverage of her auto policy\u201d due to USAA\u2019s liability evaluation on September 12, 2007, \u201cthat Linda McVey was more than 50% at fault for the accident.\u201d Bauer reiterated that McVey Vas not \u2018legally entitled to recover\u2019 \u201d due to the terms of her policy. We agree with McVey that USAA\u2019s determination that McVey had been the majority at fault excluded her from eligibility to recover under the UIM coverage portion of her policy. USAA\u2019s determination on September 12, 2007, that she had been the majority at fault rose to the level of a denial of her UM/UIM coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\u00b624  USAA eventually paid McVey the sums available under her UM/UIM coverage, but it waited more than three years after the accident-until September 20104o pay its policy limits. A later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>payment fails to cure an insurer\u2019s prior failure to conduct a reasonable investigation, as required by \u00a733-18-201(4), MCA. <em>See Lorang, </em>\u00b6 149. The Court discussed in <em>Lorang </em>the unintended consequences that would flow from a decision to allow insurers to \u201ccure\u201d an unreasonable investigation by subsequently paying the claim after having denied it. <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 149. The Court recognized that insurers simply could \u2018ignore the UTPA and forego reasonable investigation, or any investigation, until the claimant [took] steps to enforce his or her contractual rights.\u201d <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 149. If the law allowed this \u201ccure,\u201d insurers would \u201cremain immune from liability under \u00a733-18-201 (4), MCA.\u201d <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 149. To allow insurers to \u201ccure\u201d effectively would render this section of the code meaningless. <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b625 USAA\u2019s eventual payment to McVey of the policy limit under her UM/UIM coverage does not shield USAA from potential liability under \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA. USAA effectively denied McVey\u2019s UM/UIM claim on September 12, 2007, when it determined McVey to be the majority at fault. USAA\u2019s eventual payment of the claim proves insufficient to preclude application of \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA. <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b626  Whether USAA actually conducted a reasonable investigation as required by \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA, remains an issue for the trier of fact. We reverse the District Court\u2019s determination that McVey may not pursue a claim based upon USAA\u2019s alleged failure to investigate reasonably her claim as required under \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u00b627 <em>Whether the District Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of USAA regarding McVey\u2019s claim for damages arising from emotional distress.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b628 The District Court determined that McVey had failed to present any evidence that she suffers from emotional distress as a result of USAA\u2019s alleged mishandling of her claim. A court may grant summary judgment if \u201cdiscovery and disclosure materials on file\u201d indicate that no genuine issue of material fact exists, and that the party moving for summary judgment is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). McVey claims emotional distress as an element of damages that resulted from USAA\u2019s alleged violation of the UTPA. A party who raises a parasitic emotional distress claim does not have to demonstrate the heightened standard of proof required for an independent, stand-alone claim of negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress. <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 190; <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 248, \u00b6 66, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u00b629 We clarified in <em>Jacobsen </em>that no heightened standard exists for parasitic emotional distress claims, \u201cand that the severity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>distress affects the amount of damages recovered but not the underlying entitlement to recover.\u201d <em>White v. Longley, </em>2010 MT 254, \u00b6 48, 358 Mont. 268, 244 P.3d 753 (citing <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 66). <em>Jacobsen </em>also cited the damage instructions in the Montana Pattern Jury Instructions 2d 25.02, 15.01-03, for guidance in evaluating a parasitic claim for emotional distress damage. <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 66. The instructions provide that there exists no \u201cdefinite standard by which to calculate compensation for mental and emotional suffering and distress.\u201dMont. Pattern Jury Instr. Civ. 25.02 (2d ed. 2003); <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 65. Therefore, a party who pursues a parasitic claim for emotional distress avoids the heightened evidentiary showing of a stand-alone emotional distress claim. <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 66; <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u00b630 McVey\u2019s parasitic emotional distress claim arises from her UTPA claims. McVey\u2019s deposition testimony provides sufficient evidence of emotional distress to establish that genuine issues of material fact exist. McVey described USAA as a \u2018bunch of crooks\u201d who caused her to have suffered emotional distress damages as a result of how USAA treated her. McVey further testified that \u20181 am suffering mental distress,\u201d but declined to describe it. She only said that she \u2018Tdid not] need counseling for something that [she] know[s] is not [her] fault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-6\">\u00b631 We allowed a claim of emotional distress by the insureds in <em>Lorang </em>to proceed to trial premised on the fact that they were \u201cshocked and sickened at the prospect of having to battle with [their insurer] again to recover replacement socket benefits.\u201d <em>Lorang, </em>\u00b6 193. We subsequently determined in <em>White </em>that the plaintiffs had presented sufficient evidence to support an award of emotional distress damages on their claims of negligence and constructive fraud when they testified to the \u201cstress, anxiety and depression\u201d that they had suffered from dealing with a \u2018house-building fiasco.\u201d <em>White, </em>\u00b6 49. We noted that the plaintiffs had to live apart when the husband \u2018had to abandon retirement and return to California to work again.\u201d <em>White, </em>\u00b6 49. This evidence substantiated the District Court\u2019s determination that \u201cthe Whites suffered greatly as they watched their dream turn into a nightmare.\u201d <em>White, </em>\u00b6 49. McVey can pursue her emotional distress claim if she can present evidence at trial of a similar nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u00b632 A jury ultimately decides facts in a case and the inferences to be drawn from such facts. Sections 26-1-501, -502, MCA. A court should not rely upon an inference for summary judgment purposes if it \u201crequires a speculative leapt.]\u201d <em>Knucklehead Land Co. v. Accutitle, Inc., </em>2007 MT 301, \u00b6 25, 340 Mont. 62, 172 P.3d 116. Additionally, unsupported allegations generally prove insufficient for a plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>withstand summary judgment. <em>Glacier Tennis Club at the Summit, LLC v. Treweek Constr. Co., </em>2004 MT 70, \u00b6 37, 320 Mont. 351, 87 P.3d 431, <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, \u00b6 21, 336 Mont. 105, 152 P.3d 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b633  McVey admittedly failed to support her statement in her deposition that she suffered mental distress by any additional explanation. We need not make a \u201cspeculative leap,\u201d however, if we infer from all of the evidence in the summary judgment record that McVey would experience stress and anxiety during the three-year interval between the accident and USAA\u2019s decision finally to pay her the benefits of her UM/UIM coverage. McVey suffered substantial physical injuries that required multiple surgeries. She nevertheless persisted in her efforts to secure coverage under her UM/UIM policy. Among other matters, she retained an accident reconstruction expert to overcome USAA\u2019s attempt to intervene against her in her suit against Blough. A jury should be allowed to hear McVey\u2019s emotional distress claim and observe her demeanor on the stand. A jury can decide if McVey suffered from emotional distress as a result of her treatment by USAA when it allegedly violated the UTPA. McVey has met the evidentiary standard required in <em>Jacobsen </em>to defeat USAA\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b634 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b548-6\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b548-7\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"AeR\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">\u00b635 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s holding that an insured has standing to enforce the UTPA based solely on the filing of a claim by a third-party claimant. This holding is contrary to basic principles of standing and justiciability. I further dissent from the Court\u2019s holding that USAA is not entitled to summary judgment on McVey\u2019s UTPA cause of action. This holding is based on a mistaken understanding of the timing of McVey\u2019s UIM claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">\u00b636 Following is a timeline of the pertinent events in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">July 26, 2007 - McVey and Blough are involved in an automobile accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\">July 27, 2007 - Blough files a property claim with USAA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\">July to Sept. 2007 - USAA claims adjuster Theda conducts an investigation, including an interview with Blough on August 1, two interviews with McVey on separate days in August, a review of the police report, and an inspection by an independent adjuster. Sept. 12,2007 - Theda concludes that McVey is \u201cmajority at fault.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>USAA pays Blough\u2019s property claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">Sept. 14,2007 - McVey\u2019s attorney notifies USAA that she will sue Blough for damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">Feb. 18, 2008 - USAA receives the report of Blough\u2019s reconstruction expert, which indicates that McVey was at fault.

McVey informs USAA that she settled the litigation with Blough for the policy limits, and she demands payment of her UIM claim. USAA thereafter hires a third expert to evaluate the accident reports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">Sept. 23, 2010 - USAA pays McVey the UIM policy limits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">\u00b637 The Court holds that Blough\u2019s act of filing a third-party claim with USAA gave McVey (the insured) standing to enforce the UTPA. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. But at that time, McVey did not have a pending claim with USAA that required a liability determination or investigation. The only pending claim that triggered USAA\u2019s investigation of the accident was Blough\u2019s claim for property damage, and Blough thus was the only party who could claim any sort of injury if USAA conducted an inadequate investigation. The Court\u2019s conclusion that McVey could file an action under the UTPA premised on USAA\u2019s handling of Blough\u2019s claim lacks any basis in law. To maintain an action, McVey must demonstrate <em>her own </em>injury under the UTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">\u00b638 Under \u00a7\u00a733-18-201(4) and -242(1), MCA, an insured or a third-party claimant has an independent cause of action against an insurer for actual damages caused by the insurer\u2019s refusal to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation. However, it is an elemental principle of justiciability that a plaintiff cannot maintain an action unless she clearly alleges a past, present, or threatened injury to a property or civil right which would be alleviated by successfully maintaining the action. <em>Heffernan v. Missoula City Council, </em>2011 MT 91, \u00b6 33, 360 Mont. 207, 255 P.3d 80. Furthermore, \u201cas a prudential matter,\u201d a plaintiff is generally restricted to asserting her own rights and not those of third parties. <em>Williamson v. Mont. Pub. Serv. Commn., </em>2012 MT 32, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 42, 364 Mont. 128, 272 P.3d 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">\u00b639 McVey\u2019s UIM claim was premised on the assertion that Blough\u2019s motor vehicle had been underinsured. She presented this claim to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>USAA, at the earliest, in February 2009. At that time, her lawsuit against Blough was in its infancy. McVey did not demand payment from USAA under her UIM coverage until May 2010, after settlement of her lawsuit against Blough. I agree with the Court that if USAA had then denied coverage to McVey based solely on its initial, allegedly inadequate investigation of Blough\u2019s claim three years earlier (in the summer of 2007), then McVey would have suffered the requisite \u201cinjury\u201d to establish standing for a lawsuit under the UTPA. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. But that would only be because McVey had, by that point, filed <em>her own </em>claim necessitating an investigation of the accident. The filing of a \u201cclaim\u201d is a prerequisite to the pursuit of a UTPA action <em>by that claimant </em>premised on a violation of \u00a733-18-201(4), MCA. An insured cannot claim injury based solely on how the insurer investigates a claim made by a third party. I accordingly disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion at \u00b6 21 that Blough\u2019s filing of a property claim, by itself, gave McVey grounds to invoke the protections of \u00a733-18-201(4) and -242, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u00b640 Turning now to the specifics of McVey\u2019s UTPA action, the facts do not support the Court\u2019s assertion that USAA denied McVey\u2019s UIM claim based on Theda\u2019s earlier determination in September 2007 that McVey had been majority at fault. Opinion, \u00b6 23. McVey\u2019s UIM coverage provided for the payment of damages that she was legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle. The purpose of UIM coverage \u2018is to provide a source of indemnification when the tortfeasor does not provide adequate indemnification.\u201d <em>Hardy v. Progressive Specialty Ins. </em>Co., 2003 MT 85, \u00b6 21, 315 Mont. 107, 67 P.3d 892. Although McVey filed her UIM claim with USAA in February 2009, she was not eligible for such coverage until it was determined that Blough was at fault <em>and </em>that his insurance coverage was insufficient to compensate McVey for her damages. That was the purpose of McVey\u2019s lawsuit against Blough. From January 2009 to May 2010, she was involved in litigation against Blough to establish which party was at fault. In May 2010, McVey settled her case against Blough for his policy limits and notified USAA of the settlement. At that time, McVey provided USAA with the report of her accident reconstruction expert and asserted her eligibility for UIM coverage. Once USAA received the report of McVey\u2019s expert, USAA investigated and concluded that Blough was at fault. USAA then paid the policy limits of McVey\u2019s UIM coverage in September 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u00b641 McVey has not asserted that USAA neglected to effectuate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of her UIM claim. <em>See </em>\u00a733-18-201(6), MCA. Rather, she has asserted specifically that USAA refused to pay her claim without conducting a reasonable investigation based on all available information. <em>See </em>\u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA. Yet, USAA never refused to pay her claim. Quite the contrary, once McVey settled her lawsuit against Blough and demanded payment under her UIM coverage, USAA conducted an investigation in light of the expert report that McVey had only recently provided, and USAA then paid McVey\u2019s UIM claim. The Court\u2019s suggestion that USAA \u201cwaited more than three years\u201d to pay McVey\u2019s claim, Opinion, \u00b6 24, is simply an incorrect recitation of the facts. (Not only that, it is irrelevant given that McVey has not asserted a claim under \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA.) McVey did not even present her UIM claim until February 2009, and her eligibility for UIM coverage did not arise until she settled the Blough lawsuit in May 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b642 Based on the undisputed facts, USAA is entitled to summary judgment on McVey\u2019s UTPA claim. I would affirm the District Court. I dissent from this Court\u2019s contrary decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
