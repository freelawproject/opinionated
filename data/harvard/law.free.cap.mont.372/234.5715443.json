We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">\u00b62 <em>1.

Whether Ugalde is entitled to a new trial because her counsel provided ineffective assistance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b67 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b68 On the morning of June 11, 2008, Nevada Ugalde placed several urgent phone calls to Susan Napier, the mother of the child she was babysitting. Through tears, Ugalde told Napier that the child, I.N., had fallen from the crib and expressed concern about the way he was acting and breathing.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">\u00b69 Napier did not have a vehicle with her, so she began walking toward Ugalde\u2019s home. Meanwhile, Ugalde called her husband and told him about I.N.\u2019s condition. Ugalde\u2019s husband asked or told her to \u2018Call 911,\u2019\u2019hung up the phone, left his workplace, and began driving home. On the way, he spotted Napier walking on the side of the road and stopped to pick her up. They arrived at the Ugalde home together, approximately thirty minutes after the initial phone call between Ugalde and Napier. Ugalde never called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">\u00b610 Ugalde handed I.N. to Susan at the front door. I.N.\u2019s eyes were nearly closed and he was barely breathing. Ugalde\u2019s husband took Susan and I.N. to the emergency room at the Billings Clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">\u00b611 In the emergency room, Dr. Curtis Lee discovered multiple injuries to I.N.\u2019s head and internal bleeding. Dr. Linda Johnson, a general practice pediatrician, and Dr. Eugen Dolan, a neurosurgeon, were called in to assist with I.N.\u2019s care. Dr. Johnson helped identify and reduce immediate problems with intracranial pressure. Dr. Lee and Dr. Dolan decided to fly I.N. to a children\u2019s hospital in Denver for additional treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">\u00b612 Since the incident, I.N. has undergone extensive physical, speech, and occupational therapy. I.N. suffered hearing loss and visual impairments requiring several surgeries. The State\u2019s professional witnesses believed the injuries were inconsistent with simply falling from a crib to a carpeted floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">\u00b613 Several people involved with I.N.\u2019s treatment reported the incident to law enforcement pursuant to mandatory reporting obligations. On June 29,2009, the State filed an Information charging Ugalde with aggravated assault in violation of \u00a745-5-202, MCA (2007). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The Information alleged that Ugalde purposely or knowingly \u201cshook or slammed\u2019T.N. on June 11,2008, causing serious bodily injury. Ugalde entered a plea of not guilty and received a public defender. Due to a conflict, Ugalde was appointed new counsel on July 2, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b614 Ugalde\u2019s counsel decided she would need to retain a pathologist as an expert. To that end, she consulted with Eric Olsen, coordinator for resource allocations to contract counsel for the Office of the Public Defender [OPD], to comply with the OPD\u2019s internal policy that requires approval for any expenses over $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b615 After voicing concerns about funding, Olsen explained that he was \u201cnot inclined to approve the request\u201d and instead put Ugalde in contact with Dr. Gary Dale, the State Medical Examiner at the State Crime Lab. Ugalde could consult Dr. Dale without charge due to an agreement between the OPD and the State Crime Lab.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b616 Under the impression that her communications would be kept confidential, Ugalde\u2019s counsel spoke with Dr. Dale. Dr. Dale remarked that the State\u2019s identification of Dr. Thomas Bennett as an expert in the case surprised him, in part because he knew the State already was aware of potential problems with using Dr. Bennett in child abuse cases. Dr. Dale recommended Dr. Mary Case as an independent expert for the defense. Dr. Dale never signed a written agreement with the public defender\u2019s office or with Ugalde\u2019s counsel. Nor apparently did he discuss with defense counsel any agreement to maintain confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b617 After concluding that his involvement with Ugalde was \u201cterminated,\u201d Dr. Dale telephoned Dennis Paxinos, the Yellowstone County Attorney, and discussed what he perceived as problems with the use of Dr. Bennett as an expert in this case. Dr. Dale warned against using Dr. Bennett as a witness, though he indicated that he agreed with Dr. Bennett\u2019s conclusion that the injuries were inconsistent with an accidental cause. Paxinos later related the information obtained from Dr. Dale to the prosecutor handling the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b618 On November 25, 2009, Ugalde filed a motion to dismiss the charge for alleged violations of confidentiality and due process. Ugalde argued that by revealing defense information and strategy to Paxinos, Dr. Dale violated a duty to keep his consultation with Ugalde\u2019s counsel confidential. In addition, Ugalde\u2019s motion alleged interference with the attorney-client relationship in violation of the Sixth Amendment and a violation of the right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">\u00b619 The District Court denied the motion to dismiss on March 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>2010, concluding that Dr. Dale owed the defense no duty of confidentiality and that the proper remedy in any event would be disqualification of the witness-not dismissal of the Information. The court rejected Ugalde\u2019s due process violation and Sixth Amendment arguments. Finally, the court concluded that these facts did not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b620 Trial commenced on April 19, 2010, and lasted five days. The State listed twenty-two anticipated witnesses in its trial brief and called eighteen witnesses at trial. One witness for the State, Dr. Smith, was added fourteen days before the trial began.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b621 On the first day of trial, Ugalde objected to the State\u2019s plan to call more than ten witnesses, especially the wide range of experts called to establish the element of serious bodily injury. Ugalde\u2019s counsel argued that the parade of witnesses was unnecessary, cumulative, and could serve only to generate hostility toward Ugalde and sympathy for the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b622 In response, the court asked if Ugalde would stipulate to the element of serious bodily injury and thereby remove the State\u2019s obligation to prove that required element of the offense. Ugalde\u2019s counsel indicated that she was not comfortable stipulating to serious bodily injury. The court stated, \u2018Then I think the State has to prove it.\u201d The court overruled each of Ugalde\u2019s many subsequent objections to cumulative testimony throughout the trial. In total, the State called approximately eleven witnesses over the next three-and-a-half days to testify to various aspects of the injuries to I.N.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b623 The theory of the defense was that I.N. fell from the crib at Ugalde\u2019s home. Ugalde called two expert witnesses: Dr. Kenneth Monson, a biomechanical engineer, who testified that the injuries could have been caused by a short accidental fall, and Dr. John Plunkett, a pathologist, who explained that a short fall could cause this constellation of injuries. Dr. Plunkett also testified about a growing skepticism to shaken baby syndrome in certain sections of the medical community-particularly biomechanical engineers and, increasingly, pathologists. Lisa Justis, a social worker, testified about I.N.\u2019s ability to pull himself up to a position where falling from the crib was possible, and Ugalde also testified on her own behalf. In its closing argument, defense counsel emphasized that, despite the surfeit of expert witnesses, the State could not eliminate the possibility of an accidental cause of the injuries beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\u00b624 On April 23, 2010, a unanimous jury found Ugalde guilty of aggravated assault. The District Court sentenced her to twenty years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>with five suspended, and ordered her to pay $1,331,636.65 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b625 Following the trial, Ugalde filed a motion for a new trial or dismissal based on Dr. Dale\u2019s disclosure of confidential information to Paxinos, cumulative evidence, the presentation of evidence previously ruled improper, and improper closing argument. The District Court denied the motion. Ugalde appeals her conviction and the court\u2019s denial of her motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b626 We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial. <em>State v. Thorp, </em>2010 MT 92, \u00b6 39, 356 Mont. 150, 231 P.3d 1096 (2010) (citing <em>State v. Makarchuk, </em>2009 MT 82, \u00b6 14, 349 Mont. 507, 204 P.3d 1213).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b627 This Court generally will \u201cnot address issues of prosecutorial misconduct pertaining to a prosecutor\u2019s statements not objected to at trial.\u201d <em>State v. Aker, </em>2013 MT 253, \u00b6 21, 371 Mont. 491, 310 P.3d 506 <em>(citing State v. Longfellow, </em>2008 MT 343, \u00b6 24, 346 Mont. 286, 194 P.3d 694). \u2018We may review such an issue, however, under the plain error doctrine.\u201d <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>State v. Lacey, </em>2012 MT 52, \u00b6 14, 364 Mont. 291, 272 P.3d 1288). The decision to invoke plain error review is discretionary. <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u00b628 \u201cOnly record-based ineffective assistance of counsel claims are considered on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>State v. Howard, </em>2011 MT 246, \u00b6 18, 362 Mont. 196, 265 P.3d 606). \u2018To the extent such claims are reviewable, \u2018they present mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 22 (quoting <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">\u00b629 <em>1. Whether the District Court should have dismissed the charges against Ugalde when, after Ugalde disclosed information and defense strategies to the State Medical Examiner, communication occurred between the Medical Examiner and the Yellowstone County </em>Attorney. \u00b630 On appeal, Ugalde argues her client confidentiality, work product privileges, and due process rights were violated when Dr. Dale, the State Medical Examiner, disclosed information obtained from a confidential consultation with defense counsel to Dennis Paxinos, the Yellowstone County Attorney. She also argues that Paxinos engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by communicating with Dr. Dale and relaying the information to the State\u2019s prosecuting attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">A. <em>Client Confidentiality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u00b631  The District Court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the conduct of Dr. Dale and Paxinos did not entitle Ugalde to dismissal of the information or a new trial. \u2018Because it is a drastic step, dismissing an indictment is a disfavored remedy.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Rogers, </em>751 F.2d 1074, 1076 (9th Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b632  A defendant\u2019s \u201caccess to expert assistance is a crucial element in assuring a defendant\u2019s right to effective legal assistance, and ultimately, a fair trial.\u201d <em>Hutchinson v. People, </em>742 P.2d 875, 881 (Colo. 1987). The confidentiality of experts \u2018is a crucial element in the effective legal representation of a defendant.\u201d <em>Hutchinson, </em>742 P.2d at 882. The District Court correctly recognized, however, that when this duty of confidentiality is breached, the proper remedy is to disqualify the expert. <em>In re Mitchell, </em>981 P.2d 172, 175 (Colo. 1999) (citing <em>Wang Laboratories, Inc. v. Toshiba Corp., </em>762 F. Supp. 1246 (E.D. Va. 1991), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds); see Rogers, </em>751 F.2d at 1079 (\u2018If, in fact, Miller revealed a confidential communication in violation of his ethical obligations as an attorney, suppression of that evidence at trial is the appropriate remedy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b633 In <em>Hutchinson, </em>the Colorado Supreme Court reversed a conviction on the ground that the prosecution should not have been permitted to call a defense-retained handwriting expert in its case-in-chief. <em>Hutchinson, </em>742 P.2d at 876. Unlike in <em>Hutchinson, </em>the expert at issue here, Dr. Dale, was never called to the stand and offered no testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"A2B\">\u00b634 In Ugalde\u2019s brief in support of her motion to dismiss, she argued that if the test for a breach of confidentiality by a non-attorney expert is met, \u201cdisqualification of the expert is compelled.\u201d Her brief further noted that \u2018It]he policy of excluding an expert who has received this type of information is due to the fact that it is difficult to determine conclusively what impact such information may have on the expert\u2019s analysis or subsequent testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b635 Ugalde argues on appeal that the alleged breach of confidentiality here warrants a new trial or dismissal of the action. Her brief points out that, \u2018Tb]ecause Dr. Dale is not a retained expert for the prosecution in this matter, exclusion is not a remedy for his actions.\u201d But, as the District Court recognized, this does not mean that dismissal is appropriate. <em>See U.S. v. Morrison, </em>449 U.S. 361, 364-65, 101 S. Ct. 665, 668 (1981) (\u201c[A]bsent demonstrable prejudice, or substantial threat thereof, dismissal of the indictment is plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>inappropriate, even though the violation may have been deliberate.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To the contrary, the fact that Dr. Dale was not called as a witness means that the type of harm against which exclusion is meant to protect never occurred here in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b636  \u2018The trial court has discretion to grant a criminal defendant a new trial but may do so only if required in the interests of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Billedeaux, </em>2001 MT 9, \u00b6 23, 304 Mont. 89, 18 P.3d 990; \u00a746-16-702(1), MCA. The court\u2019s decision to deny a new trial must be justified by the law and the weight of the evidence. <em>Billedeaux, </em>\u00b6 23; \u00a7 46-16-702(3), MCA. Ugalde relied on an unspoken-and ultimately misguided-assumption that her communications with Dr. Dale were confidential. The record shows that the prosecution already knew of the problems surrounding Dr. Bennett. Dr. Dale sent a letter on December 9, 2005-a considerable time before this case was filed4nforming the Montana County Coroners and County Attorneys of Dr. Bennett\u2019s problematic history. Ugalde was not affected by Dr. Dale\u2019s disclosure of his ultimate opinion that Ugalde intentionally harmed I.N. because this opinion never reached the jury. Thus, we agree with the District Court that the evidence presented here does not warrant dismissal of the information or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\n<em>B. Work-Product Privilege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b637 Ugalde argues that \u2018[Dr.] Dale\u2019s disclosures violated work-product privilege, resulting in unfair and irremediable prejudice to her case.\u201d The work-product doctrine protects against the disclosure of \u2018the mental processes of an attorney, providing a privileged area within which [the attorney] can analyze and prepare [a] client\u2019s <em>case.\u201d State v. Miller, </em>231 Mont. 497, 513, 757 P.2d 1275, 1285 (1988) (citing <em>U.S. v. Nobles, </em>422 U.S. 225, 238, 95 S. Ct. 2160, 2170 (1975)). \u2018The reality of our legal system demands that the embraces of the protection also extend to agents of the attorney.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>231 Mont. at 513, 757 P.2d 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b638 Here, it is uncertain to what extent, if any, work product was disclosed. The disclosure of Dr. Dale\u2019s ultimate opinion regarding causation is irrelevant because he never testified. Even if he had, his opinion necessarily would have been disclosed to the State prior to his taking the stand. <em>State v. Anderson, </em>211 Mont. 272, 280, 686 P.2d 193, 98 (1984) (citing <em>State v. Hardy, </em>235 S.E.2d 828, 841 (N.C. 1977) (\u2018The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>privilege is certainly waived when the defendant or the State seeks at trial to make a testimonial use of the work product.\u201d)). Ugalde\u2019s intention to impeach Dr. Bennett qualifies as work product but it is unclear whether this intention was disclosed to Paxinos. It appears as though Dr. Dale only discussed the problems with calling Dr. Bennett as a witness generally, consistent with his previous letter. In essence, Ugalde argues that she was prejudiced by the disclosure of facts already known to all parties, and the fact that she was denied the chance to impeach an expert who never testified. \u2018The burden to demonstrate an abuse of discretion is on the party seeking reversal of an unfavorable ruling.\u201d <em>State v. Criswell, </em>2013 MT 177, \u00b6 42, 370 Mont. 511, 305 P.3d 760. Ugalde has not carried her burden of demonstrating that these facts warrant dismissal of the information or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">C. <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b639 Ugalde alleges general due process violations resulting from Dr. Dale\u2019s disclosure of information to Paxinos pertaining to Dr. Bennett. \u201cA district court may dismiss an indictment where the government\u2019s investigatory or prosecutorial conduct violates a defendant\u2019s due process rights.\u201d <em>U.S. v. King, </em>200 F.3d 1207, 1213 (9th Cir. 1999) (citing <em>U.S. v. Barrera-Moreno, </em>951 F.2d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir. 1991)). \u2018To violate due process, government conduct must be \u2018so grossly shocking and so outrageous as to violate the universal sense of justice.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019King, </em>200 F.3d at 1213 (quoting <em>U.S. v. Restrego, </em>930 F.2d 705, 712 (9th Cir. 1991)). When the government\u2019s investigatory or prosecutorial conduct has violated a defendant\u2019s right to due process, it is within the district court\u2019s discretion to dismiss an indictment. <em>King, </em>200 F.3d. at 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b640 While the communications between Dr. Dale and Paxinos constitute government action, Ugalde does not explain how a due process violation exists when a defendant cannot impeach an expert witness who offers no evidence. Dr. Bennett was contacted regarding this case at a relatively early stage. The State used his professional opinion in the affidavit and motion for leave to file the Information. It may be, given the State\u2019s awareness of potential issues with Dr. Bennett testifying, that he was included simply to consult regarding other experts. Ugalde\u2019s protestation that this is a \u201cclose case\u201d is unconvincing. Even if Ugalde had impeached Dr. Bennett regarding his expert opinion that the injuries were not accidental, the harm to the State\u2019s case was minimal because Dr. Bennett\u2019s opinion was shared by four other medical doctors who testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b641 The District Court determined that the government conduct was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>not so outrageous or shocking as to infringe Ugalde\u2019s due process rights and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\n<em>D. Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b642 Ugalde argues that the District Court failed to consider \u201cthe prosecutorial misconduct implicit in Dennis Paxinos[\u2019s] actions.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Ugalde argues that Paxinos had \u201can absolute obligation to end the conversation and advise Dale of the doctor\u2019s obligation to keep the consultation with defense counsel confidential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b643 A new trial may be granted \u201cwhere the prosecutor\u2019s actions have deprived [a] defendant of a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>State v. Gray, </em>207 Mont. 261, 266-67, 673 P.2d 1262, 1265-66 (1983) (citations omitted). This Court \u201cmeasures prosecutorial misconduct by reference to established norms of professional conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Passmore, </em>2010 MT 34, \u00b6 48, 355 Mont. 187, 225 P.3d 1229 (2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u00b644 In <em>Passmore, </em>the Court noted that the defendant \u201ccited no cases or professional standards\u201d that supported his argument, and did not establish prejudice since the defendant was not tried under a problematic Information. <em>Passmore, </em>\u00b6 48. Ugalde likewise cites no comparable cases or standards and fails to establish prejudice. Paxinos knew very little about the case when called by Dr. Dale. Paxinos merely facilitated the transfer of information that was either irrelevant or already possessed by the State. The record does not show that Paxinos sought an unfair advantage or that he obtained one. While we do not endorse the communications that occurred in this case, we conclude that they did not deprive Ugalde of due process. The District Court did not err in denying Ugalde\u2019s motions for dismissal or a new trial on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u00b645 <em>2. Whether Ugalde is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the State\u2019s witnesses were not unnecessarily cumulative or unfairly prejudicial to Ugalde.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">\u00b646 Ugalde argues that the sheer quantity of the State\u2019s witnesses was unnecessary and unfairly prejudiced the jury against her. Specifically, she claims the State called an excessive number of expert witnesses to prove the element of serious bodily injury, contending that \u201c[a]ny of these witnesses would have been sufficient to establish that I.N. suffered serious bodily injury.\u201d The District Court disagreed, determining that the State\u2019s medical witnesses provided relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>information to the jury without needlessly presenting cumulative evidence. The court observed that each witness testified within his or her own medical specialty and held that although there may have been some overlapping testimony, the evidence was \u2018hot nearly as \u2018cumulative\u2019 as the defendant claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b647 \u201cRelevant evidence is generally admissible.\u201d <em>State v.

The prosecution was not merely required to prove that serious bodily injury occurred, but also that Ugalde caused the injuries. The court instructed the jury that the State was required to prove serious bodily injury and causation as elements of the crime. Ugalde argues that the State called only two witnesses to testify regarding causation. Yet even the experts who only testified on the nature and extent of the injuries played a role in proving whether I.N.\u2019s injuries were caused by an accidental fall from a crib or intentionally by some other means. Because Ugalde was the only other person present when I.N. was injured and she presented expert testimony to support her claim that he had fallen from his crib, the prosecution was required to present evidence of the nature and seriousness of the injuries to show that they could not have been sustained from a fall. Thorough review of the record reveals that it is often impossible to separate which evidence went to the causation element and which went to the serious bodily injury element; the extent of the injuries was a factor for the jury to consider in determining both seriousness and causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b649 The District Court reviewed the evidence and properly determined that the State did not parade ten doctors before the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>to testify to the exact same point or offer irrelevant evidence. Ugalde made several objections at trial-some of which were sustained-that the State\u2019s experts were being asked to testify beyond their expertise. Ugalde would have the State walk a tightrope between presenting prejudicially cumulative evidence and failing to call the correct experts to sufficiently explain these complicated medical issues. .While the State must stay within the bounds of the Rules of Evidence, the path is nowhere near as narrow as the defense suggests here.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b650  The District Court determined that this complicated case required the testimony of the different experts and treatment providers to fully explain the cause and extent of the injuries to the jury.

If victim impact evidence is introduced that is \u201cso unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for relief.\u201d <em>Payne, </em>501 U.S. at 825, 111 S.

In <em>Copple, </em>the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that some victim impact evidence was relevant to the issue of intent and therefore admissible, while other evidence regarding the amount of the victim\u2019s losses was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial since the impact of the losses was not at issue in the case. <em>Copple, </em>24 F.3d at 544-45.</p>\n<p id=\"AMJ\">\u00b654  On appeal, Ugalde offers no specific testimony as an example of improper victim impact evidence. We find nothing here akin to the statement in <em>Armstrong. </em>Also, as the District Court observed, the evidence presented here bears \u201clittle resemblance\u201d to the evidence in <em>Copple. </em>Here, the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses was relevant to proving mental state, causation, and serious bodily injury. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the State\u2019s evidence was not so prejudicial as to render the trial fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>\u00b655 <em>4. Whether Ugalde is entitled to a new trial on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b656 The prosecutor began her closing argument with a first-person narrative from the perspective of the infant, relating the State\u2019s view of what happened as though I.N. was testifying on his own behalf. During rebuttal, the prosecutor then told jurors that the infant was \u201cspeaking to you\u201d and asked the jurors to \u201ctell [I.N.] that you heard him and that you find the Defendant guilty.\u201d Ugalde did not object to the State\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b657 Ugalde argues on appeal that the State\u2019s closing and rebuttal arguments were improper because certain statements constituted a \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument. Ugalde explains that a \u201cgolden rule\u201dargument is one in which jurors \u201care asked to put themselves in a party\u2019s place,\u201d citing to <em>State v. Long, </em>975 A.2d 660 (Conn. 2009). Ugalde argues that such arguments are improper because they \u201cappeal to base, visceral emotion, without regard for evidence or proof of guilt.\u201d <em>See Clausell v.

The evidence, Defendant\u2019s actions, Defendant\u2019s admissions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clausell, </em>\u00b6 17. Similarly, the District Court determined the prosecutor\u2019s argument in this case urged the jury to follow the trail of evidence and find Ugalde guilty.

Although <em>the Rodriguez </em>court noted a split of authority on the issue, it observed that speaking for a victim does not necessarily result in error. <em>Rodriguez, </em>581 F.3d at 803 (citing <em>Sanchez v.

Even those cases cited as contrary authority did not conclude that \u201cspeaking for\u201d the victim alone required reversal of a conviction. <em>E.g. U.S. v.

The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision <em>in Drayden v. White, </em>232 F.3d 704 (9th Cir. 2000), is similar. In that case, the court held that the defendant\u2019s trial was not rendered \u2018fundamentally unfair\u201dby the prosecutor\u2019s improper delivery during his closing argument-from the witness chair-ef a lengthy soliloquy purporting to tell the story of the homicide victim. Among other things, the court noted that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s statements were supported by the evidence and reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. In other words; had the prosecutor delivered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>exactly the same speech in the third person, it would have been proper.\u201d <em>Drayden, </em>232 F.3d at 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b662 Although the prosecutor in this case purported to speak for the victim, she then asked the jury to consider the witnesses\u2019 testimony carefully because \u201c[I.N.] can\u2019t tell you what happened on June 11th of 2008.\u201d The State did not expressly invite the jury to put itself in the shoes of the victim. Considering the State\u2019s closing argument in its entirety, we observe that the argument following the challenged comments directed the jury to the evidence and its relationship to the elements of the offense. <em>Makarchuk, </em>\u00b6 24 (\u2018We consider alleged improper statements during closing argument in the context of the entire argument.\u201d). While we do not decide whether the prosecution\u2019s argument was objectionable, we conclude after a review of the record and the District Court\u2019s careful consideration of the issue that4n the context of the surrounding statementsJt did not rise to the level of plain error. The Dissent\u2019s strong statement that prosecutors are suffering no \u201cactual consequences\u201d of \u201cviolating] ethical rules\u201d by committing misconduct during argument (Dissent, \u00b6 118) overlooks its earlier recognition that this Court has not yet decided whether a first-person narrative constitutes misconduct (Dissent, \u00b6 105). We decline to overturn the jury\u2019s verdict on the basis of an argument that was not made at trial and that has not been held to be grounds for a new trial by this Court or by other courts to have considered the issue under similar circumstances. Ugalde waived her right to raise this claim on appeal by failing to object to the State\u2019s closing arguments during trial.

She further argues that defense counsel\u2019s failure to ensure the confidentiality of an expert witness, to object to late disclosure of a new expert by the prosecution, to stipulate to serious bodily injury, to object to victim impact testimony, and to timely object to the prosecution\u2019s closing arguments constitutes ineffective assistance and denied her a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b665 A defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and by Article II, \u00a7 24 of the Montana Constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>\u2018Before reaching the merits of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a direct appeal, we \u2018must first determine whether the allegations are properly before the Court on appeal or whether the claim should be raised in a petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to \u00a746-21-101, MCA.\u201d <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 34 (quoting <em>State v.

Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). Under <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant bears the burden of proving: \u2018(1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Whitlow v.

Inherent Conflict of Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b668 Ugalde argues that defense counsel was \u201cunable to effectively represent [her] due to the inherent conflict arising from the centralized nature of the Office of the Public Defender ....\u2019\u2019She points specifically to the contract coordinator\u2019s ties to the OPD and the requirement that the OPD approve expenditures over $200 by contract defense attorneys. To support her position, she offers a 2009 study conducted by the American University Criminal Courts Technical Assistance Project, suggesting that structural issues with the OPD\u2019s contract coordinator position allow undue influence over contract counsel by the OPD. These allegations properly are before the Court on appeal and this issue may be addressed directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b669 A lawyer is obligated to maintain professional independence. \u201cA lawyer shall not permit a person who recommends, employs or pays the lawyer to render legal services for another to direct or regulate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>lawyer\u2019s professional judgment in rendering such legal services.\u201dM. R. Prof. Conduct 5.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b670 Sufficient prejudice under Strickland\u2019s second prong requires that the defendant \u201cdemonstrate that a reasonable possibility exists that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional error, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Hammer, </em>\u00b6 11. A cursory look at this issue is enough to determine that Ugalde was insufficiently prejudiced to warrant reversal. Ugalde\u2019s counsel was required to obtain approval for expenditures and the contract coordinator shelved a preliminary request for a specific pathologist pending consultation with Dr. Dale. After consulting with Dr. Dale, however, defense counsel never renewed the request for the pathologist and instead requested another doctor. This second request was approved. In addition, two out-of-state expert witnesses testified for the defense, and Ugalde was represented by two attorneys at trial. Ugalde has not shown that any of her requests for resources was not provided; she has shown only that one request was not renewed because her counsel chose another expert. No one has argued that responsibility for this choice rested on anyone other than defense counsel; indeed, we will not assume that, when a lawyer is required to request approval or consult with an expert, that she automatically abandons her own professional judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b671 Ugalde\u2019s claim that her \u201cchoice of an expert witness was frustrated\u201d is thus without merit and therefore the larger issues that she argues are implicated by the 2009 study will not be addressed at this time. Because the OPD approved Uglade\u2019s ultimate choices for expert witnesses, she has not shown prejudice from a conflict of financial interest between the OPD and contract counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\n<em>B. Failure to Ensure Confidentiality of a Witness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b672 Ugalde claims that she received ineffective assistance of counsel when defense counsel failed to \u201cexplicitly and independently ensure confidentiality before disclosing critical case strategy ....\u2019\u2019Ugalde adds to this claim that defense counsel\u2019s failure to raise the Yellowstone County Attorney\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct before the District Court also was ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b673 Having determined above that the disclosures by Dr. Dale to Paxinos were insufficient to affect the outcome of the case, we now hold based on the same reasoning that Ugalde cannot demonstrate a reasonable possibility that, but for counsel\u2019s error, the result of the proceeding would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\n<em>C. Failure to Object to the Late Disclosure of Dr. Smith</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u00b674 Ugalde argues that \u201ccompetent counsel would have objected\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the State\u2019s disclosure of a new expert witness \u201ca mere fourteen days before trial.\u201dThis issue was not raised until Ugalde\u2019s post-trial motion, but the record is sufficient to address the issue directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b675 Under the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>deficient performance is performance that \u2018[falls] below an obj ective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20. The burden of proving deficient performance is on the defendant. <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 22. When \u201cscrutinizing counsel\u2019s actions, we are highly deferential, indulging a \u2018strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 22 (quoting <em>Kills On Top, </em>273 Mont. at 49, 901 P.2d at 1380). In <em>Howard, </em>this Court determined that the defendant did not meet his burden to show deficient performance for failure to ascertain whether two child witnesses were competent to testify after noting that the defense\u2019s cross-examination was thorough and that an investigator was employed during discovery to take the witness\u2019s <em>statements.Howard, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b676 Ugalde fails to identify how additional time to prepare would have aided the defense. The fact that defense counsel did not object to the timing of Dr. Smith\u2019s disclosure suggests that the defense did not perceive the disclosure to be harmful at the time. Similar to <em>Howard, </em>defense counsel took advantage of the opportunity to interview Dr. Smith before trial. Likewise, the defense was able to thoroughly cross-examine him regarding complicated medical issues and even called an expert who directly addressed and rebutted many of Dr. Smith\u2019s opinions. The record does not support Ugalde\u2019s claim of deficient performance by counsel here.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\n<em>D. Failure to Stipulate to Serious Bodily Injury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A12\">\u00b677 Ugalde claims that defense counsel\u2019s discomfort to stipulating was \u201cunpardonable\u201d and describes the failure to stipulate to the element of serious bodily injury as the \u201cmost serious oversight\u201d by defense counsel. Yet, to come to this conclusion, Ugalde assumes that the District Court radically would have restricted the State\u2019s expert testimony if defense counsel had stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b678 This assumption is insufficient to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel. While the trial court may have limited some testimony where it could determine that the testimony only went to the element of serious bodily injury, as discussed above, proving causation in this case required analysis of I.N.\u2019s injuries. Therefore the State still may have needed to call many of the same witnesses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>testify about the nature of the injuries. Ugalde\u2019s argument to the contrary is speculative. Ugalde \u2018bears the burden to show that [her] counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>State v. St. Germain, </em>2007 MT 28, \u00b6 33, 336 Mont. 17, 153 P.3d 591. <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>first prong \u201ccarries a strong presumption in favor of the State, as counsel is allowed wide latitude in deciding what tactics [counsel] should, and should not, employ in defending [a] client.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 11. The record shows only that defense counsel was \u2018hot comfortable\u201d stipulating to an element of the crime; putting the State to its burden of proof was not deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\n<em>E. Failure to Object to Victim Impact Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b679 Ugalde argues that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to victim impact testimony, when \u201ctaken in conjunction with the other errors by defense counsel,\u201d constitutes a failure to provide effective representation. She concedes, however, that \u201cit is not certain such objections would have been sustained, and it is less certain they would have changed the outcome <em>....\u2019\u2019We </em>already have pointed out above that Ugalde offers no specific statements as examples of victim impact evidence. We also have determined that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the State\u2019s evidence was not sufficiently prejudicial to render the trial fundamentally unfair. We therefore conclude that Ugalde has failed to prove prejudice sufficient to meet the requirements of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>second prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\n<em>F. Failure to Object to Improper Closing Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u00b680 Ugalde claims that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the State\u2019s closing argument, during which the State spoke from the perspective of the injured child, constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. The State\u2019s closing argument began with several brief, but undeniably emotional statements. The prosecutor-while pretending to be I.N.-said, \u2018Now, I can\u2019t hang out with kids my own age because I can\u2019t say what I want or do what I need. I can\u2019t tell my mom I love her. I can\u2019t say what I want or do what I need because at age two-and-a-half I can only say three words.\u201d Next, the State communicated that, while I.N. personally was unable to testify, the jury had \u2018heard from numerous witnesses about what happened to [I.N.] on that day.\u201d The State then proceeded to carefully and properly discuss the evidence introduced by each witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\u00b681 During its own closing, the defense deftly focused on the State\u2019s difficulty in eliminating the possibility of an accidental cause. The defense observed that the State\u2019s experts could not completely rule out non-accidental trauma, and also that the State did not rebut evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>that I.N. was capable of pulling himself up and over the low-placed bars of the crib. The defense conceded that the injuries were \u2018horrible and tragic\u201d and entreated the jury to conclude that \u201c[w]hat happened in this case was a horrible accident, not a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b682 \u201cIn scrutinizing counsel\u2019s actions, we are highly deferential, indulging a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 22 (citation omitted). \u2018Because many lawyers refrain from objecting during ... closing argument, absent egregious misstatements, the failure to object during closing argument... is within the \u2018wide range\u2019 of permissible professional legal conduct.\u201d <em>Kills On Top, </em>273 Mont. at 50-51, 901 P.2d at 1380 (quoting <em>U.S. v. Necoechea, </em>986 F.2d 1273, 1281 (9th Cir. 1993) (citation omitted). \u2018This Court has determined ... that failure to object does not qualify as unreasonable conduct by trial counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Lacey, </em>2012 MT 52, \u00b6 28, 364 Mont. 291, 272 P.3d 1288 (citing <em>Clausell, </em>\u00b6 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b683  In <em>Kills On Top, </em>this Court held that the appellant\u2019s trial counsel was \u2018hot deficient in failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument\u201d when the prosecutor portrayed himself as the victim. <em>Kills On Top, </em>273 Mont. at 50, 901 P.2d at 1380. Similarly-in light of the evidence presented in this case and considering the State\u2019s closing argument as a wholew/e conclude that defense counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional conduct. Ugalde has not met her burden of demonstrating deficient performance as required by Strickland\u2019s first prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\n<em>G. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u00b684 In summary, we determine that all of Ugalde\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims are reviewable on direct appeal. Having reviewed those claims de novo, we conclude that Ugalde has not met the <em>Strickland </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">\u00b685 Finding no error in the District Court\u2019s trial or post-trial rulings, the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b283-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\"> There is nothing in the record here to suggest that there was a deliberate violation of any confidentiality agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\"> We limit our analysis to Yellowstone County Attorney Paxinos\u2019s conduct, since Ugalde conceded in a brief that \u2018the specific prosecutor in this matter obviously has clean hands ....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b283-11\">JUSTICE MCKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"AXs\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">\u00b686 After consideration of the record in its entirety, I conclude there was plain error when the prosecutor \u201cchanneled\u201d the eight-month-old victim during closing arguments. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s holding under Issue 4 that the District Court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>abuse its discretion in denying Ugalde\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b687 While under the care and supervision of his babysitter (Ugalde), eight-month-old I.N. suffered a serious head injury causing acute bilateral subdural hematomas, brain swelling, and severe bilateral retinal hemorrhaging. As a result, I.N. likely will have permanent deficiencies in his motor skills and cognitive development. It is doubtful that a prosecutor could have a more sympathetic victim than an eight-month-old infant who, allegedly, was abused by his caretaker.</p>\n<p id=\"A8f\">\u00b688 In the Information, the State alleged that Ugalde had \u201cpurposely or knowingly caused serious bodily injury to another, to-wit: the Defendant shook or slammed I.N. (born in October 2007) causing him serious bodily injury,\u201d in violation of \u00a745-5-202(1), MCA (\u201cA person commits the offense of aggravated assault if the person purposely or knowingly causes serious bodily injury to another ....\u201d). As is an accused\u2019s right, Ugalde was not comfortable with stipulating to \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d and, thus, required the prosecution to meet its burden of proving every element of the offense charged. Nevertheless, in her opening statement, defense counsel acknowledged to the jury that I.N. had suffered serious bodily injury: \u201c[Nevada] had her own young child, and she was baby-sitting [I.N.] in her own home when he suffered a terrible accident and he was seriously injured.\u201d During her closing argument, defense counsel again acknowledged that \u20181 told you out of the gate we weren\u2019t going to contest that the injuries were serious in this case. That was never an issue. The issue in this case is causation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b689 Ugalde\u2019s approach is understandable, given that her defense related to causation. Testimony regarding the nature of I.N.\u2019s injuries overlapped with testimony regarding the seriousness of those injuries, and defense counsel could not risk that a pretrial stipulation to \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d would foreclose her from examining experts at trial regarding the nature of the injuries as relevant to causation. We implicitly acknowledge counsel\u2019s dilemma in our observation that a \u201c[t]horough review of the record reveals that it is often impossible to separate which evidence went to the causation element and which went to the serious bodily injury element; the extent of the injuries was a factor for the jury to consider in determining both seriousness and causation.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b690 Consequently, the prosecution produced ten witnesses who testified to various aspects of I.N.\u2019s injuries and treatmentmuch of it overlapping and cumulative. While it would be unreasonable to prevent the State from developing its case regarding serious bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>injury, a defendant does not waive objections to prejudicial or cumulative evidence by insisting that the State meet its burden of proof. Ugalde still had the right to have relevant evidence excluded from consideration by the jury if its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or by considerations of needless presentation of cumulative evidence. M. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b691 The District Court refused to hold the State at fault \u2018for preparing a thorough presentation of its case\u201d and ultimately determined, in balancing the cumulative and prejudicial nature of the evidence against its probative value, that the complicated nature of I.N.\u2019s injuries warranted testimony from each of the ten witnesses. In my view, this was a close call. However, we review such rulings for abuse of discretion, and the question under this standard is not whether we would have reached the same decision, but whether the trial judge acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason. <em>Newman v. Lichfield, </em>2012 MT 47, \u00b6 22, 364 Mont. 243, 272 P.3d 625. I agree with the Court\u2019s implicit holding that the District Court did not act arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceed the bounds of reason in allowing the prosecution to present the testimony of all ten witnesses. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50. Given that I.N. suffered a serious head injury, it is not surprising that the impact of this primary injury would be observed through many, if not all, aspects of I.N.\u2019s physical and mental well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b692 Nevertheless, the impact on the jury of hearing ten experts testify to each aspect of I.N.\u2019s injuries and treatment is relevant to, and provides context for, the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument. The State\u2019s first witness was Dr. Brian Starr, I.N.\u2019s pediatrician. Dr. Starr testified that before the June 11, 2008 injury, I.N. was a developmentally normal child, but that since the injury, I.N.\u2019s skull was not growing normally. Dr. Starr stated that this was indicative of a severe brain injury and that I.N. is permanently impaired as a result of this injury. Dr. Starr also stated that he has treated children who suffered short-distance accidental falls and that he had never seen, in such cases, the same \u201cconstellation of injuries\u201d that I.N. had suffered. \u00b693 Next, Holly Taylor, a physical therapist, described I.N.\u2019s motor skills and how I.N.\u2019s developmental delays in his motor skills are a result of his brain injury. Tanya Sciuchetti, a pediatric occupational therapist, also testified that I.N. was delayed in his motor skills due to his brain injury. Carol Morse, a speech and language pathologist, testified that I.N.\u2019s speech development has been delayed as a result of his brain injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\u00b694 Dr. Eugen Dolan, a neurological surgeon, testified that I.N. suffered a severe head injury with bleeding inside the skull. When cross-examined on causation, Dr. Dolan was somewhat equivocal but did agree that I.N.\u2019s injuries could have been caused by the trauma of falling from a crib. He admitted that he could not rule out accidental trauma as a potential cause. Dr. Linda Johnson, a pediatrician, also described I.N.\u2019s injuries and her treatment of those injuries. She stated that I.N.\u2019s injuries were severe, and she was 95 to 97 percent sure that the injuries were the result of nonaccidental trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b695 Dr. Curtis Lee, an emergency room physician, testified that it was apparent I.N. had suffered \u201ca severe head trauma.\u201dHe described I.N.\u2019s injuries and testified about his treatment of I.N. Dr. Lee acknowledged that he had not ruled out accidental trauma as a potential cause of the injuries; however, he opined that the history he had been given regarding the mechanism of injury-i.e., that I.N. had fallen out of a crib-did not account for the severity of the injuries he had observed in I.N.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b696 Dr. Andrew Sirotnak, of Denver Children\u2019s Hospital in Colorado, is a pediatrician who specializes in child abuse cases. Dr. Sirotnak described I.N.\u2019s injuries and testified that these injuries were not consistent with a linear fall of less than three feet onto a carpeted floor. Rather, in his opinion, this was a case of physical abuse or nonaccidental trauma. While he could not specify the mechanism of injury, Dr. Sirotnak opined that I.N.\u2019s injuries were consistent with rapid acceleration-declaration, such as whiplash.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b697 Dr. Daniel Weaver, a pediatric ophthalmologist, described the injuries to I.N.\u2019s eyes and stated that surgical treatment of the eyes had been necessary due to I.N.\u2019s head injury. Dr. Weaver testified that, in his experience, he had never seen I.N.\u2019s constellation of injuries-bilateral retinal hemorrhages, bilateral vitreous hemorrhages, and an afferent pupil defect-in a child who had fallen from a height of less than four feet. He conceded, however, that such injuries could result from such a fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u00b698 Lastly, Dr. Wilbur Smith, a pediatric radiologist, testified that I.N. had suffered severe abusive head trauma. In Dr. Smith\u2019s opinion, I.N.\u2019s injuries were not the result of a short-distance fall but, rather, were the result of being shaken or slammed. He conceded on cross-examination, however, that the nature of the injuries by themselves did not establish abusive treatment by a caregiver-for example, they theoretically could have been the result of a motor vehicle accident-and thus it was necessary to consider the reported history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>about the injuries. Nevertheless, Dr. Smith maintained the opinion that I.N.\u2019s injuries were not due to a fall from his crib.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b699 In addition to the foregoing experts, the State called Susan Napier, I.N.\u2019s mother. Through Susan, the State introduced State\u2019s Exhibits 3 through 6 into evidence. Exhibits 3 and 4 are pictures taken of eight-month-old I.N. at his sister\u2019s birthday party on June 1, 2008. Exhibit 5 is a picture of I.N. at the hospital in June 2008 following his injury. He is shown in a medically induced coma with IVs, a catheter, and a head wrap. Exhibit 6 is a picture of I.N. in January 2009 after his second eye surgery. He is shown with a patch over his left eye.</p>\n<p id=\"AOQ\">\u00b6100 The prosecution\u2019s initial closing argument, presented by Deputy County Attorney Juli Pierce, began as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">May it please the Court, counsel, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. What a difference a day makes. Before June 11th of 2008,1 was a normal, healthy, happy kid. My parents and I had hopes and dreams for me. This is me on June 1st of 2008 at my sister Anastasia\u2019s birthday party. [Jury is presumably shown State\u2019s Exhibits 3 and 4, depicting I.N. at the birthday party.] After June 11th of 2008,1 would never ever, ever be the same again. My life and the lives of my family would be drastically changed forever because of what my baby-sitter, the Defendant, did to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">That morning, on June 11th of 2008,1 was a normal kid. My mom and my grandma dropped me off at the Defendant\u2019s house who had been baby-sitting me for a couple of months. Sometime in the early afternoon, my trusted caretaker, that woman, shook me and slammed me to the point of having severe closed head injury causing me to look like this. [Jury is presumably shown State\u2019s Exhibit 5, depicting I.N. in a medically induced coma.] And after June 11th of 2008,1 had more and more surgeries, and more issues, and the Defendant caused me to look like this. [Jury is presumably shown State\u2019s Exhibit 6, depicting I.N. following his second eye surgery.] Now, I can\u2019t walk normally without braces on, or else I walk on my tiptoes. Now, I can\u2019t hang out with kids my own age because I can\u2019t say what I want to do or what I need. I can\u2019t tell my mom I love her. I can\u2019t say what I want or what I need because at age two-and-a-half I can only say three words. [Jury is shown a video, apparently State\u2019s Exhibit 19, which shows I.N. at his home interacting with his mother in April 2010.] My life will never be the same, and my family\u2019s lives will never be the same because of what the Defendant did to me on June 11th of 2008.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>At the conclusion of her argument, Pierce asked the jurors to \u201ctell the Defendant that you know what happened that day, and you find her guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b6101 At the outset of her rebuttal closing argument, Pierce remarked: \u201cWe talked ... at length in voir dire about child abuse. We talked about child abuse usually occurring behind closed doors, two people, perpetrator/victim.\u201d Pierce asserted that \u201c[I.N.] was the only witness, besides the Defendant, to tell you what happened to him on June 11th of 2008.\u201d (I.N. did not actually testify.) Pierce concluded with the following: \u201c[I.N.] can\u2019t speak. He can\u2019t sit in that chair and tell you what happened to him. But you heard all those witnesses, and it\u2019s like [I.N.] was speaking to you. And you tell [I.N.] that you heard him, and you find the Defendant guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b6102 \u201cChanneling the victim\u201d is a technique by which a lawyer speaks to the jury in the first person as though she is the injured or deceased person. It is calculated to produce a dramatic and emotional impact on the jury by bringing to life in the courtroom a dead victim or a victim who-as here-eannot testify. In my view, a prosecutor who channels an eight-month-old infant, states that \u201cI can\u2019t tell my mom I love her,\u201d and asks the jury to \u201ctell [the infant] that you heard him\u201d has engaged in misconduct calling into doubt the fundamental fairness of the trial itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b6 103 Channeling gained national attention in conjunction with John Edwards\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign. Nineteen years earlier, Edwards (a North Carolina lawyer at the time) litigated an action against an obstetrician for negligently failing to perform a cesarean section that allegedly would have prevented the child\u2019s cerebral palsy. Edwards stood before the jury and channeled the words of the unborn baby girl. Referring to an hour-by-hour record of a fetal heartbeat monitor, he told the jury: \u201cShe said at 3, \u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019 She said at 4, \u2018I\u2019m having a little trouble, but I\u2019m doing O.K.\u2019 Five, she said, \u2018I\u2019m having problems.\u2019 At 5:30, she said T need out.\u2019 \u201d Edwards continued: \u2018She speaks to you through me. And I have to tell you right now-J didn\u2019t plan to talk about this-right now I feel her. I feel her presence. She\u2019s inside of me, and she\u2019s talking to you.\u201d The jury awarded Edwards\u2019s client $6.5 million, but the trial court subsequently ruled the award \u201cexcessive,\u201d observing that it had been given \u201cunder the influence of passion and prejudice.\u201dThe parties ultimately settled for $4.25 million. <em>See </em>Adam Liptak &amp; Michael Moss, <em>In Trial Work, Edwards Left A Trademark, </em>N.Y.

Prosecutors apparently will risk manipulating and misstating the evidence in order to present an emotional appeal, even when they have ample and convincing evidence to convict. <em>Drayden v.

Stringer, </em>271 Mont. 367, 381, 897 P.2d 1063, 1071-72 (1995). It also is improper for the prosecutor to comment on evidence not of record during closing argument. <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6 14. However, this Court has not addressed directly whether channeling the victim in closing argument constitutes reversible misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b6106 The issue arose in <em>Kills on Top, </em>where we considered whether defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s summation of the evidence, in which the prosecutor portrayed himself as the victim and narrated in the first person, constituted ineffective assistance. We held that counsel was not deficient because fit appears that all material statements contained in the prosecutor\u2019s narration from the standpoint of the victim were supported by testimonial or other evidence admitted at trial.\u201d <em>Kills on Top, </em>273 Mont. at 51, 901 P.2d at 1380. But we declined to consider whether channeling the victim actually constituted prosecutorial misconduct. <em>Kills on Top, </em>273 Mont. at 62, 901 P.2d at 1387.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b6107 In the civil context, the issue of channeling arose recently in a medical malpractice action where the plaintiffs attorney assumed the persona of the plaintiffs deceased husband and delivered a first-person narrative recounting the events leading to his death. <em>Heidt v. Argani, </em>2009 MT 267, \u00b6 5, 352 Mont. 86, 214 P.3d 1255. Counsel used phrases such as \u201coh my God, I\u2019m dying,\u201d and then described being autopsied, including a description of being cut open and of the decedent\u2019s sorrow at not getting to see his children grow up. <em>Heidt, </em>\u00b6 5. At this point, one of the jurors announced that she was \u201cnot okay\u201d and that she thought she was going to pass out. The defendant-physician (Argani) proceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>to render assistance. <em>Heidt, </em>\u00b6 6. On appeal, we considered whether the plaintiffs motion for a mistrial should have been granted. <em>Heidt, </em>\u00b6 12. We concluded, in light of the unique circumstances of the case-i.e., a medical malpractice trial in which the jury gets to see the defendant doctor reacting to a real-life situation and apparently successfully delivering life-saving care-that a mistrial should have been granted. <em>Heidt, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17. We did not address the propriety of counsel\u2019s channeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b6108 Outside Montana, the Eighth Circuit observed in <em>Rodriguez </em>that a prosecutor may not express an opinion implying knowledge of facts unavailable to the jury and that it is improper to ask jurors to put themselves in the place of the victim. 581 F.3d at 803. However, the Court of Appeals noted disagreement among courts about whether a defendant is unfairly prejudiced by a prosecutor\u2019s statement that she \u201cspeaks for\u201d a victim. <em>Rodriguez, </em>581 F.3d at 803.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the cases cited in <em>Rodriguez </em>are distinguishable from the present case in that they did not involve a prosecutor narrating in the voice of the victim, the cases nevertheless demonstrate how courts will view the range of prosecutorial conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b6109 Our criminal justice system is premised on certain fundamental principles. One of those principles was aptly described by Justice Sutherland of the United States Supreme Court almost 80 years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">The [prosecutor] is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a \u25a0peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor-indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">It is fair to say that the average jury, in a greater or less degree, has confidence that these obligations, which so plainly rest upon the prosecuting attorney, will be faithfully observed. Consequently, improper suggestions, insinuations, and, especially, assertions of personal knowledge are apt to carry much weight against the accused when they should properly carry none.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEo\"><em>Berger v.

Criswell, </em>2013 MT 177, \u00b6 57, 370 Mont. 511, 305 P.3d 760 (McGrath, C.J., concurring). Unfortunately, however, \u201c \u2018some prosecutors have permitted an excess of zeal for conviction or a fancy for exaggerated rhetoric to carry them beyond the permissible limits of argument.\u2019 \u201d <em>Criswell, </em>\u00b6 55 (McGrath, C.J., concurring) (quoting <em>ABA Stands, for Crim. Just.: Prosecution Function and Def. Function, </em>Stand. 3-5.8, Commentary, 107 (3d ed., Am. B. Assn. 1993)). \u2018Prosecutorial conduct in argument is a matter of special concern because of the possibility that the jury will give special weight to the prosecutor\u2019s arguments, not only because of the prestige associated with the prosecutor\u2019s office, but also because of the fact-finding facilities presumably available to the office.\u201d <em>ABA Stands, for Crim. Just.: Prosecution Function and Def. Function, </em>Stand. 3-5.8, Commentary, 107. Accordingly, a prosecutor \u201cshould not make arguments calculated to appeal to the prejudices of the jury\u201d and \u201cshould refrain from argument which would divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence.\u201d <em>ABA Stands, for Crim.

The Court of Appeals observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">By doing so, the Prosecutor inappropriately obscured the fact that his role is to vindicate the public\u2019s interest in punishing crime, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>to exact revenge on behalf of an individual victim. Furthermore, the prosecutor seriously risked manipulating and misstating the evidence by creating a fictitious character based on the dead victim and by \u201ctestifying\u201d in the voice of the character as if he had been a percipient witness. Finally, by testifying as [the victim], the prosecutor also risked improperly inflaming the passions of the jury through his first-person appeal to its sympathies for the victim who, in the words of the prosecutor, was a gentle man who did nothing to deserve his dismal fate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><em>Drayden, </em>232 F.3d at 712-13.1 would add to this that channeling also risks infringing the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to cross-examine her accusers face to face. U.S. Const. amend VI; Mont. Cost. art. II, \u00a724.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b6112 In <em>Criswell, </em>which involved charges of aggravated animal cruelty, the prosecutor disparaged the defendants during his closing argument, calling them \u201csquatters\u201d and \u2018freeloaders.\u201d He also asserted that they had been \u2018fun out of Idaho\u201d and implied that one of the defendants had purchased marijuana in lieu of providing food for his cats. <em>See Criswell, </em>\u00b6 43. While the prosecutor maintained that his remarks had not been intended to inflame the jury or to comment on the defendants\u2019 characters, <em>Criswell, </em>\u00b6 45, Chief Justice McGrath questioned this explanation: \u2018Personally, I find that hard to believe. If not intended to inflame the jury or comment on the Criswells\u2019 characters, then what were they intended to do?\u201d <em>Criswell, </em>\u00b6 57 (McGrath, C.J., concurring). In my view, we should be asking the same question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b6113 In her closing argument, prosecutor Pierce stood before the jury, assumed I.N.\u2019s persona, and gave a first-person narrative of \u201cwhat my baby-sitter, the Defendant, did to me.\u201d If not intended to inflame the passions of the jury through an appeal to their sympathies for this already sympathetic infant-victim, then what was this tactic intended to do? This was a case in which the prosecution had presented ample-and, at times, repetitious-festimony about the serious bodily injuries suffered by the victim. The prosecution also had presented multiple expert opinions that these injuries were not the result of an accidental fall from a crib. As Pierce observed in her closing argument, \u201cwitness after witness after witness\u201d testified on these matters. Certainly, the prosecutor properly could have argued the State\u2019s view of what these <em>actual </em>witnesses\u2019 testimony showed. The prosecutor also could have urged the jury \u201cto follow the trail of evidence and find Ugalde guilty.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 58 (discussing the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Court\u2019s reasoning based on <em>Clausell). </em>But that is not what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"AI7\">\u00b6114 The prosecutor here purported to give actual testimony from an absent witness. This testimony reflected Pierce\u2019s personal opinions about what I.N. might have said on the witness stand had he been able to appear as a witness. Opinions of this sort, however, are \u201ca form of unsworn, unchecked testimony and tend to exploit the influence of the prosecutor\u2019s office and undermine the objective detachment that should separate a lawyer from the cause being argued.\u201d <em>ABA Stands, for Crim. Just.: Prosecution Function and Def. Function, </em>Stand. 3-5.8, Commentary, 108. Such tactics inappropriately obscure the fact that the prosecutor\u2019s role is to vindicate the public\u2019s interest in punishing crime, not to exact revenge on behalf of an individual victim. <em>Drayden, </em>232 F.3d at 712-13. They seriously risk manipulating and misstating the evidence by creating a fictitious character based on the injured victim and by \u201ctestifying\u201d in the voice of the character. <em>Drayden, </em>232 F.3d at 713. And they risk improperly inflaming the passions of the jury through the first-person appeal to its sympathies for the victim. <em>Drayden, </em>232 F.3d at 713. They also deny the defendant the right to cross-examine the fictitious witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b6115 The Court refuses to grant relief because Ugalde did not contemporaneously object to the prosecutor\u2019s channeling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Opinion, \u00b6 62. Somewhat ironically, however, the Court then denies relief on Ugalde\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (premised on defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the improper closing argument) because \u201cmany lawyers refrain from objecting during... closing argument\u201dand \u201cfailure to object does not qualify as unreasonable conduct by trial counsel.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 82 (ellipsis in original, internal quotation marks omitted). It seems to me that if failure to object does not qualify as unreasonable conduct by trial counsel, then we ought to review Ugalde\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim on its merits. Conversely, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>an objection was required in order to preserve this claim for appeal, then defense counsel was ineffective for not making one and we should review the claim. At the very least, the claim should be considered under plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b6116 We have stated repeatedly that misconduct by a prosecutor may form the basis for granting a new trial where the prosecutor\u2019s actions have deprived the defendant of a fair and impartial trial. <em>State v. Gray, </em>207 Mont. 261, 266-67, 673 P.2d 1262, 1265-66 (1983); <em>State v. Arlington, </em>265 Mont. 127, 158, 875 P.2d 307, 325 (1994); <em>State v. Hayden, </em>2008 MT 274, \u00b6 27, 345 Mont. 252, 190 P.3d 1091. We have also explained that the applicability of plain error review must be decided on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis. <em>State v. Sullivant, </em>2013 MT 200, \u00b6 17, 371 Mont. 91, 305 P.3d 838; <em>Daniels, </em>\u00b6 20. Under this doctrine, we may review a claimed error that implicates a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights4ncluding claims of prosecutorial misconduct-where failing to review the error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 29-30; <em>State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 137-38, 915 P.2d 208, 215 (1996), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b6117 Here, I believe the prosecutor\u2019s channeling the infant-victim in closing arguments denied Ugalde her constitutional right to a fair trial. The channeling was neither brief nor harmless. It was calculated to play on the emotions and sympathy of the jury. I.N. spoke to the jurors through Pierce, describing the assault, the surgeries, how his life is no longer the same, that he no longer can tell his mother he loved her, and that he can only speak three words. Pierce asserted that \u201c[I.N.] was the only witness, besides the Defendant, to tell you what happened to him on June 11th of 2008.\u201d Pierce asked the jurors to tell I.N. that they heard him and to tell Ugalde that they know what happened that day. The evidence presented at trial concerning the impact upon the eight-month-old victim and the cause of his injuries was overwhelming. But that does not justify our overlooking a prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument that was calculated to appeal to the jury\u2019s emotions, passion, and sympathy. This tactic undermined the fundamental fairness of the trial. I therefore would reverse for plain error and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b6118 In closing, I note there may be many reasons why defense counsel does not object to improper argument by the prosecutor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Counsel may believe that an objection would draw attention to a particular fact or strengthen the argument being made. Counsel may fear a particular response from the judge or the prosecutor that would harm his or her client. It is not inconceivable that defense counsel may allow the prosecutor to continue an improper line of argument and thereby potentially build reversible error into the case. But whatever the reason for defense counsel\u2019s silence, this Court\u2019s ongoing refusal to address improper arguments such as here perpetuates tolerance of trial tactics that undermine fairness in our tribunals. As I have observed previously, \u201c[t]he message that this increasingly prevalent practice is sending, unfortunately, is that prosecutors in this State can be assured of having their convictions upheld despite comments made during trial which violate ethical rules and \u2018run the risk of undermining the fundamental fairness of the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Aker, </em>2013 MT 253, \u00b6 44, 371 Mont. 491, 310 P.3d 506 (McKinnon &amp; Cotter, JJ., dissenting) (quoting <em>State v. Lindberg, </em>2008 MT 389, \u00b6 34, 347 Mont. 76, 196 P.3d 1252). Until there are actual consequences, such as reversal of the conviction, the problem is going to persist.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqo\">\u00b6119 In response to this, the Court observes that we have \u201cnot yet decided whether a first-person narrative constitutes misconduct.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 62. However, the fact that this Court has not yet reversed a case due to improper channeling is beside the point. The rules prohibiting this tactic are already well settled. In this regard, the Court does not dispute the following: that a prosecutor \u201cshould not make arguments calculated to appeal to the prejudices of the jury,\u201d <em>ABA Stands, for Crim. Just.: Prosecution Function and Def. Function, </em>Stand. 3-5.8(c), 106; that a prosecutor \u201cshould refrain from argument which would divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence,\u201d <em>ABA Stands, for Crim. Just.: Prosecution Function and Def. Function, </em>Stand. 3-5.8(d), 106; and that a prosecutor risks \u201cmanipulating and misstating the evidence\u201dand \u2018improperly inflaming the passions of the jury\u201d by \u201ctestifying\u201d in the voice of the victim, <em>Drayden, </em>232 F.3d at 713. These standards were violated here when the prosecutor, in her closing argument, embarked on a first-person narrative in the voice of the victim. This tactic arguably ran afoul, as well, of our longstanding prohibitions against expressing a personal opinion about the guilt of the accused and commenting on evidence not of record. <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14, 21; <em>Stringer, </em>271 Mont. at 381, 897 P.2d at 1071-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b6120 In the end, we fail today in our obligation to provide guidance to the bench and bar on a serious issue in the conduct of criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>proceedings-an issue that the appellant has squarely raised in this appeal. We have rules which establish, at least in my view, that it is improper for the prosecutor during closing argument to employ tactics calculated to play on the emotions and sympathy of the jury. Channeling the victim is clearly designed to do just that. I believe we should say so explicitly, rather than avoid the question on a procedural ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b6121 I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\"> The <em>Rodriguez </em>court cited the following cases: <em>Compare Sanchez v.
