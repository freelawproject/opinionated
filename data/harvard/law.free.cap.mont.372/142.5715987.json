Sherlock (Judge Sherlock) of the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, presided over the trial of Jeremy MacGregor (MacGregor) for two counts of attempted deliberate homicide. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts. Judge Sherlock denied MacGregor\u2019s motions to dismiss for lack of speedy trial and for juror misconduct. MacGregor appeals from these dismissals as well as from numerous alleged errors at trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">STATEMENT OF ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">\u00b62 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court correctly deny MacGregor\u2019s motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">\u00b63 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err by failing to inquire into MacGregor\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim and the voluntariness of his decision to represent himself?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">\u00b64 <em>Issue Three: Did the District Court correctly deny MacGregor\u2019s speedy trial claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">\u00b65 <em>Issue Four: Did the District Court err by admitting evidence of MacGregor\u2019s prior assault of his wife?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">\u00b66 <em>Issue Five: Should we exercise plain error review of MacGregor\u2019s claim that the District Court gave an erroneous instruction on mitigated deliberate homicide?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-15\">\u00b67 <em>Issue Six: Did the District Court improperly impose parole conditions?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-16\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b175-17\">\u00b68 On April 15,2010, MacGregor shot and nearly killed his unarmed wife, Jennifer MacGregor (Jennifer) and their live-in nanny, Betsy Mart (Betsy). He was arrested and charged with two counts of attempted deliberate homicide. After brief representation by a public defender, MacGregor demanded that he represent himself pro se and the court allowed him to do so with standby counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-18\">\u00b69 Before trial, MacGregor filed numerous motions with the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>including a motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial. Trial commenced on February 22, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b610 At trial, MacGregor made vague claims about his general nonviolent nature and argued that he had not been in a fight for a number of years. The State introduced evidence that MacGregor had assaulted Jennifer in the past, seeking to rebut his statements of non-violence. The District Court admitted this prior assault to rebut MacGregor\u2019s claim of non-violent character and his statement that he had not been in fights for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b611 The court submitted instructions to the jury for attempted deliberate homicide and attempted mitigated deliberate homicide. MacGregor failed to object to the instructions. The jury found MacGregor guilty of both counts of attempted deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"AmP\">\u00b612 MacGregor\u2019s standby counsel filed a motion for new trial based on juror misconduct. The District Court conducted a hearing concerning juror Justin Wearley\u2019s (Wearley) communication with his family about the trial, his reading of a newspaper during trial, and his failure to reveal at voir dire that he had been a victim of domestic violence. The District Court heard testimony from Wearley, his wife, and their two children, and denied the motion upon a finding that MacGregor could not show prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b613 Appropriate standards of review will be discussed as they arise in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\u00b6 14 <em>Did the District Court correctly deny MacGregor\u2019s motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">\u00b615 This Court reviews motions for new trial based on juror misconduct for abuse of discretion, and a district court will not be overturned unless a defendant demonstrates he was deprived of a fair and impartial trial. <em>State v. Rennaker, </em>2007 MT 10, \u00b6 29, 335 Mont. 274, 150 P.3d 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">I. Failure to Disclose at voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">\u00b616 Section 46-16-115, MCA, lists a number of appropriate challenges for cause in evaluating prospective jurors. Unless a juror falls within one of those statutory categories, the juror will not be removed for cause without a showing of partiality. <em>State v. Hendricks, </em>171 Mont. 7, 11, 555 P.2d 743, 746 (1976). In <em>Rennaker, </em>we reviewed a misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>claim in a trial for sexual assault wherein two jurors failed to disclose their prior experience of sexual abuse. <em>Rennaker, </em>\u00b6 35. We held that the nondisclosure of their experiences only constituted misconduct if it amounted to intentional concealment, or other further evidence of bias was proven. <em>Rennaker, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b617  The District Court properly concluded that Juror Wearley\u2019s failure to disclose was not intentional and no other evidence of bias was presented. Although the defense inquired during voir dire about experiences with domestic violence, a juror could have believed that the defense was inquiring about whether those experiences \u201cwould influence how you judge this case ... .\u201d Indeed, that was the very question asked of another juror, who was not challenged for cause or bias. We further note that past experiences with a similar crime are not listed as legitimate challenges for cause in \u00a746-16-115, MCA. The defense, therefore, can only show misconduct by proving some evidence of bias. Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA; <em>State v. Dunfee, </em>2005 MT 147, \u00b6 16, 327 Mont. 335, 114 P.3d 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b618  MacGregor urges that we recognize Wearley\u2019s implied bias based on the similarities between his experiences and the facts of the case, relying on <em>Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>99 F.3d 978, 987 (10th Cir. 1996). But our holding in <em>Rennaker </em>requires more than similarities between the juror\u2019s experiences and the crime alleged. MacGregor can point to no evidence of bias other than the fact that Wearley had been a victim of domestic violence. In fact, testimony of Wearley\u2019s family revealed that he sympathized with MacGregor. Therefore, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Wearley was an impartial juror who unintentionally concealed his experience with domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">II. The Newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b619 MacGregor argues that Wearley was exposed to prejudicial extraneous information when he had his family read a newspaper article about the trial to him. Juror misconduct based on extraneous communications must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and in the context of the entire record. <em>United States v. Maree, </em>934 F.2d 196, 202 (9th Cir. 1996) <em>(rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, United States v. Adams, </em>432 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir. 2006). The trial court is uniquely qualified to appraise whether extraneous information resulted in prejudice, and we accord substantial weight to that determination. <em>Stebner v. Associated Materials, Inc., </em>2010 MT 138, \u00b6 23, 356 Mont. 520, 234 P.3d 94; <em>Maree, </em>934 F.2d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\u00b620  Where a juror is exposed to extraneous information, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>rebuttable presumption of prejudice exists. <em>Stebner, </em>\u00b6 17. This presumption is not absolute, and arises only when the information shows a natural tendency to prejudice. <em>Allers v. Riley, </em>273 Mont. 1, 8, 901 P.2d 600, 605 (1995). In cases concerning prejudice from pretrial newspaper publicity, we held that a \u2018juror\u2019s knowledge of the case and publicity, without more, is insufficient to warrant a change of venue since <em>it cannot be equated with prejudice.\u201d State v. Devlin, </em>2009 MT 18, \u00b6 32, 349 Mont. 67, 210 P.3d 791 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>State v. Fuhrman, </em>278 Mont. 396, 409, 925 P.2d 1162, 1170 (1996)). Juror misconduct and the resulting prejudice may be evaluated by considering juror testimony and affidavits concerning the misconduct. <em>Stebner, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 22; <em>Harry v. Elderkin, </em>196 Mont. 1, 7-8, 637 P.2d 809, 813 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b621  Here, the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Wearley\u2019s communications with his family did not have a tendency to prejudice. The fact that Wearley was exposed to publicity alone does not constitute a showing of prejudice. The District Court considered testimony from Wearley and his family indicating that he sympathized with MacGregor and did not feel that the article influenced his view of the trial. The court concluded that the headline \u2018Shooter Blames Demonic Forces,\u201d presented no new information that had not been divulged in MacGregor\u2019s trial because his opening argument stated that \u201cdemonic forces somehow got these things to happen where apparently I have done these horrible, horrible things to my family.\u201d MacGregor points to no falsehood or bias produced by the article and has not shown any facts demonstrating that the article has a natural tendency to prejudice. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the information did not prejudice the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">III. Wife\u2019s Comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b622 MacGregor also argues that Wearley was exposed to prejudicial extraneous information when his wife said that MacGregor was \u2018braking excuses\u201d for his conduct. We have held that a district court is within its discretion to deny a retrial when an assertion of prejudice has no grounds in the record. <em>State v. White, </em>2008 MT 129, \u00b6 13, 343 Mont. 66, 184 P.3d 1008 (\u201cAlthough White asserts that Lindbergh\u2019s impermissible comment prejudiced the jury ... his claim of prejudice fades when the record is considered.\u201d). Testimony at the District Court\u2019s inquiry indicated that Wearley\u2019s statements occurred in the midst of a civics lesson with his children about the trial, and Wearley himself did not express his opinion or seek the opinion of his wife. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>evidence was presented that Wearley was persuaded or influenced by his wife\u2019s opinion of the trial. The District Court properly concluded that Wearley was not exposed to any statement that would prejudice his view of MacGregor\u2019s position at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b623 <em>Did the District Court err by failing to inquire into MacGregor\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim and the voluntariness of his decision to represent himself?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">I. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b624  MacGregor complains that his attorney failed to form a strategy or contact him while he was at the Montana State Hospital. At the time the trial court ordered the competency evaluation, MacGregor already had requested to represent himself. The court deferred decision on MacGregor\u2019s request until the evaluation was completed. MacGregor later complained that \u201crepresentation was forced upon him during the state\u2019s mental evaluation,\u201d while simultaneously criticizing Scott for failing to contact MacGregor while he was hospitalized. Given the District Court\u2019s familiarity with MacGregor\u2019s requests and its decision to postpone ruling on MacGregor\u2019s motion to represent himself, it did not err in failing to conduct additional inquiry into his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u00b625 MacGregor also alleged before and during trial that his attorneys had colluded with the prosecution to his detriment. The record is unclear whether he was referring to conduct occurring before or after his appointed counsel was designated as standby counsel. When a defendant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel during trial, we review whether the district court made an inquiry into those complaints to determine whether they are substantial. <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>1998 MT 70, \u00b6 15, 288 Mont. 180, 955 P.2d 1371; <em>State v. Hammer, </em>2013 MT 203, \u00b6 14, 371 Mont. 121, 305 P.3d 843. In reviewing a district court\u2019s inquiry, we do not examine whether counsel was ineffective, but instead, whether the district court\u2019s inquiry into the claim was adequate. <em>Hammer, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>State v. Dethman, </em>2010 MT 268, \u00b6 16, 358 Mont. 384, 245 P.3d 30; <em>State v. Weaver, </em>276 Mont. 505, 511, 917 P.2d 437, 441 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u00b626 A district court\u2019s inquiry is adequate when it considers the defendant\u2019s factual complaints together with counsel\u2019s explanations addressing the complaints. <em>Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Dethman, </em>\u00b6 16. If the district court\u2019s adequate inquiry finds that the defendant\u2019s complaints are insubstantial, it is not required to hold a hearing on the issue. <em>Hammer, </em>\u00b6 14. A complaint is substantial when it makes some showing of fact indicating that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. <em>Bomar v. State, </em>2012 MT 163, \u00b6 7, 365 Mont. 474, 285 P.3d 396; <em>State v. Miner, </em>2012 MT 20, \u00b6 11, 364 Mont. 1, 271 P.3d 56. Those facts must make a showing of deficiency to overcome the presumption that a defendant was provided with effective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Morsette, </em>2013 MT 270, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 372 Mont. 38, 309 P.3d 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u00b627  Here, MacGregor\u2019s primary claim was that his counsel colluded with the prosecution by sharing details about the defense and otherwise talking with each other. The District Court noted that the defense discusses details of the case with prosecutors \u201cin every single criminal case, and there is nothing shown that would create a breach of confidentiality.\u201dThe court held that discussions between the defense and prosecutors were not sufficient to overcome the presumption that counsel was effective, and did not reveal any indication of prejudice towards the case. MacGregor points to no other facts indicating that his lawyer\u2019s conduct was unprofessional or incorrect. Accordingly, the District Court made an adequate inquiry to establish that MacGregor\u2019s claims had no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">II. Voluntariness of Waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\u00b628  This Court has recognized the Sixth Amendment right to self-representation, but we are also mindful of the disadvantages confronting pro se parties. <em>Halley, </em>\u00b6 20. A District Court may only allow a defendant to waive the right to counsel when the record establishes that the defendant is fully aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, and made the waiver knowingly with \u201ceyes wide open.\u201d <em>State v. Colt, </em>255 Mont. 399, 406, 843 P.2d 747, 751 (1992); <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 2541 (1975). So long as substantial credible evidence exists to support the district court\u2019s decision that the defendant made a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver, it will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>State v. Plouffe, </em>198 Mont. 379, 385, 646 P.2d 533, 536 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\u00b629  The District Court here ensured that MacGregor knew the disadvantages of self-representation, warning him that it could decrease the effectiveness of representation and that he would need to follow court deadlines. The District Court also ordered a competency evaluation and refused to allow MacGregor to proceed pro se until the evaluation was completed. After evaluators at the Montana State Hospital (MSH) determined that MacGregor was competent to stand trial, the court again explained the dangers of self-representation. MacGregor still insisted on waiving counsel. The record clearly reflects that the District Court took adequate precautions to ensure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>MacGregor waived counsel voluntarily and knowingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b630 <em>Did the District Court correctly deny MacGregor\u2019s speedy trial claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b631 We apply two standards when reviewing a district court\u2019s ruling on a speedy trial motion. First, we review factual findings to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Couture, </em>2010 MT 201, \u00b6 47, 357 Mont. 398, 240 P.3d 987. Second, we examine de novo whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied constitutional law to the facts at issue. <em>Couture, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b632 This Court evaluates speedy trial claims by considering the relevant facts in four key areas, and then assessing whether those facts demonstrate a denial of the right to speedy trial. <em>Morsette, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 34, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815). The relevant factors include the length of delay, the reasons for delay, the accused\u2019s responses to the delay, and prejudice to the accused. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 106-11. No single factor in this balancing test is indispensable or dispositive, and we recognize that district courts must engage in a difficult, sensitive, often subjective balancing process. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2000 MT 180, \u00b6 14, 300 Mont. 367, 4 P.3d 654; <em>State v. Highpine, </em>2000 MT 368, \u00b6 14, 303 Mont. 422, 15 P.3d 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">I. Length and Responsibility for Delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u00b633 A trial delay of longer than 200 days triggers the four factor balancing test in <em>Ariegwe. Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 62. However, the length of delay alone does not amount to a speedy trial violation. We must also consider the reasons for the delay and attribute portions of the delay to certain parties. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 64. Delay requested by a particular party may be attributable to the other party. <em>State v. Diaz, </em>2006 MT 303, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, 334 Mont. 479, 148 P.3d 628; <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 66. When the State causes a delay in the trial, we must evaluate whether a valid reason justified the delay. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 67 (quoting <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 531, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 2192 (1972)). Those delays resulting from the State\u2019s lack of diligence are weighed significantly against the State. <em>Couture, </em>\u00b6 72. \u2018Institutional delays\u201d that are inherent in the criminal justice system are valid reasons for delay and we do not weigh those delays heavily against the State. <em>Morsette, </em>\u00b6 13. Delay may be attributed to the defendant when the defendant attempts to change counsel, request a continuance, or request mental health evaluations. <em>Morsette, \u00b6 </em>14.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">\u00b634 MacGregor was arrested on April 15, 2010. On July 27, 2010, MacGregor gave notice of his defense of mental incapacitation and not having a particular state of mind. That notice referenced \u00a745-2-203, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>MCA, providing that intoxication is not a defense to mental state unless the defendant did not knowingly consume an intoxicating substance. MacGregor filed a motion requesting evaluation of his mental state on July 30, and the State moved for the same evaluation at the Montana State Hospital. MacGregor withdrew his motion for evaluation on August 3, and then again filed the motion for psychological evaluation on August 6, noting \u20181 understand this motion may delay trial.\u201d MacGregor returned from evaluation at MSH on November 3, 2010, and on November 15, 2010, a status hearing set a trial date for February 7, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b635 The District Court calculated that 314 days had passed between arrest and trial. Of those days, the court found that MacGregor was responsible for a seven-day continuance and the 90-day mental health evaluation at MSH. MacGregor now disputes the assignment of responsibility for the mental health evaluation, as it was requested by the State. We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the request was a direct response to MacGregor\u2019s intoxication defense and his request for private evaluation. The court also held that the rescheduling of trial dates resulting from the mental health evaluation could also be attributed to MacGregor, amounting to 175 days. This was not in error, as the State had been prepared for trial on the original date and the court was forced to reschedule only as a result of MacGregor\u2019s actions. Finally, the court correctly attributed 131 days to the State as institutional delay resulting from continuances and preparation for trial, as no evidence demonstrated a lack of diligence on the State\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">II. Assertion of the Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b636 When a defendant raises a speedy trial issue, we must evaluate whether the defendant truly wants a speedy trial, or whether he is attempting to have his case dismissed on speedy trial grounds. <em>State v. Steigelman, </em>2013 MT 153, \u00b6 15, 370 Mont. 352, 302 P.3d 396; <em>State v. Billman, </em>2008 MT 326, \u00b6 31, 346 Mont. 118, 194 P.3d 58. MacGregor was arrested on April 15, 2010, and at a hearing on November 15, 2010, the trial was scheduled for February 7, 2011. MacGregor was incarcerated for 214 days, at which time he was told that he would be incarcerated for 84 more days before trial would begin. MacGregor then filed a motion on November 22, 2010, indicating that he wanted a speedy trial, but that the court should not do any speedy trial balancing yet. MacGregor then filed a motion on January 11, 2011, requesting that the court perform the speedy trial balancing test and dismiss his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\u00b637  The District Court concluded that MacGregor asserted his right to speedy trial only to avoid trial. MacGregor could have easily brought the motion to dismiss when he first complained of the delay on July 15, or at the rescheduling hearing at November 15, or even in his motion filed on November 22. Instead, the timing of MacGregor\u2019s motion comes just before his trial, but long after the rescheduling hearing or his first complaint of delay. We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that this tactic was disingenuous, and that MacGregor likely did not raise it earlier because he wanted to give more weight to his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">III. Prejudice to the Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b638 As a final matter, we must consider prejudice to the accused resulting from the delay of trial. The impairment of the accused\u2019s defense from a speedy trial violation constitutes the most important factor in our prejudice analysis. <em>Steigelman, </em>\u00b6 29; <em>City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, \u00b6 19, 290 Mont. 148, 965 P.2d 866. We must also consider a defendant\u2019s interest in minimizing impairment of liberty and shortening the disruption of daily life. <em>Ariegwe, \u00b6 87; United States v. MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1, 8, 102 S. Ct. 1497, 1502 (1982). In <em>Morsette, </em>we considered a defendant who was housed in solitary confinement during a 662-day trial delay, but no evidence showed any impairment to the defendant\u2019s <em>case. Morsette, </em>\u00b6 13. We upheld the District Court\u2019s finding that the State had overcome the presumption of prejudice to the defendant because his defense had not been impaired. <em>Morsette, </em>\u00b6 15. The conditions of incarceration are also relevant in assessing the oppressiveness and prejudice to the defendant. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u00b639 Here, MacGregor points to no evidence that the delay of trial impaired his defense. At the speedy trial hearing, MacGregor alleged that video surveillance of the bowling alley had been unattainable due to the delay, and that some witnesses lacked memory of the events at the bowling alley. But MacGregor made no showing that the loss of evidence prejudiced his case. Namely, he never demonstrated that the video evidence ever existed, that the video evidence could ever have been obtained, that the video was destroyed as a result of the delay, or that the video would have helped his case at trial. The same problems exist with his friends\u2019 recollections of the bowling alley events. MacGregor never alleged that his friends remembered incorrectly or that a clearer memory would have benefitted his case. Like the court in <em>Morsette, </em>the District Court considered all of MacGregor\u2019s allegations of prejudice and found no evidence that his defense had been impaired. Since impairment of the defense is the most important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>factor in determining prejudice from delay, we see no reason to disturb the court\u2019s finding that MacGregor did not suffer prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b640  As a final matter, MacGregor contends that he was subjected to oppressive conditions while he was incarcerated, including prison overcrowding and malfunctioning of the heat system. We do not condone the conditions that MacGregor endured during his incarceration. Those conditions alone, however, do not warrant a finding of oppressive pretrial incarceration sufficient to establish the prejudice factor of speedy trial analysis. <em>Morsette, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">IV. Balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b641 In <em>Ariegwe, </em>trial was delayed for more than 400 days and nearly all of the delay was attributable to the government, but we found that no speedy trial violation existed when considered in the context of other circumstances. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 134. In <em>Morsette, </em>we affirmed a District Court\u2019s finding that there was no substantial prejudice to the defendant, even though a 321-day delay was attributable to the State. <em>Morsette, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16; <em>See also, Steigelman, </em>\u00b6 14 (426-day delay not violation of speedy trial on balance). Federal courts have also declined to dismiss on speedy trial grounds when violations extended far beyond 200 days because other factors controlled. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 534, 92 S. Ct. at 2192 (delay of four years did not trigger speedy trial dismissal when defendant was free on bond for that time); <em>United States v. King, </em>483 F.3d 969, 976 (9th Cir. 2007) (two-year delay \u2018hot excessive\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\u00b642  In considering the totality of the circumstances, we find that the District Court properly determined that all four factors weighed against MacGregor\u2019s speedy trial claim. The majority of the delay in trial was attributable to MacGregor\u2019s trial tactics, and he failed to vigorously and genuinely assert his right to speedy trial. Only 131 days were attributable to the State, and all of that delay was for valid institutional purposes. MacGregor cannot show prejudice to his position at trial resulting from the delay. The District Court correctly employed the balancing test to conclude that MacGregor was not deprived of his right to speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\u00b643 <em>Did the District Court err by admitting evidence of MacGregor\u2019s prior assault of his wife?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\u00b644 This Court reviews evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. McOmber, </em>2007 MT 340, \u00b6 10, 340 Mont. 262, 173 P.3d 690. The State sought to use evidence of MacGregor\u2019s assault on his wife, Jennifer, occurring two years prior to this incident. The District Court ruled that such evidence could only be used to rebut character evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>presented by MacGregor, pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404(a)(1). MacGregor contends that he never made any statements about nonviolence towards his wife, so the State improperly introduced the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b645  A defendant puts his character at issue when making unnecessary or self-serving statements about his character which he knows to be untrue. <em>State v. Gowan, </em>2000 MT 277, \u00b6 24, 302 Mont. 127, 13 P.3d 376. The State may rebut character evidence by cross-examining the defendant\u2019s character or by calling witnesses of its own. <em>Gowan, </em>\u00b6 23. In <em>State v. Clark, </em>209 Mont. 473, 492-93, 682 P.2d 1339, 1349-50 (1984) a defendant charged with sexual intercourse without consent stated that he was generally a nonviolent and truthful person. We held that this opened the door to rebuttal evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s violent and untruthful past. <em>Clark, </em>209 Mont. at 489, 682 P.2d at 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b646 During MacGregor\u2019s trial, he argued that he was unusually violent on the night in question. He noted that he picked fights with friends on that night even though he was \u2018hot a violent man\u201d and had not been in a fight in many years. MacGregor blamed his sudden outburst of violence on the combination of stress, a \u201cspiritual assault,\u201d and his intense intoxication. MacGregor hoped to persuade the jury that this amounted to \u201cextreme mental or emotional stress for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse\u201d and justified a verdict for attempted mitigated deliberate homicide. Section 45-5-103(1), MCA. The general theme of MacGregor\u2019s argument was, \u2018I wasn\u2019t acting like myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u00b647  The prosecution cross-examined MacGregor to show that he regularly became belligerent when intoxicated. MacGregor denied becoming violent when intoxicated, other than the night in question; T don\u2019t recall any other incidents.\u201d In response to this, the State asked whether MacGregor had drunkenly assaulted his wife two years earlier. This evidence directly rebuts MacGregor\u2019s assertion that he was not himself, not violent, and not aware that he was especially belligerent when intoxicated. MacGregor plainly opened the door to character evidence when he made general claims about his nonviolent nature and his unusual behavior when intoxicated that night. The District Court properly admitted the prior conviction to rebut MacGregor\u2019s character evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u00b648 <em>Should we exercise plain error review of MacGregor\u2019s claim that the District Court gave an erroneous instruction on mitigated deliberate homicide?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\u00b649 MacGregor argues that the District Court gave an incorrect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>instruction on attempted mitigated deliberate homicide. That instruction correctly stated that mitigated deliberate homicide contained the elements of deliberate homicide, and that mitigation should be found if \u201cthe Defendant was acting under the influence of extreme mental or emotional stress for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse.\u201d Section 45-5-103(1), MCA. The instruction also stated that \u2018you should first consider the verdict on the greater offense of attempted deliberate homicide. If you find the Defendant guilty of attempted deliberate homicide, you need go no further as you will have reached a verdict in this case.\u201d Both parties admit that this part of the instruction was incorrect as a matter of law, because mitigated deliberate homicide requires a preliminary finding of deliberate homicide. <em>Demontiney v. Mont. Twelfth Judicial Dist. Crt., </em>2002 MT 161, \u00b6 16, 310 Mont. 406, 51 P.3d 476; <em>State v. Scarborough, </em>2000 MT 301, \u00b6\u00b6 48-50, 302 Mont. 350, 14 P.3d 1202. MacGregor, who drafted and submitted this instruction to the court, did not object to it. We generally do not review jury instructions unless they are specifically objected to at trial. <em>State v. Earl, </em>2003 MT 158, \u00b6 23, 316 Mont. 263, 71 P.3d 1201. We may exercise plain error review if the claimed error implicates a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights and results in a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>Earl, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b650  MacGregor contends that the incorrect instruction prevented the jury from considering mitigated deliberate homicide as a charge, and this constitutes a miscarriage of justice. MacGregor alleges mitigation because he was intoxicated on marijuana and alcohol; he was upset about an incident where his dog knocked over his child; his child had been diagnosed with a minor ailment; he had fired someone recently; he had quit cigarettes, marijuana, and alcohol (although not that day); he had worked 60-hour work weeks; he had cut his hand; and his wife forgot their anniversary. But mitigating factors arise from some sort of direct provocation, not simply the buildup of stress and anger. <em>Hans v. State, </em>283 Mont. 379, 399, 942 P.2d 674, 686 (1997). We have previously ruled that extreme intoxication does not constitute a mitigating factor, nor do the stresses that accompany living in hard times. State <em>v. Goulet, </em>283 Mont. 38, 42, 938 P.2d 1330, 1333 (1997) (showing of intoxication or anger insufficient to support mitigation); <em>State v. Martin, </em>2001 MT 83, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, 305 Mont. 123, 23 P.3d 216 (unemployment, homelessness, pregnant girlfriend do not support mitigation). MacGregor presented no evidence demonstrating provocation of his anger other than the challenges that naturally accompany sobriety, fatherhood, and marriage. Nor did any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>MacGregor\u2019s witnesses corroborate his involuntary intoxication defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b651 MacGregor claims that he only fired shots when his wife threatened to leave him, and that this constitutes a mitigating factor. Testimony at trial revealed that Jennifer refused to live with MacGregor <em>without their live-in nanny, </em>saying that if Betsy were fired, \u201cI can\u2019t live like this\u201d and \u201c[i]f she goes, I go.\u201d MacGregor then began to threaten Jennifer by putting the gun to her forehead and under her chin. When Jennifer pushed him away and began to run out the door, MacGregor shouted Tw]ait baby, please don\u2019t do this.\u201d When Jennifer stopped and turned to face MacGregor, he shot her in the chest, and went on to shoot Betsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b652  Jennifer\u2019s insistence on a live-in nanny is distinguishable from the passions and jealousies ignited when a romantic partner ends a relationship. <em>See State v. Gratzer, </em>209 Mont. 308, 682 P.2d 141 (1984); <em>State v. Azure, </em>2002 MT 22, 308 Mont. 201, 41 P.3d 899. The fact that one\u2019s spouse wants a nanny is not a reasonable excuse for extreme mental or emotional distress that results in deadly violence. Because MacGregor did not prove any mitigating factors as a matter of law, the instruction did not rise to a level of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b653 <em>Did the District Court improperly impose parole conditions?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u00b654 Finally, we review sentences for legality to determine whether they are within statutory parameters. <em>State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 41, 331 Mont. 471, 133 P.3d 206. At sentencing, the District Court imposed a period of incarceration, restitution to Betsy and Jennifer, and prohibited MacGregor from seeing Betsy or Jennifer. While the parole board has sole authority to impose conditions of release upon parole, the original judgment may impose conditions for the entirety of an individual\u2019s sentence, even when they are later paroled. <em>State v. Burch, </em>2008 MT 118, \u00b6\u00b6 22-29, 342 Mont. 499, 183 P.3d 66; \u00a746-23-216, MCA, (\u2018The period served on parole must be considered service of the term of imprisonment....\u201d). Where a district court lacks statutory authority to impose a sentence, its conditions may be considered recommendations to the parole board if parole is granted. <em>State v. Heafner, </em>2010 MT 87, \u00b6 6, 356 Mont. 128, 231 P.3d 1087 (TT]he District Court did not have the power to impose conditions upon a future parole that might be granted to Heafner. If Heafner is paroled then the Board of Pardons and Parole may impose conditions of parole and may consider those listed by the District Court as recommendations.\u2019); <em>State v. Holt, </em>2011 MT 42, \u00b6 18, 359 Mont. 308, 249 P.3d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\u00b655 MacGregor contends that the District Court unlawfully imposed conditions upon parole by stating that his sentence conditions would apply even if released on parole. MacGregor points to no specific condition, but only contests that the conditions of his sentence should not apply to him if he is later paroled. While the District Court may not impose conditions of parole, it is statutorily authorized to impose some of the conditions in the order, such as the requirement that he pay restitution to his victims. Section 46-18-201(5), MCA. It would be illogical for the District Court to require MacGregor to pay restitution only when he was incarcerated and not when paroled, and the court properly exercised its authority in imposing that condition. To the extent the conditions imposed govern his behavior on parole, the conditions may be viewed as the District Court\u2019s recommendations to the parole board. Only the parole board, however, may impose conditions on MacGregor for the purposes of parole. The District Court properly exercised its authority in adopting the PSR\u2019s recommended conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b656 For the reasons stated above, the MacGregor\u2019s convictions and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b188-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES RICE, BAKER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
