Ted O. Lympus (Judge Lympus). Fletcher was represented by attorney Lane Bennett (Bennett) who helped him negotiate a plea agreement with the prosecutor. Pursuant to the agreement, the State would request only 40 years imprisonment with 20 suspended in exchange for Fletcher\u2019s plea of guilty. At his change of plea hearing, Fletcher acknowledged that Judge Lympus was not bound by the plea agreement and that he could face a harsher sentence than that outlined in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b62 At sentencing, Judge Lympus handed down an oral order imposing a 40-year sentence with 20 suspended. The sentence also required that Fletcher complete the Sexual Offender Program (SOP) I and II in the Montana State Prison, and imposed a 10-year restriction on eligibility for parole. However, Fletcher interpreted the sentence to require SOP I and II only if professionals determined that he needed such a program, and also believed that he would not need to complete the SOP conditions before becoming eligible for parole. When the written sentence was issued, Fletcher was concerned that the SOP and parole conditions were inconsistent with the oral pronouncement of his sentence in that he was required to complete SOP I and II outright, and he would not be eligible for parole until after completion of these conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b63 In his petition for Post-Conviction Relief (PCR), Fletcher argued that his sentence was unfair because the judge used personal feelings against him and did not give adequate reason for the 10-year parole restriction, and also asserted an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (IAC). Fletcher never raised the inconsistency of his oral and written sentence in his PCR petition. The District Court dismissed the petition without a hearing. It is from this dismissal that Fletcher now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">STATEMENT OF ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">\u00b64 <em>Issue One: Are Fletcher\u2019s challenges to the legality of his sentence procedurally barred?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">\u00b65 <em>Issue Two: Was Fletcher denied effective assistance of counsel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b66 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for post-conviction relief to determine whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. We do not review issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Ellenburg v. Chase, </em>2004 MT 66, \u00b6 18, 320 Mont. 315, 87 P.3d 473. IAC claims present mixed issues of law and fact which we review de novo. <em>State v. Clary, </em>2012 MT 26, \u00b6 13, 364 Mont. 53, 270 P.3d 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b67 <em>Are Fletcher\u2019s challenges to the legality of his sentence procedurally barred?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u00b68 Fletcher challenges his sentence on the grounds that the District Court\u2019s oral pronouncement at sentencing differed from the written order. He further argues that a hearing should have been conducted to modify or clarify his sentence. However, Fletcher raises both of these arguments for the first time on appeal, so they are barred as a matter of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\u00b69 All grounds for post-conviction relief claimed by a petitioner must be raised in the original or amended original petition. Section 46-21-105(l)(a), MCA. We do not review issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 18. In a PCR petition that includes an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, defendant may raise all claims that were foreclosed by his counsel\u2019s abandonment of appeal. <em>In re Hans, </em>1998 MT 7, \u00b6 19, 288 Mont. 168, 958 P.2d 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">\u00b610  Petitioner states that he raised the inconsistency of his sentence in his PCR petition, as well as in his PCR reply brief. In fact, he raised the issue in neither document. In his PCR petition, Fletcher states that his 10-year parole restriction was handed down without reason, but does not contest the consistency of oral and written judgments. Further, his PCR reply brief raises only an ineffective assistance of counsel claim alleging that Fletcher\u2019s attorney failed to seek clarification of the parole eligibility restriction. Nothing in Fletcher\u2019s motions or briefs at the PCR or trial stage challenges the legality of the oral or written sentence on.account of contradictory or ambiguous terms. As such, the inconsistency of his sentence is raised for the first time on appeal, and it is barred as a matter of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"AFi\">\u00b611 <em>Was Fletcher denied effective assistance of counsel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">\u00b612 Fletcher also claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorney (1) failed to ensure he understood the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>agreement, (2) failed to seek clarification of the oral and written judgments, and (3) failed to preserve Fletcher\u2019s right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b613 To determine if an individual has received ineffective assistance of counsel, we use the two-part test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984); <em>State v. Miner, </em>2012 MT 20, \u00b6 11, 364 Mont. 1, 271 P.3d 56. Under this test, the defendant must demonstrate (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. <em>Miner, </em>\u00b6 11. LAC claims must be grounded on facts in the record and not on mere conclusory allegations. <em>State v. Finley, </em>2002 MT 288, \u00b6 9, 312 Mont. 493, 59 P.3d 1132. If an insufficient showing is made regarding one prong of the test, there is no need to address the other prong. <em>Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 21, 301 Mont. 135, 10 P.3d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b614 Under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>first prong, we examine whether counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness considering prevailing professional norms, and in the context of all circumstances. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 14. Counsel\u2019s conduct is strongly presumed to be within professional norms, and a plaintiff must \u2018identify the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 16 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2066). We then examine these acts or omissions in light of all circumstances to determine whether it falls below the standard of reasonable professional conduct. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 16. Under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>second prong, we examine whether there is a reasonable probability that counsel\u2019s lack of reasonable professional conduct renders the trial result unreliable or the proceedings fundamentally unfair. <em>Miner, </em>\u00b6 12. \u2018If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice ... that course should be followed.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b615 First, Fletcher\u2019s attorney sufficiently explained the risks and benefits of a guilty plea in this situation. In <em>State v. Cameron, </em>we found that a defendant sufficiently understood the consequences of his plea when his lawyer explained the plea, as well as when the trial judge interrogated him to ensure his understanding. <em>State v. Cameron, </em>253 Mont. 95, 102, 830 P.2d 1284. Bennett and Fletcher agreed that he had little chance for acquittal at trial because of eyewitnesses and DNA evidence. Bennett\u2019s affidavit demonstrates that he warned Fletcher that the Court could sentence him more harshly than the plea agreement recommendations. Under these circumstances, Bennett\u2019s conduct was that of a reasonable professional, so Fletcher\u2019s claim fails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the first prong of <em>Strickland. </em>But even if Bennett had failed to inform his client about the risk of a greater sentence, Fletcher acknowledged at his change of plea hearing that the Court could hand down a harsher sentence than the plea agreement. As such, Fletcher was not prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s failure to explain the plea agreement, so his claim also fails the second prong of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b616 Second, Fletcher was not prejudiced by Bennett\u2019s failure to clarify the ambiguity of the oral judgment or his failure to object to the written judgment. Although the oral version of a sentence is controlling, written judgments may help clarify an ambiguous oral sentence. <em>State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, \u00b6\u00b6 36-40, 288 Mont. 286, 957 P.2d 9; <em>State v. Waters, </em>1999 MT 229, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, 296 Mont. 101, 987 P.2d 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b617 Here, the District Court\u2019s oral judgment was certainly ambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">[T]he defendant\u2019s consideration for eligibility for parole is restricted from the first 10 years of this sentence ... [T]he defendant will be required to successfully comflete [sic]-eomplete the sex offender program SOP Program Level 1, as well as SOP Level 2 prior to being-if that is deemed appropriate by the administrators of the program at Montana State Prison. Both then, SOP I and II are to be-successfully completed prior to consideration for parole eligibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b618 As Fletcher argues, the oral sentence conditions regarding his parole eligibility and SOP requirements could be subject to several possible interpretations. However, Fletcher also concedes that one of those possible interpretations is the sentence outlined by the written judgment: \u2018It was the order of this Court that the Defendant shall not be eligible for parole for ten (10) years. It was further the order of this Court that the Defendant shall not be eligible for parole unless and until he successfully completes Sex Offender Treatment Program I and II.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u00b619 Had Bennett requested clarification of the oral judgment, the judge would have likely clarified his order at that time. Fletcher was not prejudiced simply because he was surprised by the written order\u2019s clarification of his sentence. Because the written order legally clarified the oral sentence, Bennett\u2019s objection to the written order would have had no legal consequence for Fletcher. Further, it is irrelevant that the Flathead Prosecutors prepared the written order because Judge Lympus demonstrated his actual intent by signing the order. Accordingly, Fletcher\u2019s IAC claim regarding inconsistency of sentence fail the second prong of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\u00b620  Finally, Fletcher asserts that Bennett refused to preserve his right to appeal his sentence. But Bennett did not refuse his client\u2019s wish for an appeal, instead, he warned Fletcher that he had slim chance for a successful appeal to this Court because his sentence was legal. Further, Bennett advised Fletcher that the proper remedy for appealing his sentence was at the Sentence Review Board (SRB). This advice is not in error, and it is irrelevant that another lawyer would have acted differently by warning Fletcher about the risks of SRB. <em>State v. Turner, </em>2000 MT 270, \u00b6 7, 302 Mont. 69, 12 P.3d 934. (\u2018The fact that some other lawyer ... would have done differently ... is not ground for branding the appointed attorney with the opprobrium of ineffectiveness. ...\u201d). Therefore, Bennett\u2019s actions were those of a reasonable professional under the circumstances, and Fletcher\u2019s third claim fails the first prong of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b621 Fletcher\u2019s challenges to the legality of his sentence are procedurally barred. Fletcher was not denied effective assistance of counsel. We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Fletcher\u2019s PCR petition.</p>\n<judges id=\"b57-6\">JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
