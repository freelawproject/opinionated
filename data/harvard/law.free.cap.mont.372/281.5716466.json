We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">1. <em>Whether Montana\u2019s sexual abuse of children statute, \u00a745-5-625(l)(c), MCA, sweeps too broadly in violation of the First Amendment and the Commerce Clause?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">2. <em>Whether the District Court properly authenticated and admitted extensive internet chat logs into evidence?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">\u00b63 Fergus County Deputy Sheriff Troy D. Eades (Eades) conducted an online investigation of child enticement as part of the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (ICACTF). Eades represented himself as \u2018Lissa,\u201da 14-year-old female from Montana. The 50-year-old Hantz lived in Fremont, California. Hantz first contacted Lissa on November 10, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">\u00b64 Hantz found Lissa through the teenage-oriented social networking website TeenSpot.com. Hantz initially contacted Lissa through TeenSpot.com\u2019s instant messaging system. Hantz asked Lissa her age, gender, and location. Lissa responded that she was a 14-year-old female from Montana. Hantz moved his conversation with Lissa from the TeenSpot.com instant messenger service onto the Yahoo instant messaging service.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">\u00b65 The tone of Hantz\u2019s conversation with Lissa changed quickly on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the Yahoo instant messaging service. Hantz asked Lissa if she had seen a man naked, or if she had been naked with a man. Hantz told Lissa that he wanted to get naked with her. Hantz wanted to masturbate while Lissa watched on a webcam. Hantz asked Lissa for permission to masturbate while she watched. Lissa briefly and affirmatively responded to each of Hantz\u2019s statements and questions. Hantz shared his webcam feed with Lissa, and proceeded to masturbate on the live webcam feed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b66 Hantz asked Lissa to confirm that she was \u201creally 14.\u201d Lissa answered yes, and then asked Hantz if he liked younger girls. Hantz replied with \u201coh yea.\u201d Hantz continued to ask Lissa about her sexual experiences. Hantz also made sexual references to Lissa. Shortly thereafter Hantz invited Lissa to join him in mutual masturbation. Hantz expressed his wish that Lissa had a webcam so that he could watch her.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b67 Hantz chatted online with Lissa ten times over the next four months. Each conversation proceeded similarly to the November 10, 2010, conversation. Each conversation included references to Hantz masturbating. Hantz broadcasted his masturbation over his webcam several times. Hantz made references to sexual activities with younger females during this time. Hantz claimed to have had sexual intercourse with a 17-year old female named \u201clori.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b68 Hantz engaged in five chats with Lissa during February 2011. Hantz requested that Lissa remove her clothing several times over the course of these chats. Hantz also directed to Lissa to masturbate in each of these chats. Hantz lastly made several references to his potential plans to travel to Montana to meet Lissa in person. Hantz apparently intended to engage in various sexual activities with Lissa.</p>\n<p id=\"AI5\">\u00b69 Eades obtained an arrest warrant for Hantz based on Hantz\u2019s potential travel plans. A Fremont, California detective, who also served as a member of the ICACTF, arrested Hantz on February 25, 2011. The Fremont police informed Hantz that they had an arrest warrant for him from Montana. Hantz claimed that there had been a misunderstanding, and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b610 The Fremont police confiscated Hantz\u2019s computer. The Fremont police found evidence of a search for airline tickets on the internet travel site Priceline.com for a flight from San Jose, California to Great Falls. The Fremont police also found copies of each of the online chats between Hantz and Lissa.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\u00b611 The Fremont police further found records of online chats between Hantz and other online personas who had represented themselves as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>female minors. These collateral chats had occurred during the same time period as Hantz\u2019s chats with Lissa. Each of the collateral chats generally followed the same pattern as Hantz\u2019s online chats with Lissa.</p>\n<p id=\"Am8\">\u00b612 The State of Montana (State) charged Hantz on February 24, 2011, with two counts of felony sexual abuse of children, in violation of \u00a745-5-625(l)(c), MCA. The State specifically charged Hantz with two counts of knowingly having counseled Lissa, a person online whom Hantz had believed to be a 14-year-old female, to remove her clothing and engage in \u201cmasturbatory conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b613 Hantz sought to dismiss both charges on the basis that \u00a745-5-625(l)(c), MCA, unconstitutionally limited his freedom of speech as protected by both federal and state constitutions due to the statute\u2019s overbreadth, both on its face and as applied to his conduct. Hantz further claimed that \u00a7 45-5-625(l)(c), MCA, violated the federal Commerce Clause. The District Court denied Hantz\u2019s motion in a written order.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b614 Hantz filed a motion in limine to exclude the collateral chats. Hantz apparently never filed a brief in support of his motion in limine. The District Court denied Hantz\u2019s motion before trial. Hantz proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b615 The State requested permission to introduce the collateral chats between Hantz and the other online personas on the third day of trial. The District Court reviewed the 2,500 pages of online chat conversations outside the jury\u2019s presence. The District Court characterized the 2,500 pages of online chat conversations as \u201cnon-testimonial in nature\u201d and therefore determined the chats \u201cc[ould] be admitted without running afoul of the confrontation clause.\u201d The District Court then determined that the 2,500 pages could be offered \u2018to establish motive, intent or absence of mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b616 Hantz objected to the admission of any collateral chats that involved persons other than Lissa on the basis that admission of the chats would be cumulative evidence. The District Court determined that a cautionary instruction would remedy any potential prejudice. The District Court delivered the cautionary instruction over Hantz\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u00b617 Hantz claimed at trial that he thought that he had been \u201crole playing\u201d with an adult woman in the online chat. Hantz claimed that he thought the adult woman with whom he had been chatting merely pretended to be a 14-year-old. The jury found Hantz guilty of both counts. Hantz appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b618 This Court exercises plenary review of constitutional issues. <em>DeVoe v. City of Missoula, </em>2012 MT 72, \u00b6 12, 364 Mont. 375, 274 P.3d 752. We review for correctness a district court\u2019s decisions on constitutional issues. <em>DeVoe, </em>\u00b6 12. Statutes enjoy a presumption of constitutionality. <em>DeVoe, </em>\u00b6 12. The party who challenges the constitutionality of a statute bears the burden of proof. <em>DeVoe, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"AN1\">\u00b619 We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. <em>State v. Bishop, </em>2012 MT 259, \u00b6 31, 367 Mont. 10, 291 P.3d 538. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in a substantial injustice. <em>Bishop, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b620 <em>Whether Montana\u2019s sexual abuse of children statute, </em>\u00a7 <em>45-5-625(l)(c), MCA, sweeps too broadly in violation of the First Amendment and the Commerce Clause?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\u00b621 Hantz asserts that Montana\u2019s sexual abuse of children statute, \u00a7 45-5-625(1)(c), MCA, sweeps too broadly when it criminalizes any means of communication that serve to induce a child under 16 to engage in sexual conduct. Section 45-5-625(1)(c), MCA, provides that a person commits the offense of sexual abuse of children if the person knowingly \u201cpersuades, entices, counsels, or procures a child under 16 years of age or a person the offender believes to be a child under 16 years of age to engage in sexual conduct, actual or simulated.\u201d Section 45-5-625(1)(c), MCA. Section 45-5-625(5)(b)(i)(D), MCA, specifically defines sexual conduct to include actual or simulated masturbation.</p>\n<p id=\"A2E\">\u00b622 A challenged statute\u2019s overbreadth must be both real and substantial when judged in relation to a statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep. <em>State v. Nye, </em>283 Mont. 505, 515, 943 P.2d 96, 103 (1997); <em>State v. Ross, </em>269 Mont. 347, 353, 889 P.2d 161, 164 (1995). Hantz must show that the alleged overbreadth presents both \u201creal\u201d and \u201csubstantial\u201d threats to speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive and to address, both as applied to himself and to others. Hantz concedes that Montana\u2019s sexual abuse of children statute serves a plainly legitimate purpose: to protect children from sexual predators and sexual exploitation. Hantz must demonstrate, therefore, that \u00a745-5-625(l)(c), MCA, would have a real and substantial effect on any speech beyond the statute\u2019s legitimate purpose. Nye, 283 Mont. at 515, 943 P.2d at 103; <em>Ross, </em>269 Mont. at 353, 889 P.2d at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\u00b623 Hantz asserts that the term \u201ccounsels\u201d in \u00a745-5-625(l)(c), MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>serves to \u201ccriminaliz[e] constitutionally protected speech because the law as written, even with the \u2018knowingly1 element\u201d fails to distinguish between lawful and unlawful conduct. Hantz points to various online publications that \u00a745-5-625(1)(c), MCA, allegedly would cover. Hantz includes the masturbation section of Columbia University\u2019s <em>Go Ask Alice </em>Health Services online question and answer database, the Planned Parenthood <em>Info for Teens </em>website and its guidance regarding masturbation, and others in his list. Hantz suggests that the detailed information provided by these websites about \u201csexuality, sex education, and \u2018how to\u2019 discussions\u201dfor masturbation would fall within the purview of \u00a745-5-625(1)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b624 Hantz\u2019s argument that websites that broadly provide sexual information fall within the purview of \u00a745-5-625(l)(c), MCA, fails to account for the \u2018knowingly\u201d element of \u00a745-5-625(1)(c), MCA. By its own terms Montana\u2019s sexual abuse of children statute applies only to those who \u201cknowingly\u201d persuade, entice, counsel, or procure a child to engage in sexual activity. The statute applies only when a sender transmits a message with the intent that a minor will view that communication. <em>Reno v. Am. Civil Liberties Union, </em>521 U.S. 844, 876, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 2347 (1997). As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Reno, </em>\u2018the sender must be charged with knowing that one or more minors will likely view [the message]\u201d in light of the size of the potential audience for most messages and the absence of a viable age verification process. <em>Reno, </em>521 U.S. at 876, 117 S. Ct. at 2347.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b625 The criminal act occurs, therefore, when an offender sends a message with the knowing intent to cause a minor to engage in sexual activity. Montana\u2019s sexual abuse of children statute does not reach those who draft, publish, or distribute publications that discuss human sexuality for a wide audience. Section 45-5-625(l)(c), MCA, likewise does not apply to those who post information regarding human sexuality for all internet users, either adults or children, to seek out and read at their discretion. The statute restricts no particular content. The statute prohibits no particular viewpoints. Section 45-5-625(l)(c), MCA, prohibits only a knowing communication with a minor that encourages the minor to engage in sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b626  This knowing communication element of Montana\u2019s sexual abuse of children statute prohibits application of the statute to broad communications to a general audience that may include minors. Hantz attempts to blur the line between a person who directly and clearly counsels a minor to engage in sexual conduct, and broad-based communicating about, regarding, or concerning human sexuality. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>knowing communication requirement of \u00a7 45-5-625(l)(c), MCA, narrowly tailors the statute\u2019s reach to apply only to conduct that would contravene the State\u2019s interest in protecting children from online sexual predators.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b627 Hantz next argues that \u00a745-5-625(1)(c), MCA, sweeps overbroadly as applied to his conduct. Hantz argues that application of Montana\u2019s sexual abuse of children statute to situations when an actor \u201cwas not present, had no physical contact with the underage individual, and any self masturbation [sic] was not used in any film or media\u201d fails to serve the statute\u2019s legislative purpose. Hantz argues that applying the statutory language to his alleged \u201cvirtual fantasy with no intention ... of making it anything else\u201d extends Montana\u2019s sexual abuse of children statute beyond constitutional validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b628 An \u201cas applied\u201d challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute focuses upon whether the statute is too vague to apply in a particular situation. <em>Nye, </em>283 Mont. at 516, 943 P.2d at 103. We will not strike the statute for vagueness if the challenged statute appears reasonably clear in its application. <em>Nye, </em>283 Mont. at 516, 943 P.2d at 103. We confine our \u201cas applied\u201d overbreadth evaluation to a determination of whether the statute reaches constitutionally protected conduct. <em>State v. Dugan, </em>2013 MT 38, \u00b6 52, 369 Mont. 39, 303 P.3d 755</p>\n<p id=\"AqQ\">\u00b629 Hantz\u2019s effort to entice Lissa, a person whom Hantz believed to be a 14-year-old girl, to engage in simultaneous masturbation over the internet clearly falls within the prohibition of \u00a745-5-625(1)(c), MCA. The State charged Hantz with knowingly counseling Lissa to engage in sexual conduct. The jury found Hantz guilty of violating the statute\u2019s prohibition on knowingly counseling a person under the age of 16 to engage in sexual conduct. Hantz fails to identify any unclear application of the statute to his conduct. Neither the U.S. Constitution nor the Montana Constitution provides protection for Hantz\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"ASI\">\u00b630 Hantz further argues that \u00a7 45-5-625(l)(c), MCA, violates the dormant Commerce Clause. The Commerce Clause grants Congress the power \u201c[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\u201dU.S. Const, art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3. Dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence interprets the federal Commerce Clause to prohibit implicitly certain state actions \u2018that interfere with interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Quill Corp. v. N.D. ex rel. Heitkamp, </em>504 U.S. 298, 309, 112 S. Ct. 1904, 1911 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b631 Hantz relies primarily on <em>American Libraries Association v. Pataki, </em>969 F.Supp. 160 (S.D.N.Y.1997), to support his dormant Commerce Clause argument. The federal court in <em>Pataki </em>invalidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>a New York statute that prohibited the intentional use of the internet to communicate pornography to children. <em>Pataki, </em>969 F.Supp. at 169. The federal court determined that the internet\u2019s lack of \u201cgeographic distinctions\u201dincluded the internet in the realm of interstate commerce. <em>Pataki, </em>969 F.Supp. at 170. The federal court feared that inconsistent legislation, \u201ctaken to its most extreme, could paralyze development of the [i]nternet altogether,\u201d despite the fact that New York had acted in its traditional role to protect minors and to enforce state laws. <em>Pataki, </em>969 F.Supp. at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b632 The federal court enjoined enforcement of the New York statute in <em>Pataki </em>because the federal court believed that internet content providers outside of New York might violate the statute unintentionally. <em>Pataki, </em>969 F.Supp. at 174-76. This hypothetical result could burden interstate commerce because the New York statute might chill internet content providers\u2019 activities, even though the content providers were operating legally in their own states. <em>Pataki, </em>969 F.Supp. at 174-76. The federal court determined that the states\u2019 varying approaches to pornographic communications could subject a single actor \u201cto haphazard, uncoordinated, and even outright inconsistent regulation by states that the actor never intended to reach and possibly was unaware were being accessed.\u201d <em>Pataki, </em>969 F.Supp. at 168-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b633  The reasoning in <em>Pataki </em>fails to protect Hantz\u2019s conduct from the reach of Montana\u2019s statute. Section 45-5-625(l)(c), MCA, requires a person to act \u201cknowingly\u201d when he seeks to persuade, entice, counsel, or procure a minor to engage in an illegal sex act. The knowing requirement of the statute greatly narrows the scope of the law and its effect on interstate commerce. We conceive of no legitimate commerce, interstate or otherwise, that involves a person who acts \u201cknowingly\u201d when he seeks to persuade, entice, counsel, or procure a minor to engage in an illegal sex act.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b634 Section 45-5-625(1)(c), MCA, likewise regulates no behavior that occurs wholly outside of Montana. Montana may prosecute only those criminal acts that occur within Montana. Section 45-1-104(2), MCA. The narrow focus of \u00a745-5-625(l)(c), MCA, further reduces concerns regarding inconsistent regulation. The federal court in <em>Pataki </em>concluded that \u201can Internet user cannot foreclose access to her work from certain states or send differing versions of her communications to different jurisdictions.\u201d <em>Pataki, </em>969 F.Supp. at 183. Section 45-5-625(l)(c), MCA, proscribes knowing communication with a minor for purposes of illegal sexual activity, and nothing else.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>\u00b635  The underlying assumption of <em>Pataki </em>that a ban on \u201ccommunications\u201d may interfere with an adult\u2019s legitimate free speech rights does not apply to a ban on a person acting \u201cknowingly\u201d when he seeks to persuade, entice, counsel, or procure a minor to engage in an illegal sex act. The State\u2019s effort to prevent a knowing communication by an adult with a person under 16 that focuses upon illegal sexual conduct constitutes a permissible regulation of commerce that fails to infringe unlawfully upon \u201c[c]ommerce ... among the several states.\u201d U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b636 <em>Whether the District Court properly authenticated and admitted extensive internet chat logs into evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b637 Hantz argues that the District Court committed reversible error when it admitted the collateral chats. Hantz specifically alleges that the prejudice of the collateral chat logs outweighs their probative value due to the 2,500 page length of the collateral chats. Hantz further alleges that the State failed to lay a proper foundation to admit the evidence due to the State\u2019s failure to prove that Hantz actually had chatted with underage girls, or merely had chatted with adults who held themselves out to be underage girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b638 TEJvidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims\u201d properly authenticates an evidentiary offer. M. R. Evid. 901(a). The State offered the collateral chats as evidence of sexually explicit online chats between Hantz and other personas who held themselves out to be young girls. The State did not need to prove the actual identity of the other personas. The State provided evidence sufficient for the District Court to determine that the collateral chats involved Hantz and personas who held themselves out as young girls. The nature of the chats showed that Hantz had engaged in sexually explicit chats with other personas who had held themselves out to be young girls. The State properly authenticated the evidentiary offer of the collateral chats.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u00b639 Montana Rule of Evidence 404(b) governs the admissibility of other crimes, wrongs, or acts. A district court possesses discretion when it determines whether other crimes evidence should be admissible under M. R. Evid. 404(b). <em>State v. Berosik, </em>2009 MT 260, \u00b6 28, 352 Mont. 16, 214 P.3d 776. Generally, evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior acts or crimes \u201cis not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d M. R. Evid. 404(b). Evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior acts or crimes may be admissible for other purposes, such as \u201cproof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>or accident.\u201d M. R. Evid. 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b640 Hantz earlier had filed a series of motions in limine to exclude various items of potential evidence pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404(b). One of Hantz\u2019s motions requested that the District Court exclude any \u201cwritten statement in the possession of any agency involved in the investigation of this case.\u201d The motion denoted evidence \u201cin the form of chats.\u201d Hantz\u2019s motion did not identify any specific chats for the District Court to evaluate. Hantz\u2019s motion further failed to advance any legal theory to exclude any particular chats. Hantz apparently also failed to file a brief in support of his motion in limine, despite claiming that he would do so during a July 26, 2012, pretrial conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b641 The District Court denied Hantz\u2019s motion in limine based upon Hantz\u2019s failure to \u201cspecifically identif[y] what statements [he] finds objectionable or how such statements constitute evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts.\u201d The District Court determined that Hantz had failed to cite any legal authority to support the exclusion of any written statements \u201cin the form of chats.\u201d The District Court further noted Hantz\u2019s failure to \u201cdemonstrate[ ] with argument or authority why the statements should be excluded.\u201d We decline to require more precise findings of fact and conclusions of law when a defendant fails to raise an argument sufficiently specific to allow a district court to conduct a meaningful review of the evidence in question. <em>State v. Dist. Court of Eighteenth Judicial Dist. of Montana, </em>2010 MT 263, \u00b6 49, 358 Mont. 325, 246 P.3d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b642 Hantz objected again at trial when the State sought to introduce the collateral chats. Hantz took exception to the potential cumulative nature of the chats. The District Court noted that Hantz had failed again to \u201ccite any authority,\u201d or to \u2018identify any of the specific information at issue\u201d when he raised his objection during trial. The District Court identified the difficult circumstances that Hantz\u2019s objection created during a hearing in chambers: \u201cthe Court finds itself in the middle of the trial now, on the third day, trying to make an assessment of the 404(b) factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b643 Hantz proffered the suggestion that the Court allow \u201cwhoever wants to testify about [the collateral chats], to testify that there were chats with other [sic],\u201dto obviate Hantz\u2019s \u201ccumulativeness\u201d concerns. The District Court declined Hantz\u2019s invitation. The District Court determined that computer \u201cgobbly gook\u201d constituted most of the 2,500 pages of collateral chats. The District Court further determined that the State had \u201cparsed out the parts involving the chats.\u201d The District Court concluded that Hantz\u2019s \u201c404(b) type motion [wa]s not in time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>[and] that [Hantz] didn\u2019t properly brief it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b644 The District Court articulated its rationale to admit the collateral chats: \u2018the facts contained in these documents[] undermined the defense\u2019s claim that Mr. Hantz\u2019s chats were harmless fantasy.\u201d The District Court set the prosecution \u201cat liberty to offer this into evidence.\u201d Upon admission of the evidence the District Court admonished the jury that the State\u2019s collateral chat \u201cevidence is not admitted to prove the character of the Defendant or to show that he acted in conformity therewith. The only purpose of admitting this evidence is to show identity knowledge and/or intent.\u201d The District Court further told that jury that \u2018[y]ou may not use this evidence for any other purpose. The Defendant is not being tried for the other crimes, wrongs or acts.\u201d A limiting instruction generally cures any unfair prejudice. <em>Dist. Court of Eighteenth Judicial </em>Dist., \u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b645  Hantz suggests that District Court\u2019s ruling prejudiced him because \u201cthere is a distinct likelihood that the jury convicted Hantz based on his being merely suspicious and indifferent about [Lissa]\u2019s age, rather than on a factual determination.\u201d We disagree. Hantz filed a broad motion in limine that did not identify specific documents to be excluded, the legal basis for excluding any of the collateral chats, or the reasons why the prejudice caused to Hantz from the admission of specific documents outweighed the probative value of those documents. Moreover, Hantz testified at trial that he believed that Lissa was an adult and that the two of them simply had been \u201crole playing\u201d that she was a minor and that he wanted to engage in sexual activities with her. As the District Court recognized, Hantz\u2019s defense strategy entitled the State to use the collateral chats to demonstrate motive, intent, and absence of mistake on Hantz\u2019s part as to the age of the person to whom he had been chatting. <em>State v.
