We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"App\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in dismissing a charge against Madsen under \u00a745-5-204, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b63 In 2011 Thomas Madsen was a Gallatin County Sheriffs Deputy. On February 9, 2011, K.J. was a female juvenile whose parents brought her to the Gallatin County Law &amp; Justice Center and requested law enforcement assistance in getting her transported to residential treatment. At the time of the incident involved in this case, officers detained K. J. in a small interview room, with her hands cuffed to a waist belt and shackles on her legs. When she attempted to turn off the light and lie on the floor, Madsen, who was outside the room, ordered her to sit at the table with the lights on and warned that if she did not do so she would \u201cfind [herself] in a whole world of hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b64 When K.J. did not comply with Madsen\u2019s orders he entered the room, grabbed her by the neck, and pushed her against the wall, banging her head. Another officer entered the room and separated Madsen from K. J. In his brief on appeal Madsen refers to the incident as a \u201cphysical control maneuver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\u00b65 On September 4, 2012, the State charged Madsen with mistreating prisoners, a felony offense, pursuant to \u00a745-5-204, MCA. Madsen subsequently moved to dismiss the charge, contending that K.J. was not a \u201cprisoner\u201d under that statute. The District Court agreed, holding that a \u201cprisoner\u201d under \u00a745-5-204, MCA, means only \u201can individual who is serving a sentence at the State prison or another State facility as the result of a conviction.\u201d The District Court dismissed the charge against Madsen because K.J. was a juvenile, she had not been convicted of an offense, and she was not being held in a State facility. The State appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">\u00b66 This Court reviews de novo, for correctness, a district court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss a criminal case, and its decision on the interpretation and construction of a statute. <em>State v. Dugan, </em>2013 MT 38, \u00b6 13, 369 Mont. 39, 303 P.3d 755 (dismissal of a criminal case); <em>State v. Brown, </em>2009 MT 452, \u00b6 6, 354 Mont. 329, 223 P.3d 874 (construction of a statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b67 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court correctly construed the term \u201cprisoner\u201das used in \u00a745-5-204, MCA. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">Mistreating prisoners. (1) A person commits the offense of mistreating prisoners if, being responsible for the care or custody of a prisoner, the person purposely or knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">(a) assaults or otherwise injures a prisoner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">(b) intimidates, threatens, endangers, or withholds reasonable necessities from the prisoner with the purpose to obtain a confession from the prisoner or for any other purpose; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">(c) violates any civil right of a prisoner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Section 45-5-204(1), MCA. The District Court concluded that the word \u201cprisoner\u201d in the statute is ambiguous. The District Court determined that the Legislature could have used another word besides \u201cprisoner\u201d and had done so in other statutes. The District Court analyzed the amendment history of the various statutes incorporated into the present \u00a7 45-5-204(1), MCA, and determined that the Legislature meant something narrow and restrictive by using the word \u201cprisoner.\u201d The District Court concluded that \u201cprisoner\u201d meant only a person who is serving a sentence at the State prison or another State facility as the result of a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">\u00b68 As noted, this Court reviews an issue of statutory interpretation as a question of law to determine whether the District Court\u2019s interpretation was correct. <em>Langemo v. Mont. Rail Link, </em>2001 MT 273, \u00b6 18, 307 Mont. 293, 38 P.3d 782. A judge\u2019s role in statutory interpretation is to \u201cascertain and declare what is in terms or substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. A court\u2019s function is to determine legislative intent, and where that can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used, the plain meaning controls and a court need not go further or apply other means of interpretation. <em>Gulbrandson v. Cary, </em>272 Mont. 494, 500, 901 P.2d 573, 577 (1995); <em>State v. Ankeny, </em>2010 MT 224, \u00b6 21, 358 Mont. 32, 243 P.3d 391. Statutory terms must be interpreted reasonably and logically, and given the natural and popular meaning in which they are usually understood. <em>Jones v. Judge, </em>176 Mont. 251, 254, 577 P.2d 846, 848 (1978); <em>Maney v. La. Pac. Corp., </em>2000 MT 366, \u00b6 19, 303 Mont. 398, 15 P.3d 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">\u00b69 The Legislature need not define every term it employs in a statute. If a term is one of common usage and is readily understood, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>court should presume that a reasonable person of average intelligence can understand it. The failure to include definitions of all terms does not automatically make a statute vague as long as the meaning is clear and provides a defendant with adequate notice of the proscribed conduct. <em>State v. Trull, </em>2006 MT 119, \u00b6 33, 332 Mont. 233, 136 P.3d 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b610 The common understanding of the word \u201cprisoner\u201d is that it describes a person who is held, confined or detained by someone else. The State correctly argued below that a \u201cprisoner\u201d commonly means a person whose liberty is restrained by law enforcement personnel, for any reason, including by reason of a conviction and sentence to a state prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court incorrectly determined that this argument only proved that the word \u201cprisoner\u201d in the statute was ambiguous. The fact that a term such as \u201cprisoner\u201d may apply to individuals in several different circumstances does not make it ambiguous, it only makes the term inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b611 The District Court\u2019s constrained definition of \u201cprisoner\u201d omits a wide range of people who can find themselves in some kind of detention. Those include but are not limited to anyone doing time in a county jail; anyone being held on charges waiting trial; anyone being held after arrest and awaiting an initial appearance; and, as in the present case, any detained juvenile. It is evident that the common understanding of the term \u201cprisoner\u201d varies from the narrow interpretation applied by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u00b612 The language of the statute itself suggests a broader definition of the word \"prisoner\u201d than the one adopted by the District Court. Subsection (l)(b) of \u00a745-5-204, MCA, expressly applies to situations where improper conduct is used to \u201cobtain a confession from the prisoner.\u201d While a confession might be sought from a person already convicted of a crime, generally a confession would most commonly be sought from a person who is detained after arrest or after being charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u00b613  The word \u201cprisoner\u201d is one in common usage with a common understanding. It is clear from the ordinary and common understanding of the word that \u201cprisoner\u201d includes a person detained by law enforcement officers, confined to a small room, and shackled hand and foot. Nothing in the statute or elsewhere in Montana law precludes application of the statute to the facts alleged in the information. The District Court\u2019s conclusion that such a person is not a \u201cprisoner\u201d is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b614  K. J. was a \u201cprisoner\u201d as provided in \u00a745-5-204(1), MCA, and the charging information filed in this case was adequate to state an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b615 The District Court is reversed and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b136-6\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, BAKER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\"> The State cited definitions of \u201cprisoner\u201d from <em>Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary </em>(10th ed.) (a person deprived of liberty and kept under involuntary restraint, confinement or custody); <em>American Heritage Dictionary </em>(5th ed.) (a person held in custody, captivity or a condition of forcible restraint, especially while on trial or serving a prison sentence); and <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(9th ed.) (a person who is serving time in prison; a person who has been apprehended by a law-enforcement officer and is in custody, regardless of whether the person has yet been put in prison).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b136-7\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AjS\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">\u00b616 The sum total of the Court\u2019s analysis of the legal question before us is to repeat seven times that the \u201ccommon\u201d meaning of the term prisoner\u201d requires that K. J. was one. This lay approach to the issue may be well suited for coffee Match world-problem-solving conducted at the corner caf\u00e9, but should not trump the application of legal principles governing this case. I believe the District Court properly applied the canons of statutory construction to reach its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"A3T\">\u00b617 As the District Court noted, the term \u201cprisoner\u201d is not as straightforward as the State contends, as even the dictionary definitions the State has offered tend to incorporate the idea that a prisoner is confined due to conviction, service of a prison sentence, or a pending trial on criminal charges. The Legislature has enacted various code provisions that define or use the term \u201cprisoner\u201d in connection with service of a prison sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a746-31-101, MCA (describing a \u201cprisoner\u201d as one who \u2018has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution\u2019); \u00a746-1-202(16), MCA (defining parole as \u2018the release to the community of a prisoner ... prior to the expiration of the prisoner\u2019s term\u2019). Similarly, the Legislature has commonly distinguished the term \"prisoner\u201d by using other terms to reference other detainees. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-32-2208, MCA (distinguishing an \u2018inmate committed to a detention center for trial or examination\u201d and \u201ca prisoner convicted\u201d of an offense); \u00a77-32-2144, MCA (a sheriff is entitled to state reimbursement for \u201cdelivering prisoners at the state prison or a juvenile correctional facility or mentally ill persons at the Montana state hospital\u2019). Consistent with this general distinction, the Criminal Law Commission Comments to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the subject statute, \u00a745-5-204, MCA, indicate that the statute was designed to support a \u201cpolicy that a sentence to imprisonment should be rehabilitative in nature. Clearly, little rehabilitation or reorientation to social norms can be accomplished when those responsible for the custody and care of prisoners mistreat them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b618 \u201c\u2018[A]mbiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S. Ct. 515, 522 (1971) (citing <em>Rewis v. United States, </em>401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S. Ct. 1056, 1059 (1971)). Our Court has likewise applied this \u201cclassic rule of construction of criminal statutes,\u201d sometimes referred to as the rule of lenity. <em>See State v. Goodwin, </em>249 Mont. 1, 23-24, 813 P.2d 953, 966-67 (1991); <em>but see State v. Turner, </em>262 Mont. 39, 49, 864 P.2d 235 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b619 \u2018We seek to implement the legislature\u2019s intent when we interpret a statute.\u201d <em>State v. Hicks, </em>2013 MT 50, \u00b6 19, 369 Mont. 165, 296 P.3d 1149 (citation omitted); \u00a7 1-2-102, MCA (\u2018In the construction of a statute, the intention of the legislature is to be pursued if possible.\u201d). The District Court closely analyzed this uncertain statute and, on the basis of the statutory context and legislative history, determined that the Legislature had not clearly expressed an intention to include detainees beyond those prisoners who are subject to a sentence of imprisonment. \u201c \u2018Statutory construction is a \u2018holistic endeavor\u2019 and must account for the statute\u2019s text, language, structure, and object.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 126, \u00b6 24, 321 Mont. 280, 90 P.3d 426 (citation omitted). \u201cWhen the plain meaning of a statute is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation... we will examine the legislative history to aid our interpretation.\u201d <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b620 I agree with the District Court\u2019s analysis and its conclusion that the Legislature did not clearly extend this statute to the acts alleged to have been committed by Madsen. Further, it is not our duty to extend it. \u201c[Ljegislatures and not courts should define criminal activity.\u201d <em>Bass, </em>404 U.S. at 348, 92 S. Ct. at 523. While there are other statutes under which Madsen could have been charged, I believe dismissal under this statute was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u00b621 I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-8\">JUSTICE McKINNON joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
