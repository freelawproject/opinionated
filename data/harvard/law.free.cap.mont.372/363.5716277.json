We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b62 We review the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment in Alfson\u2019s favor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\u00b64 On November 2, 2011, Allstate\u2019s insured, Jack McCoy (McCoy) rear-ended Alfson\u2019s pickup truck. Alfson declined medical treatment at the scene, but sought medical treatment following the collision. Dr. Rochelle Wolfe (Wolfe) wrote several short, unsworn letters advising that Alfson should not return to work due to his ongoing injuries. Since he could not return to work, Alfson demanded that Allstate pay his lost wages in advance of any settlement, supporting his request with Wolfe\u2019s letters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also submitted to Allstate a letter from his employer, Montana Rail Link, setting forth his wages for the month preceding the accident. Before paying the claimed lost wages, Allstate requested additional information, including medical records and tax returns. Alfson refused to produce this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">\u00b65 On January 12, 2012, Alfson filed the instant action, seeking a declaration requiring Allstate to issue advance payments for lost wages in the amount of $24,117.09. In early March, just after Allstate had filed its Answer and discovery requests, Alfson moved for summary judgment and supported his motion with the accident report, as well as the same letters from Wolfe and from Montana Rail link. He did not submit any sworn affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">\u00b66 In late March, Allstate moved for a continuance, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56(f)(2), so it could conduct additional discovery before responding to Alfson\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Allstate argued additional discovery was required, including a physical examination pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 35; and objected to Alfson\u2019s unsworn documentation. On April 25, 2012, Allstate made a specific motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>seeking a physical examination pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 35. On April 27, 2012, the District Court denied Allstate\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion and request for a Rule 35 examination, and granted summary judgment in Alfson\u2019s favor. In granting summary judgment, the Court permitted Alfson to submit supplemental wage loss documentation from his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\">\u00b67 On June 28, 2012, the District Court ordered that its order granting summary judgment be held in abeyance to allow Allstate to file a responsive brief in opposition to Alfson\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Allstate filed its opposing brief, along with supporting affidavits. On August 17, 2012, the District Court reinstated and reaffirmed its April 27 award of summary judgment to Alfson and denial of Allstate\u2019s request for Rule 56(f) relief. The District Court also denied Alfson\u2019s motion to compel. In reinstating its original summary judgment order, the District Court relied on Wolfe\u2019s letters. On December 4, 2012, the District Court issued a declaratory judgment requiring Allstate to advance pay Alfson\u2019s lost wages. On January 7, 2013, the District Court also issued an order requiring Allstate to pay costs and attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $3,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b68 Allstate appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b69 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the M. R. Civ. P. 56, criteria as applied by the district court. <em>In re Estate of Harmon, </em>2011 MT 84, \u00b6 14, 360 Mont. 150, 253 P.3d 821. Rule 56 provides that a party may move for summary judgment \u201cwith or without supporting affidavits.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(a). It also provides that the district court should grant summary judgment if\u2018the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b610 \u2018This Court reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation of law pertaining to a declaratory judgment ruling for correctness.\u201d <em>Med. Marijuana Growers Ass\u2019n v. Corrigan, </em>2012 MT 146, \u00b6 14, 365 Mont. 346, 281 P.3d 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\u00b611 If a party moves for summary judgment without supporting affidavits, a court may only consider the pleadings and the discovery and disclosure materials on file in granting summary judgment. <em>See </em>M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2) (\u2018The judgment sought should be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d); <em>Frenchtown Rural Fire District v. Ross, </em>No. DV-11-734, 2011 Mont. Dist. LEXIS 57, **20-21 (4th Jud. Dist. Nov. 1, 2011) (in weighing a motion for summary judgment, the court would only consider the pleadings and relevant affidavits). A court need only consider admissible evidence in deciding whether summary judgment is an appropriate remedy. <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe v. Roman Catholic Church, </em>2013 MT 24, \u00b6 21, 368 Mont. 330, 296 P.3d 450; <em>see Hiebert v. Cascade County, </em>2002 MT 233, \u00b6 35, 311 Mont. 471, 56 P.3d 848 (excluding several exhibits supporting a summary judgment brief on the basis that they constituted \u201cinadmissible hearsay\u2019). Authentication, or setting forth \u201cevidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims,\u201d is a \u201ccondition precedent to admissibility.\u201d M. R. Evid. 901(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b612 In <em>Disler v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>2000 MT 304, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, 302 Mont. 391, 15 P.3d 864, we determined that, where three loan documents were simply attached to the non-movant\u2019s brief opposing summary judgment, we would not consider them on review of the district court\u2019s decision. We reasoned that \u201cwithout an affidavit or sworn discovery response of [an individual]... with personal knowledge of the genuineness, relevance and contents of the documents [(as required by M. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(1))], the attachments ... were little more than inadmissible hearsay.\u201d <em>Disler, </em>\u00b6 11. Because no such sworn authentication for the documents\u2019 contents existed, we based our decision only on the pleadings, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file in the case and in the public record. <em>Disler, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"A5x\">\u00b613 For items not enumerated in Rule 56 to be properly considered in support of a summary judgment motion, they must be authenticated by a sworn affidavit or discovery response. <em>See </em>M. R. Evid. 901 (authentication is a condition precedent to admissibility; describing means by which evidence may be authenticated); <em>see also </em>M. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(1) (\u2018If a paper or part of a paper is referred to in an affidavit, a sworn or certified copy must be attached to or served with the affidavit.\u2019); <em>see also Disler, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 13. In <em>Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner &amp; Co., </em>896 F.2d 1542, 1550-51 (9th Cir. 1990), the Ninth Circuit stated: \u201cIt is well established that unauthenticated documents cannot be considered on a motion for summary judgment .... A document which lacks a proper foundation to authenticate it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>cannot be used to support a motion for summary judgment.\u201d (Citations omitted.) We expressly adopted this rule in <em>Smith v. Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry., </em>2008 MT 225, \u00b6\u00b6 47-48, 344 Mont. 278, 187 P.3d 639. We explained that exhibits may be submitted in support of an affidavit only \u201cso long as they are accompanied by an affidavit or sworn discovery response of an individual with personal knowledge of their genuineness, relevance, and contents, or there is a foundation laid for such exhibits based on any exception to the rule excluding hearsay evidence.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>\u00b6 39 (citing <em>Hiebert, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-32; <em>Disler, </em>\u00b6 11) (internal quotation omitted). Here, having filed the declaratory action and then seeking summary judgment, Alfson was obligated to comply with our rules governing summary judgment by submitting in support of his motion only properly authenticated supporting documents. He failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\">\u00b614  The District Court incorrectly granted summary judgment to Alfson. In granting summary judgment, the District Court considered and relied upon Wolfe\u2019s letters, as well as the letter from Montana Rail Link. These informal letters were not supported by sworn affidavits or discovery responses. Alfson submitted no evidence of their genuineness, relevance, or the qualifications of their preparers. Without supporting affidavits \u201cmade on personal knowledge, [that] set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant is competent to testify on the matters stated,\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(1), these items lack the authentication for admissibility. It was, therefore, improper for the court to consider them in granting summary judgment. The District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Alfson\u2019s favor, and declaratory judgment based on that summary judgment grant, are legally infirm and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b615 Because we reverse the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and a declaratory judgment in Alfson\u2019s favor, we remand this matter to the District Court. We decline to address the other issue Allstate raises in its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b616 Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-6\">JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-11\"> Although Alfson\u2019s request for advance payment does not appear in the record, Allstate\u2019s response, dated January 6, 2012, does. Based on Allstate\u2019s response, we assume that Alfson\u2019s letter exists and was supported by the documents Allstate claims it was in its brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
