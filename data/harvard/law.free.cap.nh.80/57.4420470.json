The plaintiffs were indebted to the defendant Smith on January 20, 1917, in the sum of $2,800, and on that date Smith assigned his claim to the defendant Thompson to secure him as surety on notes made by Smith, aggregating $3,500. October 30,1917, the defendants Fellows &amp; Son sued Smith and summoned the plaintiffs as trustees. Later, the plaintiffs were notified of the assignment and filed this petition malting Smith, Thompson and Fellows &amp; Son, defendants. Transferred by <em>Sawyer, </em>J., on Fellows <em>&amp; </em>Son's exception to a decree for Thompson, from the April term, 1920, of the superior court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Stevens, Couch &amp; Stevens, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-5\"><em>Nathaniel E.

It is conceded that it (1) was made in good faith, (2) has a sufficient consideration to sustain it and (3) that the money in the plaintiffs\u2019 hands is insufficient to save Thompson from loss, if he is compelled to pay all the notes he endorsed. It must be held, therefore, that the assignment is valid, for the mere fact the plaintiffs were not notified of the assignment until after they were summoned as trustees does not render the assignment invalid as to Fellows &amp; Son. <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Garney, </em>69 N.
