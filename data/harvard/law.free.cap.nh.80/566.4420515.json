Clark occupies a fiduciary position which entitles them for their protection to the prospective decision of questions which may hereafter arise and they cannot maintain this proceeding. <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Church, </em>77 N. H. 592. The trustees under Noah\u2019s will do not now need the advice of the court and they do not ask for it. There is no occasion for action by the trustees under Noah\u2019s will until after the death of his widow. \u201cIt is within the province of courts to. decide upon the rights of parties as they exist in the present, but it is not within their province, nor will they assume jurisdiction, to decide in advance what such rights may be in the future.\u201d <em>Gafney </em>v. <em>Kenison, </em>64 N. H. 354. Moreover the duty of distributing the residuum is not placed with the present board, for at the death of the widow the will appoints a trustee in her place. Upon the board as then constituted the duty of distribution devolves. That board may regard the question as too trivial to occupy the attention of the court. Cavanaugh, executor of Edward\u2019s will, says he wishes to be advised. The occasion for such advice is not apparent. He has already acted without waiting for the direction of the court. He has inventoried the interest as part of Edward\u2019s estate. It is not clear that he has occasion to do more until the time for collection arrives. But the case has been fully presented and the right of Cavanaugh as executor to be protected from annoyance by the further assertion of a baseless claim seems under the circumstances sufficient to authorize the announcement of the opinion of the court thereon. <em>Day </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>76 N. H. 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The interest of the legatees of the one-eighth parts of the residuum of Noah\u2019s estate under the 25th clause of the will vested at the death of Noah, there being no uncertainty as to their right of enjoyment, the right of possession only being deferred until the death of his widow, and upon the death of either before the time of distribution arrived, the bequest passed to the personal representatives of the deceased legatee in the absence of the expression of a contrary in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>tention in the will. <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>77 N. H. 94, 97; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Wiggin, </em>67 N. H. 89, 91; <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Durgin, </em>70 N. H. 121; <em>Crosby </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>64 N. H. 77; <em>Wiggin </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>64 N. H. 36, 39; <em>Kennard </em>v. <em>Kennard, </em>63 N. H. 303. The gift of personalty to the testator\u2019s children by this clause was absolute, equally with the gifts to them in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th clauses as to which they had the immediate right of enjoyment. The language upon which the present controversy is based, found in .the 26th clause of the will, \u201call bequests herein to wife, children and grandchildren are inalienable either by assignment or any other proceeding or process,\u201d applies equally by its terms to the gifts in each of the four clauses. \u201cAny provision restraining the alienation, voluntary or involuntary, of an estate in fee simple or an absolute interest in chattels real or personal, whether legal or equitable, is void.\u201d Gray, Restraints on Alienation, s. 279 A <em>(p. </em>192); <em>Ib., ss. </em>27, 105; <em>Edgerly </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>66 N. H. 434, 454; 40 Cyc. 1713. The cases <em>Wolfman </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>77 N. H. 24; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>O\u2019Loughlin, </em>76 N. H. 481, have no application. In them the legatee\u2019s right was not absolute but dependent upon the discretion of a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">If as the language indicates, the testator intended to create in the legatees an absolute inalienable estate, he intended an illegal and impossible estate and his intention cannot be given effect. <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>75 N. H. 92; <em>Edgerly </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>66 N. H. 434; <em>Burleigh </em>v. <em>Clough, </em>52 N. H. 267, 271. But as effect must be given to the testator\u2019s intention if possible although the language of the will implies an intent to create an estate not permitted by law, if from the whole will a purpose to create an estate within legal limits can be found, effect will be given to the testator\u2019s intent so far as it is legal. <em>Edgerly </em>v. <em>Barker, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The testator intended to benefit his children. The attempt to secure the gift in their hands by prohibiting its alienation is evidence in addition to the gift itself. It is not probable he would not have made the gift if he had understood the restraint he undertook to impose upon it could not be given effect. It is of no importance, however, as to these eighths whether the gift fails because of the illegality of the condition imposed. If the gifts failed, so much of the estate would be undisposed of by the will and Edward as heir to one-third would be entitled to one of the three-eighths. This right would vest at Noah\u2019s death subject to the widow\u2019s life interest and at Edward\u2019s death pass to his representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The plaintiffs contend that the clause forbidding alienation transforms Edward\u2019s apparently absolute estate in one-eighth of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>residuum into a- life estate with a remainder or limitation over to his heirs. No authority is cited in support of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">\u201cEvery person of the age of twenty-one years, of sane mind, may devise and dispose of his property, real and personal, and of any right or interest he may have in any property by his last will in writing.\u201d P. S., c. 186, s. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">\u201cThe personal estate of a person deceased not bequeathed . . . shall be distributed ... in equal shares\u201d \u201cto the children of the \u2022deceased.\u201d P. S., c. 196, s. 6, and s. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">If Edward at his death had any right or interest in the one-eighth of the residuum given him by the 25th clause of Noah\u2019s will it passed by his will by force of the statute. The plaintiffs can take no part of the estate of Edward by force of the statute of distributions because under that they are entitled as children of Edward to share only in a distribution of \u201cthe personal estate . . . not bequeathed,\u201d and Edward\u2019s will bequeathed all of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">If the plaintiffs can take anything they can take only because Noah\u2019s will gives it to them. They must take by purchase under Noah\u2019s will and not by descent from Edward.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">If the words, \u201call bequests herein to wife, children and grandchildren are inalienable either by assignment or any other proceeding or process,\u201d could be construed to express an intention that the eighth interest bequeathed to Edward should terminate upon his death or if to effectuate the expressed intention it should be necessary to so construe the language, there is no expression of any intention that the eighth part should then go to Edward\u2019s children. If Noah had intended Edward\u2019s interest should be so terminated and had used language expressing such intention he could have made such further disposition of the eighth as he pleased, he could have given it to the daughters or to the charitable organization mentioned in the 16th clause. He could have given it to Edith or to Dana or to both of them. But he gave it to none of them. Under the will assuming Edward\u2019s title did not survive his death, the missionary society has just as good a title to the eighth as these plaintiffs have, which is none at all, because no intention to give it to them is expressed by the will. If the intention claimed had been entertained it would have been expressed in apt words. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>66 N. H. 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">\u201cThe construction of the will is the ascertainment of the testator\u2019s expressed intention, \u2014 what he meant by what he said.\u201d <em>Stratton </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>68 N. H. 582, 585. As no language can be found in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>will expressing an intention that the plaintiffs should have the eighth after Edward, the plaintiffs fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\">The executor Cavanaugh is advised that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b601-5\">Young, J., was absent: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
