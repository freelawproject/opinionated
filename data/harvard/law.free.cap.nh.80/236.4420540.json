He was under contract to saw pine timber upon a lot at Goffstown where electric power was not available. He therefore entered into negotiations with the defendant for the purchase of a kerosene engine to supply power in the place of his electric motor. The evidence tended to prove that he explained to the defendant\u2019s agent \u201cthoroughly\u201d and \u201cfully\u201d the uses for which he wanted the engine; that he stated to the agent that he thought he ought to have an engine of 65 horse power to operate his mill; that the agent thereupon told him that the defendant company had a 45 horse-power Davis engine that would be \u201csuitable\u201d to his wants, \u201cmeet every requirement,\u201d \u201cdo just as good work as the electric motor,\u201d and do the work \u201cjust as well,\u201d and that the plaintiff \u201cdid not need\u201d a 65 horse-power engine. At the same conference, but after the order was signed, the agent was taken to the mill and shown the electric motor and a blower not driven by the same motor.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The plaintiff first attempted to operate his sawmill at Amoskeag with the 45 horse-power engine and after some difficulty, with the aid of a man sent out by defendant at plaintiff\u2019s request, he \u201cgot it going\u201d and tried the mill out on some oak logs, but it did not work very well. From this trial the plaintiff \u201cdidn\u2019t think\u201d that the engine would do the work, but as the oak logs were \u201chard sawing\u201d and he \u201cwanted to give it a chance on pine\u201d he removed the engine with his mill to Goffstown, where, upon trial, the engine continued to show such lack of power that the mill \u201cwould absolutely stop right in the middle of a log\u201d and produced only about fifty per cent, of the daily cut usual for such a mill. The defendant sent to Goffstown its representative who conceded that the engine did not have sufficient power to run plaintiff\u2019s mill, although it tested 45 horse power. Thereupon the plaintiff requested the defendant to exchange the engine for a larger one, and a 65 horse-power engine was substituted nine or ten days later, during which time the mill was shut down. This engine ran the mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The defendant in its brief and argument contends (1) that there is no evidence that defendant\u2019s agent knew the true facts or that he had reason to believe that his representations were false; (2) that the alleged misrepresentations were non-actionable promises; (3) that the evidence conclusively shows that the plaintiff did not rely on defendant\u2019s representations; (4) that there was conclusive evidence of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence; and (5) that the plaintiff waived his right of action, if any, by availing himself of the right to exchange engines under the provisions of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">1. The defendant had been in business five years or more, was the agent for the sale of the Davis gasoline engine, and dealt more or less in electric motors. The defendant\u2019s agent qualified as an expert witness on power. He testified that the leading makers of electric motors rated their motors to \u201cdevelop a constant load of 25 per cent, over load, and temporary load of 40 to 50 per cent, over load;\u201d and that the plaintiff\u2019s motor would develop possibly 40 per cent, or \u201cnearer 15 horse power\u201d more than its rated capacity. It does not appear that plaintiff had this technical knowledge. It could be found from the foregoing that the defendant\u2019s agent knew or had reason to believe that the plaintiff\u2019s motor, although rated as 35 horse power, in fact developed 49 to 52 horse power temporary overload; that he nevertheless represented to plaintiff that the Davis engine which tested only 45 horse power would be suitable to his wants, meet every requirement, and \u201cdo just as good work\u201d as the plaintiff\u2019s motor. It could be further found that the margin of four to seven horse power between the relative capacities of the motor and the engine accounted for the insufficiency of the latter to operate the mill. While the defendant\u2019s agent at the trial declined to qualify as an expert on \u201csawmills,\u201d it does not appear that he advised the plaintiff of this limitation of his knowledge when he assumed to assert the sufficiency of the engine to operateHhe mill. It is the duty of one who volunteers information to another not having equal knowledge, with the intention that he will act upon it, to exercise reasonable care to verify the truth of his statements before making them. See 14 Harv. Law Rev. 189, 190, 197. \u201cA positive statement . . . not only includes a representation that the fact is as stated, but also the further representation that the maker knows it to be so.\u201d <em>Spead </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, </em>73 N. H. 46, 61. It could be found from the foregoing that the agent\u2019s statement constituted representations of material facts which he either knew or ought to have known were false. In this state, a person who acts upon a false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>representation made for the purpose of inducing him to change his position may recover the damages he sustains in an action of negligence when the maker of the statement ought to have known it to be false. <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Company, </em>74 N. H. 435, 437; <em>Shackett </em>v. <em>Bickford, </em>74 N. H. 57, 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The fact that the agent did not see the electric motor and the manner in which it was hitched up to the mill, with the blower driven by another motor, until after the order was signed, does not relieve the defendant. Plaintiff\u2019s writ counts, not on a breach of the contract, but upon negligence. Tf,. having reason to believe that the representations he had already made were untrue, and knowing that the plaintiff intended to act on them, the agent negligently allowed his misrepresentations to stand, his silence became as operative and misleading as a positive statement or act would have been, and when such is the case, a jury would be warranted in finding that the silent conduct had ceased being passive and had become an active misrepresentation. <em>Conway Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Pease, </em>76 N. H. 319, 326, 328, 335. In negligently allowing his misrepresentations to stand, the defendant\u2019s agent violated his legal duty none the less clearly because the plaintiff had already affixed his signature to the order for the engine.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">2. Representations by an expert on power to one not having equal knowledge as to the amount of energy which standard makes of motors and engines will develop, are not future promises, but are statements with reference to known facts based on tests and mathematical computations. Such representations differ materially from \u201csellers\u2019 talk\u201d or mere opinions expressed to one having equal knowledge or equal opportunities for knowledge. In \u201cthe case of an expert stating to a non-expert his opinion on matters requiring peculiar skill or knowledge ... it is difficult to see why a plaintiff (who acts reasonably in relying on the statement) may not recover against one who negligently volunteers an erroneous \u2018 opinion,\u2019 intending the plaintiff to act upon it, and knowing that substantial loss is likely to follow if the \u2018opinion\u2019 proves incorrect. . . . Negligent misstatement exists just the same, whether it be due to carelessness in forming a belief or to carelessness in the mode of expressing one\u2019s belief.\u201d 14 Harv. Law Rev. 197, 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">3. It is true that there was evidence of other inducements beside the representation in question, such as the lesser cost of the smaller engine, its lightness for moving, and possibly a quicker delivery, as the defendant had these engines in stock while the larger engine was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>only in transit. So, too, the contractual right for ten days to exchange the lighter for the heavier engine, with loss only of the extra freight charge and delay incident to the exchange, was an inducement. But it was not necessary that the agent\u2019s false representation as to the efficiency of the engine should have been the sole inducement to the contract. <em>Braley </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>92 Me. 203; <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Grout, </em>120 Mass. 20, 25; <em>Light </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>183 Mass. 206; <em>Sleeper </em>v. <em>Smith, 77 </em>N. H. 337, 339; <em>Scholfield Gear &amp; Pulley Co. </em>v. <em>Scholfield, </em>71 Conn. 1; <em>Handy v. Waldron, </em>19 R. I. 618; <em>Kley </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>127 N. Y. 555; <em>Ochs </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>221 N. Y. 335; <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>102 N. Y. 69. If the plaintiff would not have entered into the contract but for such representation, it was the proximate cause of his loss as the term is used in the law of torts. The fact that there were other contributing causes-not due to plaintiff\u2019s own negligence is not a defence. <em>Miner </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>78 N. H. 240, 241. The plaintiff testified that he relied \u201cabsolutely\u201d on the agent\u2019s statement and that otherwise he \u201cwouldn\u2019t have taken it [the engine] at all.\u201d This evidence is corroborated by his continued efforts at Amoskeag and at Goffstown to try out the engine. All inducements to the contract, including the defendant\u2019s negligent representation as to the sufficiency of the 45 horse-power engine to run plaintiff\u2019s mill, were competent evidence bearing upon the issue whether the plaintiff relied upon the latter, but no one or more of them is conclusive. \u201c The weight and reliability of competent evidence is to be determined exclusively by the jury.\u201d <em>Hewett </em>v. <em>Association, </em>73 N. H. 556, 567; <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Leighton, </em>79 N. H. 190, 191. It could be found that a man of average prudence would have relied upon the representations of an expert on power as to what an engine would accomplish when its proposed uses had been \u201cthoroughly\u201d and \u201cfully\u201d explained, and when, before the plaintiff was left to act upon the representations, the expert had examined the mill and the manner in which it was hitched up to its motive powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">4. But the defendant contends that the plaintiff was guilty of negligence in his failure to notify the defendant, after the trial of the engine at Amoskeag, that he \u201cdid not think it would do the work,\u201d and that he claimed misrepresentation; that the plaintiff had no right to take the engine to Goffstown at the risk of the defendant, relying upon representations which he then believed to be untrue. \u201cIf a misrepresentation is negligently made, or negligently allowed to stand, the party injured by relying upon it must show that he acted as a reasonably prudent man in so doing.\u201d <em>Conway Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Pease, supra, </em>328. Was there evidence from which it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>be found that the plaintiff acted with reasonable prudence in his continued reliance upon the defendant\u2019s representations? The engine was tried out at Amoskeag on oak logs. The plaintiff testified that the oak logs were \u201chard sawing\u201d and that he \u201cwanted to give it [the engine] a chance on pine,\u201d that sawing oak was a \u201cdifferent proposition,\u201d that it \u201ctook longer to saw oak than it did pine.\u201d Plaintiff had the engine on his hands. It had not been tried out in the sawing of pine upon which alone the representations had been based. Was he careless in giving it such a trial because, from his experience with oak, he \u201cdid not think\u201d that it would do the work with pine? Entertaining a belief upon insufficient evidence is not necessarily equivalent to being convinced. \u201cBetween mere belief and knowledge there is a wide difference.\u201d <em>Iron Silver Mining Company </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>124 U. S. 374, 384. Belief \u201cmay be a passive condition of the mind, prompting in neither action nor declaration.\u201d <em>Grube </em>v. <em>Wells, 34 </em>Ia. 148, <em>151. </em>\u201cBelief admits of all degrees, from the slightest suspicion to the fullest assurance.\u201d Webster\u2019s Inter. Die.; Shumaker &amp; Longsdorf Cyc. Dic. See also Allen\u2019s Synonyms and Antonyms. <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>9 Gray 271, 274. Whether plaintiff\u2019s belief as to the probable result of a further trial of the engine under the conditions contemplated in defendant\u2019s representations had become a mental state, having which a man of ordinary prudence would have ceased further trial, was a question of fact. At just what stage of experimentation a mental state of reliance becomes one of non-reliance cannot be fixed by a rule of law. In other words, plaintiff\u2019s belief, based upon an unsatisfactory trial under adverse conditions, was not conclusive evidence either that he had ceased to rely on defendant\u2019s assurances or that he was negligent in trying further to verify them. Plaintiff\u2019s persistence in continuing the trial of the engine at the hazard of delay in his own wor*k may as well be attributed to the abiding strength of the impression which the representations of an expert on power had made upon his mind as to a negligent disregard of the consequences to the defendant. \u201cUnless the carelessness of the plaintiff was so apparent that all fair-minded and reasonable men must agree that he was negligent, the case was properly submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Blood </em>v. <em>New Boston, </em>77 N. H. 464, 465; <em>Bourassa </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>75 N. H. 359, 360; <em>Miner </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><em>5. </em>Counsel claims that when the plaintiff signed the contract which provided for a right of exchange, he thereby agreed with the defendant as to what the remedy should be if the engine did not do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the work. This is not' a necessary inference. By the terms of the contract, the right to exchange engines is not predicated upon the inability of the engine to develop the power represented, but appears to be absolute. The right might be exercised by the plaintiff for any reason, such as a desire to enlarge his mill by the installation of additional machinery, or, for that matter, from mere whim or caprice. Therefore, to sustain defendant\u2019s contention as to the construction of the contract, it must appear from a consideration of all the competent evidence, that the parties intended the contractual right of exchange not only to safeguard the plaintiff from losses, if any, arising by reason of the failure of the engine to come up to expectations based upon defendant\u2019s non-actionable commendations, but as a remedy for any damages which the plaintiff might suffer from defendant\u2019s negligent misrepresentations of fact. A mere statement of the question is an answer to it, since it cannot be assumed that the parties mutually contemplated and provided a remedy for actionable misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">But the defendant contends that the exercise of the contractual right to exchange engines with a full knowledge of the incapacity of the 45 horse-power engine was a waiver as to the manner in which the contract had been obtained. If plaintiff was induced by the defendant\u2019s negligent misrepresentations to make an expensive experiment which he would not otherwise have made, the acceptance of the partial relief afforded by the exercise of his rights under his contract did not absolve the defendant from liability. It was the duty of the plaintiff to do what he reasonably could to avoid the effect of defendant\u2019s negligence. His failure to avail himself of the contractual right of exchange might have increased the damages flowing from the defendant\u2019s acts. The substitution of the larger for the smaller engine presumably lessened the loss to the plaintiff, and was material evidence upon the question of damages. The extent to which plaintiff was damaged by his reliance upon defendant\u2019s misrepresentations was a question of fact. <em>Conway Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Pease, supra, </em>335, 336. It must be assumed the defendant\u2019s rights in this regard were secured to it by instructions to the jury to which no exceptions were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b272-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
