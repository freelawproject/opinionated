Trial by jury, and verdict for the defendants. The plaintiff filed a motion \u201cto set aside the verdict and for a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the law and the evidence because the jury was misled by errors in instruction and evidence admitted and excluded in the trial.\u201d The motion was denied and the plaintiff then filed the following bill of exceptions, which was allowed at the January term, 1920, of the superior court by <em>Allen, </em>J.: \u201cThe plaintiff excepts to the denial of motion to set aside the verdict.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-11\"><em>James E.

None of the evidence has been stated in the bill of exceptions; therefore, if any exceptions were taken to the admission or exclusion of evidence, they are not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">An examination of the record discloses that an exception was taken by the plaintiff to an instruction of the court, which related solely to damages. The jury, having found that the defendants were not liable, \u201chad no occasion to consider the question of damages.\u201d Therefore, if the court\u2019s instruction in reference to damages was incorrect, it was immaterial. <em>Kuba </em>v. <em>Devonshire Mills, 78 </em>N. H. 245; <em>Woodbury </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>68 N. H. 607; <em>Wier </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>51 N. H. 177,180. Consequently there is no reason to consider whether the instruction, to which exception was taken, was erroneous. \u201cA verdict is not set aside for an error which the course of the trial renders immaterial.\u201d <em>Kuba </em>v. <em>Devonshire Mills, supra; Beckley </em>v. <em>Alexander, 77 </em>N. H. 255, 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b119-16\">Peaslee,\u2019J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
