H. 92, but by reading the words the testator used in the light of the surrounding circumstances, and giving them their ordinary meaning unless it appears that that was not the sense in which he used them. <em>Gage </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>78 N. H. 539; <em>J ones </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>78 N. H. 224; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>78 N. H. 84; <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Society, </em>77 N. H. 576; <em>Peaslee </em>v. <em>Rounds, </em>77 N. H. 544; <em>Salter </em>v. <em>Philbrick, </em>77 N. H. 322; <em>Galloway </em>v. <em>Babb, </em>77 N. H. 259; <em>Cotton </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>77 N. H. 216; <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Kerin, </em>77 N. H. 168. If the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>James used are given any meaning of which they are fairly capable, it is obvious he intended to give Martha the right to use or dispose of his property in any way she saw fit, but that if she died without disposing of it, it was to go to Mrs. Chapman, charged with the support of her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
