The plaintiff\u2019s contention that because the gift was made during the donor\u2019s last illness the gift as matter of law was a gift <em>causa mortis </em>was held unsound in <em>Harriman </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>79 N. H. 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">The exception to the refusal to order a verdict is overruled. The statements of counsel to which exception was taken are not sustained by the evidence. The refusal of the court to find the verdict was not affected thereby leaves undisturbed the legal inference that the verdict may have resulted thereform. As the defendant has not established as a fact that the error was harmless, the verdict must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">\n<em>Exception to argument sustained: new trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
