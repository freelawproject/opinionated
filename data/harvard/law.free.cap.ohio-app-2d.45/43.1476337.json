See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dawn, </em>unreported, First District Court of Appeals Clermont County, No. 345, November 20, 1972, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>This motion was overruled by entry on November 7, 1974, whereupon the defendant initiated this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The defendant argues in his sole assignment of error that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred in not granting appellant\u2019s motion for an order crediting his sentence with approximately eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment served by appellant on a prior conviction in another county which was reversed as being contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Defendant contends that by the overruling of his motion, he was denied due process and equal protection of the law. He cites no authority, and our independent research has disclosed none for the proposition that a defendant is entitled to credit for time served where the time sought to be applied related to an entirely different crime in another jurisdiction. There appears to be no precedent, established by case law, for allowing a defendant credit for time served on a prior conviction in another jurisdiction towards a later, totally unrelated conviction, even where such prior conviction was reversed, and the defendant discharged. Nor do we find any statutory authority for such an allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Clearly, Ohio statutory law provides that a defendant is entitled to credit for time served if such imprisonment is related to the offense for which he was tried and convicted. See R. C. 2967.191. However, where, as here, the time sought to be utilized arose out of a set of facts separate and apart from the instant conviction and arose in another jurisdiction, such statute is inapplicable. The defendant was denied neither due process nor equal protection of the law by the action of the trial court in overruling his motion. The single assignment of error is not well taken. The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-9\">Shadow, P.
