The trial was conducted in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County on an indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ment for first-degree murder, following a remand of such case from this court on July 30, 1974. The remand was based on the decision of this court that the trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant in not permitting the introduction of the testimony of a witness offered by the defendant, such denial being on the basis that the witness violated the rule concerning the separation of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">In the first trial of this matter, the defendant had waived his Fifth Amendment rights, and had taken the stand in his own defense. The defendant asserts that such waiver was due to the fact that the other witness had been prohibited from taking the stand to testify in the defendant\u2019s behalf, and it was therefore necessary for the defendant to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Prior to the new trial of this matter, the state presented a pretrial motion requesting that the defendant\u2019s testimony in the prior trial be permitted to be presented to the jury as part of the state\u2019s trial in chief. The defendant\u2019s newly engaged legal counsel objected to the testimony being presented on the premise that the defendant in t\u00f1e retrial of this matter intended to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The trial court sustained such motion to allow the testimony to be presented at the second trial hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The trial was had, the defendant choosing not to take the stand, the state presenting the testimony of the defendant as adduced at the prior trial herein, and the matter was submitted to the jury on the indictment for murder in the first degree. The jury returned a guilty verdict for second-degree murder. The defendant appeals herein, setting forth four assignmnts of error, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">1. \u201cThe Court below erred in allowing the prosecutor to introduce the Appellant\u2019s testimony in a prior proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">2. \u2018 \u2018 The Court below erred in not declaring a mistrial or giving special instructions to the jury after the court made a statement that any error can be cured by appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">3. \u201cThe Court below erred by instructing the jury that the Appellant had a burden of proof in establishing the defense of self-defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>4. \u2018 \u2018 The Court below erred in not granting the motion to reduce the finding of guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The main thrust of the defendant\u2019s argument in support of his first assignment of error is that merely because the \u201cdefendant has testified at a previous time and place before a different tribunal does not prevent defendant from claiming his privilege under self-incrimination as to the same matter in a subsequent trial or proceeding.\u201d The defendant cites the ease of <em>In Re Neff </em>(C. A. 3, 1953), 206 F. 2d 149, and the textual material found in 21 American Jurisprudence 2d 386, Criminal Law, Section 359, in support of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">We hold that the law contained in the case of <em>In Re Neff, </em>and the textual article referred to is not necessarily in conflict with the position of the state herein, which is to the effect that the waiver of the Fifth Amendment in a prior trial would permit the use of such testimony in a subsequent trial. The case of <em>In Re Neff, </em>and the annotation which follows -pertain to the right of a witness to claim a privilege against self-incrimination in a subsequent criminal trial after having testified to the same matters before a grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">With such law this court is in agreement. As stated in the annotation to <em>In Re Neff, </em>found at 36 A. L. R. 2d 1403:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">\u201cThe fact that a witness has testified before the grand jury without invoking his privilege against self-incrimination has been held not to constitute a waiver or estoppel with respect to a claim of privilege when the witness is called upon to testify to the same matter on a subsequent criminal trial, the claim of privilege on subsequent trial being judged on its own merits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Again, we add that we concur in such law, in that the grand jury presents a different forum than does a trial of a matter. The person may, of course, claim his Fifth Amendment rights in a grand jury hearing, or he may proceed to offer his testimony. However, the witness before the grand jury is without the benefit of legal counsel and, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>fore, his statements should not he used against him contrary to his claimed constitutional Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Conversely, as in a criminal trial, the generally accepted rule is that the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination may be waived by a defendant by his voluntarily taking the stand in his own behalf in one trial, and that by so doing such defendant further waives his right to assert the privilege of the Fifth Amendment where such testimony is used against him in any subsequent trial of the same offense. In support of such position, the case of <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968), 392 U. S. 219, is referred to, as is the annotation in 5 A. L. E. 2d 1404, relative to the general subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">It is also pointed out that a comprehensive discussion of the history and application of this rule is to be found in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Slayton </em>(W. D. Vir. 1973), 369 F. Supp. 1213, 1216, wherein we find the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u201cThe rationales that the State Courts have used to justify this practice can be classified into basically five categories : (1) that by taking the stand at trial, the defendant becomes as any other witness and his testimony can be used in anyway which any witnesses\u2019 testimony might be used (see <em>Bess </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>118 Ky. 858, 82 S. W. 576 [1904]); (2) that the defendant\u2019s testimony at his first trial or judicial hearing is an admission or declaration against interest, and is therefore no different from any voluntary out of court statement and therefore may be introduced at a subsequent trial of the accused (see <em>State </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>223 N. C. 804, 28 S. E. 2d 560 [1944]); (3) that the admission or use of the defendant\u2019s prior testimony may tend to show guilt (see <em>Miller </em>v. <em>People, </em>216 Ill. 309, 74 N. E. 743 [1905]); (4) that the introduction of a defendant\u2019s former testimony does not tend to compel him to incriminate himself (see <em>State </em>v. <em>Telley, </em>100 Utah 25, 110 P. 2d 342 [1949]); (5) that the use of the defendant\u2019s prior testimony does not constitute a comment on his failure to testify at his current trial (see <em>Miller </em>v. <em>People,, </em>216 Ill. 309, 74 N. E. 743 [1905]). The use of one or more of these rationales is not dependant upon whether such testimony was used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>during the Government\u2019s case in chief (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>67 Cal. App. 292, 227 P. 783 [1924]), on rebuttal or cross (see <em>Collins </em>v. <em>State, </em>39 Tex. Crim. 441, 46 S. W. 933 [1898]), or on whether the defendant\u2019s original testimony-had been given at a preliminary hearing (see <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>State, </em>48 Wis. 288, 4 N. W. 321 [1880]).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Based upon all of the foregoing, the first assignment of error is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The second assignment of error revolves around a statement of the trial court after such court had overruled the motion of the defense counsel during the process of jury voir dire asking the court to explain to the jury the meaning of \u201cobjective\u201d as well as \u201csubjective.\u201d This the trial court refused to do, the court indicating that the dictionary definition of words at voir dire examination was unnecessary. After defense counsel seemingly persisted in this regard, the court stated to defense counsel: \u201cI think the charge that the court will give will be understandable. If it isn\u2019t, you have your remedy by way of appeals.\u201d Defense counsel then moved for a mistrial, and was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">It is apparently the defendant\u2019s position that the trial court\u2019s statement necessarily had inherent within it the meaning that any error on the part of the jury could be \u201ccured upon appeal,\u201d but this court does not view the words accordingly, and feels that the court meant, and the words could be reasonably construed and understood to be, that the court was stating that a reversal by an appellate court could be pursued if an erroneous charge was made by the court to the jury upon the law in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">The trial court\u2019s pointing out to counsel during the trial of a matter that the appellate process is available to a defendant, if the court\u2019s charge is not understandable, may not be necessary; in fact, such may not be desirable, but it does not present prejudicial error. The jury could not reasonably construe such statement as meaning it had any less of a duty to properly weigh the facts, and determine the weight and credibility to be applied to the testimony of the witnesses. Nor could such statement of the trial court rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>sonably have resulted in the jury shirking its overall responsibility. Even though the court\u2019s action may have been error, we hold such to be nonprejudieial. This assignment of error is also hereby dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The defense counsel, at the trial hereof and prior to arguments to the jury, requested the trial court to instruct the jury that since the state introduced evidence relative to self-defense, as contained in the defendant\u2019s testimony which was read by the state, the latter must go forward and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not in self-defense. The trial court refused to do so, and now the defendant argues that the trial court erred in this regard to the prejudice of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The trial court gave an instruction, which had for years been the standard jury instruction on the burden of establishing self-defense, and charged the jury that the burden was upon the defendant to prove self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The defense counsel, at the conclusion of the charge to the jury, made no specific objection to the charge, nor was there a request for a jury instruction on the burden of proof as to self-defense, specifically, as provided by R. C. 2901.05 (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Criminal Rule 30 provides that \u201cno party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict * * The state argues that defense counsel did not object to such charge prior to the jury\u2019s retiring and, therefore, waived any error attributable thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">We hold that the purpose of Criminal Rule 30 is the same as its counterpart in civil practice, Civ. R. 51 (A). Such purpose or theory was set forth in the case of <em>Presley </em>v. <em>Norwood </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St. 2d 29, 33, wherein the court quoted McCormac, Ohio Civil Rules Practice, Section 12.18: \u201c* * * [T]he court should be given an opportunity to correct a mistake or defect in the instruction when it can be accomplished during the same trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">The court, in <em>Presley </em>v. <em>Norwood, </em>went on to hold the following within the first paragraph of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201cWhere the record affirmatively shows that a trial court has- been fully apprised of the correct law governing a material issue in dispute, and that the complaining party has unsuccessfully requested the inclusion of that law in the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury, such party does not waive his objections to the court\u2019s charge by failing to <em>formally </em>object thereto. (Civ. R. 51 (A).)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">We hold that such reasoning is equally applicable to the trial of criminal matters, and if the record affirmatively shows that a trial court has been fully apprised of the correct law governing the criminal matter involved, and that the defendant has unsuccessfully requested the inclusion of that law in the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury, the defendant cannot be said to have waived his objections to the court\u2019s charge by failing to <em>formally </em>object after the charge is given.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">However, we hold, as did the Supreme Court in <em>Presley, </em>in reference to Civ. R. 51 (A), that a defendant whose request for jury instructions fails to embody the correct law governing the criminal matter involved, and who otherwise fails to comply with Crim. R. 30, by not formally objecting, waives his right to question the trial court\u2019s charg'e upon appeal. Applying such principle to the matter at hand, we hold that the defendant has waived his right to question the trial court\u2019s charge upon appeal, in that the defendant had requested an incorrect jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The instruction requested by the defendant is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">\u201cIf it please the Court, at this time I would request that this Jury be instructed that since the State introduced the evidence of self-defense in this case, that they must now prove that it wasn\u2019t self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt, to place the preponderance of evidence or any burden upon the Defendant at this point, would be in violation of his constitutional rights. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The defendant relies upon the holding of <em>State </em>v. <em>Elijah </em>Matthews, Court of Appeals for Franklin County, No. 74 AP-428, decided December 24, 1974, as being authority for his position in this regard, that the law of this state as now set forth in R. C. 2901.05 (A), regarding the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>proof of the affirmative defense of self-defense, places the burden of negative proof upon the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">This does not correctly state the law of Ohio. It is true it was held in <em>Matthews </em>that by virtue of R. C. 2901.05 (A), the burden of proving self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence is no longer upon the defendant. However, this is not to say that, where some evidence of self-defense is raised in the state\u2019s case, it has the burden of showing that the defendant\u2019s act was not in self-defense. The state\u2019s burden in a criminal case remains the same as it always has been. It must prove all of the elements of the crime charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">If, in the presentation of its case, the state adduces some evidence tending to show self-defense, the latter is entitled to whatever benefit such evidence might befall him. However, the fact that the state raised the issue does not alter the fact that defendant still must go forward with any evidence that he has on the affirmative defense of self-defense if the evidence in its totality, as presented by the state, would necessitate the defendant\u2019s doing so in order to raise the reasonable doubt in the jurors\u2019 minds on such issue. Upon this basis, we hereby overrule the defendant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The fourth assignment of error argues that the court erred in not reducing the verdict from murder in the second degree to manslaughter, in that some of the state\u2019s evidence could only be supportive of the lesser crime. Specifically, the defendant argues: \u201cIt is axiomatic that the case of the plaintiff is no stronger than the weakest link in the chain of evidence presented.\u201d In this regard, we believe that the defendant has used an inapplicable simile. Rather than likened to a chain, the evidence adduced in a trial should be likened to a rope, line or hauser. Rather than likening the various elements within the totality of the evidence as links of a chain, such elements should be likened to the fibers in a line. Here, there is some evidence supportive of the element of self-defense. There is also some evidence from which an inference could be made that the killing was without malice, but there is also sufficient evidence to. sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>port the jury\u2019s verdict of second-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\">We pointed out in the prior decision herein that the underlying consideration, both with the trial court and with this court, should be the element of the basic fairness of every aspect of the defendant\u2019s trial. Here, upon a review of the totality of the circumstances, we hold that the defendant did in fact receive a fair trial. Based upon all of the foregoing, the judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b50-5\">Reilly and McCormac, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
