Avery, Jr. appeals from the trial judge\u2019s refusal to hear his appeal from a final order of the juvenile and domestic relations court adjudging him guilty of contempt and assessing a support arrearage. Avery alleges that the trial judge erred in finding that because Avery failed to file an appeal bond the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to consider the contempt issue. We agree and reverse the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">The record establishes that in 1990, a judge of the juvenile court ordered Avery to pay $100 per month support for his three children. In 1994, Avery was summoned to court from prison for failure to pay support. The judge determined Avery was indigent and appointed counsel for him. Following a hearing, the judge found that an arrearage of $9,200 existed and adjudged Avery in contempt for violating the support order. He sentenced Avery to 365 days in jail unless he paid the arrearage or reached an agreement with the Division of Child Support Enforcement. The judge set the appeal bond at $9,200, the amount of the child support arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Avery appealed to the circuit court. At a hearing in the circuit court, Avery\u2019s counsel argued that no bond was required to perfect the appeal, that Avery\u2019s sentence was erimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>nal in nature, and that Avery was entitled to a trial <em>de novo </em>in circuit court pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1\u2014296(E) and 16.1-136. The trial judge ruled that the conviction and punishment were civil in nature, found that an appeal bond had not been filed, and dismissed the appeal on the ground that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction. The dismissal order recited that the juvenile court judge found that Avery has been jailed on a felony conviction \u201calmost since ordered to pay [child] support\u201d and that Av\u00e9ry \u201ccould not pay because of his felony conviction plus violation ... of parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The statute governing appeals from the juvenile court states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\"><em>No appeal bond shall be required </em>of a party appealing from an order of a juvenile and domestic relations district court <em>except for that portion of any order or judgment establishing a support arrearage or suspending payment of support during pendency of an appeal. </em>In cases involving support, no appeal shall be allowed unless and until the party applying for the same or someone for him shall give bond, in an amount and with sufficient surety approved by the judge or by his- clerk if there is one, to abide by such judgment as may be rendered on appeal if the appeal is perfected or, if not perfected, then to satisfy the judgment of the court in which it was rendered. An appeal will not be perfected unless such appeal bond as may be required is filed within thirty days from the entry of the final judgment or order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3i\">Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) (emphasis added). By its explicit terms, the statute removes the requirement for posting a bond except as provided in the statute. The provision specifying that a bond shall be required for an appeal of a judgment establishing support arrearages implicitly recognizes that an order that sets arrearages may have a component that does not establish a support arrearage. In such a case, an appeal bond is required only for \u201cthat portion of any order ... establishing a support arrearage.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The juvenile court\u2019s order that Avery sought to appeal adjudged Avery guilty of civil contempt and assessed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>arrearage. Seeking to appeal without the necessity of posting a bond, Avery\u2019s counsel argued, in part, to the circuit judge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\">I guess the first issue that the Court needs to decide is whether or not we properly perfected our appeal. It was done within the appropriate time, but what the J <em>&amp; </em>D Court is saying that this is a civil matter so they had the right to set an appeal bond and that the case cannot be appealed until the appeal bond is posted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">It didn\u2019t sound right to me and I\u2019m not sure whether it is right or not, but I found a Court of Appeals decision. It\u2019s called <em>Kessler vs. Commonwealth </em>[,18 Va.App. 14, 441 S.E.2d 223 (1994) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">And I submit to the Court that the same reasoning would apply that if a person is subject to twelve months in jail like my client received, it\u2019s criminal in nature and, therefore, he should be entitled to either a jury trial, which we\u2019re not asking for, but at least an appeal to the Circuit Court, which is why we\u2019re asking the Court to assume jurisdiction, allow us to put on some evidence really as to sentencing. We\u2019ll plead guilty to non support, but I think that there is some mitigation evidence that would justify a sentence less than the twelve months. So I think the first issue is the jurisdiction issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">$ $ $ $ ^ $ if;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">And then I think it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s almost ludicrous to then find someone indigent and say that he doesn\u2019t have money to hire an attorney so that he is entitled to court appointed counsel, and then to make him post a $10,000.00 cash bond for his sentence to be reviewed by another Court. I mean, so, to say that, you know, to put a condition that\u2014that there is no way that the defendant can make, I think practically speaking there is no way that he could purge it so he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>doesn\u2019t\u2014so he doesn\u2019t\u2014to style the order in that way would effectively deny his appeal. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In finding a lack of jurisdiction, the trial judge ruled that the \u201cstatute says that [the juvenile judge was] entitled to set a bond in the amount of the arrears.\u201d However, this record clearly supports Avery\u2019s argument that he sought only to appeal the contempt finding. During the circuit court proceedings, Avery\u2019s counsel addressed the nature of the contempt charge and the sentencing but never challenged the support arrearage. Indeed, Avery\u2019s counsel tacitly conceded the arrearage when he stated, \u201c[w]e\u2019ll plead guilty to non support.\u201d Thus, his argument sufficiently \u201cinform[ed] the court that he was pursuing an appeal of the contempt order and not appealing the determination of the support arrearage.\u201d <em>McCall v. Commonwealth Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>20 Va.App. 348, 352-53, 457 S.E.2d 389, 392 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">We need not address Avery\u2019s argument that because he was indigent and incarcerated, the contempt \u201cpunishment [was] ... determined and unconditional,\u201d <em>Kessler v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 14, 16, 441 S.E.2d 223, 224 (1994), and, therefore, was a criminal matter requiring no bond. Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) does not require the posting of a bond except as specified. A finding of contempt is not an order \u201cestablishing a support arrearage.\u201d <em>See McCall, </em>20 Va.App. at 352-53, 457 S.E.2d at 392. We hold, therefore, that Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) permitted Avery to appeal from the juvenile court\u2019s contempt order without the necessity of posting a bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Accordingly, we reverse the order dismissing the appeal and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
