Mrs. D\u2019Agnese argues that the court was prevented from assuming jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) because at the time it did so, a custody proceeding was pending in Illinois. We agree and reverse the circuit court\u2019s decree insofar as it assumes jurisdiction over the issue of child custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Irene Gouletas and Victor D\u2019Agnese were married on August 24, 1978 in Chicago, Illinois. Mrs. D\u2019Agnese\u2019s family resides in Chicago. Three of the couple\u2019s four children were born in Chicago. The family moved to Virginia in 1984, where their fourth child was born. The family resided in Virginia until 1992. On March 3 of that year, Mrs. D\u2019Agnese filed for divorce in Virginia, requesting custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">On April 10, 1992, apparently without informing Mr. D\u2019Agnese of her intentions, Mrs. D\u2019Agnese took the four children to live with her family in Chicago. On April 20, 1992, Mrs. D\u2019Agnese filed a petition for an order of protection with the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. She claimed that the court had jurisdiction because the children were physically present in the state and it was necessary to protect them from mistreatment and abuse. In support of this claim, she described various acts by Mr. D\u2019Agnese, including beating the children, holding a knife to her daughter\u2019s throat, and threatening to kill the family pets with a gun. Although the form petition requested information about other pending court actions between the parties, Mrs. D\u2019Agnese did not advise the Illinois court that she had a petition for divorce pending in Virginia. On April 24, 1992, Mrs. D\u2019Agnese voluntarily dismissed the Virginia divorce petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">On April 20, 1992, the day Mrs. D\u2019Agnese filed her petition, the Illinois court granted an emergency protection order. The order prohibited Mr. D\u2019Agnese from entering Mrs. D\u2019Agnese\u2019s home or office in Chicago and from removing the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>from the state. The order also granted temporary custody of the children to Mrs. D\u2019Agnese. Mr. D\u2019Agnese was notified of this order after it was granted. On May 11, 1992, Mr. D\u2019Agnese moved to dismiss on the grounds that the Illinois court was an inappropriate forum. The court refused to dismiss Mrs. D\u2019Agnese\u2019s petition, and the emergency order was extended several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">On or about May 1, 1992, Mrs. D\u2019Agnese filed for divorce in Illinois. Several days later, Mr. D\u2019Agnese filed for divorce in Virginia. Mrs. D\u2019Agnese\u2019s Illinois petition for divorce and the petition for a protective order were consolidated. Mr. D\u2019Agnese did not answer the Illinois petition for divorce, and a judgment for dissolution of the marriage was entered on March 22, 1993. The Illinois court granted custody of the children to Mrs. D\u2019Agnese and continued the order of protection. It reserved rulings on visitation, support, maintenance, and attorney\u2019s fees. Mr. D\u2019Agnese filed an appeal of the judgment, which was dismissed on February 25, 1994, apparently at Mr. D\u2019Agnese\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">On January 25, 1993, while both the Virginia and Illinois proceedings were pending, Mrs. D\u2019Agnese filed a motion for abstention in the Virginia circuit court, asking that the court refrain from exercising jurisdiction due to the Illinois proceedings. On March 31, 1993, the Virginia trial judge issued a letter to the parties indicating that he had spoken with the judge in Illinois. The conversation took place after Mr. D\u2019Agnese had defaulted in the Illinois divorce proceeding, but before the final decree was entered. The Illinois judge informed Judge Peatross that Mr. D\u2019Agnese had made an appearance in her court that \u201cwas not a special appearance but one which resulted in <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction generally over the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The judges agreed that Virginia had jurisdiction as the children\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20\u2014126(A)(1); Ill.Rev.Stat. Ch. 40, \u00a7 2104. They also agreed that Illinois would have jurisdiction if the requirements of the so-called \u201cemergency jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>tion\u201d section of the UCCJA were met. <em>See </em>Ill.Rev.Stat. Ch. 40, \u00a7 2104; Code \u00a7 20-126(A)(3). The Illinois judge indicated that she had made findings of abuse or mistreatment in accord with that section, and that Mr. D\u2019Agnese had not challenged those findings. Judge Peatross informed the Illinois judge that Mr. D\u2019Agnese had denied abuse at a hearing before the Virginia court. However, Judge Peatross concluded that both courts \u201cmay take jurisdiction of the matter and it is a question of whether or not one of the courts should decline jurisdiction at this point in time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">On October 19, 1993, the Virginia court ruled that under <em>Middleton v. Middleton, </em>227 Va. 82, 314 S.E.2d 362 (1984), it was the proper court to exercise jurisdiction under the UC-CJA because Virginia was the children\u2019s home state. On August 11, 1994, the circuit court denied Mrs. D\u2019Agnese\u2019s motion to dismiss Mr. D\u2019Agnese\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">On November 4, 1994, the Virginia court issued a decree of divorce that affirmed that portion of the Illinois court\u2019s decree dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage. The court noted that Mrs. D\u2019Agnese had preserved her right to appeal the court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction. The court awarded custody of the children to Mrs. D\u2019Agnese. The issue of visitation was reserved pending reports by mental health professionals. The court later ordered supervised visitation on a limited basis, to which Mrs. D\u2019Agnese has objected. Mrs. D\u2019Agnese appeals the circuit court\u2019s ruling that it had jurisdiction over the custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">We review the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to Mr. D\u2019Agnese, the prevailing party in the trial court. The burden is on the party who alleges reversible error to show that reversal is justified. <em>Lutes v. Alexander, </em>14 Va.App. 1075, 1077, 421 S.E.2d 857, 859 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Both Virginia and Illinois have adopted the UCCJA. Among the Act\u2019s purposes are to avoid jurisdictional competition in matters of child custody, to promote cooperation among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>courts of different states in custody disputes, to assure that litigation over the custody of the child ordinarily occurs in the state most closely connected with the child and his or her family, and to deter abductions and other unilateral removals of children undertaken in order to obtain custody orders. <em>Middleton, </em>227 Va. at 93, 314 S.E.2d at 367. The child\u2019s welfare is the paramount concern for courts in determining the most appropriate forum for a custody dispute. <em>Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 329, 387 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Mrs. D\u2019Agnese does not dispute that Virginia was the children\u2019s home state when these proceedings began. Instead, she argues that the Virginia court could not lawfully assume home state jurisdiction because a proceeding was pending in Illinois. Under Code \u00a7 20-129(A), the Commonwealth \u201cshall not\u201d exercise jurisdiction where at the time the petition was filed, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child was pending in a court of another state \u201cexercising jurisdiction substantially in conformity with this chapter----\u201d This rule does not apply where the court in the other state decides to stay its proceeding in favor of the other court. Code \u00a7 20-129(A). Here, the Illinois court declined to stay its proceeding in favor of the Virginia court.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">This section of the UCCJA was intended to avoid jurisdictional conflict by establishing a \u201cpriority in time\u201d rule for simultaneous proceedings. <em>See </em>Elizabeth Carrington Shuff, Comment, <em>The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act in Virginia, </em>14 U.Rich.L.Rev. 435, 438; 442 (1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u00a7 20-129(A) applies only to proceedings in another state where the court is exercising jurisdiction \u201csubstantially in conformity\u201d with the UCCJA. Here, the Illinois court issued a protective order pursuant to the emergency jurisdiction provision of the UCCJA. Under that provision, the court may assume jurisdiction if the child is physically present in the state and it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child from mistreatment or abuse, either actual or threatened. Ill.Rev.Stat. Ch. 40, \u00a7 2104; Code \u00a7 20-126(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In order to determine whether it was appropriate to defer to the Illinois court under Code \u00a7 20-129(A), the circuit court had to determine whether the Illinois court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction was substantially in conformity with the Act. While the court appeared to have doubts about the legitimacy of the allegations of abuse, it nonetheless found in the letter opinion of March 31, 1993 that the Illinois court had obtained emergency jurisdiction. Once the circuit court so found, it was required to defer to the Illinois court pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-129(A). <em>See Coleman v. Coleman, </em>493 N.W.2d 133, 136 (Minn.Ct.App.1992); <em>Carpenter v. Carpenter, </em>326 Pa.Super. 570, 577-80, 474 A.2d 1124, 1128-30 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In deciding to exercise home state jurisdiction even though an action was pending in Illinois, the circuit court relied on <em>Middleton v. Middleton, </em>227 Va. 82, 314 S.E.2d 362 (1984). In <em>Middleton, </em>the Supreme Court held that a pending custody proceeding in England did not justify the circuit court\u2019s refusal to exercise home state jurisdiction. The Court warned against applying Code \u00a7 20-129(A) in a \u201cwooden\u201d manner where foreign jurisdiction had been obtained by one parent spiriting the child away from its domicile. <em>Id. </em>at 99, 314 S.E.2d at 371. However, in <em>Middleton </em>there were no allegations of abuse, and the Court in effect held that the mother had \u201cspirit[ed] the child away from its domicile\u201d simply in order to obtain foreign jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>If the Virginia circuit court had found that Mrs. D\u2019Agnese took the children to Illinois simply to obtain jurisdiction in that state and not to protect them from abuse, it could have refused, under <em>Middleton, </em>to defer to the Illinois court pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-129(A). However, the court did not do so, but found instead that the Illinois court had obtained emergency jurisdiction. The circuit court therefore had no basis to refuse to defer to the Illinois court pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-129(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The Illinois court\u2019s exercise of emergency jurisdiction, which is temporary in nature, did not necessarily confer permanent jurisdiction over the custody issue. Indeed, a court that exercises emergency jurisdiction is generally required to defer to the court with the stronger claim to jurisdiction, usually the court in the home state. <em>See Coleman, </em>493 N.W.2d at 137 n. 2; <em>In re Marriage of Alexander, </em>252 Ill.App.3d 70, 72, 77, 191 Ill.Dec. 331, 333, 336, 623 N.E.2d 921, 923, 926 (1993); <em>Trader v. Darrow, </em>630 A.2d 634, 638-39 (Del.1993); <em>Piedimonte v. Nissen, </em>817 S.W.2d 260, 267 (Mo.Ct. App.1991). Mrs. D\u2019Agnese\u2019s counsel conceded at oral argument that the Illinois court had neither home state nor significant connection jurisdiction over the custody matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">However, because the Virginia court was required to defer to the Illinois court under Code \u00a7 20-129(A), it was for the Illinois court to determine whether its continued exercise of jurisdiction was appropriate. Any objection by Mr. D\u2019Agnese to the jurisdiction of the Illinois court had to be made in Illinois. The Illinois court found that it had obtained personal jurisdiction over Mr. D\u2019Agnese and consolidated the divorce and the emergency custody proceedings. The court issued orders on both dissolution and custody, and Mr. D\u2019Agnese\u2019s appeal was dismissed. The Illinois order is now final, and that order cannot be collaterally attacked in the Virginia courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court assuming jurisdiction over the custody of the children is reversed, and the visitation order vacated. The case is remanded to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>trial court for any further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-9\">. A threshold question is whether Mrs. D\u2019Agnese is entitled to invoke Code \u00a7 20-129 at all. Mrs. D\u2019Agnese seeks application of the \"priority in time\u201d rule, yet her Illinois action was not the first in time. Her Virginia divorce petition, which requested custody of the children, was still pending at the time she filed in Illinois. She failed to inform the Illinois court of the Virginia proceeding, apparently because she had left instructions with her attorney to dismiss the Virginia proceeding. It was in fact dismissed shortly after the Illinois petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">At the time Mr. D\u2019Agnese filed his petition in Virginia, the proceeding initiated by Mrs. D'Agnese was pending in Illinois. These were simultaneous proceedings within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-129, and therefore that statute applies, even though the Illinois proceeding was not origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>nally the first in time. <em>See Simpkins v. Disney, </em>416 Pa.Super. 243, 247-49, 610 A.2d 1062, 1064-65 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
