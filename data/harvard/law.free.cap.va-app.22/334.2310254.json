Finding no error, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Randolph was arrested December 18, 1993, and a preliminary hearing was held January 10, 1994, at which time probable cause was found. He was held in custody continuously from the time of the probable cause hearing until trial. Upon motion of defendant, the trial was continued from April 22, 1994, until July 13, 1994, a period of eighty-two days. The trial date was again continued upon motion of the Commonwealth, and finally commenced on August 31, 1994. At trial, defendant moved to dismiss on the ground that he was not afforded a speedy trial. The motion was denied. Randolph was subsequently convicted by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Randolph contends that the five-month speedy trial limitation for commencing the trial elapsed on August 30, 1994, the day before the trial in fact began. He argues that January 10, 1994, the date of the preliminary hearing, should be counted as the first day against the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth argues, on the other hand, that January 10 does not count as the first day to calculate five months <em>from </em>the date probable cause was found. In support of his argument, defendant places significance upon the wording of Code \u00a7 19.2-243, which states that the trial must commence \u201cwithin five months <em>from </em>the date such probable cause was found\u201d instead of within five months <em>after. </em>(Emphasis added). We disagree with defendant\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 19.2-243.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Code \u00a7 1-13.3, governing the computation of time, clearly provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">when a statute or rule of court requires a notice to be given or any other act to be done within a certain time after any event or judgment, that time shall be allowed <em>in addition to the day on which the event or judgment occurred.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>(Emphasis added). Use of the word \u201cfrom\u201d rather than \u201cafter\u201d in Code \u00a7 19.2-243 does not preclude Code \u00a7 1-13.3 from controlling. By its terms, Code \u00a7 1-13.3 governs the very issue before the Court, which is whether \u201cthe day on which the event or judgment occurred\u201d shall be counted in computing the time within which an event shall be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Accordingly, the convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
