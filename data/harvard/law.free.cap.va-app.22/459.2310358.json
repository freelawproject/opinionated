Among the assets distributed were two retirement plans in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>which the husband participated through his employer. The court awarded the wife forty percent of the marital share of each of the two plans. On appeal, the husband contends that the court overstated the value-of the \u201cmarital share\u201d of his defined contribution plan, referred to as the Performance Sharing Plan (\u201cPSP\u201d), by failing to treat as separate property the income earned passively during the marriage on the amount of his premarital contributions to the plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The distribution of the defined benefit plan is not at issue. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">A defined contribution plan is comprised of funds held in an account established by the employee through his employer. A defined contribution plan is one in which \u201cthe employee and the employer both make contributions to a retirement plan account, and the employee\u2019s benefits are expressed in terms of the present balance in his account.\u201d Brett R. Turner, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>\u00a7 6.02 (2d ed.1994); <em>see also Defined Contribution Plans, Equitable Distribution Journal </em>Vol.13, No.1, at 1-6 (Jan.1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By contrast, a defined benefit plan defines an employee\u2019s benefits \u201cas a certain amount per period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, upon retirement, a defined contribution plan gives an employee the funds remaining in his plan account, while \u201ca defined benefit plan gives the employee a specific periodic benefit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Here, the parties stipulated that husband\u2019s PSP was worth $23,370 when the parties married and $163,467 when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>they separated. Based on these figures, the court classified husband\u2019s $23,370 pre-marital contribution as separate property. Although husband\u2019s accounting expert testified that the value of the husband\u2019s pre-marital contributions had grown to $61,097 during the marriage as a result of earnings attributable solely to those funds, the court declined to classify as husband\u2019s separate property the income passively earned on his $23,370 pre-marital contribution. The court determined the \u201cmarital share\u201d of the PSP was $140,097 (i.e., $163,467 minus $23,370) rather than, as husband contended, $102,370 (i.e., $163,467 minus $61,097).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Husband contends classification of the PSP is controlled by Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) and its tracing provisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Wife concedes that, under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A), passive income earned by or on separate property remains separately classified. However, she contends that retirement plans are not subject to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>classification and distribution rules applicable to non-retirement plan assets, because retirement plans are treated as a unique species of property under Virginia\u2019s equitable distribution law. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G); <em>Keyser v. Keyser, </em>7 Va.App. 405, 412, 374 S.E.2d 698, 702 (1988). For this reason, she argues that husband\u2019s theory has no basis under Virginia law. Indeed, the issue is one of first impression in Virginia.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">This Court has described pensions as constituting an \u201cunusual type of property,\u201d <em>Gamble v. Gamble, </em>14 Va.App. 558, 565, 421 S.E.2d 635, 640 (1992).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, we find no support for the view that the legislature intended to exclude retirement plans, or any other specific type of property, from the overall equitable distribution scheme. <em>See Banagan v. Banagan, </em>17 Va.App. 321, 325, 437 S.E.2d 229, 231 (1993) (\u201c[W]hen pension benefits comprise a \u2018portion of the pool of marital assets,\u2019 they are clearly contemplated by the \u2018scheme\u2019 of Code \u00a7 20-107.3, which is intended to justly distribute the \u2018marital wealth of the parties.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">That scheme is set forth in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A), which addresses the classification of property, including retirement plans, as either separate, marital, or part marital and part separate. The same code section sets forth the \u201ctracing\u201d provisions applicable to assets which are part marital and part separate. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3). Under these tracing provisions, a retirement benefit which is part marital and part separate, is classified in accordance with the definition of \u201cmarital share\u201d set forth in \u00a7 20-107.3(G). Code \u00a7 20-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>107.3(A)(3)(b). Code \u00a7 20-107.3(0(1) defines the marital share of a pension as \u201cthat portion of the total interest, the right to which was earned during the marriage and before the last separation of the parties.\u201d That portion is considered \u201cmarital property\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Wife contends that the phraseology, \u201ctotal interest ... earned during the marriage,\u201d has a clear meaning, requiring the inclusion as marital property of <em>all </em>funds earned by the PSP during the marriage, irrespective of the separate nature of the funds contributed. However, wife\u2019s reading of Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(b) and -107.3(G) ignores the remaining provisions of the equitable distribution statutory scheme which, upon proof, treats as separate all other species of separate property, together with any increases in value passively earned by or on the separate property during the marriage. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-107.3(A)(l), -107.3(A)(3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">When read in context, the provisions respecting the classification of pension funds compel giving similar treatment to income passively earned during the marriage from separate funds contributed to a defined contribution plan. Under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(2), pension funds are characterized as \u201cpresumptively\u201d marital and only remain so classified <em>in the absence of satisfactory evidence that the property is separate. </em>This provision is conceptually equivalent to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(d), which provides that separate property commingled with marital property retains its original classification if it can be retraced by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Furthermore, the \u201cpro-ration\u201d of the PSP urged by husband is consistent with the treatment accorded to pension funds held in defined benefit plans. Under Virginia law, it is well established that the marital portion of a defined benefit plan is distinguished from the separate portion by the application of a fraction, the numerator of which represents the total time the pensioner is employed during the parties\u2019 marriage, and the denominator of which represents the total time the pensioner is employed through the date of retirement. <em>See, e.g., Mosley v. Mosley, </em>19 Va.App. 192, 198, 450 S.E.2d 161, 165 (1994); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number><em>Primm v. Primm, </em>12 Va.App. 1036, 1037, 407 S.E.2d 45, 46 (1991). The fraction diminishes the marital share in relation to the number of years that pre- and post-marital contributions are made.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, as applied, the fraction effectively excludes from the marital share the income earned by pre- and post-marital contributions to the pension.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Different treatment of a defined contribution plan follows neither from the nature of the plan, which is characterized by readily identifiable fund values during the life of the fund, nor from the language of the statute. The trial court, therefore, erred in failing to classify as separate the income earned passively by husband\u2019s separate contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In this case, stipulated evidence established the value of husband\u2019s separate contributions made before the marriage. Expert testimony established the value by which the separate contributions increased passively. On appeal, wife contends that the method used by husband\u2019s expert to calculate the increased value of husband\u2019s separate contributions at the date of separation was erroneous. However, wife failed to object to husband\u2019s method of calculation at trial and is, therefore, procedurally barred from raising the issue on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the evidence of value presented to the trial court on this issue stands admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for entry of an equitable distribution order consistent with this opinion. Because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the statutory interplay between equitable distribution and support awards, the trial court will have to reconsider its support award in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">. The wife filed a cross-appeal, the disposition of which is addressed in a separate memorandum opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\">. Under the <em>Internal Revenue Code, </em>\"the term 'defined contribution plan\u2019 means a plan which provides for an individual account for each participant and for benefits based solely on the amount contributed to the participant's account, and any income, expenses, gains and losses, and any forfeitures of accounts of other participants which may be allocated to such participant\u2019s account.\u201d Types of defined contribution plans include tax-qualified profit-sharing plans, stock bonus plans, and 401(k) plans. IRAs (Individual retirement accounts) are also defined contribution plans, although they are not tax-qualified plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\"><em>Equitable Distribution Journal, supra, </em>at 1-2 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\">.

However, we note that husband\u2019s theory of classifying as separate the income earned passively by his separate contribution has been accepted in other equitable distribution jurisdictions. <em>See Equitable Distribution Journal, supra, </em>at 4-5; <em>Thielenhaus v.

Because there is no fund account to prorate between marital and separate, the time during which benefits were earned is prorated instead. <em>See </em>Turner, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 6.10. Applying such a fraction to a defined contribution plan could lead to incongruous results, and such an approach is not generally used. <em>See id. </em>at n. 221.
