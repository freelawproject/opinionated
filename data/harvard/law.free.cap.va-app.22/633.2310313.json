Oil Transport and its insurer (collectively \u201cemployer\u201d) appeal, contending that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission was insufficient to support a finding of destitution as to Jordan. We agree with employer, and we reverse the order of the commission and dismiss the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Jordan\u2019s son was killed in October 1992 in an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment with Oil Transport. The employer accepted the claim as compensable but denied that Jordan was entitled to receive benefits as a dependent of her son. A hearing was held before Deputy Commissioner Lahne on April 26, 1995, to determine whether Jordan was totally or partially dependent on the decedent. Jordan was the sole witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Jordan had been living with her son when he was killed. She testified that her son cashed his checks and gave her money to pay the rent, utilities, and food. His weekly wage was $395.64 (approximately $1700 per month). Jordan\u2019s monthly income at the time of her son\u2019s death was $636.08, comprising $420 from an annuity and $216.08 from Social Security. Jordan testified that her son claimed her as a dependent when he filed tax returns, although she did not specify which years and no tax returns were produced at the hearing. The deputy commissioner, after hearing Jordan\u2019s testimony and reviewing the interrogatories, found that Jordan was a parent in destitute circumstances as contemplated by Code \u00a7 65.2-515(A)(4) and awarded benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-512(A)(2). The full commission found that the record supported the deputy commissioner\u2019s conclusion and affirmed the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Code \u00a7 65.2-512 states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">A. If death results from the accident within nine years, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid, compensation in weekly payments equal to 66% percent of the employee\u2019s average weekly wages, but not more than 100 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined in \u00a7 65.2-500 nor less than 25 percent of the average weekly wage as defined therein:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>2. If there are no total dependents pursuant to subdivision A 1, A 2, or A 3 of \u00a7 65.2-515, to those persons presumed to be wholly dependent as set forth in subdivision A 4 of \u00a7 65.2-515, and to those determined to be wholly dependent in fact, for a period of 400 weeks from the date of injury....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Code \u00a7 65.2-515(A)(4) provides that \u201c[pjarents in destitute circumstances, provided there be no total dependents pursuant to other provisions of this section,\u201d are \u201cconclusively presumed to be dependents wholly dependent for support upon the deceased employee.\u201d A parent with \u201conly the earning potential sufficient to provide no more than a bare existence with no resources to provide against reasonably anticipated or inevitable financial emergencies\u201d is deemed \u201cfinancially vulnerable\u201d and, therefore, destitute for the purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-515(A)(4). <em>Roanoke Belt, Inc. v. Mroczkowski, </em>20 Va.App. 60, 71, 455 S.E.2d 267, 272 (1995). This status is to be determined by the evidence viewed at the time of the employee\u2019s death. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Under these standards Jordan failed to meet her burden of proving dependency, whether actual or as a result of being financially vulnerable. Despite two sets of specific interrogatories, Jordan refused to provide even approximate dollar amounts of her son\u2019s contributions to her expenses. She produced no tax returns, no documentation of bills being paid by her son, nor any other tangible objective evidence of dependency. Her testimony consisted solely of bald assertions that she was dependent on her son\u2019s contributions. Jordan testified to no reasonably anticipated or inevitable financial emergency at the time of her son\u2019s death. The evidence of her financial position at the time of her son\u2019s death was inadequate to classify her as financially vulnerable. Upon the record before us, we must conclude that the commission had insufficient evidence to determine that Jordan was in \u201cdestitute circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Employer also argues that the deputy commissioner erred in excluding certain letters written by the decedent. Having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>concluded that the claim should be dismissed on other grounds, we do not reach the issue of the admissibility of the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the commission\u2019s decision and dismiss the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
