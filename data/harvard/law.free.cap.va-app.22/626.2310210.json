(employer), (2) was released to her pre-injury employment on November 30,1992, and (3) neglected to report earnings which exceeded her pre-injury wage. Finding no error, we affirm the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">On June 26, 1990, claimant sustained employment-related injuries to her knees, hands, and back, and was awarded benefits from employer for the resulting disability. Beginning in December, 1992, employer filed several motions with the commission, each seeking suspension of the award, and attended by applications for related hearings. The first, received by the commission December 24, 1992, alleged that claimant had been released to her pre-injury employment on November 30, 1992, and that any existing disability was not attributable to the industrial accident. A motion and application filed December 3, 1993, asserted that claimant had \u201cprocured\u201d the subject benefits through fraud and failed to report earnings in accordance with Code \u00a7 65.2-712. The third motion, received January 5, 1994, alleged that claimant had been released to pre-injury employment on December 9, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Before referring these motions to the hearing docket, the commission\u2019s Claims Division required employer to \u201cpay compensation [for two periods] pursuant to the ... award,\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>accordance with Rule 1.4(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Employer subsequently forwarded claimant a cheek for $5,896.42 on May 26, 1994, $68 less than the amount prescribed by the order. Nevertheless, the matters were all referred to the hearing docket on June 3, 1994, without objection from claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">In early September, 1994, claimant moved the commission to dismiss the pending motions pursuant to Rule 1.4(C), contending that employer had failed to fully satisfy the payment required by the commission. Shortly thereafter, employer paid claimant an additional $100 to resolve the insufficiency and, on September 14, 1994, the deputy commissioner denied claimant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Claimant did not request full commission review of this decision, but included the issue in her appeal to the commission of the deputy\u2019s later decision, which granted employer \u201call of the relief requested in its applications for hearing.\u201d On review, the commission concluded that the ruling on claimant\u2019s Rule 1.4(C) motion to dismiss was <em>res judicata </em>and affirmed the deputy\u2019s decision on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\n<em>RES JUDICATA: RULE 1.6(A)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">\u201cThe commission has the power to make and enforce \u2018rules not inconsistent with [the Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act, for carrying out the provisions of this Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Specialty Auto Body v. Cook, </em>14 Va.App. 327, 330, 416 S.E.2d 233, 235 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201cWhen a challenge is made to the commission\u2019s construction of its rules, \u2018our review is limited to a determination whether the commission\u2019s interpretation of its own rule was reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>cy will be \u201caccorded great deference\u201d and its interpretation of its rules \u201cwill not be set aside unless arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Virginia Real Estate Bd. v. Clay, </em>9 Va.App. 152, 159, 384 S.E.2d 622, 626 (1989), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>398 S.E.2d 78 (Va. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Rule 1.6(A) of the commission rules provides that \u201c[a] request for review of a decision accepting or rejecting a change in condition claim or application shall be filed within 20 days from date of the decision. No oral argument is permitted.\u201d Here, claimant failed within the time allotted by Rule 1.6(A) to request a review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s initial ruling denying her motion to dismiss the applications. Accordingly, the commission concluded that the deputy commissioner\u2019s determination of the Rule 1.4(C) issue was <em>res judicata. See K &amp; L Trucking Co. v. Thurber, </em>1 Va.App. 213, 219, 337 S.E.2d 299, 302 (1985). We find that the commission\u2019s application of Rule 1.6(A) was reasonable and consistent with provisions of the Act and, therefore, beyond our review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">\n<em>RETURN TO PRE-INJURY EMPLOYMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Under familiar principles, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, employer in this instance. <em>R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990). \u201cIt lies within the commission\u2019s authority to determine the facts and the weight of the evidence, and its findings in that regard, when supported by credible evidence, will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d <em>Rose v. Red\u2019s Hitch &amp; Trailer Servs., Inc., </em>11 Va.App. 55, 60, 396 S.E.2d 392, 395 (1990). \u201cA question raised by conflicting medical opinion is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Powell, </em>2 Va.App. 712, 714, 347 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1986). \u201cThe fact that there is contrary evidence in the record is of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>consequence if there is credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Wagner Enters., Inc. v. Brooks, 12 </em>Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Dr. Juan L. Jammes, a neurologist, evaluated claimant on November 30, 1992, and reported \u201cno objective evidence of disability.\u201d Rather, he opined that claimant was \u201csuffering from functional overlay.\u201d The commission found Dr. Jammes\u2019 report, considered with other medical evidence and observations of claimant \u201cperforming tasks ... inconsistent with her claimed disability,\u201d \u201csufficient to prove that ... claimant was released to return to her pre-injury employment on November 30, 1992,\u201d a decision clearly supported by credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">\n<em>EARNINGS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Code \u00a7 65.2-712 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[s]o long as an employee receives payment of compensation ... such employee shall have a duty immediately to disclose to the employer ... any incarceration, return to employment or increase in his earnings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">It is uncontroverted that both before and after the accident claimant was a \u201cdistributor\u201d of Herbalife products and became a Herbalife \u201csupervisor\u201d in June, 1991. Her responsibilities included ordering, receiving, storing, selling, packaging, and delivering an array of Herbalife products. Claimant\u2019s tax returns indicated 1991 gross sales of $7,648.82, followed by substantial annual increases, rising to approximately $73,000 in 1994. Although claimant\u2019s tax records and testimony reflected significantly less <em>net </em>income, the evidence indicated that she repeatedly represented to others that her net earnings ranged from $3,000 to $5,000 per month.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In assessing these conflicts in the record, the commission characterized claimant\u2019s evidence as \u201cunpersuasive\u201d and \u201c[in]conclusive,\u201d concurred in the deputy\u2019s finding that claimant was \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>credible,\u201d and concluded that claimant had earned a net income which exceeded her pre-injury average weekly wage. This factual finding is also well-supported by credible evidence and will not be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"Abm\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\">. Rule 1.4(C) requires that ''[c]ompensation ... be paid through the date the application was filed,\u201d subject to certain inapplicable exceptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\">. Employer subsequently filed two additional motions and applications for hearing, dated October 7, 1994, and November 4, 1994, respectively, both alleging claimant's failure to report for independent medical examinations. All motions were consolidated for hearing before the deputy commissioner on March 30, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\">. Contrary to claimant\u2019s assertions during oral argument, the commission\u2019s construction and application of Rule 1.6(A) would not require this Court to entertain appeals of such decisions as a \"final award.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-116.04, 65.2-706; <em>Holly Farms Foods, Inc. v. Carter, </em>15 Va.App. 29, 34, 422 S.E.2d 165, 167 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b664-8\">.
