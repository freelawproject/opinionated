(employer) appeals from the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>(commission) that affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s award of benefits to Melvin C. Moore, Jr. (claimant). Employer presents three questions: (1) whether there was sufficient evidence for the commission to find that claimant was disabled as of September 1, 1990, and that he made reasonable efforts to market his remaining work capacity; (2) whether claimant\u2019s claim is barred by the statutes of limitations embodied in Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-56 and 65.1-99; and (3) whether employer is entitled to a credit for the total dollar amount paid under the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Claimant sustained a compensable injury on November 10, 1986 while working as a hustler driver for employer. A \u201chustler\u201d is a vehicle which moves cargo containers. Claimant fractured both wrists as the result of a fall from a hustler vehicle. Claimant made several unsuccessful attempts to return to his pre-injury job and became a patient of Dr. Lawrence Morales, an orthopedic surgeon, on May 4, 1987. Dr. Morales concluded that claimant could not return to his job as a hustler driver but could do work of a lighter nature. On May 5,1988, claimant filed a claim with the commission for the injury suffered in 1986.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">On June 1, 1988, surgery was performed on claimant\u2019s right wrist. On July 28, 1988, claimant was discharged from the care of his surgeon, Dr. Theodore DuPuy, having received from him a thirty-five percent permanent disability rating to his upper extremity. From that date through August 31, 1990, claimant received permanent partial disability benefits under the LHWCA, as well as periods of temporary total disability (during surgery in 1988 and 1993) under the LHWCA. Employer asserts it paid a total of $128,578.60 under that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Sometime during 1991, claimant began looking for work. Claimant could remember only that his search commenced during warm weather. Vocational counselor Michael Hulen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>attempted to assist claimant in job placement beginning July 31, 1991, and did so unsuccessfully for three months, though claimant was cooperative. Claimant offered into evidence a list of sixty-nine employers with their respective phone numbers from which he sought employment. Claimant\u2019s application was dismissed without prejudice by order entered May 8, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">On June 7, 1993, surgery was performed on claimant\u2019s left hand. Prior to this surgery, claimant was capable of performing light-duty work with his right hand but not his left. Dr. Morales, claimant\u2019s surgeon and treating physician, released claimant, on September 21, 1993, to perform light and medium duty work. He limited claimant from work \u201crequiring repetitive motions of both hands or both wrists such as assembly-type work, heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, repetitive grasping, turning of wrenches with different tools or instruments.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\n<em>I. Claimant\u2019s Disability and Efforts to Market Work Capacity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Employer contends that there was insufficient evidence for the commission to find that claimant was disabled as of September 1,1990, when his benefits under the LHWCA were exhausted, and that claimant failed to make reasonable efforts to market his remaining capacity for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In reviewing the commission\u2019s decision, we are guided by well-settled principles. A finding of fact made by the commission which is supported by credible evidence is conclusive and binding upon this Court. <em>Fairfax Hosp. v. DeLaFleur, </em>221 Va. 406, 410, 270 S.E.2d 720, 722 (1980). \u201cA question raised by conflicting medical opinion is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Powell, </em>2 Va.App. 712, 714, 347 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1986). \u201cThe fact that there is contrary evidence in the record is of no consequence if there is credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Wagner Enters., Inc. v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">While Dr. DuPuy opined on several-occasions that claimant was capable of returning to his pre-injury employment, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>commission discounted his opinion, noting that it was not apparent that Dr. DuPuy knew of the actual duties of a hustler driver. The commission, instead, placed greater weight on the opinion of claimant\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Morales, who, in reaching his conclusion that claimant could not return to his pre-injury employment, had visited claimant\u2019s work site and handled a hustler vehicle. Dr. Curtis Spear, also an orthopedic surgeon, who examined claimant at the request of claimant\u2019s union, concurred in Dr. Morales\u2019s opinion. In addition, claimant made several attempts to return to his former job but was unable to continue because of pain in his hands and arm. <em>See Sky Chefs, Inc. v. Rogers, </em>222 Va. 800, 284 S.E.2d 605 (1981) (unsuccessful attempts to return to pre-injury employment may be considered in determining the extent of a claimant\u2019s disability). The opinions of Drs. Morales and Spear and claimant\u2019s unsuccessful efforts at returning to work provide credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s occupational injury kept him from resuming his pre-injury work.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">In order to receive continued benefits, a disabled employee must prove that he made reasonable efforts to market his residual wage earning capacity. <em>National Linen Serv. v. McGuinn, 8 </em>Va.App. 267, 269, 380 S.E.2d 31, 34 (1989). \u201cIn determining whether a claimant has made a reasonable effort to market his remaining work capacity, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to ... the prevailing party before the commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 380 S.E.2d at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In reviewing the commission\u2019s determination concerning claimant\u2019s efforts to market his work capacity, we note, as did the commission, that claimant was cooperative with Mr. Hulen, the rehabilitative counselor supplied by employer. However, Mr. Hulen could not secure employment for claimant. Also, Dr. Morales found claimant motivated to return to work. Though claimant\u2019s list of employers from whom he sought employment is not an extensive record for marketing efforts generally, the commission observed that claimant can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>read and write at only a second or third grade level. Given this record, credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s marketing efforts were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\n<em>II. Statutes of Limitations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Employer argues that the statute of limitations under former Code \u00a7 65.1-56, now Code \u00a7 65.2-501, bars claimant\u2019s claim. Code \u00a7 65.2-501, in pertinent part, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">After compensation has been paid as provided in \u00a7 65.2-503 [compensation for permanent loss], the employee may, within one year from the date compensation was last due <em>under this section, </em>file an application for incapacity to work....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">(Emphasis added). Employer, noting that the commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s April 1, 1994 award of seventy weeks of permanent partial disability benefits, running from July 28, 1988 to November 29, 1989, reasons that November 29, 1990, one year from the last date compensation was allowed, was the last day on which claimant could seek compensation due to an incapacity to work. The statute of limitations in Code \u00a7 65.2-501, however, does not begin to run until compensation for permanent loss was \u201clast due\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-503. Because compensation for claimant\u2019s permanent loss did not become due under that code section until his award was entered by the deputy commissioner on April 1, 1994, claimant\u2019s claim was not time barred. The fact that under the LHWCA compensation was last due on November 29, 1989 is of no import; only an award made under Code 5 65.2-503 can trigger Code \u00a7 65.2-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Employer also raises the statute of limitations of former Code \u00a7 65.1-99, now Code \u00a7 65.2-708. Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">Upon its own motion or upon the application- of, any party in interest, on the ground of a change in condition, the Commission may review any award and on such review may make an award ending, diminishing or increasing the compensation <em>previously awarded </em>.... No such review shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>be made after twenty-four months from the last day for which compensation was paid, pursuant to an award <em>under this </em>title____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">(Emphasis added). This code section is inapplicable. Claimant\u2019s March 25, 1993 application by letter of counsel did not allege a change in condition but was an initial request for temporary total disability benefits. Under Code \u00a7 65.2-708, the commission is empowered to \u201cend[], diminish[] or increase] the compensation <em>previously awarded.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Prior to April 1, 1994, no award had been entered by the commission on claimant\u2019s behalf. The award provided under the LHWCA is of no benefit to employer; the two-year limitation on review provided for in Code \u00a7 65.2-708 applies only to awards made \u201cunder this title,\u201d with \u201cthis title\u201d referring to Title 65.2\u2014the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Virginia Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\n<em>III. Credits for Benefits Paid Under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AfZ\">A review of the Virginia Act clearly discloses the General Assembly\u2019s intent that an injured employee not be awarded a double recovery for a compensable injury; equally evident in the Virginia Act is the General Assembly\u2019s intent that an employer not be required to pay twice for an employee\u2019s injury. The question presented here is whether under the facts of this case the award made by the commission requires employer to pay twice for claimant\u2019s compensable injury. We believe that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Depending upon the circumstances, employees who are injured while working as longshoremen may elect whether to first seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the LHWCA or the Virginia Act. Both the LHWCA and the Virginia Act provide compensation for permanent injuries by ordering, weekly payments for a stated number of weeks, depending upon the extent of the permanent injury. We were advised at oral argument that this claimant elected to pursue his claim for benefits under the LHWCA because that act provides larger weekly payments for wages lost due to injury, albeit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>a lesser number of weeks. Thus, a longshoreman has a choice between higher payments for a lesser number of weeks under the LHWCA or lower payments for a greater number of weeks under the Virginia Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Employer asserts that pursuant to the provisions of the LHWCA, claimant was paid a total of $128,578 which includes weekly wage-loss payments and payments for a 35% permanent partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">When claimant could no longer recover compensation payments under the LHWCA, he requested a hearing pursuant to the provisions of the Virginia Act. At the hearing before the deputy commissioner, employer contended that it was entitled to a dollar-for-dollar set off for amounts paid under the LHWCA against any award made by the commission pursuant to the provisions of the Virginia Act. The commission held that \u201cthe employer is entitled to set off the number of weeks that benefits were paid under LHWCA rather than the total amount ... of compensation paid under LHWCA.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Any weekly amounts employer paid under the LHWCA which exceeded what was due under the Virginia Act were not credited against employer\u2019s liability under the Virginia Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">When enacting the Virginia Act, the General Assembly anticipated that compensation benefits might be paid to injured employees other than those ordered by an award. Among the provisions of the act addressing payments made other than by the terms of the Virginia Act is Code \u00a7 65.2-520, entitled \u201cVoluntary payments by employer,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\"><em>Any </em>payments made by the employer to the injured employee during the period of his disability, or to his dependents, <em>which by the terms of this title were not dm and payable when made, </em>may, subject to the approval of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Commission, be deducted from the amount to be paid as compensation provided that, in the case of disability, such deductions shall be made by shortening the period during which compensation must be paid and not by reducing the amount of the weekly payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">(Emphasis added). Subject to the approval of the commission, an employer is entitled to a credit for <em>any </em>\u201cvoluntary payment\u201d it may have made to the employee.. As defined by the statute, a payment is \u201cvoluntary\u201d if it was not \u201cdue and payable\u201d by \u201cthe terms of this title\u201d when made. Thus, the disability payments employer paid claimant under the LHWCA were \u201cvoluntary\u201d because when paid they were not \u201cdue and payable\u201d under \u201cthe terms of\u2019 the Virginia Act. Therefore, the amounts paid under the LHWCA should have been deducted from employer\u2019s liability as determined by the commission. The statute makes no exception to its command, and its language directing that a credit be provided for \u201cany\u201d voluntary payments indicates an intent to provide a credit'for <em>all </em>payments that fall within its classification of \u201cvoluntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Both employer and the deputy commissioner cite <em>Tiller v. Long Homes, Inc., </em>228 Va. 343, 323 S.E.2d 71 (1984), as authority for their respective positions. In <em>Tiller, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed the commission\u2019s decision allowing the employer a credit against the award. The facts in <em>Tiller </em>are not the same as in the matter before us. The employer\u2019s overpayment in <em>Tiller </em>arose from its own mistake; employer\u2019s overpayment in this case resulted from payments made under the mandate of federal law. In both cases, however, the overpayments were \u201cvoluntary\u201d as defined in the Virginia Act. A case more closely analogous to the one before us is <em>Evans v. AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc., </em>332 N.C. 78, 418 S.E.2d 503 (1992). In <em>Evans, </em>the North Carolina Supreme Court held that an employer is entitled to a full dollar-for-dollar credit toward its workers\u2019 compensation liability for amounts paid prior to an award pursuant to the employer\u2019s disability plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We hold that the commission erred in concluding that employer was not entitled to credit for the amount employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>paid under the LHWCA that exceeded its obligation under the Virginia Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Except as to the issue of credit, the decision of the commission is affirmed. On the issue of credit for payments made by employer under the LHWCA, the commission is reversed and the case remanded. Upon remand, the commission shall determine the amount paid by employer as compensation under the LHWCA, which amount shall be set off against employer\u2019s liability under the Virginia Act and credit shall be given to employer for the excess amount paid against any future liability it may have to claimant for the injury received.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\">. No hearing was held on this claim until February 10, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-8\">. The deputy commissioner found that the total compensation claimant was entitled to under the Virginia Act was $112,516.54. Employer asserted before the commission that since it had paid claimant more than that sum, any award to be made by the commission had been satisfied, and it was due a credit of the overage paid.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
