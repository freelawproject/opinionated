Gregory was convicted in a bench trial of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, a second or subsequent offense, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C). Gregory contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized from him and that the evidence is insufficient to prove he intended to distribute cocaine. We hold that the trial court did not err and affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">At approximately 1:56 a.m. on April 9, 1994, Officer Ronald McClaren, Jr. received a radio dispatch that an anonymous caller reported that an individual \u201cwas standing out in the roadway [at the 1700 block of Carlyle Avenue in Richmond] flagging motorists down to ask them if they wanted to buy drugs.\u201d The caller described the individual as a black male wearing a green sweat jacket with a green hooded jacket underneath, a pair of dark jeans, and tennis shoes. The caller also provided information about the color, make, and \u201cother identifying characteristics\u201d of the automobile from which \u201cthe individual was supposedly dealing in drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">About two minutes after receiving the dispatch, Officer McClaren approached the 1700 block of Carlyle Avenue. He observed the defendant in a vehicle matching the description given by the anonymous tipster. The defendant was dressed in the manner described by the caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">As McClaren approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle, the defendant looked in McClaren\u2019s direction and began to walk away from the vehicle. He proceeded down Carlyle Avenue and looked over his shoulder toward McClaren as he walked. Officer McClaren drove his patrol car beside the defendant and stopped. Because McClaren could not see one of the defendant\u2019s hands, McClaren told the defendant to show the other hand. The defendant did not show both hands until McClaren exited his patrol car and drew his weapon. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the defendant showed both hands, McClaren reholstered his weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">McClaren explained to the defendant that he was responding to a call that an individual was seen selling drugs and that he was going to check to determine whether the defendant had outstanding arrest warrants. McClaren informed the defendant that he would be free to go if there were no problems. The defendant replied, \u201cit\u2019s not me. It wasn\u2019t me.\u201d McClaren then conducted a pat-down search of the defendant and felt objects, including a hard object, in the defendant\u2019s pocket. When McClaren asked the defendant what was in the pocket, he replied, \u201c[pjlease mister, please don\u2019t put anything in my pocket.\u201d McClaren asked the defendant again what was in the pocket and the defendant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d McClaren then asked the defendant if he had \u201cpermission to go into [the defendant\u2019s] pocket,\u201d and the defendant replied, \u201c[s]ure, you do.\u201d McClaren found seven individual bags of crack cocaine in the defendant\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Based on the foregoing evidence, the trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">At trial, McClaren testified that he had recovered seven baggies containing 3.4 grams of cocaine from the defendant and that the packaging and quantity of the cocaine were consistent with distribution. The trial court found the defendant guilty of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, a second or subsequent conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">A police officer may lawfully stop and frisk an individual if the officer possesses a reasonable suspicion, based on articulable facts, that the individual is or is about to be engaged in criminal activity. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884-85, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). The standard for conducting such a detention is less than probable cause, but more than an \u201cinchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moss v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 305, 308, 373 S.E.2d 170, 172 (1988) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883). \u201cOnce the police officer has properly detained a suspect for questioning, he may conduct a limited pat-down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>search of the suspect\u2019s outer clothing to search for weapons if the officer reasonably believes, based on specific and articulable facts, that the suspect might be armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 27, 30, 434 S.E.2d 918, 920 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In considering whether facts based on an anonymous tip are sufficient to provide a police officer a reason to suspect criminal activity, the United States Supreme Court has stated that \u201canonymous [information that has] been sufficiently corroborated [may] furnish reasonable suspicion ... [justifying an] investigative stop.\u201d <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 331, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2416-17, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990). Applying <em>Alabama v. White, </em>we have held that although the police do not have to verify every detail provided by an anonymous tipster, \u201c[significant aspects of the informer\u2019s information must be independently corroborated.\u201d <em>Bulatko v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 135, 137, 428 S.E.2d 306, 307 (1993). <em>See also Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 49, 54, 455 S.E.2d 261, 264 (1995) (holding that <em>Terry </em>stop was valid because known rehable \u201cinformants provided detailed, predictive information that the officers were able to corroborate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Here, the tipster provided a detailed description of the individual, the car, the location, and the nature of the illegal activity in which the individual was engaged. Although Officer McClaren did not observe the defendant engaged in illegal activity, McClaren verified certain details of what the tipster observed within moments after receiving the detailed account. McClaren verified that the defendant matched the physical description, wore clothes, and occupied a vehicle matching the description given by the tipster.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Admittedly, the facts as related by the caller could have been \u201ceasily obtained\u201d by a casual observer. <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. at 332, 110 S.Ct. at 2417; <em>see Hardy v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 433, 436, 399 S.E.2d 27, 29 (1990) (holding that verification of \u201cinnocent\u201d behavior is not sufficient to establish probable cause). In that vein, the Supreme Court noted in <em>Alabama v. White </em>that in evaluating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>informer\u2019s reliability that \u201cthe anonymous [tip] contained a range of details relating not just to easily obtained facts and conditions existing at the time of the tip, but to future actions of third parties ordinarily not easily predicted.\u201d <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. at 332, 110 S.Ct. at 2417 (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 245, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2335-36, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). The Court noted, however, that reasonable suspicion depends upon \u201cthe content of information possessed by [the] police\u201d as well as its reliability. <em>Id. </em>at 330, 110 S.Ct. at 2416. Accordingly, a detailed description, like that given here, by a caller who appears to have been a concerned citizen who recently observed a person hailing motorists to sell drugs, together with immediate verification of aspects of the description are important factors to consider in determining whether the officer had reasonable suspicion, even when the description contains facts that are \u201ceasily obtained.\u201d <em>See Draper v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">This Court has held that <em>Alabama v. White </em>does not pre- ' elude a finding of reasonable suspicion when the anonymous tipster does \u201cnot provid[e] the government with information that predicts the future actions of the [defendant], if some other indicia of reliability of the informant exists.\u201d <em>Beckner v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 533, 535, 425 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">It is well established that whether reasonable suspicion \u201cexists to warrant an investigatory stop is determined by the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1100, 1103, 407 S.E.2d 49, 51 (1991).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">The circumstances we may consider include \u201cthe \u2018characteristics of the area\u2019 where the stop occurs, the time of the stop, whether late at night or not, as well as any suspicious conduct of the person accosted such as an obvious attempt to avoid officers or any nervous conduct on the discovery of their presence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1103, 407 S.E.2d at 51-52 (quoting <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 53, 67, 354 S.E.2d 79, 87 (1987) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number><em>United States v. Bull, </em>565 F.2d 869, 870-71 (4th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 946, 98 S.Ct. 1531, 55 L.Ed.2d 545 (1978))). These circumstances are also relevant in determining the reliability of an anonymous informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In the present case, Officer McClaren found the defendant alone around 2:00 a.m. McClaren testified that \u201cwe always receive complaints of drug dealing in the area of [the 1700 block of] Carlyle Avenue.\u201d He also observed further suspicious behavior by the defendant. McClaren testified that \u201cwhen [the defendant] looked in my direction and saw me he immediately began walking away from the vehicle and began walking down Carlyle Avenue.\u201d The defendant walked away from McClaren and looked over his shoulder. When McClaren pulled his patrol car along side the defendant and said, \u201cgood morning,\u201d the defendant replied, \u201cwhat,\u201d and according to McClaren, seemed \u201cslightly agitated.\u201d The defendant had one of his hands slightly behind his back, and McClaren commanded him to \u201c[s]how me the other hand.\u201d The defendant refused to show his hands until McClaren exited his patrol car and drew his weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>the police officer saw Smith shortly after 10:00 p.m. on a playground that had a reputation as a place where drugs were prevalent. When Smith looked in the officer\u2019s direction, Smith suddenly placed something in his front pants pocket. We held that the officer\u2019s observations were insufficient to warrant an investigatory stop. <em>Smith, </em>12 Va.App. at 1104, 407 S.E.2d at 52; <em>see also Goodwin v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 363, 367, 398 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1990); <em>Moss, </em>7 Va.App. at 308, 373 S.E.2d at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In the present case, however, Officer McClaren observed the defendant at 2:00 a.m., in a known drug area, walking away from a car he had previously occupied. As he walked away, he looked over his shoulder repeatedly at Officer McClaren. Although McClaren did not observe the defendant flagging down cars or engaging in other activity consistent with drug distribution, the fact that the defendant exited his car and acted nervously upon noticing the police tends to add <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>credence to the officer\u2019s suspicion that the defendant was the person the tipster had described as flagging down vehicles and offering to sell the occupants drugs. The defendant\u2019s behavior thus tended to support the informer\u2019s report. Based upon the details of the informer\u2019s tip concerning the defendant\u2019s conduct in hailing motorists offering to sell drugs, the detailed description of the defendant, and Officer McClaren\u2019s independent observations and partial verification, McClaren had reason to suspect that the defendant was engaged in selling drugs. <em>See Draper, </em>358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327. Therefore, when McClaren stopped the defendant he had reason to detain the defendant temporarily in order to inquire about his activities and to investigate whether defendant was engaged in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Officer McClaren stated during cross-examination that he requested and was granted permission to search the defendant\u2019s pockets. The trial court found that the defendant granted \u201cclear permission ... for entry into [his] pockets.\u201d \u201cThe test of a valid consent search is whether it was \u2018freely and voluntarily given.\u2019 \u201d <em>Deer v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 730, 734, 441 S.E.2d 33, 36 (1994) (quoting <em>Bumper v. North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 548, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 1791-92, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968)). The Commonwealth must demonstrate that the consent was not the product of duress, and \u201c[t]he question of whether a particular \u2018consent to a search was in fact voluntary or was the product of duress or coercion, express or implied, is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of all the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 735, 441 S.E.2d at 36 (quoting <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 227, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2047-48, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Here, Officer McClaren conducted a valid <em>Terry </em>stop. Although he drew his weapon when the defendant did not show both hands, he reholstered the gun before asking for permission to search the defendant\u2019s pockets. McClaren informed the defendant that he was investigating a report of drug dealing and that the defendant would be free to go if there were no problems. On these facts, the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>finding that the defendant voluntarily consented to the search of his pockets was not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Limonja v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 532, 540, 383 S.E.2d 476, 481 (1989) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>495 U.S. 905, 110 S.Ct. 1925, 109 L.Ed.2d 288 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The defendant also contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he intended to distribute the cocaine seized from him. On appeal, the evidence is \u201cviewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, and given all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Albert v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 734, 741-42, 347 S.E.2d 534, 538 (1986). This Court will not disturb the trial judge\u2019s verdict \u201cunless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 742, 347 S.E.2d at 538-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u201cWhen the proof of intent to distribute narcotics rests upon circumstantial evidence, the quantity which the defendant possesses may indicate the purpose for which it is possessed. Possession of a quantity greater than that ordinarily possessed for one\u2019s personal use may be sufficient to establish an intent to distribute it.\u201d <em>Iglesias v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 93, 110, 372 S.E.2d 170, 180 (1988) <em>(en </em>banc) (citations omitted). At trial, Officer McClaren testified that, based upon his training and experience, he believed that possession of 3.4 grams of cocaine was consistent with distribution, not personal use. Moreover, McClaren also testified that the method of packaging of the cocaine seized from the defendant was consistent with distribution. <em>See Early v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 219, 222, 391 S.E.2d 340, 341-42 (1990). Although Officer McClaren testified on cross-examination that it was conceivable that an individual with \u201ca serious addiction\u201d could consume around three grams of cocaine in two days, we hold that his testimony, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to prove intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In addition to testifying that the amount of cocaine seized and the method of packaging were consistent with distribution, McClaren also testified that the tipster reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>that an individual was \u201cstanding in the street waving down motorists [and] asking them if they wanted to purchase drugs.\u201d Although the tipster\u2019s statement was inadmissible hearsay, <em>see Arnold v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 275, 279-80, 356 S.E.2d 847, 850 (1987), the defendant failed to object to the statement at the time it was offered into evidence. <em>See Burns v. Board of Supervisors, </em>227 Va. 354, 363, 315 S.E.2d 856, 862 (1984) (holding that failure to object to the admission of the statement constitutes a waiver of the hearsay objection). Therefore, the statement was properly before the trial court and was relevant to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Because the anonymous tip was sufficiently corroborated, Officer McClaren had reasonable suspicion to conduct a <em>Terry </em>investigatory stop. The seizure of the cocaine was valid because the defendant voluntarily consented to the search of his pockets. Therefore, the trial court did not err by overruling the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the cocaine. Moreover, the evidence was sufficient to prove that the defendant intended to distribute the cocaine seized from him. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b155-7\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AWK\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The evidence proved that the police dispatcher relayed an anonymous telephone tip to the officer. The officer acted on the tip and stopped Gregory. However, the officer did not know the tipster and had no basis to believe the tipster was honest or rehable. The evidence failed to establish that the anonymous tipster was rehable. Thus, the evidence failed to prove that the officer had a reasonable articulable suspicion to support a <em>Terry </em>stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">The principle is well established that \u201c[t]he informant must provide some basis for his knowledge before the pohce officer rehes upon it as being rehable enough to support an investigatory stop.\u201d <em>Beckner v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 533, 537, 425 S.E.2d 530, 533 (1993). In a case involving an anonymous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>tip, the Supreme Court ruled as follows in upholding a <em>Terry </em>stop:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">[T]he independent corroboration by the police of significant aspects of the informer\u2019s predictions imparted some degree of reliability to the other allegations made by the caller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">[It is] also important that, as in <em>[Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)], \u201cthe anonymous [tip] contained a range of details relating not just to easily obtained facts and conditions existing at the time of the tip, but to future actions of third parties ordinarily not easily predicted.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 245[, 103 S.Ct. at 2335-36]____ What was important was the caller\u2019s ability to predict respondent\u2019s <em>future behavior, </em>because it demonstrated inside information\u2014a special familiarity with respondent\u2019s affairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-8\"><em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 332, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2417, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990). Despite the predictive nature of the tip and the corroboration, the Court nonetheless concluded that \u201cit [was] a close case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Although this Court, in dicta, has stated that reasonable suspicion may exist even if the anonymous tipster does not \u201cprovid[e] the government with information that predicts the future actions of the [defendant],\u201d that statement was premised upon proof in the record that \u201csome other indicia of reliability of the informant exists.\u201d <em>Beckner, </em>15 Va.App. at 535, 425 S.E.2d at 531. In the absence of predictive information, the ingredient that allowed the Supreme Court in <em>White </em>to infer that the content of the information \u201cdemonstrated [the tipster had] ... a special familiarity with the [suspect\u2019s] affairs,\u201d 496 U.S. at 332, 110 S.Ct. at 2417, the Commonwealth must prove that the tipster had a special familiarity with the details of Gregory\u2019s affairs. Only then will the evidence support the anonymous tipster\u2019s reliability through other \u201cindicia.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 329-32, 110 S.Ct. at 2415-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">The tip that the officer acted upon when he stopped Gregory \u201c \u2018provide[d] virtually nothing from which one might conclude that [the tipster was] either honest or his information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>reliable.\u2019 \u201d 496 U.S. at 329, 110 S.Ct. at 2415. Nothing intrinsic to the tip reasonably allowed the officer to draw conclusions of honesty or reliability. The tip did not contain any information that indicated the tipster had a familiarity with Gregory\u2019s affairs. The tip neither predicted his future behavior nor contained \u201ca range of details relating not just to easily obtained facts and conditions existing at the time of the tip.\u201d <em>White, </em>496 U.S. at 332, 110 S.Ct. at 2417.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The substance of the tip might support an inference that the tipster saw Gregory in the vicinity. However, the tip did not convey any other information upon which an inference of guilt could have been made. The tipster might have been someone who merely bore a grudge against Gregory, or a practical joker, or another suspicious police officer. The record does not disclose any information concerning the tipster and contains no basis upon which to conclude that the tipster \u201cappears to have been a concerned citizen.\u201d Precisely because someone can easily harass another person, the Supreme Court has stated that \u201cif a tip has a relatively low degree of reliability, more information will be required to establish the requisite quantum of suspicion than would be required if the tip were more reliable.\u201d <em>White, </em>496 U.S. at 330, 110 S.Ct. at 2416.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">To guard against that same mischief, this Court barred <em>Terry </em>stops based on tips that reflected no more than a suspicion or a hunch of criminal activity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">The facts that the police rely upon must amount to more than an \u201cinchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch.\u2019 \u201d Here, the informant\u2019s tip did not provide a range of detail that would elevate what may have been a mere \u201chunch\u201d to a reasonable suspicion. If a hunch is not enough for a police officer to effectuate a stop, it follows that the hunch of an unnamed informant, albeit an informant with some indicia of personal reliability, is also not sufficient. The fact that the informant\u2019s hunch is conveyed to the police officer does not raise the hunch to the level of reasonable suspicion. \u201cManifestly, this conduct falls below activity necessary to justify a reasonable suspicion that a violation of law had occurred or was occurring.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>Beckner, </em>15 Va.App. at 537, 425 S.E.2d at 533 (citations omitted). The tip in this case neither established that the caller was \u201chonest [nor] his information reliable,\u201d <em>White, </em>496 U.S. at 329, 110 S.Ct. at 2415-16, nor negated the hypothesis that the tip was based solely on the observer\u2019s hunch. <em>Beckner, </em>15 Va.App. at 537, 425 S.E.2d at 533. \u201c[Something more\u201d than the tip was necessary to establish reasonable suspicion in this case. <em>White, </em>496 U.S. at 329, 110 S.Ct. at 2415-16 (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 227, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2326, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The Commonwealth attempted to establish the tipster\u2019s reliability by showing that the officer corroborated aspects of the tip by the officer\u2019s independent observations. Although the officer testified that he observed facts reported by the tipster, he observed nothing more than any uninformed tipster might have seen. The criminal conduct that the tipster reported, which may have been embellished because of a hunch, was not observed by the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The record established that the anonymous tipster described a person to the police dispatcher and informed the dispatcher that the person was \u201cstanding out in the roadway flagging motorists down to ask them if they wanted to buy drugs.\u201d When the officer arrived at the particular street, he saw a man sitting in a vehicle and dressed as described by the tipster. The officer saw no criminal or unusual activity. Thus, the officer did not corroborate in any manner the tipster\u2019s report of illegal conduct. The Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that \u201c[c]learly the officer reasonably inferred that the [tipster] had observed [Gregory] in the act of selling drugs\u201d is baseless. This record provides no foundation from which any such inference could have been drawn. Before the officer stopped Gregory, the officer observed \u201cnothing more than innocent details which any casual observer could have given.... Anyone who saw [Gregory] ... that day could have given the same description of him.\u201d <em>Hardy v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 433, 435, 399 S.E.2d 27, 28 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>The corroboration the Commonwealth relies upon consists of wholly innocent activity that would normally not command the attention of the police. These facts do not provide a basis to conclude that the tipster was reliable and certainly do not negate the hypothesis that the tipster\u2019s report was any more than a hunch of criminal activity. <em>See Beckner, </em>15 Va.App. at 537, 425 S.E.2d at 533. The only reasonable inference to draw from these facts is that the tipster saw Gregory in the area, nothing more. Conceding that the officer did not observe Gregory approaching passing vehicles or engaging in other activity consistent with drug distribution, the majority concludes that Gregory\u2019s departure from his car and \u201cnervous\u201d demeanor added credence to the tipster\u2019s report that a similarly dressed person had been offering to sell drugs. I fail to see the connection. Nothing that the officer observed in Gregory\u2019s behavior supported the tipster\u2019s report. When Gregory walked away from his vehicle and watched the police vehicle, he was engaged in perfectly lawful activity. We have no idea why Gregory acted as he did. However, he had a right to walk away from a police officer unless the police officer had grounds to detain him. The circular nature of the majority\u2019s reasoning is obvious. If you walk away from a police officer, you can\u2019t be stopped except upon reasonable suspicion, but if you walk away, <em>ipse dixit, </em>you have given the officer reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1100, 407 S.E.2d 49 (1991), a police officer saw Smith shortly after 10:00 p.m. on a playground that had a reputation as a place where drugs were prevalent. When Smith looked in the officer\u2019s direction, Smith suddenly placed something in his pants pocket. This Court held that the officer\u2019s observations of \u201csuspicious\u201d activity were not sufficient to warrant an investigatory stop. 12 Va.App. at 1104, 407 S.E.2d at 52. <em>See also Goodwin v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 363, 367, 398 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1990); Moss <em>v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 305, 308, 373 S.E.2d 170, 172 (1988). Likewise, the evidence in this record does not support the trial judge\u2019s finding that Gregory was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>lawfully stopped. I would hold that the trial judge erred in refusing to suppress the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Furthermore, the evidence in this case failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gregory intended to distribute the cocaine that was seized. The Commonwealth\u2019s proof of intent to distribute was based primarily upon the following testimony of the arresting officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">Q Seven individual baggies with how much weight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">A 3.4 grams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">Q Based upon your training and experience, is that method of packaging with that weight, is that consistent with personal use or distribution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">A Distribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">Q You base that on your years of working in the property section and your training and experience as a police officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The officer admitted, however, that a user of cocaine could personally consume three grams of cocaine in two days. On cross-examination, the officer was unable to testify as to the usage of a typical addicted person.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">Q Officer, based on your training and experience, how much crack cocaine could an individual smoke in a day if they\u2019re an addict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-13\">A If they\u2019re an addict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-14\">Q Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-15\">A Well, I couldn\u2019t really go into as far as what personal consumption would be for an individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">The relatively small quantity of cocaine warrants the inference that Gregory possessed it for his personal use. <em>See Dukes v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 119, 122-23, 313 S.E.2d 382, 384 (1984). Moreover, no other evidence indicated an intent to distribute. The individual packages of cocaine were not unique. \u201cThe mode of packaging and the way the packages were hidden are as consistent with possession for personal use as they are with intent to distribute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123, 313 S.E.2d at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>For these reasons, I would also hold that the evidence failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gregory possessed the cocaine with intent to distribute. Thus, I would reverse the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
