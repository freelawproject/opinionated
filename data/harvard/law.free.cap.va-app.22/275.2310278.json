(appellant) appeals the trial court\u2019s order affirming the Virginia Racing Commission\u2019s decision awarding licenses to Colonial Downs, L.P. to own a horse racetrack with pari-mutuel wagering, and to Stansley Racing Corporation to operate such a track. Appellant contends that the trial court erred by holding that the commission did not exceed its authority under the Virginia Pari-Mutuel Horse Racing Act (Horse Racing Act) in awarding an owner\u2019s license to a limited partnership, and an operator\u2019s license to a corporation that did not file an application with the commission. We hold that the commission acted within the scope of its authority and affirm the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The General Assembly enacted the Horse Racing Act in 1988 to allow horse racing with pari-mutuel betting in Virginia. As part of the legislation, the General Assembly created a racing commission and vested it with \u201ccontrol of all horse racing with pari-mutuel wagering in the Commonwealth, [and] with plenary power to prescribe regulations and conditions under which such racing and wagering shall be conducted, so as to maintain horse racing in the Commonwealth of the highest quality and free of any corrupt, incompetent, dishonest or unprincipled practices and to maintain in such racing complete honesty and integrity.\u201d Code \u00a7 59.1-364(A). The Act provides that \u201c[n]o person shall construct, establish or own a horse racetrack or satellite facility where pari-mutuel wagering is permitted\u201d without receiving an owner\u2019s license from the commission, and that \u201c[n]o person shall operate parimutuel wagering or conduct any race meeting at which wagering is permitted\u201d without first obtaining an operator\u2019s license from the commission. Code \u00a7 59.1-375.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Pursuant to its statutory authority, the commission established October 1, 1993, as the deadline for submitting applications for owner\u2019s and operator\u2019s licenses, prescribed the information to be provided in the applications, and permitted the filing of joint applications for owner\u2019s and operator\u2019s licenses. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 59.1-377, -381. Six applicants, Virginia Racing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Associates, L.P.; Virginians, Inc.; Churchill Downs, L.P.; Old Dominion Jockey Club, Inc.; Virginia Jockey Club, Inc.; and Stansley Management, L.P. submitted applications by October 1,1993. All six applicants submitted joint applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Stansley Management, L.P. (Stansley, L.P.) stated in its joint application that it would enter into a contract for the management of the racing facility with an entity controlled by Arnold Stansley. Arnold Stansley was Stansley, L.P.\u2019s general partner, and was also a limited partner along with James Leadbetter. Stansley owned seventy percent of Stansley, L.P., and Leadbetter owned thirty percent. In June 1994, Stansley, L.P. changed its name to Colonial Downs, L.P.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and substituted Stansley Management Corp. (Stansley Corp.) as its general partner in place of Arnold Stansley. Stansley Corp.\u2019s only shareholders are Stansley (70%) and Leadbetter (30%).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In May 1994, Colonial Downs informed the commission by letter that it would enter into a contract with Stansley Racing Corporation (Stansley Racing), a Virginia stock corporation to be formed, to operate and manage the racing facility if it received the owner\u2019s license. Stansley Racing was incorporated in June 1994, and its sole shareholders are Arnold Stansley (70%) and James Leadbetter (30%). Stansley and Leadbetter are also Stansley Racing\u2019s sole directors, and Arnold Stansley' is the corporation\u2019s President.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">As part of the application process, all six applicants provided financial data and analyses, engineering studies, architectural renderings, case studies, and demographic analyses in-support of their different approaches for establishing a horse racing facility. The commission held several meetings and public hearings, and inspected each of the sites proposed by the six applicants. In addition, the commission received analyses of the applications from two expert consultants and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>afforded the applicants the opportunity to review those analyses and question the consultants\u2019 representatives. The commission also conducted background investigations of all persons haying an ownership interest in the three corporations and three partnerships that applied for licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In June 1994, the commission held an informal fact finding conference to receive sworn testimony and exhibits on the applications. At the conference, each applicant delivered an opening statement and rebuttal and was examined under oath by the commission and by other applicants. In addition, members of the public were permitted to comment on each application. A written six-volume transcript of the conference was prepared and is part of the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">After the conference, the commission permitted the applicants to file post-hearing submissions until June 23, 1994, and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law until June 28, 1994. Because the applicants arid the public continued to file materials after the June deadlines, the commission reopened the record on September 14, 1994. The record was closed a second time on September 21,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In its case decision issued October 14, 1994, the commission found that Colonial Downs\u2019 proposal to construct a racetrack in New Kent County was superior to the other five proposals and awarded Colonial Downs an owner\u2019s license and Stansley Racing an operator\u2019s license. The commission expressly found that Colonial Downs and Stansley Racing possessed the best overall financial plan and a proven management team, and that the Colonial Downs facility could be developed more quickly than the other proposed facilities and offered \u201cthe best site for a racetrack in Virginia.\u201d Furthermore, the commission found that Colonial Downs and Stansley Racing had satisfied all of the statutory and regulatory license criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Appellant appealed the awards to the circuit court pursuant to Code \u00a7 59.1-373. The circuit court affirmed the commission\u2019s issuance of the licenses. The trial court held that Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>\u00a7 59.1-378 does not limit the commission\u2019s authority to grant licenses to corporations only and that the commission did not act arbitrarily by awarding Stansley Racing an operator\u2019s license, even though it \u201cdid not technically apply\u201d for a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We first address the commission\u2019s contention that the Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction over this appeal. Code \u00a7 17-116.05(1) expressly provides that the Court of Appeals shall have jurisdiction to review \u201c[a]ny final decision of a circuit court on appeal from a decision of an administrative agency.\u201d However, the commission argues that the provisions of Code \u00a7 59.1-373 control jurisdiction in this case rather than the general jurisdiction statute, and that by enacting Code \u00a7 59.1-373, the legislature intended that appeals from the commission would be by petition to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Code \u00a7 59.1-373 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">Any person aggrieved by a refusal of the Commission to issue any license or permit, the suspension or revocation of a license or permit, the imposition of a fine, or any other action of the Commission, may, within thirty days of such action, appeal to the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. If the court finds that the action of the Commission was arbitrary, it shall order such action as it deems appropriate. The decision of the court shall be subject to appeal <em>as in other cases at law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">(Emphasis added). The commission contends that the General Assembly made its intent clear by using the language \u201cas in other cases at law\u201d because appeals of actions at law generally he with the Supreme Court. Code \u00a7 8.01-670(A)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In <em>Commonwealth v. E.W. Yeatts, Inc., </em>233 Va. 17, 353 S.E.2d 717 (1987), the Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over a \u201ccivil action\u201d instituted pursuant to Code \u00a7 33.1-387<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because the right to file the action is dependent upon compliance with the administrative procedures set forth in Code \u00a7 33.1-386.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 24, 353 S.E.2d at 721. The Court reasoned that \u201c[djivining legislative intent ... is not a contest of labels but an exercise in common sense interpretation of statutory language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, because the right to bring a civil action under Code \u00a7 33.1-387 arises in the context of an administrative action, the Court held that it is \u201ca \u00a7 17-116.05(1) appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The rationale in <em>Yeatts </em>is controlling here. Use of the terms \u201ccivil action\u201d or \u201cother cases at law\u201d in a statute does not, standing alone, define jurisdiction and divest this Court of its express jurisdiction. Had the legislature intended to grant the Supreme Court jurisdiction over the circuit court\u2019s review of appeals from the racing commission, it would have expressly so provided. As the Supreme Court instructed in <em>Yeatts, </em>such an indirect reference should not be construed to define jurisdiction or supercede the express mandate of Code \u00a7 17-116.05(1). Accordingly, we deny the commission\u2019s motion to transfer jurisdiction of this appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Appellant contends that a partnership is ineligible to receive an owner\u2019s license under Code \u00a7 59.1-378. Appellant bases this contention upon language in Code \u00a7 59.1-378(C) to the effect that the commission shall deny a license to any applicant that is not a corporation which meets specified criteria. The appellant misconstrues the statute. The conditions apply only to applicants that are corporations and do not require that an applicant be a corporation in order to be eligible for an owner\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u201c[A] fundamental rule of statutory construction requires that courts view the entire body of legislation and the statutory scheme to determine the \u2018true intention of each part.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia Real Estate Bd. v. Clay, </em>9 Va.App. 152, 157, 384 S.E.2d 622, 625 (1989) (quoting <em>McDaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 287, 292, 99 S.E.2d 623, 627 (1957)), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>398 S.E.2d 78 (1990); <em>see also Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>155 Va. 1, 11, 155 S.E. 635, 638 (1930) (stating that \u201cthe legislative intention must be sought from the whole act, and not merely from certain parts of it\u201d). Code \u00a7 59.1-377 expressly permits \u201cany person,\u201d which under the Horse Racing Act includes a \u201cnatural person\u201d or partnership, Code \u00a7 59.1-365, to apply for an owner\u2019s license. Furthermore, Code \u00a7 59.1-378(B) directs the commission to deny a license to an applicant if \u201cthe applicant, or any officer, <em>partner, </em>principal stockholder, or director of the applicant\u201d has engaged in designated illegal conduct or undesirable practices. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Appellant\u2019s selective emphasis on certain phrases in Code \u00a7 59.1-378(0 disregards the other statutory provisions, which clearly indicate that individuals, joint ventures, partnerships, associations, or corporations are eligible to receive an owner\u2019s license. <em>See Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. Citizens for Safe Power, </em>222 Va. 866, 869, 284 S.E.2d 613, 615 (1981) (stating that \u201ca statute is not to be construed by singling out a particular phrase\u201d). We hold, therefore, that Code \u00a7 59.1-378(C), read in the context of the Horse Racing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Act, does not apply to all applicants, but only to corporate applicants. Thus, the trial court did not err in holding that Colonial Downs, operating as a limited partnership, was eligible to receive an owner\u2019s license.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Appellant next contends that the trial court erred by affirming the commission\u2019s decision to award an operator\u2019s license to the Stansley Racing Corporation. Appellant argues that because Stansley Racing was not formed until June 1994, it did not exist when applications were being submitted and its officers did not file an application for an operator\u2019s license on its behalf before the October 1, 1993 application deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Code \u00a7 59.1-381(A) provides that \u201c[a]ny person desiring to hold a race meeting or operate a satellite facility shall file with the Commission an application for an operator\u2019s license.\u201d Furthermore, Code \u00a7 59.1-382 provides that the commission shall ... grant a valid operator\u2019s license to <em>applicants </em>who meet the criteria set forth in this chapter and established by the Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Appellant contends that this language is clear and unambiguous and that we cannot resort to general rules of statutory construction. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Eaton, </em>248 Va. 426, 430, 448 S.E.2d 652, 655 (1994). Appellant argues that Stansley Racing did not exist on October 1, 1993, and did not apply for an operator\u2019s license. Therefore, Stansley Racing was not an \u201capplicant,\u201d and the commission exceeded its statutory authority by awarding Stansley Racing an operator\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Colonial Downs, a limited partnership, had filed a joint application for licenses to own and operate a racetrack and provided all of the required personal and financial information concerning the partnership and the limited and general partners. Several months after filing the application, Arnold Stansley and James Leadbetter, the sole partners of Colonial Downs, formed a corporation, Stansley Racing. The partners informed the commission that this corporation, of which they were the sole stockholders, officers, and directors, would operate and manage the racetrack if Colonial Downs was awarded the owner\u2019s license. As the trial court noted in holding that Stansley Racing was eligible to receive an operator\u2019s license, \u201c[t]he same people who owned [Colonial Downs] now own Stansley Racing Corp., and they own it in the same percentages.\u201d Therefore, the question raised on these facts is not simply, as appellant suggests, whether the commission can award a license to an entity that does not apply. Clearly, an application must be filed before the commission may award a license. The critical issue before the commission, which is the dispositive issue on appeal, is the extent to which the commission possesses the inherent authority to discharge its responsibility under the Act by allowing an applicant to change its legal or organizational structure, or its ownership interests, and to amend its application or supplement its disclosure documents to reflect changes brought about by ongoing, legitimate business decisions and financial transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Whether an administrative agency has acted within the scope of its authority is a question of law. <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 242, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1988). \u2018Where the agency has the statutory authorization to make the kind of decision it did and it did so within the statutory limits of its discretion and with the intent of the statute in mind, it has not committed an error of law....\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, as appellant contends, when the question is whether the agency has \u201cfailed to comply with statutory authority ... less deference is required and the reviewing courts should not abdicate their judicial function and merely rubber-stamp an agency determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243, 369 S.E.2d at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Although the commission derives its powers from the Horse Racing Act, \u201c[t]he statutory grant of power is not strictly limited ... to the narrow confines of the express language of the statute. \u2018[E]very power expressly granted, or fairly implied from the language used, or which is necessary to enable [the commission] to exercise the powers expressly granted, should and must be accorded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Muse v. Alcohol Beverage Control Bd., </em>9 Va.App. 74, 78, 384 S.E.2d 110, 112 (1989) (quoting <em>Portsmouth v. Virginia Ry. &amp; Power Co., </em>141 Va. 54, 61, 126 S.E. 362, 364 (1925)); <em>see also Fairfax County v. Miller &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>222 Va. 230, 237, 279 S.E.2d 158, 162 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Code \u00a7 59.1-382 neither expressly grants nor denies the commission the authority to allow an applicant to amend its application or to supplement its disclosure document. The Horse Racing Act does not contain a definition of \u201capplicant.\u201d In arguing that an applicant should not be permitted to amend its application, particularly by substituting a newly formed corporation for a partnership, the appellant urges this Court to adopt the narrow definition of \u201capplicant\u201d that the legislature has used in other instances. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 3.1-126.2:1 (\u201c \u2018Applicant\u2019 means the person who applies for, or requests, a license, or applies for registration of any liming material; or applies to become a contractor\u201d); Code \u00a7 10.1-1400 (\u201c \u2018Applicant\u2019 means any and all persons seeking or holding a permit required under this chapter\u201d); Code \u00a7 59.1-78 (\u201c \u2018Applicant\u2019 means a person filing an application for registration of trademark, case mark or service mark under this chapter, and includes his legal representatives, successors and assigns\u201d). However, because the Act does not expressly address the administrative agency\u2019s authority to allow amendments, substitutions, or supplements to applications or disclosures, or the nature or extent of such modification, we look to \u201c[t]he \u2018basic law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under which the Commission acted and the purposes thereof\u2019 in order to determine whether the commission exceeded its statutory authority by granting Stansley Racing an operator\u2019s license. <em>Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Comm\u2019n v. York St. Inn, Inc., </em>220 Va. 310, 313, 257 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>851, 858 (1979) (footnote omitted). \u201cThose purposes must be gleaned from an analysis of the overall statutory and regulatory scheme for the [licensing of racetracks].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313-14, 257 S.E.2d at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The Code provisions that govern the licensing of owners and operators of horse racing tracks with pari-mutuel betting address two primary public policy concerns. First, the legislation emphasized protecting the honesty and integrity of horse racing in the Commonwealth. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 59.1-364(A), -378(B), -379, -382(5). Applicants for both owner\u2019s and operator\u2019s licenses must provide the name and address of each individual who has an ownership interest or other pecuniary interest, Code \u00a7 59.1-377(A)(2), and are required to disclose \u201c[s]uch information as the Commission deems appropriate regarding the character, background and responsibility of the applicant and the members, partners, stockholders, officers and directors of the applicant.\u201d Code \u00a7 59.1-377(A)(3). Furthermore, the commission must deny a license to an applicant if the applicant or one of its owners has failed to disclose any information requested, or has engaged in certain dishonest, fraudulent, unethical, illegal, or questionable practices or behavior. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 59.1-378(B), -379; <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 59.1-382(5) (providing that \u201c[t]he Commission shall deny a license to any applicant, unless it finds ... [t]hat the applicant has made provisions satisfactory to the Commission for the detection and prosecution of any illegal, corrupt or fraudulent act, practice or conduct in connection with any race meeting or pari-mutuel wagering\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Second, the legislation is designed to ensure that horse racing is conducted on a sound financial basis, according to accepted business and management practices, in order to promote the success and growth of the horse racing industry in the Commonwealth. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 59.1-364(A) (\u201cHorse racing with pari-mutuel wagering as licensed herein shall be permitted in the Commonwealth for the promotion, sustenance and growth of a native industry, in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of the people\u201d). Under Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>\u00a7 59.1-377, the application must provide information pertaining to the financial responsibility of all applicants or persons with a financial interest in the operation, the terms of leases or financing agreements, and detailed information about all stockholders, officers, and directors of a corporate owner, or each individual or partner of a partnership or joint venture. The commission is further instructed to \u201cdeny a license to any applicant, unless it finds that the applicant\u2019s facilities are or will be appropriate for the finest quality of racing, and meet or will meet the minimum standards that any track provided for standard breed racing be at least five-eighths of a mile, that any dirt track provided for flat racing be at least one mile, and that any track provided for flat or jump racing on the turf be at least seven-eighths of a mile.\u201d Code \u00a7 59.1-378(A). The commission is given broad discretion to \u201crequire such information about the enclosure and location of [the proposed] track as it deems necessary and appropriate to determine whether they comply with the minimum standards \u2022 provided in this chapter, and whether the conduct of a race meeting or parimutuel wagering at such location would be in the best interests of the people of the Commonwealth.\u201d Code \u00a7 59.1-377(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The application procedure is intended to ensure that the commission obtains and possesses all information necessary and desirable in order for it to render decisions that will promote \u201chonesty and integrity\u201d and the \u201cgrowth of a native industry.\u201d Code \u00a7 59.1-364(A). Clearly the legislature did not intend to unduly restrict the racing commission\u2019s ability to authorize applicants to pursue sound business or financial practices. The General Assembly granted the commission broad power and discretion to prescribe the information required in the application process and to evaluate the applications. Inherent in this broad grant of authority is the power to approve or require any amendments, substitutions, or supplements that sound business practices may dictate.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">As the trial court noted, the commission \u201chad all of the facts before it necessary to render its decision.\u201d Stansley Racing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>provided the commission with copies of its articles of incorporation and bylaws. From these documents, as well as the other information provided, the commission was able to determine that Arnold Stansley and James Leadbetter were Stansley Racing Corporation\u2019s sole stockholders and directors and that Stansley Racing was in compliance with Code \u00a7 59.1-382. The partners in Colonial Downs were the same persons who were the sole stockholders, officers, and directors of Stansley Racing. Furthermore, the formation of Stansley Racing did not affect or alter the substance of Colonial Downs\u2019 application with respect to the location, design, financing, and plan of operation for the proposed racetrack. The substitution of Stansley Racing for Colonial Downs did not require the commission to investigate additional parties or evaluate a proposal different from that which Colonial Downs offered. For these reasons, the commission\u2019s decision to award a license to Stansley Racing without requiring it to file a separate application did not exceed the commission\u2019s statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">If we adopted appellant\u2019s narrow definition of the commission\u2019s authority, we would frustrate the commission\u2019s ability to award licenses in a manner that would be \u201cin the best interests of the people of the Commonwealth.\u201d The commission might determine that an individual applicant\u2019s racetrack proposal was far superior to all other proposals, but that the interests of horse racing in Virginia would be better served if the applicant was a corporation that would have an ongoing existence as opposed to an individual or partnership. These considerations would fall within the commission\u2019s expertise and discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Nonetheless, under appellant\u2019s interpretation of the commission\u2019s statutory authority, the commission would essentially be limited to four options: it could request the individual applicant to incorporate and resubmit another application; it could award the individual applicant the license despite its misgivings; it could reject a superior application for a less desirable one; or it could reject all applications and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>repeat the application process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> All of these options would hinder and unduly limit the commission in its ability to \u201cpromptly consider\u201d the applications, Code \u00a7 59.1-382, and, most importantly, to work with, foster, oversee, and award licenses to applicants in a manner that will serve \u201cthe best interests of the people of the Commonwealth.\u201d Code \u00a7 59.1-377(A)(4). We hold, therefore, that the commission did not exceed its authority by awarding the license to a corporation when the stockholders, officers, and directors were the partners in the limited partnership that submitted the approved application. The ability of the commission to make business decisions of this nature \u201cis necessary to enable [the commission] to exercise the powers expressly granted.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Muse, </em>9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Va.App. at <em>78, 384 </em>S.E.2d at 112 (quoting <em>Portsmouth v.

A contrary finding would not only frustrate the Horse Racing Act\u2019s purposes, but would conflict with the maxim \u201c \u2018that the [administrative agency] shall apply expert discretion to the matters coming within its cognizance, and judicial interference is permissible only for relief against the arbitrary or capricious action that constitutes a clear abuse of the delegated discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>York St. Inn, </em>220 Va. at 315, 257 S.E.2d at 855 (quoting <em>Schmidt v.

Appellant also contends that under Code \u00a7 59.1-382, the commission can only <em>award </em>operator's licenses to corporations. Because the commission awarded the operator\u2019s license to a corporation, a ruling on this issue would not affect the outcome of the controversy. \" 'The duty of this court, as of every other judicial tribunal, is to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or <em>to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it.\u2019 \u201d Hankins v. Town of Virginia Beach, </em>182 Va. 642, 644, 29 S.E.2d 831, 832 (1944) (quoting <em>Mills v. Green, </em>159 U.S. 651, 653, 16 S.Ct. 132, 132-33, 40 L.Ed. 293 (1895)) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b335-4\">. The facts of this case raise a similar scenario. Apparently, the formation of Stansley Racing was in response to concern that only corporations may qualify to obtain an operator\u2019s license under Code \u00a7 59.1-382(1). Although the proper interpretation of Code \u00a7 59.1-382 is not an issue before this Court, the statutoiy language reasonably interpreted suggests that only corporations are eligible to receive an operator\u2019s license. Therefore, the commission was faced with the possibility that three of the joint applicants were ineligible to receive an operator\u2019s license. Under appellant\u2019s interpretation of the commission\u2019s authority, the only options available to the commission were to begin the application process over again or award the license to one of the corporate applicants regardless of whether their proposals would best serve the interests of the people of the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b335-5\">. Appellant also notes that the commission\u2019s instructions regarding the applications provide that \u2018\u2018[ajmendments will be accepted until January 3, 1994.\u201d However, it is clear from the commission\u2019s actions throughout the application process that the deadline applied to when applicants could amend their applications as a matter of right. The deadline did not preclude the commission from allowing amendments or supplements to the application process which might be necessary or desirable for business reasons, provided the commission did not allow or prohibit amendments by the various applicants. \"[T]he interpretation which an administrative agency gives its regulation must be accorded great deference and will not be set aside unless arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Virginia Real Estate Bd. v. Clay, </em>9 Va.App. 152, 159, 384 S.E.2d 622, 626 (1989). The only indication in the instructions regarding the meaning of the term \"amendments\u201d is the statement that \"[mjergers and acquisitions of ownership interest by persons other than those listed in the application will be treated as an amendment to the application(s) affected by the merger or change in ownership.\u201d Because the commission had to investigate all persons with an ownership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>interest in the applicants, it had good reason to be more concerned with changes in ownership as opposed to changes that did not involve the addition of new parties. Moreover, the commission gave all applicants the opportunity to make changes to their organizational structure after January 3, 1994. Appellant, for instance, amended its articles of incorporation in April 1994 to provide for the repurchase of stock in accordance with Code \u00a7 59.1-378. We hold, therefore, that the commission\u2019s interpretation and application of its instructions regarding the deadline for amendments was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b336-7\">BAKER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ALo\">concurring in part, dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s affirmation of the trial court\u2019s finding that an operator\u2019s license was legally granted to an entity that did not apply for such license within the time set by the Virginia Racing Commission (commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>It is clear from this record that the commission set October 1, 1993 as the deadline for filing applications.

For this reason, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the matter with direction that the trial court enter an order revoking the operator\u2019s license granted to Stansley Racing Corporation by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">I agree that this Court has jurisdiction to decide matters over which the commission has authority and that there is nothing in the statutes that created its authority which requires owners or operators to be corporate entities.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
