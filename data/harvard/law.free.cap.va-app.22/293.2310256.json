DCSE contends that Code \u00a7 20-49.1(B) requires that when DNA test results show a probability of paternity of 98% or greater, the trial court must treat the results as the equivalent of a judgment finding paternity and, therefore, the trial court erred by finding nonpaternity despite DNA test results showing a 99.92% probability of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">We hold that Code \u00a7 20-49.1(B) applies only when the parties have signed a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity under oath, or after having signed such an acknowledgement have obtained a \u201csubsequent\u201d genetic test that affirms at least a 98% probability of paternity. Because the parties had not executed an acknowledgement of paternity, Code \u00a7 20-49.1(B) does not apply. Therefore, Code \u00a7 20-49.4 is the applicable statute by which we review the trial court\u2019s decision that DCSE failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Flaneary is the biological father of Gerald Lee Overby.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Upon our review, and applying the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-49.4, we hold that the unimpeached DNA test results showing a 99.92% probability of paternity and the uncontroverted evidence that Debra Overby and Flaneary had sexual intercourse during the period of conception proved paternity, as a matter of law, by clear and convincing evidence. Thus, because the trial court\u2019s finding that Flaneary is not Gerald Lee Overby\u2019s father is plainly wrong, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and remand the matter for the court to enter an appropriate order of paternity and to determine child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">I. <em>FACTS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">On March 17, 1987, Debra Overby gave birth to a son, Gerald Lee Overby. Because Debra Overby received public assistance for her son\u2019s support, she assigned the right to child support from the father to DCSE. In 1992, DCSE required Debra Overby to identify the child\u2019s father and she named Willard Edward Stump as the biological father. Stump voluntarily agreed to paternity testing, and the test results positively excluded him as the child\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">After Stump was excluded, DCSE again requested that Debra Overby identify the father. This time, she identified James Flaneary, the appellee, as the father. DCSE filed a petition against Flaneary to establish paternity and to assess and order the payment of child support. The court ordered that DNA blood tests be conducted on Debra Overby, Gerald Lee Overby, Flaneary, and Flaneary\u2019s brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The DNA test results excluded Flaneary\u2019s brother as the father. In testing Flaneary, the laboratory probed six genetic systems from the child and parents for comparison. Five of the six systems probed from Flaneary matched those of Gerald Lee Overby and, according to the laboratory\u2019s calculations, these phenotype comparisons established a probability of paternity for Flaneary of 99.92%. According to the lab\u2019s report, the calculations were based upon accepted guidelines established by the American Association of Blood Banks. A second mismatch between the child\u2019s and Flaneary\u2019s pheno<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>types would have excluded Flaneary as the father. However, each phenotype of the child\u2019s that matched Flaneary\u2019s significantly increased the statistical probability that he is the child\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">At the evidentiary hearing, Debra Overby acknowledged that she had previously signed an affidavit naming Willard Stump as the child\u2019s father and that she told a representative of DOSE that Flaneary was not Gerald\u2019s father. Overby testified that she had first named Stump as the father because he and Flaneary were the only two men she had sexual relations with during the period of conception and Flaneary had told her that he could not father a child. She testified that she first had sexual intercourse with Flaneary on July 6, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Dr. Daniel B. Demers, an expert in DNA testing, gave two possible explanations why the failure of one of Gerald Over-by\u2019s genetic systems to match that of Flaneary did not exclude paternity: \u201c(1) The rare likelihood that James Flaneary had the same genetic material as an unknown man in the population or (2) Mr. Flaneary was the biological father but a rare mutational even[t] occurred during spermatogenesis.\u201d Demers testified that, in his opinion, the second explanation was the most likely of the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Demers further explained that Stump and Flaneary\u2019s brother were only probed three times, while Flaneary was probed six times, because Stump and the brother did not match Gerald after three probes and, thus, were excluded. He explained that the percentage of probability of paternity increases each time the blood is probed and a match is found between the child\u2019s and putative father\u2019s genetic systems or genetic markers. On cross-examination, Demers explained that because five phenotypes matched, it was highly probable, but not definite, that Flaneary was the child\u2019s father, and that had there been a second inconsistent probe, Flaneary would have been excluded as the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Flaneary testified that Overby told him that she was already pregnant when they first had sexual intercourse. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>also denied that he was the father and denied that he told anyone that he was the father. Furthermore, in light of Overby\u2019s testimony that she first had sexual intercourse with Flaneary on July 6, 1986, he introduced medical records from Overby\u2019s obstetrician which indicated that her pregnancy could have begun in early June 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">In holding that Overby and DCSE had failed to carry the burden of proving paternity, the trial court found that Over-by\u2019s testimony was \u201cequivocal [and] confused,\u201d that Flaneary denied paternity, and that the DNA testing \u201cha[d] at least one joker.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court ruled that Flaneary was not Gerald Lee Overby\u2019s father and dismissed DCSE\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">II. <em>ANALYSIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">DCSE, citing Code \u00a7 20-49.1(B), contends that when DNA testing affirms at least a 98% probability of paternity, the test results are conclusive as to paternity and the trial court need not consider other evidence of paternity. Code \u00a7 20-49.1(B) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">[t]he parent and child relationship between a child and a man may be established by a written statement of the father and mother made under oath acknowledging paternity or subsequent scientifically reliable genetic tests, including blood tests, which affirm at least a ninety-eight percent probability of paternity. Such statement or blood test result shall have the same legal effect as a judgment entered pursuant to \u00a7 20-49.8. In the absence of such acknowledgment or if the probability of paternity is less than ninety-eight percent, such relationship may be established as otherwise provided in this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Thus, DCSE argues that either a sworn acknowledgement of paternity <em>or </em>a genetic test result showing the requisite probability of paternity has the same legal effect as a judgment of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Flaneary asserts that Code \u00a7 20-49.4, not Code \u00a7 20-49.1, controls contested paternity proceedings. Code \u00a7 20-49.4 provides, \u201cin <em>any </em>action to establish parentage, ... [a]ll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>relevant evidence on the issue of paternity shall be admissible ... [and] may include, but shall not be limited to ... [t]he results of scientifically reliable genetic tests, including blood tests, if available, weighted with all the evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added). Moreover, Flaneary points out that under Code \u00a7 20-49.4, paternity must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. He notes that Code \u00a7 20-49.4 sets forth a nonexclusive list of the types of evidence, including scientifically reliable genetic tests, that are relevant to prove paternity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues, therefore, that Code \u00a7 20-49.1 applies only when a sworn voluntary acknowledgement of paternity exists and that Code \u00a7 20-49.4 applies in contested judicial proceedings to establish paternity where, as in this case, no voluntary acknowledgement exists, or where the genetic testing reports less than a 98% probability ofpaternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The initial question presented by DCSE is whether Code \u00a7 20-49.1 applies and requires a trial court in a contested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>paternity proceeding to give genetic test results affirming at least a 98% probability of paternity the same legal effect as a judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Clearly, the major purpose for enacting Code \u00a7 20-49.1 was to eliminate the necessity of obtaining a judicial adjudication of paternity in cases where both parents voluntarily acknowledge under oath a child\u2019s paternity. <em>See </em>1990 General Assembly, Summary of Legislative Proposal Priority 1, Department of Social Services, Legislative Draft File, House Bill 961 (1990); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 63.1-250.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">In <em>Dunbar v. Hogan, </em>16 Va.App. 653, 658-59, 432 S.E.2d 16, 19 (1993), we held, however, that under Code \u00a7 20-49.1, a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity under oath does not preclude a party from litigating paternity even though the statute provides that such acknowledgement shall be accorded the effect of a \u201cjudgment entered pursuant to \u00a7 20-49.8.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We held that such acknowledgements are accorded treatment as a judgment for such purposes as administrative support orders, Code \u00a7 63.1-250.1, or full faith and credit to foreign support orders and other payments. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-49.8(B). Thus, even if Code \u00a7 20-49.1 applied to cases \u2022where the parties had not voluntarily acknowledged paternity but where genetic test results affirm at least a 98% probability of paternity, the <em>Dunbar </em>rationale would not preclude the putative father from contesting and litigating the issue of paternity. When litigating the issue of paternity, the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>then is whether Code \u00a7 20-49.1 applies and requires that DNA test results that affirm at least a 98% probability of paternity be accorded either a rebuttable or conclusive presumption of paternity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">It is a well established rule of construction that a statute ought to be interpreted in such a manner that it may have effect, and not found to be vain and elusive____ It is our duty to give effect to the wording of the statute, and allow the legislative intention to be followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\"><em>Barnett v. D.L. Bromwell, Inc., </em>6 Va.App. 30, 34, 366 S.E.2d 271, 273 (1988) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>McFadden v. McNorton, </em>193 Va. 455, 461, 69 S.E.2d 445, 449 (1952)). In <em>Dunbar, </em>we decided only that under Code \u00a7 20-49.1 an acknowledgement of paternity under oath is not <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel to a judicial adjudication of paternity; we did not consider the extent to which or whether Code \u00a7 20-49.1 controls or has any effect in a judicial proceeding to determine paternity. We hold that Code \u00a7 20-49.1, by its terms, applies only where the parties have voluntarily acknowledged paternity under oath, or where after acknowledging paternity under oath a <em>\u201csubsequent </em>scientifically reliable genetic test[ ] ... affirm[s] at least a ninety-eight percent probability of paternity.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The purpose of Code \u00a7 20-49.1, as we pointed out in <em>Dunbar, </em>was to deal with paternity claims that the parties voluntarily agreed upon, including those that \u201csubsequently\u201d were verified by genetic testing that affirmed a high probability of paternity. Code \u00a7 20-49.1 provides that those situations shall be treated as judgments for certain purposes, such as collection and enforcement of support through administrative orders or full faith and credit, even though there has been no formal adjudication of paternity. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20^49.8(B). The legislative history and statutory scheme make clear that Code \u00a7 20-49.4 controls contested paternity disputes and Code \u00a7 20^49.1 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Many states have enacted paternity statutes establishing a rebuttable presumption of paternity where genetic test results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>report a paternity equal to or greater than a designated percentage. <em>See, e.g., Howie v. Thomas, </em>514 N.W.2d 822, 824 (Minn.Ct.App.1994) (statute provides that when a blood test from accredited laboratory shows a paternity probability of 99% or greater, the burden shifts to the alleged father to prove nonpaternity by clear and convincing evidence); <em>Filkins v. Cales, </em>86 Ohio App.3d 61, 619 N.E.2d 1156, 1158 (1993) (statute provides that genetic test results indicating a probability of 95% or greater raises presumption of paternity and satisfies preponderance of evidence burden of proof, thereby requiring presumed father to rebut by clear and convincing evidence); <em>Gregory v. McLemore, </em>899 P.2d 1189 (Okla.Ct.App. 1995) (statute creates rebuttable presumption of paternity where scientifically reliable genetic tests show statistical probability of paternity at 95% or more); <em>In re the Paternity of J.M.K., </em>160 Wis.2d 429, 465 N.W.2d 833, 835 (Ct.App.1991) (statute creates a rebuttable presumption of paternity where an alleged father is shown to have a statistical probability of paternity of 99% or higher), <em>review denied, </em>471 N.W.2d 510 (Wis.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Code \u00a7 20-49.1 neither expressly establishes a rebut-table presumption of paternity nor otherwise addresses the \u201chost of technical, legal questions\u201d presented by such a presumption. D.H. Kaye, <em>Presumptions, Probability and Paternity, </em>30 Jurimetrics 323, 327 (1989-90). Therefore, we decline to establish such a presumption under the guise of statutory construction. <em>See Barnett, </em>6 Va.App. at 34, 366 S.E.2d at 273. Rather, we hold that the Virginia General Assembly intended that \u201csubsequent\u201d genetic test results showing a probability of paternity of 98% or higher are to be given greater weight only when accompanied by a <em>prior </em>voluntary acknowledgement of paternity under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">By contrast, Code \u00a7 20-49.4 contains no rebuttable presumption of paternity. To the contrary, it expressly provides that the genetic test results shall be considered together with the other evidence of paternity and given such weight as the fact finder determines is justified. Where there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>voluntary acknowledgement of paternity under oath, or where there is an acknowledgement but a party in interest challenges paternity and the genetic test results show a probability of paternity of less than 98%, paternity shall be established in accordance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-49.4. Because there was no acknowledgement of paternity here, the decision of the trial court will be affirmed unless, as a matter of law, clear and convincing evidence proves paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Code \u00a7 20\u201449.4, provides that \u201c[t]he standard of proof in <em>any </em>action to establish parentage shall be by clear and convincing evidence. All relevant evidence on the issue of paternity shall be admissible.\u201d (Emphasis added). Among the nonexclusive list of factors that may be considered to prove paternity under Code \u00a7 20-49.4 are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">1. Evidence of open cohabitation or sexual intercourse between the known parent and the alleged parent at the probable time of conception; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">3. The results of scientifically rehable genetic tests, including blood tests, if available, weighted with all the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Clear and convincing evidence is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK5\">[t]hat measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established. It is intermediate, being more than a mere preponderance, but not to the extent of such certainty as is required beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases. It does not mean clear and unequivocal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-9\"><em>Martin v. Pittsylvania County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>3 Va.App. 15, 21, 348 S.E.2d 13, 16 (1986) (quoting <em>Gifford v. Dennis, </em>230 Va. 193, 198 n. 1, 335 S.E.2d 371, 373 n. 1 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">On appeal, the reviewing court cannot set aside the judgment of the trial court sitting without a jury unless it is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u00a7 8.01-680; <em>see Hankerson v. Moody, </em>229 Va. 270, 274, 329 S.E.2d 791, 794 (1985).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\">However, a trial court\u2019s conclusion based on evidence that is \u201cnot in material conflict\u201d does not have this binding effect on appeal. The trier of fact must determine the weight of the testimony and the credibility of the witnesses, but it \u201cmay not arbitrarily disregard uncontradicted evidence of unimpeached witnesses which is not inherently incredible and not inconsistent with facts in the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><em>Hankerson, </em>229 Va. at 274, 329 S.E.2d at 794 (citations omitted). In order to reverse the trial court, we must find \u201cas a matter of law that [DCSE] sustained [its] burden of proving\u201d paternity by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Tomko v. Michael\u2019s Plastering Co., </em>210 Va. 697, 700, 173 S.E.2d 833, 836 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Here, Dr. Demers provided uncontroverted testimony that the genetic blood test results reported a 99.92% probability of paternity and that the test was conducted in accordance with the accepted standards of the American Association of Blood Banks. There was no evidence challenging the test results or the reliability of the test procedure or methodology. Although the trial judge commented that the DNA test had at least one \u201cjoker in there,\u201d apparently suggesting that the test was not reliable or the result was not accurate, Dr. Demers testified that the most likely explanation for this phenomenon was that a rare mutational event occurred during spermatogenesis and that the 99.92% calculation took this discrepancy into account.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the uncontroverted evidence established that the genetic tests used here were scientifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>reliable and that the 99.92% calculation was a correct statistical probability of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">We are bound by the trial court\u2019s finding that Debra Overby\u2019s testimony was \u201cequivocal [and] confused,\u201d and must discard any of her testimony that conflicts with Flaneary\u2019s testimony or with other evidence in the record. <em>See Brooks v. Rogers, 18 </em>Va.App. <em>585, 587, 445 </em>S.E.2d 725, 726 (1994) (stating that \u201cthe credibility of witnesses and the weight accorded to their testimony are matters solely within the purview of the trial court\u201d). Nevertheless, Flaneary confirmed that he had sexual intercourse \u2022with Overby on July 6, 1986, and although he testified that she told him that she was already pregnant, this statement, standing alone, is not sufficient to establish with reliability the period of conception or that Overby was, in fact, pregnant. Furthermore, the medical records Flaneary produced do not prove that Overby was pregnant when she had intercourse with him for the first time. For instance, an entry dated January 28, 1987, states that the gestational age was \u201c33 weeks (+- 3 wks),\u201d which would include July 6, 1986. Therefore, even without Overby\u2019s testimony, the evidence that Flaneary had access during the period of conception is uncontroverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Because uncontroverted evidence established that genetic blood tests reported a 99.92% probability of paternity and that Flaneary had access during the period of conception, we hold that the evidence proved clearly and convincingly, as a matter of law, that Flaneary is the father of Gerald Lee Overby. <em>See Buckland v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 290, 297, 329 S.E.2d 803, 807 (1985) (holding that blood tests reporting a 99.72% probability of paternity \u201calone proved Buckland\u2019s paternity beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). Accordingly, we remand the matter to the trial court for entry of an order to that effect and to determine the amount of Flaneary\u2019s child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-5\">.
