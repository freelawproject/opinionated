Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 652, 466 S.E.2d 772 (1996). A rehearing <em>en banc </em>was granted to determine whether the notice requirements were met and whether the alleged failure to meet the requirements created a jurisdictional defect, requiring vacation of the convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude the proceedings against Karim were improperly initiated and, therefore, the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction over the matter. Because the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to transfer the case to the circuit court, the circuit court did not acquire jurisdiction to hear the case. Accordingly, the order of conviction is vacated and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">Karim was arrested and charged with multiple offenses relating to a July 31, 1993 shooting incident in which one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>youth was killed and two others were wounded. On August 5, 1993, Investigator Edward R. Guckenberger filed a petition with the juvenile court asking that Karim, a juvenile, \u201cand the persons having his or her custody and control be summoned to appear before\u201d the juvenile court judge. Guckenberger listed a specific Alexandria address for Karim as well as a phone number. In the space for the parents\u2019 names and addresses, Guckenberger wrote \u201cUnknown to Petitioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The juvenile court appointed Marlene Hahn as Karim\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem. </em>A summons was personally served on Karim on August 6, 1993. A copy of the petition was attached to the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The juvenile court record contains an August 6, 1993 order appointing two attorneys (Cassidy and Adams) to represent Karim. The juvenile record also contains a document entitled, \u201cRecord of Proceedings.\u201d It is signed by the juvenile judge and is dated August 6, 1993. The document indicates \u201c[t]hat Probable Cause to detain is Found,\u201d and the court ordered that Karim be held at Landmark Detention Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">On September 22, 1993, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney filed a notice of intent to certify Karim for trial as an adult. On October 7, 1993, the juvenile court conducted a hearing \u201cto determine whether or not there is probable cause to believe that an offense had occurred.\u201d The record contains Karim\u2019s motion to dismiss that was filed on October 7, 1993. In that motion, he asserted that the juvenile court failed to follow the notice requirements of Code \u00a7 16.1-263.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">The following dialogue took place at the October 7, 1993 hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-9\">THE COURT: I just wanted to raise something. When I was going through the pleadings, I couldn\u2019t find the notice of the certification\u2014and I did find that. That\u2019s why\u2014 mainly why I had the recess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-10\">And secondly, Mr. Karim, I normally always ask before the hearing\u2014I think this is the first time I\u2019ve never asked in all these years\u2014whether you had a parent here. I don\u2019t think you have a parent here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>FONTE (PROBATION OFFICER): Is your stepmom here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-4\">KARIM (Karim): I have a stepmom, but she\u2019s not here though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-5\">THE COURT: Your dad is living in the District of Columbia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">KARIM: Silver Spring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">THE COURT: Silver Spring, Maryland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-8\">KARIM: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-9\">THE COURT: What is your dad\u2019s name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-10\">KARIM: Syed Karim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-11\">THE COURT: Syed Karim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-12\">KARIM: (Nodding head).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-13\">THE COURT: Do you have any way we could contact him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aon\">KARIM: Yes, sir. His work number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-14\">THE COURT: Could you give that to Mr. Fonte?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-15\">KARIM: (Number given).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-16\">THE COURT: Okay. And is he aware of this proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMk\">KARIM: He knows that I went to court last week. He visited me at the Detention Home, and I told him I was going to court someday this week but I wasn\u2019t sure what the date was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-17\">THE COURT: Okay. And he just decided not to come or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-18\">KARIM: He didn\u2019t know when the exact date was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-19\">The hearing further revealed that Karim\u2019s mother lived in Chicago. However, Karim advised the court that he thought his stepmother, Delta Karim, had legal custody of him. She lived in Alexandria, Virginia, and her address and phone number were known to the probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-20\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court made the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-21\">THE COURT: All right\u2014I\u2019m going to go ahead and deny Mr. Cassidy\u2019s motion to strike, and I will make a finding, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>probable cause purposes, that the two delinquent acts did occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-4\">And I\u2019ll make a finding that the requirements of 16.1-269a, section 1, 2 and 3a have been met.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>And I\u2019m going to continue the case for a transfer report and transfer hearing pursuant to section C of 16.1-269.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">After ordering the transfer study, the court scheduled the next hearing for December 2, 1993. On November 12, 1993, Sean Coleman was appointed as Karim\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">On November 30, 1993, Probation Officer Frank A. Fonte typed and filed a transfer study/report with the juvenile court. The front sheet of the report contained the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-7\">FATHER: Syeed Kharim, (street address listed)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-8\">MOTHER: Anita Kharim, Chicago, Illinois</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaNt\">GUARDIAN: Delta Kharim</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADO\">ADDRESS: (street address listed)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">The record does not contain a transcript of the December 2, 1993 transfer hearing. After the hearing, at which Karim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>attorney and guardian <em>ad litem </em>were present, the juvenile judge entered a transfer order. The judge checked boxes for the following statements on the preprinted order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">The Court finds from the evidence presented that there is probable cause to believe the juvenile committed the delinquent act alleged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-6\">That the child was fifteen or more years of age at the time of the alleged commission of the offense; the child is competent to stand trial; and the interests of the community require that the child be placed under legal restraint or discipline.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-7\">the child is charged with an offense (murder, rape, robbery) for which amenability to treatment or rehabilitation as a juvenile is not a factor in this proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-8\">The Court</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-9\">TRANSFERS and so certifies the child for proper criminal proceedings to the Circuit Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">On December 20, 1993, the grand jury indicted Karim. On January 28, 1994, Karim filed notice that he intended to argue a number of pretrial motions, including a motion to dismiss the indictment. On February 4,1994, Karim argued his motion to dismiss. He alleged that the juvenile court never acquired jurisdiction because neither of his parents received proper notice. The trial court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">JURISDICTION AND TRANSFER</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">Code \u00a7 16.1-263, governing the institution of proceedings against a juvenile, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-13\">A. After a petition has been filed, the court shall direct the issuance of summonses, one directed to the child, if the child is twelve or more years of age, and another to the parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis, and such other persons as appear to the court to be proper or necessary parties to the proceedings. The summons shall require them to appear personally before the court at the time fixed to answer or testify as to the allegations of the petition. Where- the custodian is sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>moned and such person is not the parent of the child in question, the parent shall also be served with a summons. The court may direct that other proper or necessary parties to the proceedings be notified of the pendency of the case, the charge and the time and place for the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-5\">B. The summons shall advise the parties of their right to counsel as provided in \u00a7 16.1-266. A copy of the petition shall accompany each summons for the initial proceedings. Notice of subsequent proceedings shall be provided to all parties in interest. In all cases where a party is represented by counsel and counsel has been provided with a copy of the petition and due notice as to time, date and place of the hearing, such action shall be deemed due notice to such party, unless such counsel has notified the court that he no longer represents such party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-6\">H* H5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\">E. No such summons or notification shall be required if the judge shall certify on the record that the identity of a parent or guardian is not reasonably ascertainable. An affidavit of the mother that the identity of the father is not reasonably ascertainable shall be sufficient evidence of this fact, provided there is no other evidence before the court which would refute such an affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">\u201cIf a party designated in \u00a7 16.1-263 A to be served with a summons can be found within the Commonwealth, the summons shall be served upon him in person.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-264. Service on one parent is sufficient in cases of delinquency. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-9\">If a party designated to be served in \u00a7 16.1-263 is within the Commonwealth and cannot be found, but his address is known or can with reasonable diligence be ascertained, the summons may be served upon him by mailing a copy thereof by certified mail return receipt requested. If he is without the Commonwealth but can be found or his address is known, or can with reasonable diligence be ascertained, service of summons may be made either by delivering a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>copy thereof to him personally or by mailing a copy thereof to him by certified mail return receipt requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">An important consideration in interpreting the meaning of a statute is whether it is mandatory and jurisdictional or directory and procedural. When asked to decide whether various provisions relating to juvenile transfer proceedings are jurisdictional in nature, the Supreme Court has analyzed the provisions \u201cto determine whether they impart a substantive right to the juvenile or merely impose a procedural requirement.\u201d A mandatory provision in a statute is one that connotes a command and the omission of \u201c \u201cwhich renders the proceeding to which it relates illegal and void, while a directory provision is one the observance of which is not necessary to the validity of the proceeding; and a statute may be mandatory in some respects, and directory in others.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-7\"><em>Cheeks v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 578, 582-83, 459 S.E.2d 107, 109 (1995) (citations omitted) (holding that failure to give notice denied appellant substantive right to meaningful transfer appeal hearing at which he could present further evidence on issue of transfer; also finding constitutional due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">\u201cIt is clear beyond dispute that the waiver of jurisdiction [by a juvenile court] is a \u2018critically important\u2019 action determining vitally important statutory rights of the juvenile.\u201d <em>Kent v. United States, </em>383 U.S. 541, 556, 86 S.Ct. 1045, 1055, 16 L.Ed.2d 84 (1966) (holding that the \u201ccritically important\u201d decision to try juvenile as adult entitles juvenile to certain procedures and benefits as a consequence of his statutory right to the \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction of the juvenile court).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGb\">Notice, to comply with due process requirements, must be given sufficiently in advance of scheduled court proceedings so that reasonable opportunity to prepare will be afforded, and it must \u201cset forth the alleged misconduct with particularity.\u201d ... Due process of law requires notice of the sort we have described\u2014that is, notice which would be deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>constitutionally adequate in a civil or criminal proceeding. It does not allow a hearing to be held in which a youth\u2019s freedom and his parents\u2019 right to his custody are at stake without giving them timely notice, in advance of the hearing, of the specific issues that they must meet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-5\"><em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 33-34, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1446-47, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The provisions in the Code specifying parents of a juvenile as proper and necessary parties who must receive notice are mandatory. <em>See Peyton v. French, </em>207 Va. 73, 79, 147 S.E.2d 739, 743 (1966) (construing former Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-166, 16.1-167, and 16.1-172). In <em>French, </em>petitions were filed against a juvenile defendant, and the juvenile judge transferred the case to the circuit court for the defendant to be tried as an adult. The defendant\u2019s parents did not receive notice and were not present at the transfer hearing; a guardian <em>ad litem </em>had not been appointed. The Supreme Court of Virginia stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-7\">Since the [juvenile] court did not follow the mandatory requirements of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-166, 16.1-167, 16.1-172, 16.1-173 and 16.1-174, <em>supra, </em>the petitioner was not afforded a proper hearing under the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court Law before being sent on to the circuit court to be indicted and tried as an adult.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 77, 147 S.E.2d at 742. The Court held that the circuit court\u2019s order of conviction was void because the juvenile court failed to give \u201cnotice to all proper and necessary parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court refused to adopt the Commonwealth\u2019s contention \u201cthat the statutes relating to proceedings in juvenile courts are procedural and not jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-9\">Code \u00a7 16.1-158 gives the juvenile court exclusive original jurisdiction over the offenses alleged to have been committed by the petitioner, and the clear purpose and intent of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court Law cannot be achieved if it is not mandatory that the proceedings set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-164, 16.1-166, 16.1-167, 16.1-172, 16.1-173 and 16.1-176(a) be complied with. Indeed, the very language of the statutes makes it mandatory that the aforesaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>mentioned statutes be followed before criminal jurisdiction in a proper court of record comes into being.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 79, 147 S.E.2d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 425, 192 S.E.2d 775 (1972), the defendant collaterally attacked a past conviction that was rendered when he was a juvenile, twenty-two years earlier. Although Jones \u201cconceded the \u2018possibility<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the juvenile court [might] have appointed a lawyer for him\u201d at the juvenile proceeding, at the hearing to attack the conviction, Jones testified \u201cthat his parents were not present and that a guardian <em>ad litem </em>was not appointed for him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426-27, 192 S.E.2d at 777. The applicable juvenile statute at the time of the original prosecution was Code \u00a7 63-273 (1948); that Code section used language substantially similar to former Code \u00a7 16.1-172, found by the <em>French </em>Court to be mandatory. In reversing the conviction, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">[T]he official records of the court are completely silent as to any notification of the parents, certification by the judge as to such notification, the presence of the parents at the trial, the appointment of a probation officer or guardian <em>ad litem </em>to represent defendant, and the presence of either of the latter two at the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-8\"><em>Jones, </em>213 Va. at 427, 192 S.E.2d at 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The Court noted that, although \u201csignificant changes in philosophy regarding juvenile proceedings have taken place since\u201d the defendant\u2019s original trial, \u201cthe requirement that the parents of an infant defendant charged with a crime have notification of the time and place of his trial and an opportunity to be present has remained constant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427-28, 192 S.E.2d at 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">In <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 666, 222 S.E.2d 517 (1976), after a juvenile petition was filed, the juvenile defendant and the defendant\u2019s father appeared before the juvenile court for a detention hearing on October 7, 1974. On October 8, 1974, the juvenile judge appointed an attorney for the juvenile defendant, who was \u201c \u2018notified of [the transfer] hearing date.\u2019 The record fail[ed] to show, however, that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number><em>written </em>notice of the time, place, and purpose of the October 24 [transfer] hearing was given the defendant, his parents, or his attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667, 222 S.E.2d at 518. Turner, his attorney, and his parents were present at the transfer hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Turner argued that \u201cthe circuit court lacked jurisdiction to try him because notice in writing of the transfer hearing was not given him, his parents, or his attorney.\u201d The Court noted that \u201cthe <em>form </em>of notice and the <em>method </em>of giving notice are ordinarily considered matters of procedural and not substantive due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668, 222 S.E.2d at 519. Because the form of the notice was procedural rather than jurisdictional, and because the parents were present at the hearing, the Court held that \u201cany departure from\u201d the requirement of written notice could \u201cbe cured or waived by <em>the appearance of proper and necessary parties.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). <em>Turner, </em>however, is distinguishable from the present case because neither Karim\u2019s parents nor legal guardian were given proper notice or were present at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The record clearly shows that at the initiation of the proceedings on October 7, 1993, the juvenile judge knew Karim\u2019s father\u2019s Maryland address and knew that the father had recently visited his son in jail. The juvenile judge had evidence that Karim\u2019s stepmother was his guardian and knew her Virginia address. Despite having this information, the juvenile judge failed to give notice to the father or stepmother, but instead determined probable cause and ordered a transfer report.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The transfer order entered by the juvenile judge on December 2, 1993, declared that the hearing \u201cwas conducted pursuant to proper notice pursuant to Va.Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and 16.1-264 to the juvenile, the juvenile\u2019s parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis or attorney.\u201d However, the record fails to establish that the juvenile proceedings against Karim were properly initiated such that the court had jurisdiction to proceed with the October 7, 1993 probable cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>The record does not show that Karim\u2019s parents or legal guardian were present on October 7, 1993 or that the juvenile judge redetermined probable cause on any subsequent date. Instead, the record shows that, on December 2, 1993, the juvenile judge merely continued where he left off after the October 7, 1993 proceeding in which he found probable cause. On December 2, 1993, the court used the earlier-requested transfer report, found Karim to be nonamenable to treatment as a juvenile, and transferred jurisdiction to the circuit court. Therefore, the avowal in the December 2, 1993 order- that proper notice had been given was belied by the absence of evidence that the juvenile judge attempted to excuse or correct the earlier failure to give proper notice prior to finding probable cause and transferring to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Based on <em>French, Jones, </em>and <em>Cheeks, </em>we find that compliance with the Code sections at issue here, relating to procedures for instituting proceedings against juveniles, are mandatory and jurisdictional. The failure to strictly follow the notice procedures contained in the Code denied Karim a substantive right and the constitutional guarantee of due process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The record failed to establish that Karim\u2019s parents or guardian, who were proper and necessary parties, were properly given notice. The juvenile judge did not certify on the record that the identity of a parent or guardian was not reasonably ascertainable. Therefore, the juvenile court did not acquire jurisdiction. Because it did not possess jurisdiction, the juvenile court lacked authority to transfer the case to the circuit court, and, consequently, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to try Karim as an adult. <em>See State v. Taylor, </em>26 Ohio App.3d 69, 498 N.E.2d 211 (1985) (reversing and remand-, ing adult conviction where failure to give notice to parent of juvenile proceeding resulted in due process violation; appellate court held that juvenile court was without jurisdiction to effect transfer of jurisdiction to adult trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Because the circuit court had no jurisdiction, we vacate the order of conviction and remand the case to the circuit court with instructions to remand the case to the juvenile court for further proceedings against Karim' as are appropriate and consistent with this opinion, if the Commonwealth be so advised.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-13\">. The remaining issues resolved by the panel opinion were not reheard <em>en banc.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-10\">. Code \u00a7 16.1-269(A) deals with the juvenile court\u2019s decision whether to retain jurisdiction or transfer jurisdiction to a circuit court so the juvenile can be tried as an adult. The portion of the statute cited by the juvenile judge provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-11\">If a child fifteen years of age or older is charged with an offense which, if committed by an adult, could be punishable by confinement in a state correctional facility, the court shall on motion of the attorney for the Commonwealth and prior to a hearing on the merits, hold a transfer hearing and may retain jurisdiction or transfer such child for proper criminal proceedings to the appropriate circuit court having criminal jurisdiction of such offenses if committed by an adult. Any transfer to the appropriate circuit court shall be subject to the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-12\">1. The child was fifteen or more years of age at the time of the alleged commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-13\">2. Notice as prescribed in \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and 16.1-264 shall be given to the child and his parent, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis or attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-14\">3. The court finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-15\">a. There is probable cause to believe that the child committed the delinquent act ... which would be a felony if committed by an adult[.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b811-7\">. We disagree with the Commonwealth's contention that the cases stand for the proposition that a juvenile\u2019s representation by a guardian <em>ad litem </em>effectively cures non-compliance with Code \u00a7 16.1-263.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b812-6\">. We do not hold that notice for the transfer hearing was improperly given. Notwithstanding the provision of proper statutory notice for the transfer hearing, the juvenile and domestic relations court\u2019s failure to <em>initiate </em>proceedings upon proper notice in accordance with Code \u00a7 16.1-263 deprived it of jurisdiction and the attendant power to transfer the case to the circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
