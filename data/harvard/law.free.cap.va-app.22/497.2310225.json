Miller contends that the trial court erred by sentencing him as a recidivist because the Commonwealth did not produce a copy of the prior conviction order at sentencing and, therefore, the evidence was insufficient to prove that this was a second or subsequent conviction. Alternatively, he claims that even if the evidence at sentencing proved a prior conviction, he was not a recidivist because a prior conviction had not been entered at the time of the hearing in which he was adjudged guilty, and furthermore, he was not a recidivist or second offender because the predicate offense was committed subsequent to the charged offense. We find Miller\u2019s claims to be without merit. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order sentencing Miller to a term of five years in the penitentiary for a second or subsequent conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">On September 23, 1994, the Circuit Court of Lynchburg found the defendant guilty of several related felonies, including the use of a firearm during the commission of rape, all of which occurred on April 13, 1994. At arraignment, the trial judge and defense counsel informed the defendant that the punishment for the firearm offense under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is a mandatory three year sentence that will run consecutively to any sentence imposed for the primary offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>dant had not been previously convicted of using a firearm in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 at the time of arraignment or the bench trial of the guilt phase of the trial. After finding Miller guilty on all charges, the court set sentencing for November 18,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the probation officer testified, and the presentence report showed, that on September 19, 1994, four days before the bench trial for the present offense, the Circuit Court of Amherst County had found the defendant guilty, but had not sentenced him, of using a firearm in the commission of rape in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. The Amherst County conviction is the predicate offense that the Commonwealth relies on for sentencing the defendant as a recidivist.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Amherst County offense was committed in May 1994, after the commission of the Lynchburg offense. On November 14, 1994, four, days before sentencing on the present offense, the Circuit Court of Amherst County sentenced the defendant for the Amherst firearm conviction in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. No copy of that conviction order was introduced into evidence at the sentencing hearing for the present offense. However, the probation officer testified about the defendant\u2019s conviction in Amherst County, and the presentence report included the Amherst County conviction as part of his criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The defendant claims, in effect, that a probation officer\u2019s testimony and report are inadmissible hearsay when offered to prove a prior conviction at a sentencing hearing, and that the evidence is insufficient to prove a prior conviction absent a copy of the conviction order. The defendant did not contend at the sentencing hearing that th\u00e9 probation officer\u2019s testimony or report were inadmissible hearsay. <em>See Baughan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>v. Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 28, 31, 141 S.E.2d 750, 753 (1965) (holding that hearsay testimony that is admitted without objection may \u201cproperly be considered by the trial court and given its natural probative effect\u201d). Although Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 requires the Commonwealth to provide a defendant with certified copies of prior conviction orders in a bifurcated jury trial proceeding, \u201c[a] sentencing judge may consider hearsay contained in a probation report.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 656, 659, 446 S.E.2d 469, 471 (1994) <em>(en </em>banc). Because the defendant did not object to the probation officer\u2019s testimony concerning the prior firearm conviction on the ground that it was inadmissible hearsay or contend that the evidence was insufficient without a copy of the conviction order to prove that he had a prior conviction, we will not consider those issues for the first time on appeal. Rule 5A:18; Rule 5A:12. Furthermore, the record reveals no good cause for the defendant\u2019s failure to object in the trial court, nor is it necessary for us to consider the issues in order to attain justice in the case. <em>See Jimenez v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 244, 249, 402 S.E.2d 678, 680 (1991); <em>Mounce v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 433, 435-36, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s contention that he cannot be sentenced as a recidivist under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 where the offense for the predicate conviction was committed after the charged offense, our holding in <em>Stubblefield v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 343, 347, 392 S.E.2d 197, 198 (1990), controls. In <em>Stubblefield, </em>we held that Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is a \u201cspecific,\u201d rather than a general, recidivist statute and, therefore, was intended to \u201cimpose[ ] additional punishment for a subsequent <em>conviction </em>for the <em>same </em>offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(first emphasis added). \u201cSuch statutes are aimed at <em>punishment </em>of specific behavior, not reform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Because Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is concerned with punishing repeat firearm offenders, the statute punishes for a \u201csecond or subsequent conviction\u201d without regard to the dates of the convictions or the sequence in which the offenses were committed. \u201cAny conviction that follows a first conviction is a subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>conviction within the purview of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.\u201d <em>Flythe v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 832, 835, 275 S.E.2d 582, 584 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In <em>Stubblefield, </em>we held that an accused could be classified as a \u201crecidivist\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 where multiple convictions were rendered in a single jury trial. However, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ramdass </em>and the enactment of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, which requires a separate sentencing proceeding in felony jury trials, guilty verdicts rendered in a single jury trial on multiple offenses are not final convictions until the entry of the conviction order. Therefore, requiring proof of a prior conviction <em>at the time the verdicts are returned </em>would be inconsistent with the holding in <em>Stubblefield. </em>Because there is no indication that the legislature intended such a result in enacting Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, and because Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is \u201caimed at <em>punishment </em>of specific behavior, not reform,\u201d <em>Stubblefield, </em>10 Va.App. at 347, 392 S.E.2d at 198, we hold that the relevant inquiry under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is whether, <em>at the time of sentencing, </em>a conviction entered is a \u201csecond or subsequent conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Here, the defendant had been previously convicted in Amherst County of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 at the time of sentencing for the charged offense. Therefore, the charged offense was a \u201csecond or subsequent conviction,\u201d and the trial court did not err by sentencing the defendant as a \u201crecidivist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-13\">.

Miller does not contend that he was prejudiced or was deprived of any right by being advised that the punishment for the offense for which he was being tried was a mandatory three year, rather than five year, sentence. He does not claim that he would have requested a jury trial if he had known that the potential sentence would be five years. Moreover, he made no request at sentencing, and has made no claim here, that he should have been permitted to withdraw his waiver of a jury trial for the firearms offense. <em>See Thomas v.
