BAKER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Austin Wayne Keyser (appellant) appeals his bench trial conviction by the Circuit Court of the City of Waynesboro (trial court) for carjacking in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1. The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether the evidence is sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for carjacking or whether the evidence merely proves attempted carjacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">The sufficiency of the evidence having been challenged, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 502, 505, 297 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1982). Guided by that principle, the record discloses that at approximately 3:20 a.m., on August 15, 1994, Janice Knick (the victim) was engaged in her job of delivering newspapers, using her car as transportation. After arriving at one of her appointed stops, the victim exited her car to perform her duties, leaving the door to her car open, its automatic transmission in park, and the motor running. After collecting money from the newspaper box, the victim reentered her car and reached to pull her door shut when appellant \u201cshoved\u201d the car door back and stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to drive this car.\u201d The victim\u2019s testimony continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-11\">I kept trying to pull the door shut but I couldn\u2019t get it shut and then all of a sudden he just pounced over my upper body. Grabbing my arms, trying to push me over into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>passenger seat and ... my papers were stacked all the way up to the window, there was no place for me to go. And he kept reaching for the gear shift, I assume that\u2019s what he was reaching for and I started screaming, somebody please help me____ He kept saying, I\u2019m not going to hurt you[.] ... Then I grabbed my scissors because I was thinking he wasn\u2019t going to let me out. There was no way he could take the car unless he got me out of there, it\u2019s, it just wasn\u2019t possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The victim tried to get her car moving but appellant\u2019s actions prevented her from doing so. To protect herself and her property, the victim began stabbing appellant with her scissors. She further testified that appellant told her, \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, I\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d and then he said, \u201cyou can\u2019t hurt me, you can\u2019t hurt me.\u201d She said the struggle continued and \u201call of a sudden I could feel blood, it started spurting from somewhere on my hand. I had on sandals I could feel it on my feet.\u201d Appellant then \u201ctook off around the front of the car.\u201d The victim immediately reported the incident to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Apprehended by the police shortly after the incident, appellant told them that all he had done was ask the victim for directions when, without provocation, she suddenly attacked him with a pair of scissors. When apprehended appellant had approximately fifteen stab wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-10\">A. Any person who commits carjacking, as herein defined, shall be guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for life or a term not less than fifteen years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-11\">B. As used in this section, <em>\u201ccarjacking\u201d </em>means the intentional seizure or seizure of control of a motor vehicle of another with intent to permanently or temporarily deprive another in possession or control of the vehicle of that possession or control by means of partial strangulation, or suffocation, or by striking or beating, or by other violence to the person, or by assault or otherwise putting a person in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>fear of serious bodily harm, or by the threat or presenting of firearms, or other deadly weapon or instrumentality whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">To prove that an accused violated the provisions of that code section, the Commonwealth had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the carjacker took possession or control of the vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is not sufficient to prove that the accused merely attempted to seize the vehicle or seize control of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">\u201c \u201cWe have frequently pointed out that an attempt to commit a crime is composed of two elements: (1) The intent to commit it; and (2) the direct, ineffectual act done toward its commission which must reach far enough toward the accomplishment of the desired result to amount to the commencement of the consummation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 222, 227, 148 S.E.2d 800, 804 (1966) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Although the evidence may have been sufficient to prove attempted carjacking, it was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant actually seized or seized control of the victim\u2019s vehicle as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence disclosed that by wrongful acts appellant by physical force \u201cpounced over [the victim\u2019s] upper body\u201d and restrained her movement by \u201cgrabbing [the victim\u2019s] arms\u201d while unsuccessfully attempting to \u201cpush [the victim] over into the passenger seat.\u201d However, appellant never seized the vehicle or seized control of the vehicle. The evidence would support a conviction for attempted carjacking but not actual carjacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">Accordingly, we reverse appellant\u2019s conviction for violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1, and the case is remanded to the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>court for such further proceedings as the Commonwealth may be advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-10\">.
