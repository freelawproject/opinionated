BAKER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Ronald Eric James (appellant), also known as Timothy Johnson, appeals from his bench trial conviction by the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (trial court) for possession of cocaine in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250. The sole issue presented is whether the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of the cocaine found on him during a pat-down search. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">It is well established in Virginia that, on review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, the appellate courts of this Commonwealth view the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>E.g., Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1017, 101 S.Ct. 579, 66 L.Ed.2d 477 (1980); <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 1, 7, 421 S.E.2d 877, 881 (1992). In light of <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996), it appears that in certain cases a deferential standard of review may no longer be appropriate. In <em>Ornelas, </em>Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote that henceforth, \u201cas a general matter determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause should be reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While generally calling for <em>de novo </em>review of reasonable suspicion and probable cause determinations, the Supreme Court \u201chasten[edj\u201d to add that a trial court\u2019s finding of \u201chistorical fact\u201d should be reviewed only for \u201cclear error\u201d and noted that a reviewing court should \u201cgive due weight to inferences drawn from those [historical] facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, recognizing \u201cthat a police officer may draw inferences based on his own experience in deciding whether probable cause exists,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>appeals court should give due weight to a trial court\u2019s finding that [an] officer was credible and [his or her] inference was reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The record discloses that on May 27, 1994, Detective James P. Foust (Foust) of the Richmond Police Department and a detective named Burke (Burke) were looking for Charles Smyrie (Smyrie) in order to execute a felony warrant. At approximately noon, Burke drove into and stopped in a parking lot. A blue \u201cChevy Blazer,\u201d driven by Smyrie, pulled up next to Burke\u2019s vehicle. Smyrie was the \u201cwanted person.\u201d Appellant was a passenger in the front seat of Smyrie\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Burke asked Smyrie to get out of the car and began talking to him. Appellant addressed Burke, saying words to the effect of, \u201c[W]hat\u2019s going on, why are you stopping, can I get out----\u201d Foust told appellant to \u201chold on a second,\u201d then asked to talk to him. Appellant began \u201cmaking gestures\u201d with his hands, leaning down to the right where Foust could see only one of his hands and asked, \u201c[W]hat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Foust told appellant to \u201cremain quiet\u201d and to put his hands on the dashboard. At first, appellant failed to respond to that request. Later, he placed his hands on the dashboard but left them there only for \u201ca few seconds,\u201d then removed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Appellant persisted in wanting to leave the car, asking, \u201c[H]ow come I can\u2019t get out?\u201d Following that inquiry, Foust told appellant he could get out of the car. To assure his personal safety, Foust made a limited pat-down of appellant, during which he felt a hard object which he removed from appellant\u2019s front pocket. The object was a glass smoking device that contained cocaine residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Appellant was arrested and indicted for possession of cocaine. Appellant made a pretrial motion to suppress the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">The trial court denied the motion to suppress, ruling that based upon \u201call the circumstances [confronting the officer] presented to this Court,\u201d Foust\u2019s conduct, including the pat-down of appellant, was not unreasonable. The court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>concluded that it was reasonable for Foust to remove the item from appellant\u2019s pocket \u201cto determine whether it was something that could be used to cause harm to the officer or cause the officer concern for his safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The Fourth Amendment prohibits only unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>E.g., Desist v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 244, 254 n. 23, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 1036 n. 23, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969); <em>Warren v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 600, 602, 202 S.E.2d 885, 887 (1974). It is not unreasonable for a police officer to conduct a limited pat-down search for weapons when the officer can point to \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d \u201cwhich reasonably lead[ ] him to conclude, in light of his experience, that \u2018criminal activity may be afoot\u2019 and that the suspect \u2018may be armed and presently dangerous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lansdown v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 204, 209, 308 S.E.2d 106, 110 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1104, 104 S.Ct. 1604, 80 L.Ed.2d 134 (1984) (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). \u201cReasonableness is judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene allowing for the need of split-second decisions and without regard to the officer\u2019s intent or motivation.\u201d <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 725, 727, 460 S.E.2d 610, 612 (1995) (citing <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396-97, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871-72, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)). An officer is entitled to view the circumstances confronting him in light of his training and experience, <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883, and he may consider any suspicious conduct of the suspected person. <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 53, 67, 354 S.E.2d 79, 86-87 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Here, the officers were arresting the driver of the vehicle on a felony warrant. Appellant, who was an occupant of the vehicle, was \u201csomewhat jittery\u201d when Foust asked him to keep his hands on the dash. When appellant was unresponsive to Foust\u2019s request to keep his hands in Foust\u2019s view, Foust did not know whether appellant \u201cwas under the influence of anything\u201d or whether he was trying to reach to get something. Foust was concerned that appellant might be reaching for \u201ca weapon or something like that in the car\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>that appellant\u2019s hand movements were an attempt to divert his attention. Appellant appeared nervous and Foust \u201cdidn\u2019t know whether ... [appellant] had a weapon on him.\u201d Because, under these circumstances, a reasonably prudent officer would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger, Foust was justified in conducting a pat-down of appellant. <em>See Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 260, 391 S.E.2d 592 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">To justify removal of an object from a person\u2019s clothing during a search for weapons, \u201cthe officer [must] reasonably believe [that] the object could be a weapon.\u201d <em>Lansdown, </em>226 Va. at 213, 308 S.E.2d at 112. \u201c[I]t makes no difference that the object removed ... is not a weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the hard object Foust removed from appellant\u2019s pocket during the pat-down was about three inches long; Foust described it as being \u201cabout as big as your finger.\u201d It was not unreasonable for Foust to believe that this object could have been a weapon. <em>See id. </em>(not unreasonable for officer to believe that rectangular box felt in shirt pocket could be a weapon); <em>see also Williams, 4 </em>Va.App. at 67, 354 S.E.2d at 87 (not unreasonable for officer to believe that hard bulge felt in pocket, which was in fact a wad of rolled up one hundred dollar bills, was a weapon). Therefore, Foust acted properly in removing the object from appellant\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The facts reveal that appellant was not subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
