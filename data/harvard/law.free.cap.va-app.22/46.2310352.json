On December 13, 1994, the trial court sentenced Jones to life imprisonment for the murder and two years for use of a firearm. Jones appeals his convictions, contending that the trial court erred in declaring Michael Ray Brown an \u201cunavailable\u201d witness and, on that basis, admitting a transcript of Brown\u2019s prior testimony. Finding no error, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">At approximately 2:50 a.m. on the morning of July 3, 1992, Raymond A. Watson died as a result of a gunshot wound to his back. Less than one hour before, paramedics removed Watson from his burgundy station wagon, which rested partially on the median strip near the 6200 block of Chesapeake Boulevard in Norfolk. Watson\u2019s car came to rest on the median after skipping a curb while leaving an adjacent parking lot. The fatal shot was fired from a .22-caliber firearm at a range of less than eighteen inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">The police arrested Jones and charged him with Watson\u2019s murder. Jones executed a waiver of rights form and admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>being present at the scene of the crime. He told the police he saw another individual, Ben Tavers, shoot Watson while Watson sat in a dark-colored station wagon looking for drugs to buy, and that Watson then drove out of the lot over the curb. The police interviewed at least two other men, Christopher Johnson and Michael Ray Brown regarding the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">At the preliminary hearing, Brown testified as an eyewitness to the crime. He testified that on July 2, 1992 he was \u201changing around\u201d selling drugs for Jones in an area near the 6300 block of Chesapeake Boulevard in Norfolk. That afternoon, Brown saw Jones purchase a .22-caliber gun from a person identified as \u201cChris.\u201d Jones indicated that he intended to shoot the first \u201cdope smoker\u201d who came through the area. Brown testified that, around midnight that evening, he saw Jones and Ben Tavers approach a car, which had pulled into the area. Brown saw Jones fire two shots at the car\u2019s occupant from a range of approximately two to three feet. Brown further testified that when the driver attempted to flee, the car hit the curb and came to rest in the median strip on Chesapeake Boulevard. As the car drove away, Jones fired a third shot and ran. Brown stated that, later that morning, Jones admitted to him that he had shot Watson in the back. Jones was thereafter indicted for Watson\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">At Jones\u2019 trial, the Commonwealth called both Johnson and Brown as witnesses. Both men testified that they did not remember either the incident or having spoken with the police. Brown further claimed that he did not know Jones and that he had no memory of the events leading to Watson\u2019s death. In response to the Commonwealth\u2019s questions, Brown asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Commonwealth then granted immunity to Brown, but Brown claimed that he did not want to testify. Brown continued to maintain that he could not remember the crime. He also maintained that he could not remember his statement to the police, or testimony at the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The trial court concluded that Brown\u2019s inability to remember his preliminary hearing testimony rendered him an \u201cun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>available\u201d witness. Accordingly, the court allowed the Commonwealth to read into evidence Brown\u2019s testimony from the preliminary hearing, both to impeach Brown and as substantive evidence of Jones\u2019 guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">It is well established that \u201c[t]estimony given at a former trial is admissible in evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule if certain requirements are met.\u201d <em>Doan v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 87, 100, 422 S.E.2d 398, 405 (1992) (quoting Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 232 (3d ed. 1988)). Jones concedes that the Commonwealth met all of the requirements of the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule, except its burden to show that the declarant, Brown, was \u201cunavailable\u201d at the time of the trial. The reliability of Brown\u2019s former testimony is not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">A declarant\u2019s \u201cunavailability\u201d is a prerequisite to the admission into evidence of the declarant\u2019s former testimony during the guilt phase of a trial. <em>See Doan, </em>15 Va.App. at 100 n. 8, 422 S.E.2d at 405 n. 8 (distinguishing <em>Stockton v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 192, 204-05, 402 S.E.2d 196, 203, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 902, 112 S.Ct. 280, 116 L.Ed.2d 231 (1991)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The party offering the hearsay testimony has the burden of establishing the witness\u2019 \u201cunavailability.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 5, 8-9, 441 S.E.2d 47, 49 (1994). Determining whether the offering party has met its burden and, thus, whether the declarant is \u201cunavailable,\u201d is left to the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Burton v. Oldfield, </em>195 Va. 544, 550, 79 S.E.2d 660, 665 (1954). Whether a witness\u2019 lack of memory renders the witness \u201cunavailable\u201d is an issue of first impression in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u2022 In <em>Doan, </em>the Court enumerated seven conditions under which a declarant has been deemed unavailable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>(1) The declarant is dead. (2) The declarant is too ill to testify. (3) The declarant is insane. (4) The declarant is absent from the state and the party is unable to obtain the declarant\u2019s deposition. (5) The party has been unable by diligent inquiry to locate the declarant. (6) The declarant cannot be compelled to testify. (7) The opposite party has caused the declarant\u2019s absence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">15 Va.App. at 101, 422 S.E.2d at 406 (quoting Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 231 (3d ed. 1988)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jones argues that because a declarant\u2019s lack of memory is not one of the conditions listed in <em>Doan, </em>Brown was not \u201cunavailable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">However, nothing in <em>Doan </em>suggests that it established an exhaustive list of the circumstances under which a declarant may be deemed \u201cunavailable\u201d or that it intended to constrain the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s expansive statement of the rule set forth in <em>Wise Terminal Co. v. McCormick, </em>107 Va. 376, 58 S.E. 584 (1907). That rule, which is restated in <em>Doan, </em>states that a witness\u2019 \u201cunavailability\u201d is established if the court is satisfied that \u201ca sufficient reason is shown why the original witness is not produced.\u201d <em>Doan, </em>15 Va.App. at 100, 422 S.E.2d at 405 (quoting <em>Gray v. Graham, </em>231 Va. 1, 5, 341 S.E.2d 153, 155 (1986)); <em>Wise Terminal, </em>107 Va. at 379, 58 S.E. at 585; <em>Burton v. Oldfield, </em>195 Va. 544, 550, 79 S.E.2d 660, 664 (1954) (unavailability shown where declarant is \u201cdead, insane, or beyond the jurisdiction of the court or on diligent inquiry cannot be found <em>or </em>... <em>[where] some other circumstance exists </em>\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Director General v. Gordon, </em>134 Va. 381, 390, 114 S.E. 668, 670 (1922).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Brown\u2019s memory loss at trial, whether real or feigned, rendered him unavailable. Brown\u2019s testimony at trial was not forthcoming, despite the Commonwealth\u2019s repeated questions, its attempt to refresh his memory, and its grant of immunity. Brown admitted that he simply did not want to testify and ultimately could not be compelled to \u201cremember.\u201d Thus, although Brown appeared in court and testified to his present lack of memory, he was \u201cunavailable\u201d for purposes of the exception. In such cases, the focus of the inquiry is not the unavailability of the witness but the unavailability of the testimony. <em>See Morris v. Commonwealth, 229 </em>Va. 145, 149, 326 S.E.2d 693, 695 (1985) (quoting <em>Hines v. Commonwealth, </em>136 Va. 728, 745, 117 S.E. 843, 848 (1923)) (\u201cIf the declarant \u2018were present and testifying, but denying that he made [the statement], then his own original [statement] would not be available\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also </em>29 Am.Jur.2d <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 695 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Jones also argues that admitting Brown\u2019s prior testimony deprived him of his constitutional right to confront Brown. An accused\u2019s right to confrontation is satisfied with respect to the admission of prior testimony when the prior testimony was given under oath in an adversary judiciary proceeding, such as a preliminary hearing, at which the accused had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine the witness on the issues which later develop at trial. <em>Fisher v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 808, 813, <em>232 </em>S.E.2d 798, <em>801-02 </em>(1977); <em>Lassiter v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 605, 614, 431 S.E.2d 900, 905 (1993). Here, Jones cross-examined Brown at the preliminary hearing concerning Brown\u2019s identification of Jones as the killer. For this reason, Jones\u2019 Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Accordingly, Jones\u2019 convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\">. In <em>Stockton, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that unavailability was not required where the transcript was read during sentencing phase \u201cfor the limited purpose of informing the jury of the nature of the offense and the circumstances of the crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\">. Professor Friend\u2019s list of conditions is based on Virginia Supreme Court decisions in which the issue of \u201cunavailability\u201d was determined in light of the particular circumstances of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\">. Recognizing the distinction to be made between the potential scope of the rule governing the determination of \u201cunavailability\u201d and the list of particular factual circumstances or conditions which the Virginia Supreme Court found met the rule\u2019s requirements, Professor Friend comments that \u201d[i]t is uncertain as to what constitutes 'unavailability' for [the] purposes of the prior testimony exception____ Whether other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>types of unavailability will satisfy the requirement is not clear.\u201d Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-10 (4th ed. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
