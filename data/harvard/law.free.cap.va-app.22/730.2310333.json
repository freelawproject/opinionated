On appeal, appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the firearm conviction. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">On October 11, 1994, Michael Doyle, manager of Doyle Bedding and Furniture in Norfolk, arrived at the store at 10:00 a.m. At around 11:00 a.m., Doyle saw a man standing across the street, holding what appeared to be a baby. A few minutes later, as Doyle was on the floor assembling a love seat, he saw the man walking down the sidewalk toward the store\u2019s front door. He then heard the bell on that door ring as the door opened.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Doyle felt the man sit down beside him on the love seat and \u201cpush\u201d something \u201cup against [his] back.\u201d Three times the assailant said, \u201cDon\u2019t turn around or I\u2019ll shoot.\u201d At trial, Doyle testified that he never saw a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Doyle was instructed to lie on the floor. The robber asked if Doyle had a gun or if anyone else was in the store. He then tied Doyle\u2019s hands behind him with wire. At that time, a second person came into the store. Doyle could hear the second person \u201crifling through\u201d the front desk. The robber took cash, credit cards, and a wallet from Doyle. When the robber left the store, Doyle saw a blanket and plastic bottle which had not been there previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Detectives investigating the robbery discovered a plastic three liter soda bottle which had \u201cballed up\u201d newspapers in a plastic bag taped to its top. They also found a pink, blue and black blanket, and speaker wire. A finger and palm print belonging to appellant were discovered on the newspaper. The police executed a search warrant at appellant\u2019s apartment and discovered several credit cards belonging to Doyle in a man\u2019s shoe in a bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The issue presented on appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient to prove that appellant was guilty of use of a firearm in the commission of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">\u201cOn appeal, we review the evidence in the light most \u2022 favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). Moreover, \u201c[cjircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1109, 104 S.Ct. 1617, 80 L.Ed.2d 145 (1984). <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 598, 604-05, 347 S.E.2d 163, 167 (1986) (circumstantial evidence alone sufficient to sustain conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">In <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 215, 441 S.E.2d 342 (1994), the Virginia Supreme Court held that to prove the offense of use of a firearm, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove that the accused actually had a firearm in his possession and that he used or attempted to use the firearm or displayed the firearm in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit robbery or one of the other specified felonies.\u201d <em>Yarborough, </em>247 Va. at 218, 441 S.E.2d at 344 (footnote omitted). The Court stated that possession of a firearm is an \u201cessential element\u201d of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 219, 441 S.E.2d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Yarborough, in robbing his victim, said, \u201cThis is a stickup,\u201d and demanded all her money. The victim did not see a gun but testified that she thought there was a gun in Yarborough\u2019s pocket. <em>Id. </em>at 216-17, 441 S.E.2d at 343. Shortly after the robbery, the police apprehended Yarborough and discovered an unopened beer can in his pocket but no weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 217, 441 S.E.2d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Within four months of the release of the <em>Yarborough </em>opinion, the Supreme Court awarded an appeal in <em>Johnson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>(Record No. 940606). In <em>Johnson, </em>the victim was awakened by the sound of the doorbell ringing and loud knocking on his door. When he went to his door, he saw it break open. A hand came through the opening, and the victim heard a man tell him that he had a gun. Johnson told the victim to get down on the floor or he would kill him. The victim testified that he never saw a gun and never felt one. The Commonwealth conceded at trial that the only evidence that Johnson had a gun was Johnson\u2019s statement that he did. The trial court found that Johnson had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">On appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court, Johnson argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that under <em>Yarborough, </em>the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for use of a firearm in the commission of robbery. The Commonwealth distinguished <em>Yarborough, </em>noting that Johnson expressly claimed to have a gun and threatened to use it, whereas in <em>Yarborough, </em>no such claims were made. The Commonwealth argued that Johnson\u2019s conviction was based on his \u201cassertive conduct and representations that he possessed a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The Supreme Court, by unpublished order, affirmed the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The affirmance in <em>Johnson </em>clearly stands for the proposition that circumstantial evidence, such as an assailant\u2019s statement that he possesses a firearm, can be sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused indeed possessed a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">In <em>Elmore v.Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 424, 470 S.E.2d 588 (1996), we affirmed the conviction for use of a firearm in the commission of robbery where the victim, a bank teller, testified that Elmore gave her a note stating that he had a gun, then said he did not want to hurt anyone and pointed to his pocket. We noted that the evidence in <em>Elmore </em>consisted of \u201cmore than the victim\u2019s mere belief or perception that the defendant had a gun\u201d and concluded that the evidence was \u201csufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>dant actually possessed a firearm and used it in a threatening manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429-30, 470 S.E.2d at 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Here, appellant actually \u201cpushed\u201d an object into the victim\u2019s back and told him he would \u201cshoot\u201d if the victim did not cooperate. While appellant did not explicitly state that he had a gun, the clear inference to be drawn from his threat to \u201cshoot,\u201d is that he did have a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The circumstantial evidence, considered as a whole and viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, excluded all reasonable hypotheses of innocence and is therefore sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\">. The order is dated October 21, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b767-10\">BAKER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANI\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">I respectfully disagree that <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 215, 441 S.E.2d 342 (1994), does not require proof that the accused \u201cactually had a firearm\u201d and, therefore, I would reverse the conviction for use of a firearm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
