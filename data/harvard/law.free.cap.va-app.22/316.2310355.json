In his second trial, Brown was convicted of first degree murder. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction because the trial judge did not allow Brown to cross-examine the Commonwealth\u2019s chief witness, Daniel Sydow, regarding offers of leniency made by the Commonwealth and also because the trial judge refused to allow Brown\u2019s counsel to proffer the barred testimony. <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 460, 437 S.E.2d 563 (1993). When Brown was tried a third time, he was convicted by a jury of second degree murder. On this appeal, Brown contends that the trial judge erred in prohibiting him from introducing evidence in his defense to rebut Sydow\u2019s testimony and erred in admitting hearsay evidence. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The evidence proved that Wayne Peyton was found dead in a utility room at his residence between 3:30 and 4:30 p.m. on March 21, 1991. Peyton\u2019s skull had been crushed. Inside the utility room, the police found a broken watch. In Peyton\u2019s bedroom, the police found cocaine, scales, several thousand dollars in cash, and a small handgun. Peyton\u2019s cellular telephone was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Two months after Peyton\u2019s death, a police officer interviewed Brown. Brown told the police that Peyton was a drug dealer who supplied him with cocaine. Brown said that in the early morning of March 21, he went to Peyton\u2019s house, bought cocaine, and remained with Peyton twenty minutes before leaving. Brown identified the watch found in the utility room as his; he said the watch often fell off because the band was broken. He denied killing Peyton. Brown was arrested for the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Brown contends that the trial judge improperly limited his efforts to elicit testimony from his witnesses rebutting testimony given by the prosecution\u2019s chief witness, Daniel Sydow. He first challenges the trial judge\u2019s ruling sustaining the prosecutor\u2019s objection to the testimony of Dr. Miller Ryans.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">On direct examination as a witness for the Commonwealth, Sydow testified that he and Brown were cellmates in jail after Brown was arrested for Peyton\u2019s murder. Sydow testified that Brown told him that he had a disagreement with Peyton over a drug debt and that he killed Peyton with a cellular phone. When asked on direct examination why he chose to tell authorities of his conversations with Brown, Sydow testified that \u201cafter he told me what he was in for I pretty much stayed away from him. I\u2019m ' not a violent\u2014I\u2019m not into violence at all.\u201d In response to the prosecutor\u2019s questioning, Sydow said that none of his thirty felony convictions were for crimes of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Sydow also testified on direct examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">Q Sir, you have a disorder; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\">Q Tell the jury what that disorder is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\">A I\u2019m. a bipolar disorder. I\u2019m a manic depressant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-11\">Q And if you are taking the prescribed medication you\u2019re as normal as everyone else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-12\">A Correct. It\u2019s a chemical disorder. It\u2019s not a psychological or medical disorder, it\u2019s organic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-13\">Q And that doesn\u2019t inhibits your ability from remembering things and telling the truth does it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-14\">A No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-15\">On cross-examination, Sydow admitted reporting to prison authorities in 1991 that he was hearing voices. He said he heard voices when he stopped taking medication. When asked whether he had ever said that he has been diagnosed with an antisocial personality, Sydow responded, \u201cI guess that\u2019s a trait of being a manic depressive, yes.\u201d When asked whether he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>had been recently diagnosed by Dr. Ryans as having an antisocial personality, he responded, \u201cNo, I think the diagnosis was bipolar personality disorders.\u201d In discussing his disorder, he testified that he has \u201cnever wanted to hurt anybody.\u201d However, he admitted that on a personality test he responded \u201cTrue\u201d to the question: \u201cSometimes I feel like I must do something to hurt myself or someone else.\u201d He denied saying that he heard demons urging him to harm others. Sydow admitted to having lied in the past in order \u201cto get out of trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">During the defense case, Brown\u2019s counsel called as a witness Dr. Miller Ryans, a forensic psychiatrist employed by the Commonwealth. When the Commonwealth objected, the trial judge required Brown\u2019s counsel to proffer Dr. Ryans\u2019 testimony out of the presence of the jury. Brown\u2019s counsel asserted that Dr. Ryans would contradict Sydow\u2019s testimony that he had not been committed to the mental hospital and Sydow\u2019s testimony concerning his mental condition. Dr. Ryans then stated that he was chief of forensic services at Central State Hospital where Sydow was admitted in 1993 complaining of hearing demons. Dr. Ryans stated that Sydow reported that the demons were telling him to harm himself and others. Dr. Ryans diagnosed Sydow\u2019s condition as an antisocial personality disorder. He said that one of the symptoms of Sydow\u2019s condition was a tendency to have no regard for the truth, as indicated by repeated lying. He said that Sydow exhibited that symptom when he was at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The trial judge ruled that Dr. Ryans could only testify concerning Sydow hearing demons. In the jury\u2019s presence, Dr. Ryans testified that Sydow was admitted to Central State Hospital and claimed that demons were telling him to harm himself and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">\u201cWhether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>tion guarantees criminal defendants \u2018a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crane v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 683, 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 2146, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986) (citations omitted). <em>See also </em>Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8. Applying these principles, we have held that \u201ca defendant cannot be deprived of the opportunity to put his evidence and version of the facts before the jury so \u2018as to deprive a criminal defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine his accuser and to call witnesses in his defense,\u2019 or simply because the trial court finds the prosecutrix\u2019s version more credible than the defendant.\u201d <em>League v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 199, 205, 385 S.E.2d 232, 236 (1989) (citation omitted). The opportunity to present a complete defense \u201cwould be an empty one if the State were permitted to exclude competent, rehable evidence bearing on ... credibility ... when such evidence is central to the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence.\u201d <em>Crane, </em>476 U.S. at 690, 106 S.Ct. at 2147. \u201cCombined, the rights to compulsory process, confrontation and due process give the defendant a constitutional right to present relevant evidence.\u201d <em>Neeley v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 349, 356, 437 S.E.2d 721, 725 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">On direct examination in its case-in-chief, the Commonwealth proved by Sydow\u2019s own testimony that Sydow had an illness that was a \u201cchemical disorder\u201d and that Sydow\u2019s illness \u201cdoesn\u2019t inhibit [his] ability from remembering things and telling the truth.\u201d The Commonwealth proved these matters as a means of enhancing Sydow\u2019s credibility with the jury. Indeed, when the Commonwealth offered Sydow as its witness, it \u201cvouch[ed] for his credibility.\u201d <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>178 Va. 22, 26, 16 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The defense was entitled to attack Sydow\u2019s credibility. <em>Deavers v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 14, 16, 255 S.E.2d 458, 459 (1979); <em>Hummel v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 548, 550, 231 S.E.2d 216, 217 (1977). Because the jury determines the credibility of witnesses, <em>Zirkle v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 862, 870, 55 S.E.2d 24, 29 (1949), Brown\u2019s counsel was entitled to offer impeaching evidence that had the tendency to cause the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>jury to reject Sydow\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>Relevant evidence that tends to impeach a witness\u2019 credibility and assists in an accused\u2019s defense is admissible. <em>Hummel, </em>217 Va. at 550, 231 S.E.2d at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The Commonwealth sought to minimize the effect of Sydow\u2019s illness and explicitly drew from Sydow testimony that his illness did not affect his ability to remember and tell the truth. Because this evidence was elicited on direct examination, the inquiry was opened for impeachment. <em>Santmier v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 318, 319-20, 228 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1976). Sydow\u2019s denials were intended to \u201ccreate an impression in his favor, which the [defense] was justified in rebutting.\u201d <em>Locke v. Commonwealth, </em>149 Va. 447, 452, 141 S.E. 118, 120 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The record established that Dr. Ryans had examined Sydow and diagnosed his illness. The proffered testimony established that Dr. Ryans was prepared to directly contradict Sydow\u2019s testimony concerning the nature of his illness and the general manifestations of that illness. Unlike the circumstances in <em>Coppola v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 252, 257 S.E.2d 797, 803-04 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103, 100 S.Ct. 1069, 62 L.Ed.2d 788 (1980), Brown\u2019s counsel did not seek to have Dr. Ryans testify that Sydow could not be believed. Rather, the testimony was offered to establish that Sydow had not been truthful about his illness and that one manifestation of Sydow\u2019s illness was a lack of regard for the truth. The Supreme Court has held that a witness\u2019 mental impairment which affects the witness\u2019 ability to relate matters at issue may be proved to discredit the witness\u2019 testimony. <em>See Mastin v. Theirjung, </em>238 Va. 434, 440-41, 384 S.E.2d 86, 89-90 (1989). Dr. Ryans\u2019 testimony bore directly upon Sydow\u2019s credibility because it impeached Sydow\u2019s testimony given on direct examination. Thus, we hold that the trial judge improperly limited the scope of his testimony. The error was not harmless because Dr. Ryans\u2019 testimony, if believed by the jury, would have provided a basis for the jury to reject Sydow\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Because this case must be remanded for another trial, we address Brown\u2019s contentions that the trial judge erred in barring testimony of Deputy Sheriff Kenneth Maines and in admitting hearsay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"AZqX\">During the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, Sydow testified on direct examination that he was not a violent man, had not been convicted of a crime of violence, and that his thirty convictions were for crimes against property. The trial judge <em>sua sponte </em>barred defense counsel from cross-examining Sydow concerning his acts of violence and stated \u201cyou can bring the individuals in and let [them] testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">During the defense case, Brown\u2019s counsel sought to elicit testimony from Deputy Kenny Maines about Sydow\u2019s violent conduct during a civil trial on March 28,1994. Upon objection by the Commonwealth, Brown\u2019s counsel stated that during the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination of Sydow, the prosecutor elicited testimony that Sydow was not a violent person and did not engage in violent behavior. The trial judge allowed defense counsel to proffer Maines\u2019 testimony out of the jury\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Maines stated that at the conclusion of a civil case in which Sydow was a litigant, Sydow used \u201cvery obscene vulgar language,\u201d several times threatened to kill the other litigant, made gestures toward the judge, and \u201cgot in the Judge\u2019s face.\u201d Because of his violent conduct, the deputy put him in handcuffs. Sydow was charged with obstruction of justice, contempt of court, and assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">Ruling that Maines\u2019 testimony did not show that Sydow had been convicted and did not tend to prove Sydow was not credible, the trial judge disallowed Maines\u2019 testimony. Although we agree that the trial judge could require Brown to focus his proof upon evidence that tended to impeach Sydow, we do not agree that Maines\u2019 testimony could be barred in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>entirety. The Commonwealth elicited testimony from Sydow on direct examination that he was not a violent person in an apparent attempt to prove his motive for testifying and to compensate for the fact that Sydow had been convicted of numerous felonies. That testimony could only have been intended to bolster Sydow\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">However, when a witness\u2019 \u201canswer to the question propounded on direct examination ... was calculated to mislead the jury ... [and] was untrue,\u201d the witness \u201copened the door to cross-examination for the purpose of attacking his credibility.\u201d <em>Santmier, </em>217 Va. at 319-20, 228 S.E.2d at 682.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af9\">\u201c[A] witness may be cross-examined upon any testimony given by him [or her] in chief.\u201d If the question is \u201crelevant to the facts testified to\u201d by the witness on direct examination or if the question tends \u201cto test the veracity or credibility of the witness,\u201d the question is proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\"><em>Berry v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 32, 35, 455 S.E.2d 253, 255 (1995) (citations omitted). <em>See also Basham v. Terry, </em>199 Va. 817, 824, 102 S.E.2d 285, 290 (1958). Moreover, to the extent that Maines\u2019 testimony proved acts of violence, it rebutted Sydow\u2019s testimony and was admissible as impeaching evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The Commonwealth argues that because the jury chose to believe Sydow despite abundant impeachment, this \u201cmarginal impeachment ... would [not] have made any substantial difference.\u201d We need not decide the question of harmless error because the appeal is reversed on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">At trial, Brenda Pleasants testified for the Commonwealth that Peyton, the victim, telephoned her at 2:00 a.m. on March 21, 1991, and asked her to call him at 7:00 a.m. When she began to detail her conversation with Peyton, Brown\u2019s counsel objected that her testimony was hearsay. The trial judge ruled that it was covered by an exception to the hearsay rule. Pleasants then testified that Peyton telephoned and asked her to wake him before she left for work at 7:00 a.m. She testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>that Peyton said Brown was \u201ccoming to his home, something about furniture.\u201d She called Peyton again at 8:20 that morning to ensure he was awake. The trial judge told the jury that \u201cthe only reason that testimony is admissible [is] to show why she called him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Peyton\u2019s brother also testified that he had a phone conversation with Peyton on March 21 at 9:00 or 9:30 a.m. The trial judge overruled counsel\u2019s hearsay objection. Peyton\u2019s brother further testified that he spoke to Peyton that morning about going to Brown\u2019s house to get furniture. He spoke to his brother a second time that morning while Peyton was waiting for a phone call from Brown. \"When he returned home after noon, Peyton had left a message on his answering machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The following principles are well settled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">The hearsay rule excludes out-of-court declarations only when they are \u201coffered for a special purpose, namely, as assertions to evidence the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d If the court can determine, from the context and from the other evidence in the case, that the evidence is offered for a different purpose, the hearsay rule is no barrier to its admission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\"><em>Manetta v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 123, 127, 340 S.E.2d 828, 830 (1986) (citations and emphasis omitted). \u201c \u2018[The proponent] ... seeking to have hearsay declarations of a witness admitted as an exception to the general rule must clearly show that they are within the exception.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe v. Thomas, </em>227 Va. 466, 472, 318 S.E.2d 382, 386 (1984) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">The Commonwealth asserts that Pleasants\u2019 testimony relating Peyton\u2019s statements to her on the telephone was admissible to prove that she called Peyton at his request. Even if we assume that Peyton\u2019s request that his sister call him at 7:00 a.m. was \u201coffered solely to show that it was uttered, without regard to the truth or falsity of its content,\u201d <em>Speller v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 437, 446, 345 S.E.2d 542, 548 (1986) (emphasis omitted), her further testimony, that Peyton made the request \u201cbecause he had\u2014Thomas Brown was coming to his home, something about furniture,\u201d does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>fall within that same category. That assertion was offered for its truth. No other reason is manifest from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Likewise, the record does not adequately support the admission of Peyton\u2019s brother\u2019s testimony that Peyton told him on the telephone that Peyton was \u201cwaiting on a phone call from [Brown] so he could go pickup the piece so he could bring it to the house.\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that this evidence is not hearsay because it was offered to prove only that Peyton was alive is not persuasive. The content of the conversation was not necessary to prove Peyton was alive. The content of the telephone call established that Peyton was waiting for a telephone call. That Peyton talked by telephone would have been sufficient to prove Peyton was alive. The substance of the call was necessary only to prove the truth of the assertions that Peyton made in the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We also need not reach the question of harmless error on this issue because we reverse and remand for a new trial for the trial judge\u2019s failure to allow impeachment testimony by Dr. Ryans.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b371-8\">ANNUNZIATA, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Av8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion and would affirm the conviction. In my judgment, the trial judge correctly ruled that Dr. Ryans\u2019 testimony was inadmissible. The doctor\u2019s testimony improperly expressed an opinion regarding a witness\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">The credibility of witnesses is a matter for the jury to decide, weighing such factors as the appearance and manner of the witnesses on the stand, their intelligence, their opportunity for knowing the truth and observing the things about which they testify, their interest in the outcome of the case, their, bias, and if any had been shown, their prior inconsistent statements and prior criminal convictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-11\"><em>Mullis v.

Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 615, 630, 292 S.E.2d 798, 806 (1982). While expert testimony may be admitted to establish the existence and characteristics of a mental or personality disorder which could affect a witness\u2019 credibility, such evidence is inadmissible where the thrust and intent of the evidence is that a witness\u2019 testimony \u201c[can] not be believed\u201d because of his personality disorder. <em>Coppola v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 252-53, 257 S.E.2d 797, 804 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103, 100 S.Ct. 1069, 62 L.Ed.2d 788 (1980); <em>see also Davison v.

The majority states that Dr. Ryans\u2019 testimony was offered to establish \u201c[1] that Sydow had not been truthful about his illness and [2] that one manifestation of Sydow\u2019s illness was a lack of regard for the truth.\u201d Had the inquiry been limited to these two issues, Dr. Ryans\u2019 testimony would have been admissible, at least with respect to the latter issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whether Sydow had been diagnosed by Dr. Ryans as having an antisocial personality disorder and whether <em>an antisocial personality disorder </em>is characterized by, <em>inter alia, </em>the lack of regard for the truth, are matters upon which an expert may express an opinion under the holding in <em>Coppola.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">However, the record shows that Dr. Ryans\u2019 proffered testimony included his opinion concerning <em>Sydow\u2019s </em>ability to tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the truth. Dr. Ryans\u2019 proffered testimony, in answer to defense counsel\u2019s questions, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">Q Did you make a diagnosis at the end of [Sydow\u2019s] stay at Central State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">Q Did that diagnosis include ... that he exhibited symptoms of antisocial personality disorder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">Q Are there certain specific diagnostic criteria for that diagnosis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-11\">Q One of the criteria that <em>Sydow exhibited </em>was that number six under criteria?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-12\">A Yeah, six.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-13\">Q Would that be has no regard for the truth as indicated....

As such, the evidence was properly excluded under <em>Coppola </em>and its progeny.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Even assuming Dr. Ryans\u2019 testimony should have been admitted, the trial court\u2019s error was harmless in light of the abundant evidence relating to Sydow\u2019s credibility. <em>See Townes v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 307, 325 n. 6, 362 S.E.2d 650, 660 n. 6 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 971, 108 S.Ct. 1249, 99 L.Ed.2d 447 (1988). Sydow admitted to thirty prior felony convictions, to using numerous aliases, and to having lied in the past in order \u201cto get out of trouble.\u201d Furthermore, as set forth below, the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt established by the testimony of witnesses other than Sydow, including the testimony of the criminal investigators and that of appellant himself, is more than sufficient to sustain his conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Because I agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding Dr. Ryans\u2019 testimony, I will address appellant\u2019s remaining grounds for appeal. Appellant contends that he sought to impeach Sydow\u2019s testimony that he was not a violent person by introducing Maines\u2019 testimony of Sydow\u2019s prior inconsistent conduct. As pointed out by the majority opinion, such testimony regarding Sydow\u2019s prior inconsistent conduct was admissible as impeaching evidence and was improperly excluded. However, its exclusion was harmless error. Evidence of Sydow\u2019s prior \u201cviolent\u201d conduct was in fact admitted on cross-examination when appellant was permitted, without objection from the Commonwealth, to elicit the testimony that charges were pending against Sydow for \u201cassault and bodily harm.\u201d Appellant was precluded from eliciting from Maines, testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ny that, in the case that resulted in the assault charge, Sydow threatened to kill the other litigant, used \u201cobscene vulgar language,\u201d gestured toward the judge, and got \u201cin the judge\u2019s face.\u201d In light of the evidence that Sydow was charged with assault and bodily harm, the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the details of Sydow\u2019s conduct, if error, was harmless.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Finally, while I agree with the majority that the statements elicited from Pleasants and Waddy were hearsay and improperly admitted, their admission was harmless error. <em>Schindel v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 814, 817, 252 S.E.2d 302, 304 (1979) (\u201cEven though testimony is objectionable as hearsay, its admission is harmless error when the content of the extrajudicial declaration is clearly established by other evidence\u201d). The evidence established that Peyton was killed sometime between 8:30 a.m. and approximately noon. The evidence also established that the appellant and the decedent had argued four days before the murder over a drug debt Peyton owed the appellant. The cause of Peyton\u2019s death was \u201cacute head injuries.\u201d According to the medical examiner, some of the head wounds were \u201cpatterned\u201d or \u201crepetitive\u201d in their shape, indicating that the murder weapon had a \u201crounded\u201d edge. The decedent\u2019s cellular phone was missing from his house when his body was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The decedent\u2019s neighbor testified that on the day of the murder, he saw a small white pickup truck arrive at the decedent\u2019s house between 11:30 a.m. and noon. He also stated that the decedent came out and greeted a man who exited from the truck and that both men then went inside Peyton\u2019s house. The neighbor subsequently identified a photograph of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>appellant\u2019s white pickup truck as similar to the truck he saw parked in front of decedent\u2019s house on the day of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">When the decedent\u2019s body was found on the floor of the utility room of his mother\u2019s house, appellant\u2019s wristwatch was found less than two feet from the body. Bloody tennis shoe prints were found on both the utility room floor and on the back steps immediately outside the utility room door. The tread patterns on the shoe prints were inconsistent with the victim\u2019s shoes. When Richmond police officers first observed the appellant\u2019s white pickup truck at an apartment complex where his mother lived, they saw a pair of high-top tennis shoes in the bed of the truck and folded jeans in the cab. Later, appellant admitted he was wearing jeans when he visited the decedent the morning of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt can be attributed in good part to the appellant himself. The testimony provided by the decedent\u2019s neighbor was essentially admitted by appellant. While appellant did not admit he was at the decedent\u2019s house after 9:30 a.m., he later expressed uncertainty about the time. The appellant also admitted to the police that he drove his white pickup truck to decedent\u2019s house on the morning of the murder and that he and the decedent spent a few minutes talking at the track before both entered decedent\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Appellant also explained the presence of his watch at the scene of the murder by stating he had lost it there because the watch had a \u201cbad band\u201d on it. Furthermore, although the police did not tell appellant that Peyton\u2019s cellular phone was missing from the house, appellant initiated an inquiry about whether the police had the property that was taken in the robbery of Peyton\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Finally, Sydow, appellant\u2019s cellmate, testified that appellant admitted killing Peyton. In that admission, appellant gave Sydow the following detailed account of his involvement in the crime. Appellant told Sydow he went to the decedent\u2019s house to collect money the decedent owed him for drugs, that the decedent refused to pay, that appellant returned to the house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>later that day, and that on the second visit he hit and killed the decedent with the cellular telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The improper hearsay admitted in this case tended to establish that the appellant was at the decedent\u2019s house on the day of the murder not only around 9:30 a.m. as he testified, but later that morning and closer to the time when the murder apparently occurred. The erroneous admission of this hearsay evidence is of <em>de minimis </em>import in light of the overwhelming independent evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\">. Whether Dr. Ryans\u2019 testimony would be admissible to show that Sydow had not been truthful about his illness is more problematic. While Sydow denied on direct that his disorder did not inhibit his ability to tell the truth, on cross-examination, in response to defense counsel\u2019s question, he stated <em>he did not understand </em>that \"part of the diagnosis ... for antisocial personalities [is that] someone has no regard for the truth as indicates [sic] by personal lying....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-20\">. The majority cites <em>Mastin v. Theirjung, </em>238 Va. 434, 384 S.E.2d 86 (1989), as authority for the conclusion that Dr. Ryans should have been permitted to testify that Sydow exhibited a lack of regard for the truth. <em>Mastin </em>does not stand for the proposition cited. The issue in <em>Mastin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>was whether the plaintiff's post-traumatic stress syndrome was affected by her alcoholism. According to plaintiff's physician, the plaintiff told him that her alcoholism had been in remission for two years. Relying on plaintiff\u2019s statement, the physician testified that, because she was in remission, plaintiff\u2019s syndrome was unaffected by her alcoholism. However, the doctor\u2019s records indicated plaintiff had been drinking recently, and evidence of plaintiff\u2019s continued alcohol use was found properly admitted to impeach the doctor\u2019s testimony, as well as the plaintiff's credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 440-41, 384 S.E.2d at 89-90. It is important to note that no attempt was made in <em>Mast\u00edn </em>to elicit expert opinion testimony concerning a particular witness\u2019 ability to tell the truth and the opinion in no way suggests that the case expands or reverses the holding in <em>Coppola.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">. Both parties also address the court\u2019s ruling in light of the rules governing the admissibility of evidence to impeach a witness\u2019 character for truthfulness. When impeachment of a witness\u2019 character for truthfulness is the object, it is well settled under Virginia law that specific acts of untruthfulness or bad conduct are not admissible. <em>See Wynne v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 355, 356, 218 S.E.2d 445, 446 (1975); <em>Land </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 223, 225, 176 S.E.2d 586, 588 (1970); <em>Weimer v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 47, 52-53, 360 S.E.2d 381, 383-84 (1987). Maines\u2019 testimony regarding specific acts of bad conduct would not be admissible under this rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
