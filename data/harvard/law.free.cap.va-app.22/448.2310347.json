Because the employer unequivocally waived its subrogation rights when it settled Tomlin\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim, we reverse the commission\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Tomlin was employed as a security guard by Vance International. On September 9, 1989, Tomlin was assaulted during a riot and was severely injured. After the accident, the employer paid certain workers\u2019 compensation benefits pursuant to the Minnesota Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Tomlin then elected to file a claim in Virginia pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-508. Vance International denied the claim initially but ultimately accepted it as compensable. On September 5, 1991, Tomlin filed suit against several third parties who were allegedly responsible for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">On April 8, 1992, Vance International and Tomlin forwarded to the commission a petition, order, and affidavit setting forth the terms of a settlement of Tomlin\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. The commission approved the petition on April 15, 1992. At various times after that date, Tomlin settled his claims against the third parties. Vance International asserts that it is subrogated to Tomlin\u2019s claim against the third parties and is entitled to reimbursement from the third-party settlement funds. Tomlin maintains that Vance waived its subrogation rights when it settled the workers\u2019 compensation claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Tomlin\u2019s counsel is holding the proceeds from the third-party settlements pending resolution of the subrogation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The above facts were stipulated by the parties before the commission. The record also contains parol evidence in the form of correspondence exchanged by the parties during negotiations to settle the workers\u2019 compensation claim. The correspondence indicates that Vance International knew about the personal injury case in Minnesota and provided videos of the riot in order to assist Tomlin in that case. The correspondence also indicates that Tomlin was aware of \u201ca potential worker\u2019s compensation hen being filed in Minnesota\u201d and that Vance\u2019s assistance with the third-party claim was related to that hen in some manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The parties\u2019 petition to the commission provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">This compromise settlement shall be binding upon the Claimant, the employer and/or its insurer and is intended to be a full and final settlement of any claims, demands and obhgations, between the Claimant and/or the employer, or its insurance carrier which might be asserted by the Claimant and/or employer, or its insurance carrier, pursuant to the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Virginia Code Section 65.2-100 et seq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">#</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">The Claimant, employer and its carrier further represent that they understand and agree that this compromise agreement, upon approval, constitutes a full and final settlement of this claim and that the Claimant, employer and insurance carrier shall thereupon be forever released and discharged from any and all habilities, past, present and future in connection with this case including but not limited to, benefits for work incapacity, vocational rehabilitation services, placement services, benefits for permanent disability, and any rights which might be alleged to arise under Virginia Code Section 65.2-100 et seq.,....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">The commission\u2019s order approving the petition provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>it is hereby</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">ORDERED that the employer and insurance carrier shall pay the sum of $86,000 to the Claimant in a lump sum and thereafter the parties shall be forever released and discharged from any and all past, present and future claims, demands and obligation [sic] in connection with this claim, including benefits for permanent disability, and rights which might be alleged to arise under Virginia Code Section 65.2-100 et seq.,....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>States Roofing Corp. v. Bush Construction Corp., </em>15 Va.App. 613, 616, 426 S.E.2d 124, 126 (1993). The commission\u2019s factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal if supported by credible evidence. <em>Bullion Hollow Enterprises, Inc. v. Lane, </em>14 Va.App. 725, 730, 418 S.E.2d 904, 907 (1992). When the facts are undisputed, their interpretation is a matter of law. <em>Wells v. Commonwealth, Department of Transportation, </em>15 Va.App. 561, 563, 425 S.E.2d 536, 537 (1993). We are not bound by the commission\u2019s determination of legal questions. <em>Cibula v. Allied Fibers &amp; Plastics, </em>14 Va.App. 319, 324, 416 S.E.2d 708, 711 (1992), <em>aff'd, </em>245 Va. 337, 428 S.E.2d 905 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\"> Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the employer/insurer is subrogated to an employee\u2019s rights against a third party responsible for the injuries giving rise to the payment of compensation. Code \u00a7 65.2-309(A). The purpose of the statute is to reimburse an employer who is compelled to pay compensation as a result of the negligence of a third party and to prevent an employee from obtaining a double recovery of funds. <em>See Gartman v. Allied Towing Corp., </em>467 F.Supp. 439, 440 (E.D.Va.1979). The employer\u2019s subrogation rights are triggered automatically when the injured employee files a claim against the employer and thereby assigns to the employer any claims against third parties. Code \u00a7 65.2-309(A); <em>Wood v. Caudle-Hyatt, Inc., </em>18 Va.App. 391, 395-96, 444 S.E.2d 3, 6-7 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The commission agreed that the employer can waive its subrogation rights as part of a settlement but held that such a waiver must be in \u201cclear and unequivocal language.\u201d The commission found that the petition contained no language that could be construed as a waiver. The commission also stated that \u201c[t]he parties were well aware of the pending third-party claim when the workers\u2019 compensation claim was settled,\u201d and to that extent took parol evidence into account when making its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">It is well established that the employer/carrier can waive subrogation rights as part of a settlement. <em>See Connell v. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, </em>436 A.2d 408, 410-11 (Me.1981); <em>Stephenson v. Martin, </em>259 N.W.2d 467, 470-71 (Minn.1977); <em>Welch v. Arthur A. Fogarty, Inc., </em>157 Conn. 538, 255 A.2d 627, 630-31 (1969); 2A Arthur Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 74.31(e), at 14-517 (1983). There is also substantial authority to the effect that the waiver need not be express, but can be inferred from the language of the settlement agreement. 2A Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 74.17(a), at 14-428; <em>see also Stephenson, </em>259 N.W.2d at 470. However, accepting the commission\u2019s standard of a \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d waiver, we hold that Vance International waived its subrogation rights when it settled the workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The settlement provides that the parties are released from all claims, demands, and obligations in connection with Tomlin\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim, and \u201cany rights which might be alleged to arise under Virginia Code Section 65.2-100,\u201d the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Subrogation rights \u201carise\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and arose here \u201cin connection with\u201d Tomlin\u2019s claim. This language clearly and unequivocally waives Vance International\u2019s subrogation rights. <em>See Welch, </em>255 A.2d at 631 (court interpreted similar language as unambiguously waiving the employer\u2019s right to recoup compensation from settlement funds; court also noted that the settlement did not reserve the right to recoupment nor did the parties inform the commissioner who approved the settlement of any intent to reserve that right).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Where a written instrument is clear and explicit and can be interpreted based on the ordinary meaning of the language used, the parties\u2019 intent is clear and cannot be altered through parol evidence. <em>Nelson v. Commonwealth, 235 </em>Va. 228, 246, 368 S.E.2d 239, 249 (1988); <em>Amos v. Coffey, </em>228 Va. 88, 92, 320 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1984). Because the language of the settlement was clear, it was error for the commission to use parol evidence to interpret the parties\u2019 intent. For these reasons, we reverse the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
