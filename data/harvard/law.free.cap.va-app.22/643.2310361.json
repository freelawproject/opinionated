We find no error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">On February 17, 1993, Ms. Padilla\u2019s six children were removed from her custody following a child protective services investigation into the death of one of her infant twins and the lodging of neglect charges against her relating to her remaining children. Five of her children were placed in the custody of the Norfolk Division of Social Services. The sixth child was placed in the custody of his paternal grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">One of the five children was placed permanently in a therapeutic foster home. Two others did not adjust to foster care and were returned to Ms. Padilla\u2019s custody in June, 1994. Ms. Padilla was provided extensive personal and family counseling, home based services five days per week, parenting classes, and psychological examinations. The remaining two children, the subjects of this case, have resided in separate foster homes since February, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">In January, 1995, the juvenile and domestic relations district court denied Ms. Padilla\u2019s petition for custody of the two subject children. Upon recommendation of the court-appoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ed special advocate, the juvenile court ordered the goals of the children\u2019s foster care service plans changed from \u201creturn to parent\u201d to \u201cgoal for adoption.\u201d Ms. Padilla appealed that decision to the trial court, which found that it was \u201cnot reasonably likely that [the two children] can be returned to Kathleen Padilla within a predictable time consistent with the best interests of the children despite intensive and extended efforts by Norfolk Division of Social Services and other parties to correct the conditions which led to removal from the home.\u201d The trial court ordered the goals of the foster care service plans changed to \u201cgoal for adoption\u201d for both children.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Ms. Padilla contends, first, that the trial court erred in failing to require proof that she was an unfit parent, and second, that the trial court erred in finding that clear and convincing proof supported changing the goal of the foster care service plans from \u201creturn to parent\u201d to \u201cgoal for adoption.\u201d We find neither argument persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-282 sets forth no specific standard of proof for the establishment or modification of foster care plans. However, in <em>Wright v. Arlington County Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>9 Va.App. 411, 388 S.E.2d 477 (1990), we held that the appropriate standard of proof for an abuse and neglect hearing is proof by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 414, 388 S.E.2d at 479. This case is analogous to <em>Wright </em>because the placement of the children remains temporary. Thus, proof by a preponderance of the evidence is the appropriate standard in this case. The evidence satisfied that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Ms. Padilla\u2019s parental rights were not terminated in this proceeding. Should a proceeding be brought to terminate her parental rights, the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d burden of proof and the elements of proof set forth in Code \u00a7 16.1-283 will then apply. Ms. Padilla\u2019s parental fitness was not an issue in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
