McDaniel (claimant) was awarded permanent partial disability benefits by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission) pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-503. Lynchburg Foundry Company and its insurer (employer) appeal, arguing that the claim was barred by the limitations period prescribed by Code \u00a7 65.2-601. We disagree and affirm the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The facts are uneontroverted. On December 4,1991, claimant accidentally injured his left foot incidental to employment, and his counsel lodged a \u201cletter claim\u201d with the commission on April 2, 1992. This correspondence noted counsel\u2019s representation of claimant with respect \u201cto his workmen\u2019s compensation claim arising from [the subject] injury\u201d and requested \u201ca hearing ... in reference to the carrier\u2019s failure to pay medical mileage and prescriptions.\u201d The commission acknowledged receipt of claimant\u2019s \u201capplication\u201d and notified employer of the pending claim. In response, employer challenged claimant\u2019s entitlement to \u201cmedical mileage\u201d but assured the commission that employer had provided claimant with prescription drugs necessitated by the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">The claim was thereafter placed \u201cin suspense\u201d by the commission, awaiting further documentation from claimant. By letter dated August 7, 1992, claimant advised the commission that \u201creimbursement ... for a pair of boots,\u201d was the \u201conly unpaid item at [that] time\u201d and, on November 4,1992, requested a hearing relative to that issue. However, following subsequent verification of payment for the boots by employer, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>commission declined to schedule a hearing, without objection from claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The claim remained dormant until claimant\u2019s correspondence to employer, dated February 4, 1994, with a copy to the commission, advised employer that claimant had suffered a \u201c10% permanent partial disability to left foot as a result of the injury\u201d and requested employer to \u201cgo ahead and submit the appropriate paperwork to us ... for [claimant\u2019s] signature.\u201d On December 2,1994, claimant\u2019s counsel wrote the commission seeking a hearing to resolve \u201cthis matter.\u201d Relying upon the two-year limitation period of Code \u00a7 65.2-601, employer countered that the disability claim was time-barred. The commission, however, disagreed, concluding that the claim was protected by the extended period prescribed by Code \u00a7 65.2-708(B), and awarded claimant disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-601 provides that \u201ccompensation ... shall be forever barred, unless a claim [is] filed with the Commission within two years after the accident.\u201d During this period, the employee must \u201cassert against his employer <em>any </em>claim that he might have for any injury growing out of the accident.\u201d <em>Shawley v. Shea-Ball Constr. Co., </em>216 Va. 442, 446, 219 S.E.2d 849, 853 (1975) (emphasis added); <em>Mayberry v. Alcoa Bldg. Prods., 18 </em>Va.App. 18, 20, 441 S.E.2d 349, 350 (1994). Code \u00a7 65.2-601 is jurisdictional and failure to file within the allotted time bars the claim. <em>Mayberry, </em>18 Va.App. at 20, 441 S.E.2d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">However, Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) permits the commission, \u201con the ground of a change of condition,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to \u201creview any award and on such review ... make an award ending, diminishing or increasing the compensation previously awarded,\u201d provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">[n]o such review shall be made after twenty-four months from the last day for which compensation was paid, pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ant to an award under this title, except: (i) thirty-six months from the last day for which compensation was paid shall be allowed for the filing of claims payable under \u00a7 65.2-503....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">A review pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) is predicated upon a prior award. <em>Mayberry, </em>18 Va.App. at 21, 441 S.E.2d at 350-51 (citation omitted); <em>see also Shawley, </em>216 Va. at 445-46, 219 S.E.2d at 852. \u201cIn those cases where <em>no </em>compensation has been paid, the Commission <em>may make </em>an award under \u00a7 65.2-503 within thirty-six months from the date of the accident.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-708(B) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Here, claimant\u2019s original application for benefits embraced only \u201cmedical mileage and prescriptions,\u201d and employer voluntarily satisfied these expenses, <em>without </em>an award by the commission. Claimant made no mention of permanent partial disability either to the commission or employer until February 4, 1994, twenty-six months after the accident, and did not request a hearing on this \u201cmatter\u201d until December 2, 1994. Thus, the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) did not save the disability claim from the jurisdictional bar of Code \u00a7 65.2-601. <em>See Shawley, </em>216 Va. at 446, 219 S.E.2d at 852-53; <em>Mayberry, </em>18 Va.App. at 20-21, 441 S.E.2d at 350-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Nevertheless, the commission, noting that the <em>original </em>\u201cclaim was filed within two years of the accident\u201d and that the contested \u201csecond claim\u201d was \u201cmade within 36 months from the ... accident,\u201d applied Code \u00a7 65.2-708(B) to exempt the later claim from the preclusive effect of Code \u00a7 65.2-601. Clearly, the disability claim sought an award under Code \u00a7 65.2-503, had not been preceded by the payment of compensation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was asserted within thirty-six months of the accident which was subject of the earlier claim. Unlike Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A), Code \u00a7 65.2-708(B) does not require the exis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tence of a prior award. Thus, the later claim qualified for relief pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-708(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-9\">. \"[A] change in physical condition of the employee ... which would \u25a0 affect the right to, amount of, or duration of compensation.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-7\">.
