(Residents) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal the circuit court\u2019s decision affirming the Department of Environmental Quality\u2019s (the Department) issuance of a sanitary landfill permit to Browning-Ferris Industries of South Atlantic, Inc. (BFI). Residents argue that the Director of the Department (Director) violated Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(D) by issuing the permit without mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ing the required, specific determination that the proposed facility posed \u201cno substantial present or potential danger to human health or the environment.\u201d The Department asserts that: (1) by issuing the permit, the Director implicitly made the required determination under Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(D), and (2) because Residents failed to name BFI as a party in the notice of appeal or to serve it with the petition for appeal, the appeal should have been dismissed. BFI, as an intervener, argues that the court erred in denying its motion to change venue. We affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision as to the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss and BFI\u2019s motion to change venue. However, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision to affirm the permit\u2019s issuance because the record fails to show that the Director made the required determination under Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">On September 18,1990, BFI filed a notice of intent with the Department to initiate the application process for a permit to build a landfill in King and Queen County.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> BFI also filed a local certification that the proposed location and operation of the landfill complied with local ordinances, as required by Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(B)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 4,1991, BFI submitted Part A of its permit application, which contained information concerning whether the proposed site was suitable for the proposed use and addressing the siting criteria required by the Virginia Solid Waste Management Regulations (SWMR). The Department\u2019s staff reviewed Part A and approved it on July 29, 1991. On March 20, 1992, BFI submitted Part B of its application, addressing facility design, construction, and operation. The Department\u2019s technical staff reviewed Part B, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>made numerous revisions to the original proposal, and determined that the application complied with the SWMR.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The Department subsequently prepared a draft permit and held a public hearing on March 24, 1993, with the public comment period extended to April 5, 1993. The Department\u2019s staff received comments on the draft permit, made changes based on these comments before recommending that the Director approve the permit, and responded in writing to many of the issues raised during the public comment period. On June 2, 1993, the Director issued the permit to BFI. Prior to issuing the permit, the Director made no explicit finding or determination that the proposed facility posed \u201cno substantial present or potential danger to human health or the environment,\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">On July 30, 1993, Residents appealed the permit\u2019s issuance to the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond, arguing that the Director \u201cfailed to investigate whether the construction and/or operation of the landfill will create an adverse impact or a present or potential hazard to human health.\u201d Residents also argued that the Director was required to make the specific determination that the landfill posed no \u201csubstantial present or potential danger to human health or the environment.\u201d In their appeal, Residents named only the Department and the Director as parties. BFI later intervened in the appeal and moved to transfer the case to King and Queen County, the preferred venue under Code \u00a7 8.01-261(1). The circuit court denied the motion. After hearing oral argument on October 20,1994, the circuit court issued a letter opinion on May 4, 1995, finding that: (1) Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(D) did not impose an independent duty of investigation on the Director, and (2) the Director\u2019s action in issuing the permit complied \u201cwith the applicable regulations or law governing the concerns the appellant[s] raise[ ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">NECESSARY PARTIES IN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The Department argues that the circuit court should have dismissed Residents\u2019 appeal because they failed to name BFI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>as a party in the notice of appeal and failed to serve BFI with the petition for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">In its letter opinion of November 5, 1993, the circuit court refused to dismiss Residents\u2019 appeal and determined that \u201cBFI [did] not fit the definition of \u2018party\u2019 as used in Rules 2A:2 and 2A:4.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Appeals pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.14:1 to 9-6.14:25, are governed by Part 2A of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia. Rule 2A:l(e). Rule 2A:l(b) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA9\">The term \u201cparty\u201d means any person affected by and <em>claiming the unlawfulness of a regulation </em>or a party aggrieved who <em>asserts a case decision is unlawful </em>and any other affected person or aggrieved person who appeared in person or by counsel at a hearing, as defined in \u00a7 9-6.14:4 E, with respect to the regulation or case decision as well as the agency itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">(Emphasis added). A \u201crule\u201d or \u201cregulation\u201d under the VAPA is \u201cany statement of general application, having the force of law, affecting the rights or conduct of any-person, promulgated by an agency in accordance with the authority conferred on it by applicable basic laws.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4(F). In contrast, the VAPA defines the term \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccase decision\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">any agency proceeding or determination that, under the laws or regulations at the time, a named party as a matter of past or present fact, or of threatened or contemplated private action, either is, is not, or may or may not be (i) in violation of such law or regulation or (ii) in compliance with any existing requirement for obtaining or retaining a license or other right or benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4(D). The Reviser\u2019s Notes to Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4 indicate that the primary distinction between regulations and case decisions is that regulations are \u201clegislative\u201d or \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d in nature and that case decisions serve a \u201cjudicial\u201d or \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d function. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4, Reviser\u2019s Notes D. <em>See also Kenley v. Newport News General &amp; Non-Sectari</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>an Hosp. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>227 Va. 39, 44, 314 S.E.2d 52, 55 (1984) (\u201c[T]he \u2018heart\u2019 of a case decision \u2018is a fact determination respecting compliance with law.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4, Reviser\u2019s Notes D)). Under the VAPA, the term \u201chearing\u201d refers to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">agency processes other than those informational or factual inquiries of an informal nature provided in 9-6.14:7.1 and 9-6.14:11 of this chapter and includes only (i) opportunity for private parties to submit factual proofs in formal proceedings as provided in 9-6.14:8 of this chapter in connection with the making of regulations or (ii) a similar right of private parties or requirement of public agencies as provided in 9-6.14:12 hereof in connection with case decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnT\">Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Any party appealing an agency case decision must file its notice for appeal within thirty days of the final order in the case decision. Rule 2A:2 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">The notice of appeal shall identify the ... case decision appealed from, shall state the names and addresses of the appellant and of all other parties and their counsel, if any, shall specify the circuit court to which the appeal is taken, and shall conclude with a certificate that a copy of the notice of appeal has been mailed to each of the parties____ The omission of a party whose name and address cannot, after due diligence, be ascertained shall not be cause for dismissal of the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Within thirty days after filing the notice of appeal, the appellant must file his petition for appeal with the clerk of the circuit court. Rule 2A:4(a). \u201cSuch filing shall include all steps provided in Rules 2:2 and 2:3 to cause a copy of the petition to be served (as in the case of a bill of complaint in equity) on the agency secretary and on every other party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">We agree with the circuit court and hold that BFI is not a \u201cparty\u201d as defined in Rule 2A:l(b) and as used in Part 2A of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia. BFI is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u201ca person affected by and claiming the unlawfulness of a regulation\u201d because: (1) an agency case decision, not an agency regulation, is at issue in this case; and (2) BFI does not assert that the Director\u2019s issuance of the permit was unlawful. As the company that benefited from the agency\u2019s granting of the landfill permit, BFI is also not \u201ca party aggrieved who asserts a case decision is unlawful.\u201d Additionally, BFI is not \u201cany other affected person or aggrieved person who appeared in person or by counsel at a hearing\u201d because it is undisputed that no \u201chearing\u201d as defined in Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4(E) was held concerning BFI\u2019s permit request.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Additionally, the Department argues that BFI was a \u201cnecessary party,\u201d relying on <em>Asch v. Friends of the Community of the Mt. Vernon Yacht Club, </em>251 Va. 89, 465 S.E.2d 817 (1996). In <em>Asch, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia defined \u25a0 \u201cnecessary party\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">\u201cWhere an individual is in the actual enjoyment of the subject matter, or has an interest in it, either in possession or expectancy, which is likely either to be defeated or diminished by the plaintiffs claim, in such case he has an immediate interest in resisting the demand, and all persons who have such immediate interests are necessary parties to the suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 90-91, 465 S.E.2d at 818 (quoting <em>Raney v. Four Thirty Seven Land Co., </em>233 Va. 513, 519-20, 357 S.E.2d 733, 736 (1987)). However, the instant case is distinguishable from <em>Asch </em>and other cases applying the \u201cnecessary party\u201d analysis because the Rules governing an administrative appeal under the VAPA are specific to the nature of the Act. In appeals under the VAPA, the only parties required to be a part of the case are those listed in Rule 2A:l(b). Thus, because BFI was not a \u201cparty\u201d as defined in Rule 2A:l(b) and BFI was allowed to intervene in the case to protect its interests, the circuit court did not err in refusing to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">TIMELY OBJECTION TO VENUE</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Additionally, BFI asserts that the circuit court erred in finding that an intervener has no right to object to venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>In a letter opinion dated January 31, 1994, the trial court denied BFI\u2019s motion to change venue and stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ_\">There has been a question in the Court\u2019s mind whether an intervenor can object to venue. The Court decides that in this case the intervenor cannot____ Rule 2:15 ... state[s] that as to the petitioner the rules applicable to bills and subpoenas apply and as to the parties the rules applicable to defendants apply. This puts BFI in the position of plaintiff and the parties as defendants who would file responsive pleadings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">Since the original defendant, DEQ, failed to object to venue that motion is lost to the case because there is no other party defendant, including BFI as intervenor, present in the case to object to venue under the terms of [Code] \u00a7 8.01-264.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Code \u00a7 8.01-264(A) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMM\">Venue laid in forums other than those designated by this chapter shall be subject to objection, but no action shall be dismissed solely on the basis of venue if there be a forum in the Commonwealth where venue is proper. In actions where venue is subject to objection, the action may nevertheless be tried where it is commenced, and the <em>venue irregularity shall be deemed to have been waived unless the defendant objects to venue by motion filed, as to actions in circuit courts, within twenty-one days after service of process commencing the action, </em>or within the period of any extension of time for filing responsive pleadings fixed by order of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">(Emphasis added). In appeals under the VAPA, \u201c[u]nless the parties otherwise agree, ... the venue for agency or court proceedings shall be as specified in subdivision 1 of \u00a7 8.01-261.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 9-6.14:5.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Rule 2:15 governs intervention of new parties and provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\">A new party may by petition filed by leave of court assert any claim or defense germane to the subject matter of the suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">All provisions of these Rules applicable to bills and subpoenas, except those provisions requiring payment of \u25a0writ tax and clerk\u2019s fees, shall apply to such petitions; and all provisions of these Rules applicable to defendants shall apply to the parties on whom such petitions are served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A91\">\u201cGenerally speaking, an intervenor is held to take the case as he finds it....\u201d <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co. v. Peninsula Shipbuilders\u2019 Ass\u2019n, 646 </em>F.2d 117, 122 (4th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We hold that the circuit court did not err in denying BFI\u2019s motion to change venue because no defendant filed a timely objection to venue. The original defendant, the Department, failed to object to venue within twenty-one days of Residents commencing the appeal as required by Code \u00a7 8.01-264 and thus waived any venue objection. BFI intervened in the case after the twenty-one-day period for objecting to venue had passed. Thus, no timely objection to venue was filed. To hold otherwise would allow an intervener to object to venue at a late stage of the proceedings, thus interrupting the flow of the trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because no timely objection to venue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>was filed, the circuit court properly denied BFI\u2019s motion to change venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">DETERMINATION REQUIREMENT UNDER CODE \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(D)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Residents argue that the Director violated Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(D) when he issued the landfill permit to BFI without determining that the facility posed \u201cno substantial present or potential danger to human health or the environment.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Director and the Department assert that the issuance of the permit represented the Director\u2019s implicit determination that the landfill posed \u201cno substantial ... danger to human health or the environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">In 1992, the General Assembly consolidated several state agencies, including the Department of Waste Management, and created the Department of Environmental Quality. Code \u00a7 10.1-1188. The statutorily mandated policy of the Department is \u201cto protect the environment of Virginia in order to promote the health and well-being of the Commonwealth\u2019s citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The purposes of the Department include \u201ceoordinat[ing] permit review and issuance procedures to protect all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>aspects of Virginia\u2019s environment,\u201d Code \u00a7 10.1-1183(2), and \u201cpromot[ing] environmental quality through public hearings and expeditious and comprehensive permitting, inspection, monitoring, and enforcement programs.\u201d Code \u00a7 10.1-1183(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Under the Virginia Waste Management Act (the Act), the Department is responsible for insuring that \u201c[n]o person ... operate[s] any sanitary landfill or other facility for the disposal, treatment or storage of nonhazardous solid waste without a permit from the Director.\u201d Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(A).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">No permit for a new solid waste management facility shall be issued until the Director [of the Department] has <em>determined, </em>after investigation and evaluation of comments by the local government, <em>that the proposed facility poses no substantial present or potential danger to human health or the environment. </em>The Department shall hold a public hearing within the said county, city or town prior to the issuance of any such permit for the management of nonhazardous solid waste.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(D) (emphasis added). <em>See also Concerned Taxpayers of Brunswick County v.

Any permit issued by the Director \u201cshall contain such conditions or requirements as are necessary to comply with the requirements of this Code and the regulations of the [Virginia Waste Management] Board and to prevent a substantial present or potential hazard to human health and the environment.\u201d Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The Act provides that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by a final decision of the Board or Director under this chapter shall be entitled to judicial review thereof in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d Code \u00a7 10.1-1457.

Etzold, </em>245 Va. 80, 85, 425 S.E.2d 800, 802 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">We hold that the Director failed to comply with Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(D) in issuing the permit to BFI. Code \u00a7 10.1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>1408.1(D) clearly specifies that no permit for solid waste management shall be issued until the Director has made a determination or finding<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the proposed facility poses \u201cno substantial present or potential danger to human health or the environment.\u201d The record shows that the Director and the Department\u2019s staff reviewed the permit application, drafted a permit, held a public hearing concerning the draft permit, received public comments on the draft permit, made changes to the draft permit, and responded in writing to the public\u2019s concerns. However, before issuing the permit neither the Director nor the Department\u2019s staff made the finding that the facility posed \u201cno substantial ... danger to human health or the environment,\u201d not even in the permit itself. The Director and the Department concede that no such determination in writing appears in the record, but assert that the Director implicitly made that determination by issuing the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">Because the Department\u2019s main policy is \u201cto protect the environment of Virginia in order to promote the health and well-being of the Commonwealth\u2019s citizens,\u201d Code \u00a7 10.1-1188, we hold that the issuance of the permit alone was insufficient to satisfy the statutory mandate of Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(D), and that an explicit determination of \u201cno substantial present or potential danger to human health or the environment\u201d was required. Thus, the case is remanded to the trial court with instructions to remand the matter to the Director to consider the record already presented and make the required determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Accordingly, the circuit court\u2019s rulings on the Department\u2019s dismissal motion and BFI\u2019s change of venue motion are affirmed.

We do reach the question of whether an intervener would be allowed to object to venue within the twenty-one-day period. Resolution of that issue is unnecessary to this appeal because no timely objection was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">. Residents' additional argument that the Director was required to consider the character of the land affected is without merit. Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(1) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">No person shall allow waste to be disposed of on his property without a permit. Any person who removes trees, brush, or other vegetation from land used for agricultural or forestal purposes shall not be required to obtain a permit if such material is deposited or placed on the same or other property of the same landowner, from which such materials were cleared. The Board shall by regulation provide for other reasonable exemptions from permitting requirements for the disposal of trees, brush and other vegetation when such materials are removed for agricultural or forestal purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\"><em>When promulgating any regulation pursuant to this section, </em>the Board shall consider the character of the land affected, the density of population, the volume of waste to be disposed, as well as other relevant factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">(Emphasis added). Thus, the statute plainly states that the Director is required to consider the character of the land only when promulgating regulations providing for other exemptions concerning the disposal of vegetation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b589-7\">. \"Determination\u201d is defined as \"[t]he decision of a court or administrative agency\u201d and is synonymous with \"finding.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>450 (6th ed.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
