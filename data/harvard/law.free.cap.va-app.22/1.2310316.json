Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 540, 458 S.E.2d 595 (1995). Upon O\u2019Toole\u2019s motion, we stayed the mandate of that decision and granted a rehearing <em>en banc. </em>Upon such rehearing, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed for those reasons set forth in the panel\u2019s majority opinion. Accordingly, the stay of this Court\u2019s June 27, 1995 mandate hereby is lifted and its directives reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-15\">Judges Benton and Elder would reverse the judgment of the trial court for those reasons set forth in the panel\u2019s dissenting opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 544-46, 458 S.E.2d at 597-98 (Benton, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-16\">The Commonwealth shall recover of the appellant an additional $200 for services rendered the appellant by the Public Defender on the rehearing portion of this appeal, in addition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>to counsel\u2019s costs and necessary direct out-of-pocket expenses. This amount shall be added to the costs due the Commonwealth in the June 27,1995 mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">This order shall be published and certified to the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
