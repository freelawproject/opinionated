Stewart contends that the evidence was insufficient, as a matter of law, to support the conviction. He argues that because only one witness testified that he made a false statement under oath, no corroboration of the alleged perjury was established. We hold that the evidence was sufficient and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">On December 28, 1993, Roger Goodman was involved in an automobile accident with another vehicle in Chesterfield Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ty. As a result of the accident, habitual offender and reckless driving charges were brought against Booker Williams, who was alleged to have been driving the car that collided with Goodman\u2019s automobile. At Williams\u2019 trial in general district court, Stewart testified that he, not Booker Williams, was driving the vehicle that collided with Roger Goodman\u2019s automobile. Stewart was subsequently charged with perjury as a result of his testimony at Williams\u2019 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In the perjury trial, Roger Goodman testified that he was present at Booker Williams\u2019 trial in general district court and that he heard Stewart testify falsely under oath that on December 28, 1993, he, Stewart, was driving the car that struck Goodman\u2019s automobile. Goodman testified, however, that the driver of the vehicle that collided with his automobile identified himself at the scene of the accident as \u201cBooker Williams,\u201d and that Stewart is \u201ctaller and he looks a lot younger [than Williams],\u201d and that his skin tone \u201cmay be a little darker.\u201d Goodman described Williams as \u201capproximately 5 feet tall, medium color skin, real nervous individual, kind of stocky buil[d].\u201d Additionally, Goodman testified that at Williams\u2019 trial, Stewart could not identify the automobile that he claimed he was driving. Additionally, Goodman testified that Stewart did not know \u201cthe address of the person who owned the car\u201d that Stewart testified he was driving, and could not remember that Goodman was wearing a \u201cfull camouflage outfit\u201d at the time of the accident. When Goodman was asked whether there was any doubt in his mind that Stewart was not the person driving the car that struck his, Goodman responded, \u201c[n]one whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Officer Reid of the Chesterfield County Police Department testified that he investigated the accident involving Roger Goodman and Booker Williams, and that as a result of the investigation, Booker Williams was arrested on habitual offender and reckless driving charges. Officer Reid was present at Williams\u2019 trial and heard Stewart testify, under oath, that he was operating the vehicle that collided with Roger Goodman\u2019s automobile on December 28, 1993. Officer Reid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>testified that there was a \u201cdistinct difference\u201d in appearance between Stewart and Booker Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u201c[A] perjury conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-434 requires proof of falsity from the testimony of at least two witnesses or other corroborating evidence of falsity in the event the case is supported by the testimony of only one witness.\u201d <em>Keffer v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 545, 549, 404 S.E.2d 745, 747 (1991). Here, Roger Goodman was the only witness who testified that Stewart was not the driver of the vehicle that collided with Goodman\u2019s automobile. Therefore, unless other evidence corroborates Goodman\u2019s testimony that Stewart testified falsely about being the driver, Stewart\u2019s perjury conviction must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Although corroboration is required in order to prove perjury, the \u201cnature of the corroboration\u201d necessary to substantiate the testimony of a single witness in a perjury prosecution has never been specifically delineated. <em>See </em>7 John H. Wigmore, <em>Evidence \u00a7 </em>2042, at 365 (Chadbourn rev. 1978). It is important to note, however, that the corroborating evidence rule \u201cis founded upon the idea that it is unsafe to convict in any case where the oath of one man merely is to be weighed against that of another.\u201d <em>Schwartz v. Commonwealth, </em>68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 1025, 1027 (1876). The purpose of requiring corroborating evidence is \u201cto confirm the single witness\u2019 testimony and to induce the belief of it.\u201d 7 Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 2042, at 364. Accordingly, we hold that although the corroborating evidence \u201cmust be of a strong character, and not merely corroborative in slight particulars,\u201d <em>Schwartz, </em>68 Va. (27 Gratt.) at 1027, it need not be equal in weight to the testimony of a second witness. Rather, the corroborating evidence must confirm the single witness\u2019 testimony in a manner strong enough \u201cto turn the scale and overcome the oath of the [defendant] and the legal presumption of his innocence.\u201d <em>Keffer, </em>12 Va.App. at 548, 404 S.E.2d at 746-47 (quoting <em>Schwartz, </em>68 Va. (27 Gratt.) at 1027).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">We need not decide whether Officer Reid\u2019s testimony was sufficient, standing alone, to corroborate Roger Goodman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>sworn statement that Stewart testified falsely when he swore that he was the driver of the car that collided with Goodman\u2019s automobile. The trier of fact could infer from Officer Reid\u2019s statement that he investigated the accident, that he did more than take Goodman\u2019s statement and did not simply rely upon Goodman\u2019s statement to identify Booker Williams as the driver. Officer Reid arrested Booker Williams at the accident scene on habitual offender and reckless driving charges as a result of a police investigation. Reid\u2019s actions support Goodman\u2019s testimony. Officer Reid\u2019s testimony that there was a difference in appearance between Stewart and Booker Williams confirms Goodman\u2019s testimony, and also tends to prove that Goodman did not mistakenly identify Booker Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Most important, Stewart\u2019s testimony at Williams\u2019 trial corroborates Goodman\u2019s testimony and tends to prove that Stewart perjured himself when he testified that he was the driver of the automobile. <em>Cf. Cardwell v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 501, 512, 450 S.E.2d 146, 153 (1994) (holding that \u201can accomplice\u2019s testimony can be corroborated by an accused\u2019s admissions\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 1826, 131 L.Ed.2d 747 (1995). Stewart testified that, although he was driving the car, he could not remember that Goodman was wearing a full camouflage outfit. Stewart also claimed he could not remember the type of automobile he was driving when he had the accident or the address of the automobile\u2019s owner. Stewart testified at Williams\u2019 trial about three months after the accident. He gave no plausible explanation why he did not know these significant details about the accident in which he claimed to have been involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Stewart\u2019s lack of knowledge about the basic details of the accident and ownership of the automobile he claimed to have been driving, facts that he necessarily would know or be able to explain, corroborate Goodman\u2019s testimony that Stewart perjured himself. The material and transparent deficiencies in Stewart\u2019s testimony and Officer Reid\u2019s testimony \u201cturn the scale\u201d in favor of Roger Goodman and overcome the force of Stewart\u2019s oath. <em>Keffer, </em>12 Va.App. at 548, 404 S.E.2d at 746 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>(quoting <em>Schwartz, </em>68 Va. (27 Gratt.) at 1027). Therefore, the evidence is sufficient, as a matter of law, to support Stewart\u2019s conviction for perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
