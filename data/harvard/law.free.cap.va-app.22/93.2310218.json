Pursuant to the jury\u2019s recommendation, the court sentenced Bell to sixty-six years imprisonment. Bell appeals, contending (1) the conviction for abduction with intent to defile should have been merged with the conviction for animate object sexual penetration; (2) the term \u201canimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>object sexual penetration\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2 excludes digital penetration of the vagina; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdicts. We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">A defendant may be convicted of abduction in addition to \u201canother crime involving restraint of the victim, both growing out of a continuing course of conduct, ... only when the detention committed in the act of abduction is separate and apart from, and not merely incidental to, the restraint employed in the commission of the other crime.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 310, 314, 337 S.E.2d 711, 713-14 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">When considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal in a criminal case, this Court views the evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). On review, this Court does not substitute its own judgment for that of the trier of fact. <em>Cable v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 236, 239, 415 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1992). Instead, the jury\u2019s verdict will not be set aside unless it appears that it is plainly wrong or without supporting evidence. Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>Traverso v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 172, 176, 366 S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Here, the jury\u2019s finding of an abduction separate and apart from both the robbery and the sexual assault is not plainly -wrong and is supported by the evidence. On July 17, 1994 at approximately 3:30 a.m., Carter Brooks (\u201cBrooks\u201d) and Monica Stanley (\u201cStanley\u201d) left a friend\u2019s second story apartment in Richmond. As Brooks and Stanley crossed the well-lit street, moving toward Brooks\u2019 car, Bell and Robert L. Terry (\u201cTerry\u201d) walked toward them, reaching the car just before they did. After placing a gun on top of the car, Bell ordered Brooks and Stanley to empty their pockets and turn over their jewelry. Brooks and Stanley complied. Brooks then pulled his pockets out to demonstrate his compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>When Brooks and Stanley attempted to return to their friend\u2019s apartment, Bell pointed the gun at them and ordered them back. The two returned, having pulled out their pockets to demonstrate that they possessed nothing else. Bell then grabbed Stanley\u2019s wrist and noticed a bracelet she had not relinquished. After Stanley indicated the bracelet was worth only eleven dollars, Bell dropped her wrist and ignored the bracelet.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The assailants then pulled Brooks and Stanley around the side of the car and ordered them to lie face down on the sidewalk. Bell began to pat down Stanley\u2019s thighs, inner legs, and buttocks and repeatedly asked her to roll over. The victims pleaded with Bell to stop, offering him the keys to Brooks\u2019 car and the stereo inside. Bell put the gun to Brooks\u2019 head, pushed him back, and ordered Stanley to unzip her pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Bell then unzipped Stanley\u2019s pants, placed his hands inside her underwear, and inserted his fingers inside her vagina, against her will, for a period of thirty seconds to a minute. The assailants then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Bell contends that when he ordered Stanley to lie down on the sidewalk and began \u201cpatting\u201d down her body, he was continuing the robbery and searching for more property. He argues that he sexually assaulted Stanley from that position. In other words, Bell contends that the only restraint he exerted was incidental to either the robbery or the sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">However, the jury could reasonably have found from the evidence that Bell\u2019s actions in pulling Stanley around the car and ordering her to he down were acts of restraint and asportation separate and apart from the restraint inherent in either the sexual assault or the robbery. <em>See Cardwell v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 501, 511, 450 S.E.2d 146, 152 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 115 S.Ct. 1826, 131 L.Ed.2d 747 (1995); <em>Hoke v. Commonwealth, </em>237 Va. 303, 311, 377 S.E.2d 595, 600, <em>cert. denied, </em>491 U.S. 910, 109 S.Ct. 3201, 105 L.Ed.2d 709 (1989); <em>Phoung v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>457, 462, 424 S.E.2d 712, 714-15 (1992). Furthermore, the jury could reasonably have concluded that Bell moved Stanley to avoid detection. <em>See Coram v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 623, 626, 352 S.E.2d 532, 533-34 (1987). Bell knew Stanley had come from across the street prior to the robbery. Moving her around the car and ordering her to the ground took Stanley out of the line of sight from where she had come. Indeed, the victims\u2019 friend testified that he witnessed the crimes, except the object penetration, from the -window of the apartment. His view of the sexual assault was obstructed by the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Bell argues that he cannot be convicted of \u201canimate object sexual penetration\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2 because his finger is not an \u201canimate\u201d object. Bell\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Code Section 18.2-67.2, entitled \u201cObject Sexual Penetration,\u201d states, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">[a]n accused shall be guilty of inanimate or animate object sexual penetration if he or she penetrates the labia majora or anus of a complaining witness who is not his or her spouse with any object ... or ... animal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Bell contends that \u201canimate\u201d refers only to acts committed by or with an animal. Where a statute\u2019s language is unambiguous, courts \u201cmust take the words as written and give them their plain meaning.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 912, 920-21, 407 S.E.2d 319, 325 (1991) (quoting <em>Diggs v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 300, 302, 369 S.E.2d 199, 200 (1988)). A word\u2019s meaning takes color and expression for the purport of the entire phrase from which it is taken; meaning must be taken in context. <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 460, 309 S.E.2d 337, 339 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">\u201cAnimate\u201d means \u201cpossessing life; living.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>111 (2d College ed.1982). A finger is an animate object. Furthermore, contrary to Bell\u2019s contention, \u201canimate\u201d penetration is not limited to penetration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>by an animal because the statute specifically and separately addresses that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Finally, the statute does not require the Commonwealth to prove which objects are animate and which are inanimate. As the Commonwealth argues, the statute makes it a crime to sexually penetrate a complaining witness with \u201cany object.\u201d The statute prohibits inanimate or animate object sexual penetration. The statute thus addresses the universe of objects with which an accused may not sexually penetrate a complaining witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Finally, Bell argues that the evidence was insufficient to support any of his convictions. Bell\u2019s argument is based primarily on inconsistent reports of what Bell was wearing at the time, the fact that the victims were tired when they identified Bell and did so only after seeing their property at the police station and Bell in handcuffs, and hearing testimony that Terry\u2019s co-conspirator may have been named \u201cJames.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The credibility of witnesses and the weight accorded their testimony are matters solely for the trier of fact. <em>Barker v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 370, 373, 337 S.E.2d 729, 732 (1985). Here, the evidence was sufficient. Both Brooks and Stanley identified Bell as the assailant. Any inconsistency between the testimony and the initial description of the clothing worn by Bell and Terry was not substantial and, in any event, was considered by the jury. The co-conspirators were distinguished in terms of their build, clothing, and Terry\u2019s hair style. The jury also had the opportunity to evaluate Terry\u2019s videotaped interview, which was conducted on the morning of the arrest by the police, and to evaluate any inconsistencies between the statements he made then and his testimony at trial incriminating Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Finding no error in the decision of the trial court, Bell\u2019s convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\">. Bell does not challenge the admissibility of the victims\u2019 identification; he challenges only the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
