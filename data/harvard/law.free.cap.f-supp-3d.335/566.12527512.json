Plaintiff contends that the HYPE marks infringe on its HYP trademark, while Defendants claim that the marks are not confusingly similar and that, in any event, Plaintiff's trademark is invalid. Plaintiff seeks summary judgment on its federal trademark infringement claim. Defendants oppose and also seek summary judgment on Plaintiff's federal trademark, federal unfair competition and false designation of origin, and common law unfair competition claims. Additionally, Defendants move to exclude Plaintiff's expert report. Finally, both parties have moved to file certain documents under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons that follow, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is DENIED, Defendants' motions for summary judgment are GRANTED, and Defendants' motion to exclude Plaintiff's expert report is DENIED.

The parties filed their opposition motions on March 9, 2018. ECF No. 81 (\"Def Opp\"); ECF No. 82 (\"Pl Opp\"). Both parties filed their reply briefs on March 16, 2018.

On April 20, 2018, this Court denied the parties' motions without prejudice and granted them leave to file additional briefs articulating adequate justifications for sealing. ECF No. 94 (\"Sealing Order\"). Plaintiff accordingly filed a renewed motion on May 3, 2018. ECF No. 96 (\"Pl Renewed Seal Mot\").

Consumers will not encounter Hype socks in a retail store. Nor can they custom-order Hyp socks online. Plaintiff contends that similar Google search results for Hyp and Hype establish marketplace proximity. This is insufficient. First, Plaintiff did not establish that both products \"are frequently bought or researched on the Internet.\"\n   <em>\n    Eveready and Squirt\n   </em>\n   , 106 T.R. at 743. Indeed, Defendants contend that their socks cannot be purchased through a website. SMF \u00b6 59. Moreover, there is no evidence that customers would research Plaintiff's socks online. Second, even if there was Internet proximity, the survey would need to \"be selected to reflect the Internet environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Eveready and Squirt\n   </em>\n   , 106 T.R. at 744. Here, however, the survey addressed appearance in catalogs. Pittaoulis Report \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   To be sure, the products do not operate in wholly separate markets. They are both athletic socks. Presumably, for instance, some coaches who custom-order Hype socks for their team would also visit retail stores that carry Hyp socks. Yet considering all of the evidence, the Court concludes that Pittaoulis Report addressed an artificial marketplace as \"in the real world,\" the HYP and HYPE marks are not \"frequently encountered in physical or temporal proximity.\"\n   <em>\n    Eveready and Squirt\n   </em>\n   , 106 T.R. at 742 (emphasis added). Thus, a Squirt survey was inappropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Assuming that the products operate in marketplace proximity, however, the Court proceeds to analyze the rest of the survey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Leading Questions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Defendants contend that the survey posed overly-suggestive questions. For instance, Dr. Pittaoulis frequently presented only the affirmative position, such as \"Do you think these socks ... and any of the socks you saw in the first section of the survey are made or put out by the same company?\" Pittaoulis Report \u00b6 29. Defendants argue that a proper question would add the negative, inquiring, \"Do you think these socks ...\n   <em>\n    are from a separate company, or do you think any of the socks you saw in the first section of the survey\n   </em>\n   are made or put out by the same company\n   <em>\n    as the socks in the catalog\n   </em>\n   ?\" or even \"Do you think these socks ... and any of the socks you saw in the first section of the survey are made or put out by the same company\n   <em>\n    or not\n   </em>\n   ?\" Def Expert Mem at 7 &amp; n.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Plaintiff responds that the survey questions were standard, and that Dr. Pittaoulis properly chose not to add phrasing such as \"or not\" because it would have made the question \"cumbersome.\" Pl Expert Mem at 23; Pittaoulis Dep at 59:22-60:9, 110:3-10. However, the authority on which Dr. Pittaoulis relied supports including the negative phrasing to avoid leading questions, even though it \"is admittedly a mouthful and not the sort of question we would ask someone under normal circumstances.\" Def Expert Mem at 10 (citing \"Are Closed-Ended Questions Leading Questions?\" at 275\n   <em>\n    in Trademark and Deceptive Advertising Surveys\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Plaintiff attempts to differentiate the questions Dr. Pittaoulis posed from those deemed unduly suggestive because she did not ask respondents to solely compare Hyp and Hype. Instead, she also included distractor brands. However, as discussed below those distractor brands were improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff notes that Dr. Pittaoulis properly included \"don't know\" as an answer. Pl Expert Mem at 22;\n   <em>\n    see Swann, Likelihood of Confusion Studies and the Straitened Scope of Squirt\n   </em>\n   , 98 T.R. 739, 742 n.16 (2008). She additionally rotated answers and told respondents not to guess. Pl Expert Mem at 23;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pittaoulis Report \u00b6 22. Defendants question the value of adding \"don't know.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def Reply at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The Court determines that any issues regarding the phrasing of these questions \"are factored into the weight to be given to the evidence,\" not to its admissibility.\n   <em>\n    Cache, Inc. v. M.Z. Berger &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 99-cv-12320,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%2038283\">\n    2001 WL 38283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 16, 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Miscounting Responses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Defendants next argue that the survey improperly counted responses to open-ended questions as indicating confusion. They contend that 68 out of 200 answers reveal that respondents connected HYP and HYPE based on reasons unrelated to the similarity of the marks. For example, numerous answers related to the similarity of the socks, not of their source.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pittaoulis Report Ex. H (Respondent ID 214: \"Type that might be worn for sports\"; Respondent ID 424: \"They look like they have the same quality\"; Respondent ID 1130: \"THE STYLE\"). Still other answers were incomprehensible or unresponsive, such as \"a great deal\" (Respondent ID 355), \"superman\" (Respondent ID 1467), and \"one company makes smart sense\" (Respondent ID 2478).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%2038283\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that these open-ended questions constituted a \"qualitative check,\" not a \"control.\" Pl Expert Mem at 24. According to Dr. Pittaoulis, these answers \"are not relied upon in the confusion analysis\" since \"different respondents have different abilities to be articulate about why they made connections.\" Pittaoulis Dep at 95:17-24. She explained that \"[t]he control nets out all of the answers where people\n   made a connection for reasons like the style of the shoe or the style of the product.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 95:25-96:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   However, whether the survey also included separate controls is not the issue. As Defendants identify, the relevant issue is whether Plaintiff improperly counted as positive identifications of confusion answers that were \"unrelated to likelihood of confusion or similarity of branding.\" Def Reply at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Dr. Pittaoulis \"removed and replaced any respondents who [Pittaoulis] identified as providing nonsensical or gibberish answers to the open-ended questions.\" Pittaoulis Report \u00b6 34. It is unclear whether the aforementioned responses include those that were \"removed or replaced\" as gibberish. The record suggests that, while open-ended answers were \"not the basis\" for Dr. Pittaoulis' opinion, they were not excluded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pitttaoulis Dep at 96:10-13. To the extent that the Pittaoulis Report counts answers that are nonresponsive or highlight the socks' similarity rather than the trademarks' similarity, the results are less credible. However, this goes to weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Improper \"Distractors\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Defendants challenge the choices for the \"distractor\" brands in the survey. Dr. Pittaoulis stated that she \"included Bioworld because the socks included licensed superhero characters, similar to the HYP socks shown in the survey, one of which included the Superman logo.\" Pittaoulis Report \u00b6 45. She \"included Stance because, like HYPE Socks, the socks included team names.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, she \"included Reebok because the style of socks appeared similar to the HYPE Socks shown in the catalog.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She did not recall \"coming across any other team socks that started with an H.\" Pittaoulis Dep at 29:8-10. Defendants charge that those brands are ineffective as they \"look and sound nothing like HYPE.\" Def Expert Mem at 15. They contend that that Dr. Pittaoulis should have created fictitious brands, as she did with \"HIVE\" in the control survey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Additionally, Defendants note that the net confusion rate with REEBOK (7.9%) was nearly as high as that for HYP (12%). Def Expert Mem at 14-15. Plaintiff simply responds that \"Dr. Pittaoulis's determination is driven by analysis and data.\" Pl Expert Opp at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The Court agrees that the \"distractor\" names are markedly different from Hyp, which could lead to artificially high rates of association. Further, the relatively high confusion rate with Reebok counts against the survey's reliability. However, these questions again go to weight, not admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    v. Control Group\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Defendants raise two issues with the control group. First, Defendants note that the test group (exposed to HYPE) and the control group (exposed to the fictional brand \"HIVE\") were not equally exposed to the respective marks. Indeed, the HYPE catalog showed the HYPE brand name thirteen more times than the fictional HIVE catalog. Pittaoulis Dep. at 43:22-46:1. Determining that it was \"not material,\" Dr. Pittaoulis did not account for this differential exposure in her analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Second, Defendants cite the high rate of \"noise\"- control group confusion due to guessing or survey suggestively. Swann has expressed concern with control group \"noise\" levels above 25%. Swann,\n   <em>\n    Likelihood of Confusion\n   </em>\n   at 71. Here, the control group \"noise\" was 38%. Pittaoulis Report \u00b6 9. However, the Court notes that Dr. Pittaoulis filtered out the control group when determining the net confusion rate.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   The survey contains numerous methodological errors. However, the Court cannot\n   say that it is \"so flawed in methodology that its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect\" such that it is \"devoid of all probative value on the issue of the likelihood of confusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Cache\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%2038283\">\n    2001 WL 38283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-11. Accordingly, the Court has considered the survey as some evidence of actual confusion while factoring in its methodological flaws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Sealing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Finally, the Court addresses the parties' motions to seal briefing in this matter. The Court has reviewed Plaintiff's renewed motion to seal, which includes Defendants' position with respect to its customer list. For the reasons articulated in the Court's Order of April 20, 2018 (ECF No. 94), the parties' motions to seal portions of their summary judgment memoranda and Statement of Material Facts are DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Plaintiff's exhibits 25-27, which contain Defendants' customer lists and other identifying information for its customers, present a closer call. Such documents \"fall[ ] into categories commonly sealed[:] those containing trade secrets, confidential research and development information, marketing plans, revenue information, pricing information, and the like.\"\n   <em>\n    Saint-Jean v.
