Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   When Members of Congress sue the President in federal court over official action,\n   a court must first determine whether the dispute is a \"Case\" or \"Controversy\" under Article III of the United States Constitution, rather than a political dispute between the elected branches of government. A critical part of this inquiry is whether the plaintiffs have legal standing to bring the action. Whether legislators have standing to sue often turns on whether they can obtain the remedy they seek from the court from fellow legislators. When a legislative remedy is available, courts generally dismiss the case on jurisdictional grounds. The Supreme Court, however, has not foreclosed federal courts from appropriately exercising jurisdiction over certain types of disputes between the political branches. This case is one of those disputes. And when a case is properly before a court because it presents an Article III \"Case\" or \"Controversy,\" it is the role of the Judiciary \"to say what the law is.\"\n   <em>\n    Marbury v.

Trump in his official capacity as President of the United States (\"the President\") is violating the Foreign Emoluments Clause (\"Clause\"). Under this Clause, certain federal officials, including the President, may not \"accept\" an \"emolument\" from \"any King, Prince or foreign State\" without \"the Consent of Congress.\" U.S Const. art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 8. In Count I, plaintiffs seek declaratory relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in the form of a declaratory judgment stating that the President is violating the Clause when he accepts emoluments from foreign states without first seeking the consent of Congress. Am. Compl., ECF No. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 85-86. In Count II, plaintiffs seek injunctive relief pursuant to the Court's inherent authority to grant equitable relief and pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in the form of a Court order enjoining the President from accepting \"any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever\" from a foreign state without obtaining \"the Consent of Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    \u00b6 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pending before the Court is the President's motion to dismiss. The President argues that this case should be dismissed on four independent grounds,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the threshold question is whether plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims. This opinion addresses only this threshold question. With respect to the grounds for dismissal that turn on the merits, the parties dispute whether the profits that the President's business interests earn from foreign governments are covered \"emoluments.\" However, for the purpose of determining whether plaintiffs have standing to sue, the Court must accept as true the allegations that the President has accepted prohibited foreign emoluments without seeking the consent of Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As is explained more fully below, the central question for standing purposes is how to characterize the injury that occurs when the President fails to seek the consent of Congress, as required by the Clause. Plaintiffs argue that each Member of Congress suffers a particularized and concrete injury when his or her vote is nullified by the President's denial of the opportunity to vote on the record about whether to approve his acceptance of a prohibited foreign emolument. The President argues that this is an intra-branch\n   dispute which does not belong in federal court because the plaintiffs' remedy is to convince a majority of their colleagues in both Houses to pass legislation addressing the President's ability to accept prohibited foreign emoluments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Upon careful consideration of the President's motion to dismiss, the opposition and reply thereto, the relevant arguments of\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the parties' arguments at the June 7, 2018 motion hearing, and for the reasons explained below, the Court finds that the plaintiffs have standing to sue the President for allegedly violating the Foreign Emoluments Clause. The Court therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   the motion to dismiss and\n   <strong>\n    DEFERS\n   </strong>\n   ruling on the remaining arguments in the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Finally, legislation would neither prevent the President from accepting future prohibited foreign emoluments, nor force him to return those he has already accepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Furthermore, and in contrast to the situation in\n   <em>\n    Chenoweth\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   , Congress' appropriations power cannot be used to obtain a legislative remedy, such as refusing to appropriate funds for an Executive Branch program or for participation in a war, because there are no federal appropriations associated with the President's receipt of prohibited foreign emoluments. This is another aspect of the Clause that makes it unusual. The President suggests that among plaintiffs' legislative remedies is the use of Congress' appropriations power to retaliate against him for his alleged acceptance of prohibited foreign emoluments by \"tak[ing] action on matters not directly related to emoluments.\" Reply, ECF No. 28 at 18.

That no plaintiff would have standing to challenge the President's alleged violation of the Clause is certainly consistent with the President's argument that \"when an official fails to first seek congressional consent before accepting emoluments prohibited by the Foreign Emoluments Clause, it only means that the official has violated the Clause, not that each Member of Congress automatically acquires a judicially cognizable personal stake to challenge the violation.\" Def.'s Suppl. Br., ECF No. 51 at 11. The faulty premise underlying the President's argument, however, is that there is a legislative remedy for violating the Clause.

However, that challenge seeks to remedy entirely different injuries: The District of Columbia alleges injuries to its quasi-sovereign interest and its proprietary interest, and the State of Maryland alleges injuries to its sovereign interests, quasi-sovereign interest and its proprietary interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.

The Court disagrees. Again, the President has misstated the alleged injury. Moreover, this matter is before the Court on a motion to dismiss and the Court must take as true the facts that are alleged in the complaint. Plaintiffs' well-pleaded complaint alleges that the President has accepted prohibited foreign emoluments without first seeking the consent of Congress. Am. Compl., ECF No. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. The alleged injury is therefore directly traceable to the President's alleged failure to seek Congressional consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief in the form of a declaratory judgment stating that the President is violating the Clause when he accepts emoluments from foreign states without first seeking the consent of Congress, and injunctive relief in the form of an order from the Court enjoining the President from accepting \"any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever\" from a foreign state without obtaining \"the Consent of Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340114\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/737/#p752\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 84-92.

Whether injunctive relief is available here is a merits determination that the Court need not reach at this juncture, and the Court cannot assume, for the purposes of determining whether plaintiffs have standing, that injunctive relief would be unconstitutional. Because the President's alleged violation of the Clause could be redressed by the declaratory and injunctive relief sought, plaintiffs have satisfied the redressability component of the standing inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
