For the reasons detailed below, the Court will GRANT Ocwen's Motion to Exclude the Expert Report of Jeffrey Hansen [54]. The Court will GRANT Ocwen's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Keyes's TCPA claims [56], and will DENY Keyes's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment regarding her TCPA claims [52]. Because no federal claims will survive Ocwen's motion for partial summary judgment, the Court will decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Keyes's remaining state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Therefore, the Court will not consider Hansen's report in resolving the cross-motions for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Additionally, the Court will grant Ocwen's motion for partial summary judgment as to the TCPA claims and will therefore deny Keyes's motion for partial summary judgment on her TCPA claims. Dkt. Nos. 52, 56. Based on that holding, only Keyes's state law claims are left in this case. The Court will decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over these state law claims, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court will first analyze Ocwen's motion to exclude and will then turn to the merits of this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A. Motion to Exclude Expert Report of Jeffrey Hansen [54]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ocwen makes two arguments for why the Court should exclude Hansen's report. It first claims that Hansen's report lacks the proper factual basis required by Federal Rule of Evidence 702(b). Second, it claims that Hansen's statements of law and methodology are not reliable as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 702(c). Both of these arguments have merit, and thus, the Court will grant Ocwen's motion to exclude Hansen's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   1. Hansen's Report Lacks a Proper Factual Basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ocwen's first argues that Hansen's report lacks a proper factual basis because he has merely reviewed manuals and run tests on his computer, and he has not inspected the actual Aspect System which Ocwen uses to make calls. Dkt. No. 54, p. 10 (Pg. ID 963). The Court agrees, as a wealth of authority supports Ocwen's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ocwen persuasively references two cases where courts excluded expert testimony because experts did not test the software in question, and a third case where a court excluded Hansen's report because his report would not have assisted a jury in reaching a verdict.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 10-11 (Pg.

Fla. May 2, 2014), the court excluded an expert's testimony because he had based his report on a handbook rather than his personal inspection of the defendant's systems. Second, a court excluded Hansen's testimony as Hansen did not personally test or use the defendant's software.\n   <em>\n    Mohamed v. Am. Motor Co., Ltd. Liab.

The Sixth Circuit also excluded expert testimony where, without testing the lap belt at issue, an expert concluded that the lap belt was in working condition.\n   <em>\n    Smelser v. Norfolk S.

Keyes asserts, however, that Hansen has \"analyzed the Aspect UIP predictive dialer in other matters numerous times over the last 10 years.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt.

Specifically, Keyes highlights two cases in which Hansen supposedly analyzed the Aspect System that Ocwen used,\n   <em>\n    Mashiri v.

Ill. Apr. 27, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   But Keyes's reliance on those cases is misplaced. Hansen did not inspect or test Ocwen's Aspect System in those matters. Dkt. No. 81, p. 5 (Pg. ID 5068). In\n   <em>\n    Mashiri\n   </em>\n   , Hansen reviewed an amended declaration and an FCC order, as well as discovery responses and manuals. Dkt. No. 81-1, p. 4 (Pg. ID 5078). And he reviewed general documents, manuals, and deposition records in\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   . Dkt. No. 81-2, p. 5 (Pg. ID 5108-09).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Hansen's report lacks an adequate factual basis because, like the experts whose testimony was excluded in the cases noted above, Hansen has not tested the relevant equipment. Indeed, in drafting his report, Hansen simply reviewed documents and manuals regarding (1) predictive dialers and automatic telephone dialing systems (\"ATDSs\"), and (2) the Aspect System generally. Dkt. No. 54-1, p. 1 (Pg. ID 979). As such, Hansen did not test his theory regarding how Ocwen places calls through Aspect, as required by\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   . And his involvement and analysis of an Aspect system in other litigations does not establish that testability exists here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

Fla. Mar. 22, 2016). As a result, Hansen's report is \"unsupported speculation\" and a \"mere guess\" regarding how Ocwen uses the Aspect System.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Scrap Metal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566796\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/517/#p529\">\n    527 F.3d at 520-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . His report, then, is insufficient under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   . There is \"simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proferred\" by Hansen, making his report simply the \"\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   \" of an expert.\n   <em>\n    Joiner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n    522 U.S. at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n    118 S.Ct. 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   2. Hansen's Improper Statements of Law and Methodology\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ocwen's second key argument is that Hansen's statements of law and methodology are improper. Dkt. No. 54, p. 12 (Pg. ID 965). According to Ocwen, Hansen relied on vacated FCC orders when he concluded that Ocwen's Aspect System is an ATDS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In support, Ocwen cites\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2018). There, the court set aside the FCC's \"expansive\" interpretation of an ATDS, an interpretation which the FCC determined to include equipment that can generate random or sequential phone numbers and dial them, and equipment without that ability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    at 702-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Ocwen claims that Hansen's conclusion-that the Aspect System is an ATDS because it is a predictive dialer-is wrong as Ocwen's agents only call numbers saved in the Aspect System. Dkt. No. 54, at p. 13 (Pg. ID 966). Second, Ocwen argues that Hansen used different and inconsistent terminology\n   when defining or describing an ATDS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 12 (Pg. ID 965).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Ocwen is correct that Hansen's statements of law are improper; however, they are improper not because they inaccurately state the law, but because expert witnesses are not permitted to make legal conclusions.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Melcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12391713\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/672/547/#p552\">\n    672 F. App'x 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 552 (6th Cir. 2016). An expert makes a legal conclusion when \"he defines the governing legal standard or applies the standard to the facts of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12391713\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/672/547/#p552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). Hansen has not only defined the governing legal standard by providing an extensive history and explanation of what constitutes an ATDS under the TCPA and the Commission's guidance, but he has also impermissibly applied that standard to the facts of this case by concluding that Ocwen's Aspect System is an \"ATDS as contemplated by the TCPA and clarified by the FCC[.]\" Dkt. No. 54-1, p. 18 (Pg. ID 986). Thus, the Court will grant Ocwen's Motion to Exclude Hansen's Report because Hansen impermissibly constructed legal standards and made legal conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In sum, Hansen failed to test his expert theory by inspecting or testing the Aspect System with the specifications used by Ocwen. His testimony, then, is based on insufficient facts or data. Hansen's report also wrongly includes statements and conclusions of law. Therefore, the Court will grant Ocwen's Motion to Exclude the Report of Jeffrey Hansen. Dkt. No. 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   B. Parties' Cross-Motions for Partial Summary Judgment [52, 56]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Ocwen will succeed on its motion for partial summary judgment as to Keyes's TCPA claims. The Court will accordingly deny Keyes's motion for partial summary judgment as to her TCPA claims. Keyes is also not entitled to summary judgment on her MRCPA claims, as the Court will not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   1. TCPA Claims (Counts I and II)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The TCPA defines an ATDS as \"equipment which has the capacity-(A) to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator; and (B) to dial such numbers.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). As the\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   court explained, this definition has two key components: an equipment's \"capacity\" and its functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   a) Applicable Legal Standard\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The capacity and functions of an ATDS were the subject of a 2015 FCC ruling, in which the Commission attempted to clarify previous declarations regarding these definitions.\n   <em>\n    In re Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. 7961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) [hereinafter \" 2015 Declaratory Ruling\"]. The\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   opinion addressed whether the Commission's guidance in the 2015 Declaratory Ruling was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   And in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit set aside the Commission's declarations regarding the capacity and functions of an ATDS. The court determined that those declarations gave conflicting advice and, in other respects, exacerbated confusion emanating from earlier FCC orders. For example, in the\n   2015 Declaratory Ruling, the Commission concluded \"that the 'capacity' of calling equipment 'includes its potential functionalities' or 'future possibility,' not just its 'present ability.' \"\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting 2015 Declaratory Ruling at 7974 \u00b6 16 ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7975 \u00b6 20). That definition was unreasonable and too expansive, the D.C. Circuit held, because the definition of an autodialer would then capture smartphones, devices which almost 80% of American adults owned in 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    at 697-700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Because Congress did not intend for the definition of an autodialer to have such a wide reach, the\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   court vacated the Commission's definition of the capacity of an autodialer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The D.C. Circuit also set aside the Commission's rulings regarding the functions an autodialer must be able to perform, namely its interpretation of whether a device needed to be able to generate and call random or sequential numbers to constitute an ATDS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The court reasoned that \"[w]hile the 2015 ruling indicates in certain places that a device must be able to generate and dial random or sequential numbers to meet the TCPA's definition of an autodialer, it also suggests a competing view: that equipment can meet the statutory definition even if it lacks that capacity.\"\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the court vacated the Commission's definition of the functions necessary for a device to constitute an autodialer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Turning to Keyes's reading of\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   , she first argues that\n   <em>\n    ACAInternational\n   </em>\n   has no impact on 2003, 2008, and 2012 advice from the Commission regarding the capacity and functions of an ATDS discussed in FCC Orders because that advice was not timely challenged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n    18 FCC Rcd. 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,014 (2003) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20FCC%20Rcd%20559\">\n    23 FCC Rcd. 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the Tel.

First, Keyes's timeliness argument is unconvincing because the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals explicitly rejected it in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   . The court determined that \"[w]hile the Commission's [2015] ruling purports to reaffirm the prior orders, that does not shield the agency's pertinent pronouncements from review. The agency's prior rulings left significant uncertainty about the precise functions an autodialer must have the capacity to perform.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Petitioners covered their bases,\" the court added, \"by filing petitions for both a declaratory ruling and a rulemaking concerning that issue and related ones.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, courts applying\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   have noted that the pre-2015 guidance, to the extent it was reaffirmed in the 2015 Declaratory Ruling, no longer warrants judicial deference.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201567852\">\n    2018 WL 1567852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-12 (noting that \"[p]laintiff cannot rely on the FCC's definition of an ATDS to the extent it includes systems that cannot be programmed to dial random or sequential numbers, as is the case with some predictive dialers.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Second,\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   is binding on this Court in so far as it vacated the Commission's interpretations regarding the capacity and functions of an autodialer.

This approach bears out the Hobbs Act, which grants federal appellate courts (except for the Federal Circuit) \"exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in part), or to determine the validity of-all final orders of the Federal Communications Commission made reviewable by section 402(a) of title 47[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202342\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). Thus, to resolve the pending partial summary judgment motions, the Court need not defer to the Commission's declarations regarding the capacity and functions of an ATDS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   b) Merits of Keyes's TCPA Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Turning now to the substance of Keyes's TCPA claims, the Court must reach back to the statutory language of an ATDS.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517448\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/116/\">\n    894 F.3d at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that the\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   court \"invalidated [the 2015 Declaratory Ruling ] and thereby removed any deference we might owe to the views the FCC expressed in it\"). The Act provides that an ATDS must \"ha[ve] the capacity-(A) to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator; and (B) to dial such numbers.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (1) Capacity of the Aspect System\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As to the capacity a device must have to constitute an ATDS, the Second and Third Circuits have concluded that the statutory language mandates the following examination: \"how much is required to enable the device to function as an autodialer: does it require the simple flipping of a switch, or does it require essentially a top-to-bottom reconstruction of the equipment?\"\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   696 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517448\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/116/\">\n    894 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   478-79 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dominguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517448\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/116/\">\n    894 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   120 &amp; n.3. The former would constitute an ATDS, whereas the latter would not. The Court finds these courts' approach and reasoning persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Here, Ocwen has demonstrated as a matter of law that the Aspect System which it used to call Keyes requires more than a flip of the switch to qualify as an autodialer. Indeed, to modify the Aspect System, Ocwen would need to alter the system's source code, and it does not have access to that code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   This case is therefore similar to\n   <em>\n    Herrick v. GoDaddy.com LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525434\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/312/792/\">\n    312 F.Supp.3d 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Ariz. 2018). There, the court concluded that \"simply press[ing] a button\" would not enable the device to have the functions of an ATDS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525434\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/312/792/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 800 (citing\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   695 ). The\n   <em>\n    Herrick\n   </em>\n   court reached this conclusion because of testimony from the CEO of the company which produced the relevant device. Specifically, the CEO testified that he would need to approve the defendant's modification of the device.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The same is true here; Ocwen\n   does not own the source code and therefore would need external approval to effect the necessary modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   What is more, Keyes's counter-argument only confirms this conclusion. The Aspect System operates on Linux and Windows, and that fact is the sole basis for her claim that the system has the capacity to function as an ATDS. Dkt. No. 80, p. 26 (Pg. ID 4967). But, the logical extension of Keyes's assertion is that every device operating on Linux or Windows has the capacity to be an autodialer. This far-reaching contention is nearly identical to the key corollary rejected in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   : that the Commission's definition of \"present capacity\" was unlawful because it would capture smartphones that, through simply downloading an app, would gain the necessary functions of an ATDS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dominguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517448\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/116/\">\n    894 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   120 &amp; n.3. Accordingly, all reasonable persons would conclude that the Aspect System does not have the capacity to function as an ATDS. Ocwen is therefore entitled to succeed on its partial summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (2) Functions of the Aspect System\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Ocwen will prevail here on yet another basis: the Aspect System does not possess the functions necessary to be an ATDS. The Aspect System dials from a set list, but that is not the same as dialing numbers using a random or sequential number generator. And FCC advice was unclear as to whether generating random or sequential numbers and dialing them was a necessary function of an ATDS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at 702-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The D.C. Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [s]o which is it: does a device qualify as an ATDS only if it can generate random or sequential numbers to be dialed, or can it so qualify even if it lacks that capacity? ... It might be permissible for the Commission to adopt either interpretation. But the Commission cannot, consistent with reasoned decisionmaking, espouse both competing interpretations in the same order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The better reading of the Act, this Court will conclude, is that devices must be able to generate random or sequential numbers to be dialed to qualify as an ATDS. This approach tracks the statutory language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   All agree that the Aspect System dials numbers from a set list. The parties further agree that the system does not produce or store numbers using a random or sequential number generator, and call those numbers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 80, pp. 5, 24 (Pg. ID 4946, 4965);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 56, p. 20 (Pg. ID 1044). And, as described above, Ocwen does not have the capacity to effect this change in the Aspect System. Thus, the Aspect System-as Keyes has described it-is not an ATDS because it lacks the necessary functionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, Keyes vigorously maintains that the Aspect System has the required functions of an ATDS and relies on\n   <em>\n    Espejo v. Santander Consumer USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Case Nos.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20Cow.%208987\">\n    11 C 8987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206037625\">\n    2016 WL 6037625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Pa. Oct. 14, 2016). That case is not instructive,\n   however. The\n   <em>\n    Espejo\n   </em>\n   court evaluated an Aspect system, but Keyes offers no evidence that this is the same system which Ocwen used to call Keyes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Second, although the\n   <em>\n    Espejo\n   </em>\n   court concluded that the Aspect system there was an ATDS, it did so applying the now-vacated FCC guidance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5. Notably, it determined that the Aspect system in that case was an ATDS \"regardless of whether the numbers called are randomly or sequentially generated or come from calling lists.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis omitted) (quoting 2012 Order at 15932 n.5 ).\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   , however, directly set aside that conclusion, noting that the Commission's conflicting guidance on that subject \"falls short of reasoned decisionmaking in 'offer[ing] no meaningful guidance' to affected parties in material respects on whether their equipment is subject to the statute's autodialer restrictions.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    U.S. Postal Serv. v.

Cir. 2015) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   And this Court has reasoned that a device must be able to call and generate numbers randomly or sequentially to qualify as an ATDS. Put another way, simply calling from a set list is not enough for equipment to constitute an autodialer. Accordingly, Keyes's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Espejo\n   </em>\n   is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Aspect System is not an ATDS as a matter of law. Ocwen, then, will prevail on its motion for partial summary judgment. Because the Court concludes that no reasonable person could find that the Aspect System is an ATDS, Ocwen is entitled to summary judgment on Keyes's TCPA claims, Counts I and II.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   C. MRCPA Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As Keyes's TCPA claims will not survive Ocwen's motion for partial summary judgment, no federal claims remain in this litigation. Consequently, the Court will decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the MRCPA claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In this Opinion and Order, the Court was charged with resolving three motions. First, Ocwen moved to exclude the expert report of Jeffrey Hansen. Dkt. No. 54. Second and third, both parties filed motions for partial summary judgment. Dkt. Nos. 52, 56. In light of the foregoing, the Court will GRANT Ocwen's Motion to Exclude the Expert Report of Jeffrey Hansen [54]. The Court will also GRANT Ocwen's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment regarding the TCPA claims [56] and DENY Keyes's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to those claims [52].
