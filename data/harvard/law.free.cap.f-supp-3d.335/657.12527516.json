These plates look similar to large rubber stamps and are \"used to print color images of flexible labels and packaging for hundreds of everyday items, including potato chip bags, frozen vegetable bags, milk cartons, candy bar wrappers, and cereal boxes.\" DuPont offers a line of both digital and analog flexographic printing plates suitable for thermal development, as well as corresponding thermal development processing equipment under the trade name Cyrel\u00ae FAST.

On April 26, 2007, the Opposition Division of the EPO revoked the EP '121 Patent for insufficient disclosure. The Board of Appeals of the EPO set aside this decision on July 23, 2010 and referred it back to the Opposition Division. On February 1, 2017, the Opposition Division rejected DuPont's request that it revoke the reinstated EP '121 Patent. DuPont appealed this rejection on April 19, 2017 and was still waiting for a decision when it filed the Amended Complaint in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) DuPont notified me by correspondence on June 1, 2018 that it had withdrawn its appeal in the EPO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In or about 2005, \"AGFA,\" through the Belgian Subsidiary, informed DuPont of its position that some of DuPont's Cyrel\u00ae FAST flexographic printing plates and corresponding equipment infringed the EP '121 Patent in Europe and the '759 Patent in the United States. DuPont responded that the EP '121 Patent was invalid. DuPont and \"AGFA\" subsequently began negotiating for a license or sale of the '121 Patent and related patents, however, no agreement was reached and the parties suspended negotiations until the EP '121 Patent appeal was resolved before the EPO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   DuPont alleges that beginning in 2011, DuPont and \"AGFA,\" through the Delaware Subsidiary, entered into an initial distribution and marketing agreement (\"the US Agreement\"), which was last renewed and signed in 2016. According to DuPont, the US Agreement authorized \"AGFA\" as a marketer and distributor in the United States for certain DuPont Cyrel\u00ae flexographic plates and equipment. Pursuant to this agreement, \"AGFA\" agreed to promote, sell, and provide customer service for Cyrel\u00ae products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   DuPont contends that pursuant to the US Agreement, to facilitate the promotion, marketing, distribution, and related support for DuPont's Cyrel\u00ae products, DuPont authorized \"AGFA\" to provide DuPont's written, recorded, and/or digitally\n   available materials to \"AGFA's\" contractually assigned Cyrel\u00ae customers and potential customers, under the following terms and conditions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   AGFA shall use information regarding the PRODUCTS provided by DuPont, including without limitation promotional and technical literature solely for purposes of performing its obligations hereunder, including but not limited to developing its marketing programs for the Products. AGFA shall make no claims, warranties, statements or representations with respect to the Products other than those set forth in product literature that is provided by DuPont.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   These materials included: all customer and authorized distributor accessible Cyrel\u00ae sales, marketing, promotional, technical, instructional, safety, product and process information; documents and/or presentations; documents titled \"DuPont Cyrel DFR Data Sheet,\" which is the subject of U.S. Copyright Registration No. TX0008429562, and \"DuPont Cyrel Fast Presentation,\" which is the subject of U.S. Copyright Registration No. TX0008427628; and \"other copyright-protected all-rights-reserved materials\" from the DuPont website.

Pitman Company (\"Pitman\") by which Pitman became a distributor of DuPont's plates. According to DuPont, \"AGFA\" purchased Pitman in 2010 and was assigned the distribution agreement as a result of its purchase of Pitman. (Pl.'s Resp. at 4.) Defendants contest this allegation, arguing it was the Delaware Subsidiary that acquired Pitman's assets in 2010, the Delaware Subsidiary that was transferred Pitman's distribution agreement with DuPont, and the Delaware Subsidiary that distributed DuPont's plates in the United States pursuant to the US Agreement. (Defs.' Mot. at 1, 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   DuPont alleges that on July 4, 2017, \"AGFA,\" through the Belgian Subsidiary, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DuPont in Regional Court in Dusseldorf, Germany. The complaint in Germany asserts that DuPont's Cyrel\u00ae FAST DFR plates infringe the German Patent. The crux of the current dispute and focus of DuPont's injunction request is that the German complaint and written evidence \"rel[y] heavily on AGFA's unauthorized reproduction, distribution, and use of DuPont's copyright-protected and other all-rights reserved publications, technical and promotional literature, product-labels and plate-products.\" (Am.

Importantly, I note that none of these theories allege that either the Parent or Belgian Subsidiary directly availed itself of this jurisdiction. DuPont first argues that personal jurisdiction is established because the Parent and Belgian Subsidiary are bound by the US Agreement entered into by their \"agent and subsidiary\"-that is, the Delaware Subsidiary-through their involvement in the US Agreement. Second, DuPont asserts that the Parent and Belgian Subsidiary \"dominate and control\" the Delaware Subsidiary and are therefore subject to personal jurisdiction based on the actions of the Delaware Subsidiary. Finally, DuPont contends that \"AGFA\" ignores corporate formalities and I should pierce the corporate veil to find that the Parent and Belgian Subsidiary are subject to jurisdiction.

Gunther Mertens, who was previously CFO of the Delaware Subsidiary, acknowledged at his deposition that the Parent and its subsidiaries,\n   including the Belgian Subsidiary and the Delaware Subsidiary, have consolidated financial statements. Mr. Mertens explained that there were global financial reporting obligations, and his financial reports to the vice president of finance and administration were consolidated \"for reporting to investors, and the stock market, and so on.\" (Defs.' Reply, Ex. 1, 90:1-18.) But, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Wesley-Jessen\n   </em>\n   , DuPont has not submitted any other evidence demonstrating that the business strategies and financial statements of the Belgian Subsidiary and Delaware Subsidiary were consolidated so that the subsidiaries could operate as one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   DuPont next stresses that officers of the Delaware Subsidiary report to executives of the \"European Defendants,\" there are \"solid reporting lines\" from the President of the Delaware Subsidiary to the President of the Belgian Subsidiary to the CEO of the Parent, and there are \"solid reporting lines\" from the Delaware Subsidiary's CFO and Head of Operations \"up through\" the Belgian Subsidiary. But these assertions are mere conclusions, based almost entirely on organizational charts. (Pl.'s Resp., Exs. 27; 20; 75; 28; 19; 76; 77.) The simple fact that there are lines on a chart connecting various persons does not make the requisite showing that officers at the Delaware Subsidiary were actually reporting to officers at the Belgian Subsidiary such that I can conclude that the Belgian Subsidiary officers were directing the Delaware Subsidiary's business. Significantly, these charts do not in any way indicate that the reporting to Mr. Stefaan Vanhooren (President of the Belgian Subsidiary) or Mr. Ronald Dockx (CFO of the Belgian Subsidiary) was done through their roles for the Belgian Subsidiary. Rather, it appears that the reporting was in their capacity for the Graphics business group and/or on the GMC. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7848344\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/863/186/#p189\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7848344\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/863/186/#p189\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Ex. 28.) The only other document DuPont references is an email where Mr. Mertens (who was the President of the Delaware Subsidiary) referred to Mr. Vanhooren as his \"boss.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 78.) Importantly, in the email, Mr. Mertens introduces himself to a person at DuPont as \"the Regional President of Agfa Graphics in North America\" and then states that Mr. Vanhooren is based at \"our HQ in Belgium.\" The context of the email suggests that Mr. Mertens was referring to Mr. Vanhooren's role for the Graphics business group and/or the GMC, and not in his role as President of the Belgian Subsidiary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   DuPont also alleges that the Parent instituted a policy \"that the ultimate parent of each of its businesses owns and manages\" all of the intellectual property, and that the Delaware Subsidiary assigned ownership of its Pitman trademarks to the Belgian Subsidiary. In support, DuPont cites to the \"Assignment and Assumption\n   Agreement,\" whereby the Delaware Subsidiary assigned the Pitman trademarks to the Belgian Subsidiary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 95.) Although the agreement refers to \"Agfa Graphics NV\" (the Belgian Subsidiary) as an ultimate parent of its business, it also clearly states that the Parent is the \"ultimate parent\" of both the Belgian Subsidiary and the Delaware Subsidiary. (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7848344\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/863/186/#p189\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7848344\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/863/186/#p189\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Ex. 7 at AGFA0121.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   DuPont also points to a document titled \"Global Policy on Ownership and Sharing of Intellectual Property Rights within the Agfa Group,\" which states that \"[a]ll IP produced by a department of the Graphics [business group] is owned by [the Belgian Subsidiary].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 85.)

While the Belgian Subsidiary coordinates the activities of other graphics subsidiaries, importantly, it does not do so with the Delaware Subsidiary, which remains a direct subsidiary of the Parent. (Defs.' Reply, Ex. 17.) Additionally, although Mr. Vanhooren is the President of the Belgian Subsidiary, he is also President of the Graphics business group, chair of the GMC, and chairman of the Delaware Subsidiary's board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   DuPont has not presented sufficient facts tying the business of the Belgian Subsidiary and the business of the Delaware Subsidiary together such that personal jurisdiction is established over the Belgian Subsidiary. The Belgian Subsidiary and the Delaware Subsidiary did not have an indemnity agreement between them or manufacture one another's products like the subsidiaries in\n   <em>\n    Wesley-Jessen\n   </em>\n   . The Belgian Subsidiary operates in Belgium and is involved in research and development related to the graphics industry, negotiation of raw materials contracts, and manufacturing equipment, among other things. The Delaware Subsidiary, on the other hand, manufactures, markets, and sells its own products out of its principal place of business in Elmwood, New Jersey, and sometimes resells products manufactured by other parties in the printing and publishing industries in the United States. (Defs.' Mot., Santomassimo Decl., Doc. No. 60, at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 14, 24.) While the Belgian Subsidiary does coordinate the activities of other graphics subsidiaries, it notably does not do so with the Delaware Subsidiary, which remains a direct subsidiary of the Parent and maintains its own manufacturing plant unlike some of the other subsidiaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defs.'

Rather, those opinions addressed whether a parent can be liable on a contract entered into by its subsidiary. I decline to follow the\n   <em>\n    American Eagle Outfitters\n   </em>\n   court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Publicker\n   </em>\n   to establish personal jurisdiction over the Parent.

Theory 2\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   DuPont next argues that the Parent \"dominates and controls\" the Delaware Subsidiary and is therefore subject to personal jurisdiction based on the actions of the Delaware Subsidiary. Of the facts relied upon by DuPont and listed above in my discussion of DuPont's second theory as to the Belgian Subsidiary (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   page 671), those that appear to be relevant to the Parent are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   - \"AGFA\" holds itself out as a globally integrated company;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   - Pitman was purchased to increase the presence of the global Agfa Graphics business in the United States and to \"become the strongest general distributor in the US Printing industry\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   - The Parent and its subsidiaries, including the Belgian Subsidiary and the Delaware Subsidiary, have consolidated financial statements;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   - \"Agfa is commercially active worldwide through wholly owned sales organizations in more than 40 countries,\" and the Delaware Subsidiary is referred to as the \"Sales Office\" for the global Graphics business group;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   - \"Agfa Graphics revenue increase mainly comes from the USA and emerging countries\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   - Officers of the Delaware Subsidiary report to executives of the \"European Defendants\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   - \"The Foreign Defendants\" hold \"AGFA's\" monetary assets, such that the Delaware Subsidiary needs permission to make withdrawals;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   - There are \"solid reporting lines\" from the President of the Delaware Subsidiary to the President of the Belgian Subsidiary to the CEO of the Parent; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   - The \"Foreign Defendants\" dominate the Delaware Subsidiary decision making through consideration of business in the United States by the global GMC and by direct communication with the Delaware Subsidiary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As stated above, in determining whether an agency relationship exists such that a parent corporation dominates and controls its subsidiary, Delaware courts consider the following factors: \"[1] the extent of overlap of officers and directors, [2] methods of financing, [3] the division of responsibility for day-to-day management, and [4] the process by which each corporation obtains its business.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rovi Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204534641\">\n    2013 WL 4534641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Applied Biosystems, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719589\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/772/1458/#p1463\">\n    772 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1463 ). The fact that \"a parent and a subsidiary have common officers and directors [does not] necessarily indicate an[ ] agency relationship,\" and \"[t]he fact that a parent corporation finances the operations of a subsidiary is not sufficient to support a finding that the subsidiary is a mere agent or instrumentality of the parent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   n. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Turning to the first factor, the only overlap in officers and directors appears to be that Mr. Vanhooren and Kris Hoornaert were on the ExCo and the Delaware Subsidiary's board of directors. Importantly, the ExCo-the executive management team for the Parent-is distinct from the Parent's Board of Directors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp., Ex. 8 at AGFA5725.) Additionally, Delaware courts have held \"such a tenuous connection\" to be \"minor overlap\" and \"not dispositive for finding agency.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nespresso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265988\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/498/#p502\">\n    263 F.Supp.3d at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Regarding the second factor-financing-DuPont asserts that the Parent and its subsidiaries have consolidated financial statements, and \"the Foreign Defendants\" hold \"AGFA's\" monetary assets, such that the Delaware Subsidiary needs permission to make withdrawals. The documents to which DuPont cites to support this point are unavailing. First, DuPont focuses on a series of exhibits that are organizational charts that provide no information regarding the Delaware Subsidiary's monetary assets. (Pl.'s Resp., Exs. 27, 20, 75, 28, 19, 76, 77.) DuPont also provides a non-specific internal citation to Section II.A of its brief, where it reviews alleged ties between the Delaware Subsidiary and the Belgian Subsidiary, but not the Parent or monetary assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   DuPont next points to the email where Mr. Mertens referred to Mr. Vanhooren as his \"boss.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 78.) This email appears to be entirely unrelated to the finances of the Delaware Subsidiary and certainly contains nothing that confirms that the Parent holds the Delaware Subsidiary's assets such that the Delaware Subsidiary needs permission to make withdrawals. In fact, the Delaware Subsidiary files tax returns in its own name, has its own corporate checking account, and paid for the Pitman acquisition out of its own bank account. (Defs.'

Rather, it was the Delaware Subsidiary's idea to acquire Pitman after Pitman contacted Mr. Wilkens, and the Delaware Subsidiary's team of officers and employees that conducted the due diligence for the deal, worked out the terms of the deal with Pitman, negotiated with Pitman's other suppliers such as DuPont, and ultimately signed the US Agreement.

The emails and meeting minutes show that members of the GMC and ExCo were involved in three points along the timeline of the Pitman deal: (1) approval of the acquisition, (2) integration of the business once Pitman was acquired, and (3) monitoring of the business when the Delaware Subsidiary was not receiving the expected margins on the DuPont distribution. As Defendants state, the acquisition of Pitman was an $80 million deal-of course the Delaware Subsidiary needed approval from the Parent before acquiring a company for $80 million. (Defs.'

It is also logical that the Parent was involved in the smooth integration of the Pitman business into the Delaware Subsidiary's business, which was part of the greater Graphics business. Finally, it makes sense that the Parent was monitoring the margins on the DuPont distribution. In February 2013, Mr. Vanhooren reported to the Delaware Subsidiary's board that a Chapter 11 filing was under consideration for \"the U.S. graphics business\" and thus \"instructed the team to increase profitability and balance margin vs. volume in the pre-press business.\" In a subsequent meeting of the GMC, it was stressed that \"better conditions ... with DuPont\" be negotiated. This same sentiment was then communicated in an email from Mr. Dockx to Mr. Wilkens. (Pl.'s Resp., Exs. 54, 44, 3.) In the context of an impending bankruptcy, it is unsurprising that the Parent was concerned with the margins returned on the DuPont distribution agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   But these facts are hardly sufficient to find that the Parent dominated and controlled the Delaware Subsidiary such that personal jurisdiction is established. The Delaware Subsidiary handled its day-to-day business operations and rarely turned to its Parent. This is not a relationship that was dominated or controlled by the Parent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <em>\n    a.

As discussed in greater detail above, the facts pressed by DuPont-that is, that there are no shareholder consents, formal documents, or corroborating testimony that formal delegations of authority and corporate policies are voluntary and not binding\n   on the Delaware Subsidiary-are not relevant to the factors I must consider. Rather, Defendants offer significant evidence establishing that the Delaware Subsidiary is validly incorporated, elects its own officers and directors, holds regular board meetings and prepares minutes, maintains detailed records in a minute book, enacted by-laws, issued share certificates, enters into contracts in its own name, files tax returns in its own name, maintains corporate records, and has its own corporate checking account.

He stated that there was a \"dual reporting line\" for his position because ninety-percent of his job dealt with local matters of the Delaware Subsidiary but the remainder of his job required him to report the financials of the Delaware Subsidiary to the vice president of finance and administration in Belgium.

At his deposition, Mr. Vanhooren testified at length that his involvement in the Pitman deal was largely in his capacity as chairman of the Delaware Subsidiary's board. (Defs,' Reply, Ex. 3, 74:13-77:18.) It is also true that Mr. Vanhooren exchanged emails with Peter Wilkins and Gunther Mertens, or some combination of Christian Reinaudo, Kris Hoornaert, Wilfried Van Lishout, and Ronald Dockx, all of whom are members of either the GMC, the ExCo, or are corporate officers for the Parent. However, the content and context of the emails strongly suggests that Mr. Vanhooren was communicating in his capacity as President of the GMC or chairman of the Delaware Subsidiary's board, and Mr. Dockx was communicating in his role as Vice President of Finance for the GMC. This is evidenced by the fact that Mr. Vanhooren's signature block actually indicated his role as President of the Graphics business group and included links to either the website www.agfa.com or http://www.agfa.com/graphics/.
