After considering the Motions and for the reasons set forth below, the Court finds\n   that Defendant's Motion should be GRANTED and Plaintiff's Motion should be DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The present case concerns a coverage dispute between a general contractor, Defendant Slay Engineering / Texas Multi-Chem / Huser Construction (\"Defendant\" or \"Huser\"), and its insurer, Plaintiff Mt. Hawley Insurance Company (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Mt. Hawley\"). Before beginning its substantive analysis of the Motions, the Court will first briefly summarize the relevant factual background and the parties' underlying insurance agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Project Background and Relevant Chronology\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 20, 2015, the City of Jourdanton (the \"City\") entered into a construction contract with Defendant Huser (a joint venture) to design and construct a municipal sports complex (the \"Project\"). The Project consisted of four little league baseball fields, a softball field, parking lots, and a new swimming pool. Huser entered into a subcontract with Cody Pools, Inc. (\"Cody Pools\") to design and build the swimming pool. Huser also entered a subcontract with Q-Haul, Inc. (\"Q-Haul\") to perform earthwork, grading, and storm drainage work at the site, including for the planned paved parking lots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 10, 2015, after substantial completion of the Project, a Huser employee noticed cracks in the pool and in the parking lot paving. Huser placed Cody Pools on notice of the defective work and requested that Cody Pools provide a repair solution. Huser did not immediately place Q-Haul on notice because the parking lot cracks appeared to be minor. Cody Pools began repair work on the pool shortly thereafter. However, in early March 2015, a Huser employee again noticed that the pool cracks appeared to be worsening. Cody Pools and Huser were unable to agree on a future repair solution for the pool.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 3, 2017, the City notified Huser of several alleged deficiencies involving the swimming pool structure, asphalt paving, concrete flatwork and curbing, and overall site drainage. Throughout the summer of 2017, the City, Huser, Cody Pools and Q-Hall engaged engineers and conducted ongoing discussion as to how any defects to the Project could best be cured. Cody Pools asserted-through an engineer it had hired to evaluate the pool-that the pool structure was stable and that minor crack repairs would allow the pool to be operational for several years. However, on August 30, 2017, the City rejected Cody Pools' repair proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 21, 2017, the City filed a lawsuit against Huser alleging breach of contract and negligence claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Jourdanton v. Slay Engineering / Texas Multi-Chem / Huser Construction, LLC and North American Specialty Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-12-1181-CVA (81st Judicial District Court of Atascosa County, Texas) (hereinafter, the \"Underlying Suit\"). On February 13, 2018, the City filed its First Amended Petition, which alleged-in part-that the \"work performed by [Huser], its subcontractors and suppliers, was [ ] defective and not in compliance with the requirements of the agreement with the City or with the duties of care arising thereunder.\" Docket no. 11-12 \u00b6 4.7. Specifically, the City alleged \"substantial cracks in the swimming pool, parking lot, drives and other paved surfaces ... and deficient site drainage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 21, 2018, following receipt of the First Amended Petition, Huser notified Plaintiff Mt. Hawley of the claims filed by the City and provided Mt. Hawley with the First Amended Petition. Five\n   days later, the City filed a Second Amended Petition, which contained allegations substantially similar to those in the First Amended Petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 1-1 (the \"Second Amended Petition\" or \"Petition\"). Huser also provided Mt. Hawley with the City's Second Amended Petition, and it is the live pleading in the Underlying Suit.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 14, 2018, Mt. Hawley acknowledged that it had received the Second Amended Petition and that its coverage analysis would be conducted based on the updated complaint, rather than based on the City's prior pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 11-15. On March 16, 2018, Mt. Hawley denied coverage to Huser based on certain exclusions in Huser's insurance policies with Mt. Hawley.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 11-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 16, 2018, Mt. Hawley filed this instant lawsuit seeking a judgment declaring that it has no duty to indemnify or defend Huser with respect to the allegations in the City's Underlying Suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 1. On April 6, 2018, Mt. Hawley served Huser with this federal lawsuit. Defendant's Motion notes that on the same day, Mt. Hawley also served Huser with a separate federal complaint seeking a similar declaratory judgment (that will require the interpretation of the same underlying contract language) with respect to a separate Huser-related state court litigation in Harris County, Texas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 11 p. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 27, 2018, Huser answered Mt. Hawley's federal complaint and filed counterclaims asserting that Mt. Hawley breached its agreement with Huser and violated the Texas Insurance Code by denying coverage and failing to pay Huser's claims and defense costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Governing Mt. Hawley Insurance Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With respect to the relevant period, Mt. Hawley issued two types of policies providing certain insurance coverage to Huser (collectively, the \"Policies\"): Commercial General Liability Policies spanning December 31, 2014 through January 1, 2019,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , docket no. 1-2, and Commercial Excess Liability Policies issued for the same period,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , docket no. 1-6. The terms of each of the Policies appear to be the same or substantially similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a general matter, the Policies provide insurance coverage for \"bodily injury\" and \"property damage.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , docket no. 1-2 p. 4. Coverage under the Policies applies only if the \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" is caused by an \"occurrence\" that takes place in the \"coverage territory\" during the \"policy period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   An \"occurrence,\" under the Policies, is defined as an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 18-19. \"Property damage,\" as defined by the Policies, is (a) physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property, and (b) loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Further, pursuant to Section I.A of the Commercial General Liability Policies, Mt. Hawley \"will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking ... damages\" related to any such covered \"property damage\" or \"bodily injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4. However, the Policies state that\n   Mt. Hawley has no duty to defend against any suit seeking damages for any \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" that is excluded from the Policies' coverage.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Policies' coverage has two relevant exclusions for the purpose of resolving the instant Motions. First, pursuant to Section I.2.1, coverage excludes \"Damage To Your Work: \" '[p]roperty damage\" to 'your work' arising out of it or any part of it and included in the 'products-completed operations hazard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 8 (hereinafter, the \"Your Work Exclusion\"). However, the Policies provide that \"[t]his exclusion does not apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on your behalf by a subcontractor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, each of the Policies contains a separate endorsement that specifies that coverage does not extend to any suit for \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" arising directly or indirectly out of a breach of \"express or implied contract, breach of express or implied warranty, or fraud or misrepresentation regarding the formation, terms or performance of a contract.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 52 (hereinafter, the \"Breach of Contract Exclusion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate as to a claim or part of a claim if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Specifically, Plaintiff's Motion seeks an order from this Court declaring that the Policies exclude coverage for the damages arising in the Underlying Suit, and therefore, Mt.

Hawley argues that it \"does not have a duty to defend Huser in the Underlying Action because all of the allegations in the Underlying Action are excluded by Mt. Hawley's Breach of Contract Exclusion.\" Docket no. 12 p.8. On the other hand, Huser contends that the Breach of Contract Exclusion should not be interpreted so broadly as to preclude coverage related to damages caused by Huser's subcontractors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 11 pp. 8-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that Mt.

Texas courts read the phrase \"arising out of\" to require \"but for\" causation. In interpreting another general commercial liability insurance policy, the Supreme Court of Texas has held that \" 'arise out of' means that there is simply a 'causal connection or relation,' which is interpreted to mean that there is 'but for' causation, though not necessarily direct or proximate causation.\"\n   <em>\n    Utica Nat'l Ins.

Hawley contends that a policy exclusion preventing coverage for injuries \"arising out of\" particular conduct \"need only bear an incidental relationship to the described conduct for the exclusion to apply.\" However, since\n   <em>\n    Sport Supply\n   </em>\n   , courts have made clear that any such \"incidental relationship\" must still be a causal one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Fire Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Radiology Assocs., L.L.P.\n   </em>\n   , 439 Fed. App'x 293, 296 (5th Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Apparently recognizing that some \"causal\" connection must be shown, Mt. Hawley appears to argue that the existence of the contract between Huser and the City may be a sufficient causal link between the alleged property damage and the underlying contract, such that the policy exclusion is triggered. Specifically, Mt. Hawley asserts that \"but for the Contract, there would be no cause of action to bring against Huser.\" Docket no. 13 p. 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   docket 12 p. 13 (\"[Huser's] liability would not exist but for the Contract.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The problem with Mt. Hawley's comparison is that it conflates Huser's causation of \"property damage\" with Huser's ultimate contractual liability for economic losses. However, merely because Huser may ultimately be liable for certain of the City's economic losses under a breach of contract theory does not necessarily mean that all of the alleged property damage was causally attributable to Huser's alleged breach of its contract with the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Indeed, on that basis, another court has specifically rejected such a broad interpretation of \"arising out of\" as it is contained in the Mt. Hawley policy. In\n   <em>\n    Mt. Hawley Ins. Co. v. Aguilar\n   </em>\n   , No. SACV 07-00969,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011342656\">\n    2008 WL 11342656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal., Feb. 29, 2008), the court considered Mt. Hawley's precise argument regarding the scope of the breach of contract exclusion contained in Mt. Hawley's insurance agreements. The\n   <em>\n    Aguilar\n   </em>\n   court rejected Mt. Hawley's proposed interpretation of the exclusion because it \"would essentially defeat coverage in all instances because virtually all property damage that [the insured] would seek coverage for could be characterized as arising directly or indirectly out of a breach of contract or implied warranty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Instead, the\n   <em>\n    Aguilar\n   </em>\n   court reasoned that \"a more reasonable interpretation of this exclusion is that it pertains to [the insured's] liability for repairing its own deficient work or to specific contractual obligations that [the insured] has assumed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the\n   <em>\n    Aguilar\n   </em>\n   court found that-at the summary judgment stage-it could not conclude that coverage was excluded just because the insured contractor had been sued for a breach of contract by the property's owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court agrees with the general analysis by the\n   <em>\n    Aguilar\n   </em>\n   court (albeit in a slightly different posture), and the Court finds that the \"directly or indirectly\" and \"arising out of\" language requires that Mt. Hawley demonstrate that\n   <em>\n    Huser's\n   </em>\n   breach of contract was a \"but for\" (though not necessarily proximate) cause of the alleged property damage. The fact that all claims contained in the Underlying Suit have some relation to Huser's contract with the City or that Huser has been sued for breach of contract are not alone enough to trigger the Breach of Contract Exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Mt. Hawley Ins.Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. M-10-58,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%209169946\">\n    2011 WL 9169946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Tex. June 15, 2011) (same breach of contract exclusion does not apply where allegations of property damage are incidentally related to \"the\n   <em>\n    existence\n   </em>\n   of a contract, [but] they do not necessarily bear an incidental relationship to a\n   <em>\n    breach\n   </em>\n   of that contract\") (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Applying that standard, the Court agrees with Mt. Hawley that Huser's breach of contract itself may have been one \"but for\" cause of the underlying \"property damage.\" For example, the City's complaint specifically alleges that Huser breached the contract by failing to correct the defective, non-conforming work performed at the site, and presumably, some of the \"property damage\" may have arisen from Huser's alleged inaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 3.5 &amp; 4.2. Thus, in an absolute sense, certain of the allegations might-in a vacuum-support Mt. Hawley's exclusion argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Unfortunately for Mt. Hawley, however, that alone is not enough to negate Mt. Hawley's duty to defend. For Mt. Hawley's duty to be erased, it would have to also be true that the facts alleged in the Underlying Suit demonstrate that there are\n   <em>\n    no other\n   </em>\n   independent, covered (non-excluded) \"but for\" causes of the alleged property damage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section II.B.2,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, the Court must determine (i) whether there were other independent \"but for\" causes of the \"property damage\" at the basis of the Underlying Suit, and (ii) if so,\n   whether those causes of the \"property damage\" are also excluded by the Policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Subcontractors' Independent Causation of the Injury\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"When two separate events-one that is excluded and one that is covered by the general liability policy-may independently have caused the accident, Texas law mandates that the general liability policy also provide coverage despite the exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    EMCASCO Ins.

It is on this basis that Huser asserts that Mt.

Hawley's request for summary judgment notes that there is an exception to the general rule that indemnification can only be determined once the scope of liability has been established. Indeed, the Supreme Court of Texas has held that the duty to indemnify may be justiciable before liability is determined \"when the insurer has no duty to defend and the same reasons that negate the duty to defend likewise negate any possibility the insurer will ever have a duty to indemnify.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11890678\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/955/81/#p84\">\n    955 S.W.2d at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, for the same reasons Mt. Hawley contends that coverage is excluded and it has no duty to defend, Mt. Hawley also contends it has no duty to indemnify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As set forth in the prior sections, the Court has concluded that the facts alleged in the underlying third-party Petition do not demonstrate that Mt. Hawley's duty to defend has been negated, and instead demonstrate that Mt. Hawley must defend Huser in the Underlying Suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section II.A,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the narrow exception set forth in\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   does not apply, and the Court believes that it would be premature at this stage to determine to what extent-if any-Mt. Hawley must indemnify Huser for damages from the Underlying Suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For that reason, Plaintiff's Motion must be denied to the extent it seeks judgment with respect to the question of indemnification. However, the Court's denial is made without prejudice to Mt. Hawley again seeking judgment with respect to its\n   indemnification duty if \"the facts actually established\" in the Underlying Suit demonstrate that the underlying \"property damage\" is not in fact covered under the Policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Huser's Texas Insurance Code Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Mt. Hawley also seeks summary judgment as to Huser's counterclaims under the Texas Insurance Code, which assert that Mt. Hawley acted in bad faith in denying coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 13 pp. 16-17. Mt. Hawley's argument is premised on the fact that summary judgment is generally appropriate on statutory bad-faith denial claims if the insurer has prevailed in the dispute regarding coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    USAA Texas Lloyds Co. v. Menchaca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656322\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/545/479/#p488\">\n    545 S.W.3d 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488-89 (Tex. 2018) (\"[A]n insured cannot recover\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   damages based on an insurer's statutory violation if the insured had no right to receive benefits under the policy and sustained no injury independent of a right to benefits.\") (emphasis in original). Thus, because Mt. Hawley asserts that the Policies do not provide coverage for Huser, it also asserts that Huser's Texas Insurance Code claims must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As discussed in the prior sections, at this stage, the Court is unable to conclude that the \"property damage\" in the Underlying Suit is not covered by the Policies. Because no other specific bases have been provided as to why Mt. Hawley is entitled to summary judgment with respect to Huser's statutory claims, the Court will deny Plaintiff's Motion as to the Texas Insurance Code claims. However, as with its denial on the issue of indemnification, the Court's denial of Plaintiff's Motion with respect to Huser's Texas Insurance Code claims is also made without prejudice to Plaintiff again seeking judgment on the issue at a later date, if appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As set forth above, the Court finds that Plaintiff Mt. Hawley has a duty to defend Huser in the Underlying Suit. Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant Huser's Motion for Summary Judgment (docket no. 11) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED,\n   </strong>\n   and summary judgment is issued in favor of Huser with respect to Mt. Hawley's request for declaratory judgment on the issue of the duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff Mt. Hawley's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings or in the Alternative Motion for Summary Judgment (docket no. 13) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n   However, with respect to the issues of (i) Plaintiff's indemnification of Defendant and (ii) Defendant's Texas Insurance Code counterclaims, the denial of Plaintiff's Motion is made without prejudice to Plaintiff again seeking judgment on those issues at a later date, if appropriate in light of the proceedings in the Underlying Suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is asserted, in the alternative, as a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    docket no. 13.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Defendant's Motion states that Huser's other underlying case-for which it seeks coverage from Mt. Hawley-is\n    <em>\n     Eagle Heights Pleasanton, LLC v. Schaffer Mech. Co., Inc.\n    </em>\n    , No. 2018-09694, in Harris County, Texas. Upon a review of the court docket for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, it appears that the associated federal action in which Mt. Hawley seeks similar declaratory relief is\n    <em>\n     Mt. Hawley Ins. Co. v. Huser Constr. Co., Inc.\n    </em>\n    , No. 4:18-CV-787 (S.D.

Thus, although the Court will necessarily determine whether Mt. Hawley has a duty to defend the Underlying Suit in resolving the instant Motions, the Court's Order will be limited to adjudicating\n    <em>\n     Mt.
