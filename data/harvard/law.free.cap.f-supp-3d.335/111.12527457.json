At all relevant times, up until the present, he has held the rank of Captain. Effective November 1, 2015, Amirault was involuntarily removed from his position as the Head of the Department's Detective Unit, and was assigned to fill the Police Department's newly created position of Manager of Accreditation. Amirault claims that the reassignment took him out of the mainstream of detective work and deprived him of the ability to earn overtime pay, and that the job change was made in retaliation for statements he made during the course of two investigations in which he uncovered evidence of possible misconduct by City officials. As described herein, these matters are known as the \"Henry matter\" and the \"YMCA investigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 20, 2017, this Court dismissed Counts I and III of Amirault's Complaint against Malden's Chief of Police, Kevin Molis, in which Amirault had purported to\n   bring claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7 11I, for violating his First Amendment right to free speech. (Docket No. 35). This matter is presently before the Court on \"Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\" (Docket No. 52), by which the City of Malden is seeking judgment on Count II of Plaintiff's Complaint in which he alleges that the City violated his rights under the Massachusetts Whistleblower Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20149%2C%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the reasons detailed herein, the City's motion for summary judgment is ALLOWED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Amirault may proceed on his whistleblower claims based on the Henry matter. Summary judgment shall enter in favor of the City on Count II to the extent it relates to the YMCA investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise indicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Overview\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Amirault has been employed by the Malden Police Department for over 30 years. (DF \u00b6 2). In March 2013, Plaintiff, then a Captain, was assigned to serve as the Head of the Department's Detective Division. (DF \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6; PF \u00b6 147). As the Head of the Detective Division, Amirault had oversight over all major cases that occurred in the City of Malden. (DF \u00b6 7; PF \u00b6 148). In November 2014 and April 2015, he became involved in the investigation of two separate criminal matters, the \"Henry matter\" and the \"YMCA investigation.\" (DF \u00b6\u00b6 23, 75; PF \u00b6 151). On October 7, 2015, Plaintiff was informed that he would be transferred to the newly created position of Accreditation Manager. (PF \u00b6 227). Plaintiff alleges that he was involuntarily transferred as retaliation for his involvement in the Henry matter and the YMCA investigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. (Docket No. 1) at \u00b6\u00b6 76-79). It is undisputed for purposes of this motion for summary judgment that the transfer to the position of Accreditation Manager was an adverse employment action as it represented a significant loss in pay and most officers \"would not want to be assigned\" to the position. (PF \u00b6\u00b6 230-31; DR \u00b6\u00b6 230-31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     The Henry Matter\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about November 17, 2014, the Director of Malden's Planning, Inspections &amp; Permits (\"PIPS\") Department, Chris Webb (\"Director Webb\"), reported that a city check had been stolen. (DF \u00b6 23). Plaintiff claims that he was informed by Director Webb that the check was last seen on the desk of PIPS employee Enos Henry\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the surveillance camera near Mr. Henry's office had been disconnected. (PF \u00b6\u00b6 151, 159-60). Director Webb also stated that Mr. Henry had worked in\n   the City's IT department at the time the cameras were installed. (PF \u00b6 160).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The check was discovered to have been cashed on November 8, 2014 by Jennifer Degand Rene. (DF \u00b6 25). The Malden Police arrested Ms. Rene on February 2, 2015 and she implicated Mr. Henry in the theft of the check, stating that he had provided her with the check and agreed to pay her if she cashed it. (DF \u00b6\u00b6 28-29; PF \u00b6 162).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Given the fact that a City employee was implicated in the crime, Plaintiff contacted Chief Molis to brief him on the case. (PF \u00b6 163; DF \u00b6 32). Chief Molis and the Mayor of Malden, Gary Christenson, met with Amirault in Molis' police cruiser in the station garage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PF \u00b6\u00b6 163-64; DF \u00b6\u00b6 35-36). Plaintiff updated Chief Molis and the Mayor about the investigation. (DF \u00b6\u00b6 36-37; PF \u00b6 164). Chief Molis asked Plaintiff several questions, but the nature of his questions and the Mayor's level of participation in the discussion are disputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PF \u00b6 164; DR \u00b6 164; DF \u00b6\u00b6 37-38; PR \u00b6\u00b6 37-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 3, 2015, Mr. Henry was brought in for questioning, and he ultimately confessed to violating PIPS protocols and knowing Ms. Rene. (DF \u00b6 39; PF \u00b6 166). The same day, Amirault met with City Solicitor Katherine Fallon, Director Webb, and the City's Personnel Director Eleanor Cushing. They determined that there was \"just cause\" to terminate Mr. Henry and that Mr. Henry should also be issued a no trespass notice to prevent him from accessing City property. (PF \u00b6\u00b6 167-69). However, at the recommendation of the Mayor and Chief Molis, Mr. Henry instead was suspended and issued a no trespass notice. (PF \u00b6 172; DF \u00b6\u00b6 41-42; Pl. Ex. Y).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 6, 2015, Director Webb reported that another City employee had been contacted by Mr. Henry in an attempt to smuggle checks back into the PIPS Department. (DF \u00b6 44; PF \u00b6 173). Based on this information the Malden Police conducted a search of Mr. Henry's home where they allegedly uncovered seventy-six additional checks totaling over $16,000.00. (DF \u00b6 46; PF \u00b6 174). While officers were executing the warrant, Mr. Henry was discovered attempting to remove or destroy evidence and was subsequently arrested. (DF \u00b6 47; PF \u00b6 175). Upon hearing of Mr. Henry's arrest, City Solicitor Fallon drafted a termination letter. (PF \u00b6 176). The Mayor was allegedly upset over City Solicitor Fallon's unilateral actions, reportedly stating that he \"did the hiring and firing, not her.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 178). Together with his Chief of Staff, the Mayor rewrote the letter, terminating Mr. Henry's employment on or about February 11, 2015. (DF \u00b6 49; PF \u00b6\u00b6 177-80).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 10, 2015, Plaintiff appeared before the Malden City Council to discuss the allegations against Mr. Henry. (PF \u00b6 181; DF \u00b6 50). Afterward the Council approved an outside audit of the PIPS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Department to be performed by the accounting firm BlumShapiro. (PF \u00b6 181; DF \u00b6 53). However, according to the Plaintiff, City personnel were uncooperative in the investigation, and he complained about their conduct. For example, in order to complete the audit, BlumShapiro required a document known as the Energov Report. (PF \u00b6 182). The Energov Report was to be completed by the head of the City's IT Department Anthony Rodriguez. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On February 26, 2015, BlumShapiro provided him with a recommended format for the report detailing the information sought. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Rodriguez was unfamiliar with creating an Energov Report using the recommended format and suggested a conference call with BlumShapiro and the company that provided support for the City's Energov system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 183). He was tasked with setting up the call, but the call was never scheduled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   BlumShapiro personnel contacted Mr. Rodriguez requesting the report on March 31, 2015 and again on April 7, 2015 with no response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 184). On April 13, 2015, City Solicitor Fallon interceded, at which point Mr. Rodriguez produced two Excel spreadsheets with no identifying information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 185). When BlumShapiro personnel contacted Mr. Rodriguez for assistance interpreting the unlabeled data, he was unable to explain the information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A workable Energov Report was eventually provided on April 21, 2015, but it contained incomplete information, making it impossible to complete a final audit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 186). However, with the information presented BlumShapiro was able to show several suspicious transactions involving Mr. Henry totaling close to $99,000.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 187).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In or around March 2015 and again on April 16, 2015, the District Attorney's office issued a Grand Jury subpoena related to the Henry matter in an effort to get the necessary information. (DF \u00b6 60; PF \u00b6 189). The City complied with the request, but City Solicitor Fallon informed Plaintiff that the information the City provided contained significant gaps in the data. (DF \u00b6 61; PF \u00b6 190).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On or around June 8, 2015, Plaintiff and City Solicitor Fallon met with the prosecutor of Mr. Henry's case, Assistant District Attorney Craig Estes, and the Forensic Auditor for the Middlesex District Attorney's Office, Sean Ball, to discuss the lack of cooperation by the City. (PF \u00b6 188). Plaintiff alleges that he continued to meet with the City Council as many as six times regarding the progress of the Henry matter, and to provide them with \"reports which included the lack of cooperation by City officials in providing requested information and the incomplete nature of the documents submitted in response to the Grand Jury subpoena.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 191).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to the Plaintiff, on October 3, 2015, the Mayor approached the Plaintiff and questioned him about the progress of the Henry matter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 193). Plaintiff informed the Mayor that the investigation was progressing well, that an indictment was expected, and that he would be meeting with the District Attorney regarding the case on October 6, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 193).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Chief Molis met with the president of the police union on October 5, 2015 to discuss transferring Amirault to the Accreditation Manager position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 220; DF \u00b6 130). Plaintiff was informed of the transfer on October 7, 2015. (PF \u00b6 227; DF \u00b6 134).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     The YMCA Investigation\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On April 4, 2015, the police were notified that a six-year-old girl was reporting that she had been sexually assaulted at the YMCA in Malden. (DF \u00b6 75). Chief Molis' brother, Francis Molis, was a supervisor at the YMCA and was at the facility on the\n   day of the alleged assault. (PF \u00b6 194). Certain areas of the YMCA are monitored by cameras, and after police officers responded to the alleged assault, they reviewed the surveillance videotapes with Frank Molis in the hope of identifying the assailant. (PF \u00b6\u00b6 198-99; DF \u00b6 80). A review of the tapes revealed an Asian male suspect. (DF \u00b6 81). None of the YMCA employees, including Frank Molis, indicated that they knew anything about the suspect on the videotape. (PF \u00b6 199).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff received a copy of the surveillance video from Frank Molis and brought it to Assistant District Attorney Katherine Folger (\"ADA Folger\") in order to assemble a Sexual Assault Intervention Network (\"SAIN\") Team. (DF \u00b6 84). Amirault spoke with ADA Folger about sending a still photo from the videotapes to local media to assist in identifying the suspect. (DF \u00b6 86; PF \u00b6 200). When Amirault returned to the station, however, he contends that Chief Molis \"appeared angry over the status of the case ... [and] countermanded that decision stating that he preferred to 'work the case in house.' \" (PF \u00b6 201).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On April 6, 2015, a detective went to the YMCA to interview witnesses, including Frank Molis. (PF \u00b6 202). Without Plaintiff's knowledge, Chief Molis accompanied the detective to participate in the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Frank Molis and two front desk employees were interviewed. (PF \u00b6 204; DF \u00b6 96). Chief Molis participated in all three interviews and reviewed the video surveillance recording. (PF \u00b6 204). Neither Frank Molis, nor any of the other witnesses, indicated knowing the suspect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Later that night, one of the front desk employees sent Chief Molis a text message with the name of the suspect, which was promptly provided to the Plaintiff. (DF \u00b6\u00b6 102-03; PF \u00b6 205).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On April 7, 2015, the Plaintiff and Detective Marc Gatcomb brought the suspect in for questioning. (PF \u00b6 205; DF \u00b6\u00b6 106, 108). Detective Gatcomb and Detective Robert DiSalvatore interviewed the suspect. (DF \u00b6\u00b6 109). During the interview, the suspect admitted to the alleged assault and claimed that Frank Molis had invited him to the YMCA on the day in question to help move furniture. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 109-10). At this point the detectives took a short break to inform Amirault of the suspect's claim that he knew Frank Molis despite Frank Molis' previous statement to the contrary. (DF \u00b6 111; PF \u00b6 208). At Amirault's instruction, the detectives then returned to the interview to question the suspect about his relationship with Frank Molis. (DF \u00b6 112; PF \u00b6 208). In accordance with Department protocol, the interview was to be audio and video recorded. (DF \u00b6 115). However, as the detectives began to question the suspect about his relationship with Frank Molis, the recording was terminated from outside of the interview room. (PF \u00b6 209; DF \u00b6 115). This was the first known instance of a recording stopping in the middle of an interview. (PF \u00b6 212).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On April 24, 2015, Plaintiff contacted Frank Molis to request access to the YMCA servers in order to obtain surveillance footage from the incident on April 4, 2015. (DF \u00b6 119). Frank Molis informed the Plaintiff that YMCA legal counsel would need to authorize release of the servers. (PF \u00b6 215; DF \u00b6 121). After contacting the YMCA attorney, the servers were released to the Police Department. (DF \u00b6 122; PF \u00b6 216).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 14, 2015, the Plaintiff met with ADA Folger to discuss the YMCA Investigation, the conflicting statements regarding whether or not Frank Molis knew the suspect, and to express \"his belief that Frank Molis was intentionally impeding the investigation.\" (PF \u00b6 217). The case was later transferred from the Middlesex District Attorney's Office to Norfolk County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (DF \u00b6 123; PF \u00b6 218). This practice is routine for cases involving the family member of a Malden Police Officer. (DF \u00b6 124).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Amirault and Detective DiSalvatore met with a Norfolk County ADA and two members of the Massachusetts State Police for the Norfolk County C-PAC Unit to discuss the investigation. During this meeting Amirault informed them that he believed Frank Molis may have misled the investigation. (PF \u00b6 219; DF \u00b6 126).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Reassignment to Accreditation Manager\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In 2013, the Mayor informed Chief Molis that he wanted to pursue accreditation for the Malden Police Department. (DF \u00b6 127). On March 1, 2013, the Mayor and Amirault signed a Memorandum of Agreement altering the collective bargaining agreement that existed between the City of Malden and the New England Police Benevolent Association. (Def. Ex. J). This memo explicitly granted the police chief \"flexibility in assigning duties and responsibilities to a Captain ... so that responsibilities involving grant writing,\n   <em>\n    police accreditation\n   </em>\n   and the technological advances of the department are adequately addressed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) ). In May 2015, Chief Molis attended a chief's conference where someone from the Accreditation Commission gave a presentation on the accreditation process. (DF \u00b6 128).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On October 5, 2015, two days after Plaintiff's conversation with the Mayor regarding the Henry matter, Chief Molis met with Detective Gatcomb, the president of the union to which Plaintiff belonged. (PF \u00b6 220; DF \u00b6 130). During this meeting Chief Molis presented a \"Notice of Contemplated Action\" stating that he was \"contemplating assigning Capt. John Amirault to a temporary assignment as [the Department's] Accreditation Project Manager.\" (Pl. Ex. U). The Notice further stipulated that Chief Molis was \"contemplating assigning [Detective Gatcomb], as the Detective Lieutenant in the bureau, to temporarily serve as the commanding officer of the Detective Bureau.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). During the meeting Detective Gatcomb questioned Chief Molis as to whether the action was still contemplated or if it had already been decided and Chief Molis responded that the decision had been made. (Pl. Ex. N at 52)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At this time, Detective Gatcomb held the rank of Lieutenant. (PF \u00b6 225). At no point prior to this incident had the Head of the Detective Unit held a rank other than Captain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Additionally, at no point prior to this incident had a Captain assigned as Head of the Detective Unit been removed for non-disciplinary reasons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 153).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant claims that the Mayor has \"no involvement with the Police Department's personnel decisions, including how personnel are assigned within the Department,\" and that \"Chief Molis did not inform the Mayor of his decision to temporarily reassign the Plaintiff to Accreditation Manager[.]\" (DF \u00b6\u00b6 139-40). However, the Mayor was copied on the October 5, 2015 Notice of Contemplated Action documenting Chief Molis' decision to remove Plaintiff from his role as Head of Detectives. (PF \u00b6 221). As of that time, Amirault had yet to be informed of the reassignment. (PF \u00b6 224).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On October 7, 2015, Chief Molis met with Amirault and informed him that he would be temporarily reassigned to the position of Accreditation Manager effective November 1, 2015. (DF \u00b6 134; PF \u00b6 227). Chief Molis also informed Amirault that in the new position Amirault was only to work on accreditation and \"nothing else.\" (PF \u00b6 228). At this meeting, Amirault informed Chief Molis that he felt the reassignment\n   was \"personal.\" (PF \u00b6 229; DF \u00b6 141).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant maintains that on October 29, 2015, Chief Molis assured the City Council and the Assistant District Attorney pursuing Mr. Henry's case to inform them that Plaintiff's reassignment would not impact the investigation and that Plaintiff was available if needed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DF \u00b6 143).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Upon hearing of Plaintiff's reassignment, City Solicitor Fallon met with City Council officials to express her concern due to Plaintiff's involvement in the Henry matter. (PF \u00b6 232). City Solicitor Fallon felt that Plaintiff's removal \"was intended to be punishment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On November 18, 2015, Plaintiff, through counsel, wrote to Chief Molis alleging that the \"reassignment to Accreditation Manager was in retaliation for his involvement with the investigation of the Henry matter and the YMCA matter.\" (DF \u00b6 144). Plaintiff then filed this Complaint on February 2, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145). Two years after the filing of the Complaint, Plaintiff remains in the temporary Accreditation Manager position and the Henry matter remains pending.

Further, the City contends that even if a causal connection was established, the Plaintiff cannot establish that the Accreditation assignment was pretextual, or that the Defendant acted with retaliatory animus.

As an initial matter, the City argues that Amirault's\n   removal as Head of the Detective Unit and reassignment as the Accreditation Manager was too remote in time from his efforts on the Henry matter for a fact-finder to infer that they were causally related. To reach this conclusion, however, the City misconstrues the factual record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The City argues that Plaintiff's appearances before the City Council occurred in February 2015, the investigation took place over the Spring of that year, and \"Plaintiff's temporary reassignment became effective on November 1, 2015.\" (Def. Mem. at 7). The precise dates of the Plaintiff's meetings with the City Council are unclear, but there is substantial evidence in the record that Amirault's involvement continued up until the time of his reassignment. As described above, according to the Defendant, Chief Molis assured the City Council and the Assistant District Attorney pursuing Mr. Henry's case after Amirault's reassignment to inform them that Plaintiff's reassignment would not impact the investigation and that Plaintiff was available if needed. (DF \u00b6 143). Similarly, City Solicitor Fallon was concerned that the reassignment was in retaliation for Amirault's involvement in the Henry matter. (PF \u00b6 232). Significantly, on October 3, 2015, just days before the reassignment, the Mayor asked Amirault about the status of the Henry matter, and was told that an indictment was expected. (PF \u00b6 193). While the Defendant disputes the significance of this conversation (Def. Mem. at 9), it should be up to a fact-finder to determine if the Henry matter was still very much on Chief Molis' and the Mayor's mind when the decision was made in early October (not November 1, 2015) to reassign Amirault. The reassignment was not so remote from Amirault's involvement in the Henry matter that this Court can conclude, as a matter of law, that the Plaintiff cannot establish causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeCaire v. Mukasey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054907\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/530/1/#p19\">\n    530 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 19 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"our law is that temporal proximity alone can suffice to 'meet the relatively light burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mariani-Colon v.

The \"ultimate issue\" is \"whether, viewing the aggregate package of proof offered by the plaintiff and taking all inferences in the plaintiff's favor, the plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of fact\" as to whether the adverse job action was causally related to his involvement in the Henry matter.\n   <em>\n    Dominguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"917956\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/202/424/#p431\">\n    202 F.3d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 431 (1st Cir. 2000) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Here, the Plaintiff has established that he vigorously pursued the Henry matter despite resistance from other City departments. The Plaintiff argues, and a fact-finder may conclude, that the Mayor, himself, was interested in the matter and was inclined to support Mr. Henry (or terminate the investigation), as evidenced by his actions in reversing the initial decision to terminate Henry's employment with the City. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PF \u00b6\u00b6 167-69, 172; DF \u00b6\u00b6 41-42). Moreover, the Mayor met with the Plaintiff in Chief Molis' car on February 2, 2015, and Amirault contends that he had been unaware that the Mayor would be there. (PF \u00b6 163). This encounter may be viewed by a fact-finder as an effort by the Mayor to privately learn about the Henry matter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PF \u00b6\u00b6 163-64; DF \u00b6\u00b6 35-36; note 4,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ). Similarly, the Mayor's October 3, 2015 conversation with Amirault reflects a continuing interest on the part of the Mayor in the Henry matter. (PF \u00b6 193). The Plaintiff argues that Henry had been promoted to his position by the Mayor, and that Henry's mother was an influential supporter of the Mayor, facts which could also support\n   the conclusion that the Mayor would want to stop the Henry investigation and that removing Amirault as Head of Detectives and isolating him from police work as the Accreditation Manager was retaliatory. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. (Docket No. 63) at 14-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The City argues that there is no evidence that the Mayor was involved in or aware of Chief Molis' decision to reassign Amirault. Again, however, there is evidence from which a fact-finder may find to the contrary. Thus, the record establishes that Chief Molis provided the Mayor with a copy of the October 5, 2015 Notice documenting the reassignment, which Chief Molis had given to Detective Gatcomb. (PF \u00b6 221). Thus, the Mayor knew about the reassignment even before Amirault. (PF \u00b6\u00b6 224, 227). The Plaintiff argues that \"Chief Molis had never before informed Mayor Christenson of a contemplated re-assignment within the Department prior to this time.\" (Pl. Mem. at 15;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DF \u00b6 139 (\"The Mayor has no involvement with the Police Department's personnel decisions, including how personnel are assigned within the Department.\"). Under such circumstances, there is sufficient evidence to support a finding of causation so that the City's motion for summary judgment must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, the City argues that Amirault cannot establish that its stated reason for transferring him to be in charge of the accreditation process was pretextual. Thus, the City argues that accreditation was a legitimate goal of the Department, and that \"Chief Molis selected the Plaintiff to be the Accreditation Manager because of his well-rounded tenure with the Department, including his experience as patrol commander, Union leader, a member of the detail board, and a leader in the Detective Division\" - factors which allegedly led Chief Molis to conclude that Amirault was the best suited for the position. (Def. Mem. at 12-13 (citing DF \u00b6 131) ). However, the Plaintiff has raised sufficient questions about the validity of the reason given for his reassignment so that the issue should be decided by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   While the Mayor allegedly informed Chief Molis that he wanted to pursue accreditation for the Department in 2013, Chief Molis apparently did not do anything in furtherance of that goal until May 2015, when he attended a conference where there was a presentation from the Accreditation Commission. (DF \u00b6\u00b6 127-28). Even then, although he was apparently in frequent contact with Amirault, he never communicated with him either about the accreditation process or his potential role as Manager. The Chief did not even provide Amirault with a copy of the Notice proposing to change his position, electing instead to provide the information to the Union. (PF \u00b6 220; DF \u00b6 130). The jury can consider such evidence in deciding whether the reassignment was a straightforward business decision, or done in retaliation for pursuing an investigation that was causing the City discomfort.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonough v. City of Quincy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046378\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/8/#p18\">\n    452 F.3d 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18 (1st Cir. 2006) (finding the fact that the police chief did not discuss a plan to restructure the department with captains during a management meeting sufficient to undermine the City's contention that a transfer decision was part of a systemic restructuring process).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, the record before the Court is that Amirault was performing his role as the Head of Detectives well, and was respected by members of his Unit. (PF \u00b6 150). Historically, the Detective's Unit was headed by a Captain (PF \u00b6 225), and a Captain assigned as the Head of the Unit would be removed only for disciplinary reasons.

As Amirault argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   By Chief Molis' own admission, removing a Captain from the Detective's Unit for any reason other than discipline would be a \"rare occurrence.\" Despite this, Chief Molis provides no explanation for his decision to remove Plaintiff from the Detective's Unit except that he felt Plaintiff was \"well-rounded.\" There were three additional Captains that Chief Molis could have assigned to accreditation. However, he chose Plaintiff who was in the midst of a serious investigation involving the theft of City funds that was about to culminate in an indictment. There was no reasonable basis to do so. As City Solicitor Fallon told the City Council, it just doesn't make sense. [PF] \u00b6 232. Furthermore, since Plaintiff's removal from the Detectives Unit, there has been no additional investigation into either the Henry matter or the YMCA matter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 233. It is clear from this evidence a jury could reasonably conclude that Chief Molis' removal of Plaintiff from the Detectives Unit was merely pretextual and the true nature of his actions was retaliation for protect[ed] activity under the Whistleblower Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   (Pl.

In order to defeat any employer's business explanation at this stage of a case, \"[t]he plaintiff does not have to prove by a preponderance of the additional evidence that discrimination was in fact the motive for the action taken.

However, the Plaintiff's statement of facts establishes that he did not raise any complaints about any actions of his employer or Chief Molis in those discussions - he just complained about Frank Molis. Moreover, he has not alleged that the City or Chief Molis were aware of his discussions with the District Attorney's Office. These facts preclude Amirault's claim under the Whistle-blower Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   According to the Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   On July 14, 2015, Plaintiff met with ADA Folger in order to request that the District Attorney's Office's processing of the video obtained from Molis be expedited. He also informed ADA Folger of\n   the conflicting statements by the suspect and Frank Molis as to whether the two knew each other prior to the February 2015 assault and his belief that Frank Molis was intentionally impeding the investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (PF \u00b6 217).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   On August 3, 2105, Amirault and DiSalvatore met with one of the Norfolk County ADAs and two members of the Massachusetts State Police for the Norfolk County C-PAC Unit in order to provide them with all of the information they had gathered in the course of the YMCA investigation. This included information about the inconsistencies in the statements that had been made by Frank Molis and the sexual assault suspect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (PF \u00b6 219).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In order to constitute protected activity Plaintiff must be disclosing \"to a public body an activity, policy or practice\n   <em>\n    of the employer\n   </em>\n   ... that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20149%2C%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    Mass.
