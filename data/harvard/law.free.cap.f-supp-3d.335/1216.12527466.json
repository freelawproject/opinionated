The joint operating agreement with its revised terms contains just and reasonable terms to govern the relationship between the Applicants and the uncommitted mineral interest owners who elect to participate as working interest owners or nonconsenting working interest owners.

The Court must therefore apply the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   test to determine whether Plaintiffs received a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the issue of whether the integration order contained\n   terms that were just and reasonable. Regarding the first\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor, Plaintiffs' interest in the order is relatively modest. As explained above, most of their property interest-the royalty rate and bonus payment-is guaranteed and unalterable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The second\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor weighs more heavily in favor of Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs faced a high risk of erroneous deprivation of their interest in just and reasonable terms because the hearing officer did not adequately explain the basis on which she determined that the terms of the integration order were just and reasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Due process requires the opportunity to be heard in a \"meaningful manner,\" and \"[t]he opportunity to be heard must be tailored to the capacities and circumstances of those who are to be heard.\" \"\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    424 U.S. at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Goldberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p268\">\n    397 U.S. at 268-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p268\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Director's Order failed to meet these minimum due process requirements.

In part, this statement shows circular reasoning by suggesting that the terms are \"just and reasonable\" because they are reasonable. The statement that the terms were \"standard in the industry throughout the greater geographic region,\" on the other hand, may be a valid reason to find the terms to be just and reasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Plaintiffs were not granted a meaningful opportunity to be heard on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   At no point in the December hearing did the hearing officer indicate that her decision on whether the integration order's terms were just and reasonable would be based on standards used in the industry and in the greater geographic reason. Neither did the Commissioners do so in the March 8 hearing. The notice of hearing also lacked any mention of this. As a result, there was no way for Plaintiffs to know what evidence would be relevant to the hearing officer's decision. If the standards to be used in the hearing officer's decision had been clear, Plaintiffs could have focused their arguments on those factors that would actually affect the determination of \"just and reasonable\" terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Because this was not clearly spelled out, Plaintiffs were deprived of a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs' particular \"capacities and circumstances\" further support the conclusion that the hearing failed to satisfy due process. Integration applications like the ones at issue here are relatively new in Idaho, and the term \"just and reasonable\" has not been interpreted by the Idaho Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See Pl's Br.\n   </em>\n   at 2, Dkt. 23-1 (\"As hydrocarbon development is new to Idaho, [the December 14-15 hearing] was the first hearing under the new law.\");\n   <em>\n    Hearing Transcript\n   </em>\n   at 113:23-114:7, Dkt. 24-5 (hearing officer stating \"we are inventing the wheel\" and \"we are all sort of doing some of these things for the first time and getting a feel for these new regulations, also setting precedents for hearings to come\");\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   at 15, Dkt. 24-1 (\"The Idaho Supreme Court has not interpreted the term \"just and reasonable\" as it appears in the Act.\"). As private citizens who are not experts in the complex and specialized field of oil and gas law, Plaintiffs were especially disadvantaged by the lack of precedent to inform their understanding of what factors may be considered in a determination of \"just and reasonable\" terms. Therefore, Plaintiffs' capacities and circumstances support a finding that here, due process required a clear explanation of the factors considered in applying the \"just and reasonable\" standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As to the third\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor, holding a new hearing will impose relatively few financial or administrative costs on Defendants. The hearing will involve the same issues, parties, and facts that the previous one did. The only change required will be specification of the basis on which Defendants determine factors to be relevant or irrelevant to the determination of \"just and reasonable\" terms. Additionally, Defendants have an interest in ensuring that the integration hearing complies with due process in order to set an example for future hearings and thereby reduce the probability of further litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This conclusion does not affect the hearing officers' ability to exclude irrelevant or unnecessary testimony or evidence, or the Commission's discretion to determine what factors should be considered when determining whether the terms and conditions of integration order are \"just and reasonable.\" Rather, it simply recognizes that due process requires a meaningful opportunity to be heard, and in these circumstances, that Plaintiffs and other nonconsenting landowners know the standard which the hearing officer will apply in considering whether the integration order is just and reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This is a close case. Plaintiffs were provided with a hearing and an opportunity to be heard, and the hearing officer provided a reason for her decision. However, the lack of any explanation as to what would guide the decision of whether the terms of the integration order were just and reasonable\n   meant that Plaintiffs' opportunity to be heard was not \"meaningful,\" as required to satisfy due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

However, the record shows at least some factors could qualify because they are unrelated to compensation but could affect the terms and conditions of the integration order. For example, if a hearing officer determined that it was needed to ensure just and reasonable terms, the hearing officer could presumably alter the length or the primary term or extension of the lease, which party pays for the cost of transporting the natural gas, and whether the lease includes the right of ingress and egress over the landowner's property.\n    <em>\n     Hearing Transcript\n    </em>\n    at 62:1-15, Dkt. 24-5;\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 198:19-199:5;\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 193:4-18.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The Court encourages the Commission to revise its regulations by listing the factors to be considered when determining whether the terms of integration order are just and reasonable, in order to ensure consistency of the standards used in decision making and make those standards clear to the public.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Because bring their due process claims under \u00a7 1983, the Court need not analyze whether the State of Idaho has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity for claims brought under the OGCA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Spaulding v.
