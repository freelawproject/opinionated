(Dkt. 1). The operative complaint in this action is Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, filed on June 19, 2014. (Dkt. 8). Defendants Paul Black (\"Black\"), Stephen Casaceli (\"Casaceli\"), Richard Beall (\"Beall\"), and Joyce Krygier (\"Krygier\") (collectively \"Defendants\") have now moved for summary judgment. (Dkt. 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants contend that summary judgment is appropriate because they did not use excessive force against Plaintiff, violate Plaintiffs equal protection or First Amendment rights, or thwart Plaintiff's right of access to the courts. (Dkt. 53-8). Plaintiff responded with a cross-motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 55). In his crossmotion, Plaintiff indicated he wishes to waive all claims against Casaceli, Beall, and Krygier-thus, only pursuing claims against Black. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, he contends there are genuine issues of material fact regarding his claims against Black and requests that summary judgment as to those claims be denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). For the reasons that follow, Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 53) is granted and Plaintiff's crossmotion for summary judgment (Dkt. 55) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on March 13, 2014, alleging claims against\n   employees at the Wende Correctional Facility (\"Wende\") and the Clinton Correctional Facility. (Dkt. 1). On May 21, 2014, the Court ordered that Plaintiff's claims regarding the Clinton Correctional Facility be transferred to the Northern District of New York. (Dkt. 7). Plaintiff then filed his Amended Complaint on June 19, 2014. (Dkt. 8). The Court screened the Amended Complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) and allowed the following claims to proceed to service: (1) excessive use of force on Plaintiff by Black; (2) violation of Plaintiff's equal protection rights by Black; (3) violation of Plaintiff's First Amendment rights by Black; (4) failure to adequately train subordinates or to supervise, control, discipline, or correct unconstitutional practices or conditions by Casaceli, Beall, Dale Artus, and Brian Fisher; and (5) thwarting of Plaintiff's access to physical evidence by Krygier and Casaceli. (Dkt. 9 at 5-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 18, 2015, the remaining defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint in part. (Dkt. 13). The Court granted the motion by Decision and Order dated March 21, 2016, dismissing Dale Artus and Brian Fisher from the case and dismissing Plaintiff's claims against Defendants in their official capacities. (Dkt. 18 at 6, 8). Defendants subsequently filed their answers to Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. (Dkt. 19; Dkt. 20; Dkt. 21; Dkt. 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Discovery in this matter closed on May 20, 2017. (Dkt. 46). On July 5, 2017, Defendants filed the instant motion (Dkt. 53), seeking summary judgment on all remaining claims, namely: (1) excessive use of force on Plaintiff by Black in his personal capacity; (2) violation of Plaintiff's equal protection rights by Black in his personal capacity; (3) violation of Plaintiff's First Amendment rights by Black in his personal capacity; (4) failure to adequately train subordinates or to supervise, control, discipline, or correct unconstitutional practices or conditions by Casaceli and Beall in their personal capacities; and (5) thwarting Plaintiff's access to physical evidence by Krygier and Casaceli in their personal capacities. (Dkt. 53-8 at 3). On July 31, 2017, Plaintiff responded to Defendants' motion with a cross-motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 55). Defendants replied to Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment on August 16, 2017. (Dkt. 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The following facts are taken from Defendants' Local Rule 56 Statement of Facts (Dkt. 53-1) (\"Defendants' Statement\") and Plaintiff's responsive papers (Dkt. 55). Because Plaintiff has failed to respond to each paragraph of Defendants' Statement as required by the Local Rules of Civil Procedure (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   L. R. Civ. P. 56(a)(2) ), and because the facts set forth therein are supported by citations to admissible evidence, the Court has generally deemed them admitted for purposes of this Decision and Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N. Y. State Teamsters Conference Pension &amp; Ret. Fund v. Express Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8917073\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/640/#p648\">\n    426 F.3d 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648-49 (2d Cir. 2005). However, where Plaintiff has specifically controverted particular facts, the Court has noted the disagreement, and has viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Prison Fight\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 24, 2012, Black, Beall, and other New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (\"DOCCS\") staff responded to a seven-inmate fight in a yard at Wende. (Dkt. 53-1 at \u00b6 10). Beall was the area supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). Casaceli was not present in the yard when the fight occurred, nor did he directly supervise Black. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 82).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the time the fight broke out, there were approximately 66 inmates in the yard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Two inmates were fighting\n   when Beall arrived. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). The DOCCS officers gave numerous orders to the inmates to stop, and when neither complied, additional staff was called, including Black. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff punched one of the two fighting inmates, and then a fourth inmate attacked Plaintiff before three more inmates joined the fight. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17). When Black arrived, he saw Plaintiff fighting with another inmate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). Plaintiff was hit on the top of the head by the inmate, which knocked him back onto the ground. (Dkt. 53-4 at 9). Plaintiff then got up and ran back towards the fight. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19). Black and other staff instructed Plaintiff to stop fighting, but Plaintiff continued to try to rejoin the fight.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20). Black struck Plaintiff with his baton, and Plaintiff fell to the ground. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21). Defendants allege Black struck Plaintiff on the knee (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), while Plaintiff maintains he was struck on his head and then his knee (Dkt. 55 at 3, 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff was handcuffed while the fight was ongoing, at which time Plaintiff, who is an African American male, protested Black's actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In response to Plaintiff, Black allegedly said, \"Shut up you nigger, before I hit you again.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The entire incident, from the start of the fight to the officers placing Plaintiff in handcuffs, lasted approximately 30 seconds. (Dkt. 53-1 at \u00b6 25; Dkt. 55 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff was taken for medical examination and later transported to the Erie County Medical Center for further medical treatment. (Dkt. 53-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26). Medical staff determined Plaintiff had three abrasions on his face, a two-inch long, half-inch deep laceration on the top of his head, an abrasion on his elbow, and scratches on his hand and near his eye. (Dkt. 55 at 27). Plaintiff alleges that he received 14 staples in his scalp for the laceration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38). A 2-\u00bc inch tin can lid was recovered from the yard by DOCCS staff after the fight. (Dkt. 53-1 at \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff maintains that Black's conduct amounts to excessive use of force and a violation of Plaintiff's equal protection and First Amendment rights, (Dkt. 55 at 6), and alleged in his Amended Complaint that Casaceli and Beall failed to adequately train subordinates or to supervise, control, discipline, or correct unconstitutional practices or conditions (Dkt. 8 at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Surveillance Video\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A surveillance camera recorded the yard-fight incident described above on videotape. (Dkt. 53-1 at \u00b6 49). During a disciplinary hearing for Plaintiff regarding this incident, the video was viewed several times by Plaintiff and the presiding officer, Casaceli. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On June 19, 2012, Casaceli informed Plaintiff in a memorandum that the videotape would be preserved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54). The Inmate Record Coordinator (\"IRC\") office generally only saves surveillance videos for two weeks unless an inmate requests preservation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63). The Freedom of Information Law (\"FOIL\") office and IRC office are usually not aware of the existence of videotapes shown at inmate disciplinary hearings and had no knowledge of the videotape shown at Plaintiff's hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 56-57). Plaintiff sent a FOIL request asking for the videotape of the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58). An IRC staff member responded to Plaintiff's request under Krygier's name and\n   advised Plaintiff that the videotape no longer existed because more than two weeks had passed since the yard fight. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64). The video was later discovered in the hearing packet and was provided to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A copy of the surveillance video was provided to and reviewed by the Court in connection with the instant motion for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-4 at 9). The surveillance video comports with the description of the yard fight set forth above. Plaintiff acknowledges that the surveillance video \"accurately shows the events on May 24, 2012....\" (Dkt. 55 at \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleged Casaceli and Krygier violated his constitutional rights because the initial response to his request for the videotape thwarted his access to physical evidence and consequently to the courts. (Dkt. 8 at 16-2; Dkt. 9 at 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment should be granted if the moving party establishes \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The record before the Court demonstrates that Black used force on Plaintiff to restore order in the prison yard, not to inflict injury because of racial prejudice. Black struck Plaintiff during the course of a seven-person prison fight after Plaintiff ignored orders from DOCCS staff to stop fighting. (Dkt. 53-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21). Once Plaintiff was on the ground and no longer trying to engage in the fight, Black immediately stopped using force. (Dkt. 53-1 at \u00b6 21, 23). While Plaintiff was being handcuffed, the other inmates were still fighting, and it was at this time that Black allegedly threatened to hit Plaintiff again and used the racial slur. (Dkt. 53-1 at \u00b6 23-25; Dkt. 55 at 5). These circumstances indicate that Defendant Black's use of force and subsequent threat were attempts to control the situation in the prison yard, not to hurt Plaintiff because of his race. More importantly, there is no evidence in the record from which a trier of fact could reasonably conclude that Black would have treated a similarly-situated individual of a different race-namely, an inmate who had ignored direct orders and was attempting to rejoin a fight in progress-any differently than Plaintiff. Plaintiff cannot establish an equal protection violation on these facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stone v.

On the record before the Court, Plaintiff has made no showing that Black had a high risk of behaving inappropriately, or that Beall or Casaceli knew or should have known of any such risk. To the contrary, the record shows Defendant Black received training prior to working for DOCCS and takes continuing training each year in use of force. (Dkt. 53-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 84-85). Therefore, a reasonable finder of fact could not determine that Beall or Casaceli failed to train Black in violation of Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Thwarting of Access to the Courts Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff claims Casaceli and Krygier thwarted his access to physical evidence in violation of his constitutional rights.

To prevail, Plaintiff must demonstrate Defendants' actions frustrated a non-frivolous underlying claim. The uncontroverted evidence shows Casaceli informed Plaintiff in a memorandum that the videotape of the prison fight where Black struck Plaintiff would be preserved. (Dkt. 53-1 at \u00b6 54). After requesting a copy of the video, Plaintiff initially received a response from the IRC under Krygier's name mistakenly advising him that the video no longer existed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64). However, the video was later discovered in the hearing packet and was then provided to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77). Plaintiff subsequently filed the instant lawsuit. (Dkt. 1). In other words, Plaintiff ultimately was able to obtain the physical evidence he sought and to pursue this matter without any interference. Therefore, a reasonable trier of fact would find that Casaceli and Krygier did not frustrate Plaintiff's access to the courts and that their actions were at most a minor inconvenience for Plaintiff. Defendants are therefore entitled to summary judgment with respect to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Qualified Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants also contend that they are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to all of Plaintiff's claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-8 at 22-25). \"The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages 'unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.' \"\n   <em>\n    McGowan v.

Here, because the Court holds a reasonable trier of fact would find Plaintiff did not produce enough evidence to demonstrate that Defendants violated his constitutional rights, the Court does not reach the issue of whether Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 53) is\n   granted, and Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 55) is denied.

(Dkt. 55 at 4). However, as discussed more fully below, the Court has reviewed the DOCCS' surveillance videotape of this incident, and while the video has no audio, it unquestionably shows the DOCCS guards communicating with the prisoners, including Plaintiff, to stop fighting. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 53-4 at 9).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiff suffered some harm as a result of Black's use of force. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 57 at 3). Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds the objective portion of the\n    <em>\n     Hudson\n    </em>\n    test to be satisfied for purposes of Defendants' motion and focuses the remainder of its analysis on the first component.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
