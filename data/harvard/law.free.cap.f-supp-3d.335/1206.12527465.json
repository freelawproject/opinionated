(Dkt. No. 65.) An opposition was filed. (Dkt. No. 69.) Defendants filed a reply. (Dkt. No. 75.) Pursuant to the Court's order, Plaintiff filed a sur-reply on September 20, 2018. (Dkt. Nos. 76, 77.) A hearing was held on October 12, 2018. Jessica Reimelt, Esq. appeared on behalf of the United States, and Defendants Charles Le Beau and Victoria Le Beau, proceeding pro se, appeared. Based on the reasoning below, the Court GRANTS in part Defendants' motion for a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 23, 2017, the United States of America (\"Plaintiff\") filed a complaint to\n   foreclose judgment liens\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on real property against Charles (\"Charles\") and Victoria (\"Victoria\") LeBeau (collectively \"Defendants\"). (Dkt. No. 1.) On September 29, 2017, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint. (Dkt. No. 33.) On December 8, 2017, the Court denied Defendants' motion to dismiss and granted in part Victoria's request for a stay as to Victoria's tax years 1995, 1997-1999 because on August 30, 2017, Victoria had filed a claim for innocent spouse relief for tax years 1992-1995, 1997-1999, the years for which judgement was entered in the underlying case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 42 at 11\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; Dkt. No. 36-4, Ds' RJN, Ex. 1.) However, the Court denied Victoria's request for a stay for the tax years 1992-1994 because she had already sought innocent spouse relief as to the 1992-1994 tax years which was denied by the IRS on April 23, 2000 under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206015\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) and which was not timely appealed with the Tax Court. (Dkt. No. 42 at 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Case No. 10cv817-GPC(NLS);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 27-17 at 1 (IRS Determination).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 6, 2018, after briefing by the parties, the Court granted Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. (Dkt. No. 47.) On June 11, 2018, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint (\"SAC\") seeking to: (1) determine that the United States' judgment and tax liens attaches to all property held by Victoria LeBeau, including real property located at 1999 Via Segovia, La Jolla, CA 92037 (the \"Property\"); (2) determine that Victoria LeBeau holds Charles LeBeau's one-half interest in the Property as nominee for Charles LeBeau or, in the alternative, set aside the transfers of Charles LeBeau's interest in the Property to Victoria LeBeau and Casa de Erin, LLC as fraudulent conveyances; and, (3) to enforce the United States' judgment and tax liens against Charles and Victoria LeBeau upon the Property. (Dkt. No. 58.) On July 17, 2018, the Court denied Defendants' motion for declaratory judgment. (Dkt. No. 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the pendency of this case, on August 30, 2017, Victoria filed a request for innocent spouse relief for multiple tax years, 1992-1995 and 1997-1999. (Dkt. No. 36-4, Ds' RJN, Ex. 1.) On May 16, 2018, the IRS issued a Final Determination as to all these tax years. (Dkt. No. 65-4, Charles' Decl., Exs., 1, 2.) As to tax year 1992, the IRS denied innocent spouse relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206015\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and (c) as not timely filed. (Dkt. No. 65-4, Charles' Decl., Ex. 1 at 2.) Despite being untimely, the IRS denied equitable relief under \u00a7 6015(f) determining that the requirements were not met and concluding, \"[y]ou received transferred assets from your spouse or ex-spouse as part of a fraudulent scheme or for the principal purpose of avoiding tax or the payment of tax.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) For the tax year 1993, innocent spouse relief was denied under \u00a7\u00a7 6015(b), (c) and (f). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.) For the tax year 1994, innocent spouse relief was denied under \u00a7\u00a7 6015(b), (c) and (f). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.) For the tax year 1995, innocent spouse relief under \u00a7 6015(f) was partially granted in\n   the amount of $193,272.00 and denied in the amount of $40,437.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) For the tax year 1997, innocent spouse relief was denied under \u00a7\u00a7 6015(b), (c) and (f). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.) For the tax year 1998, innocent spouse relief was denied under \u00a7 6015(f). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24.) For the tax year 1999, innocent spouse relief was denied under \u00a7 6015(f). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 22, 2018, Victoria filed a petition with the United States Tax Court challenging the IRS' determinations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 2.) On July 30, 2018, Defendants filed a motion for a stay of the case pending a ruling by the U.S. Tax Court as well as any appeal to the Ninth Circuit. (Dkt. No. 65.) Around July 31, 2018, Defendants filed a \"First Amendment to Petition\" in the U.S. Tax Court. (Dkt. No. 75, Ds' Reply, Charles' Decl., Ex. 1 at 8.) Around September 5, 2018, Charles filed a Notice of Intervention in the Tax Court case. (Dkt. No. 75, Ds' Reply, Charles' Decl., Ex. 2 at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to the SAC, Charles and Victoria LeBeau were married, now legally separated and currently reside together at 1999 Via Segovia, La Jolla, CA 92037 (the \"Property\"). (Dkt No. 58, SAC \u00b6 3.) The United States has judgment and federal tax liens against both Charles and Victoria Le Beau, and the United States seeks to enforce its judgment and tax liens against their interests in the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Between 1994 and 2008, a delegate of the Secretary of the Treasury made assessments against Charles and Victoria LeBeau for federal individual income taxes, penalties and interest for the tax years 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998 and 1999. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Despite timely notice and demand, the LeBeaus failed to pay the assessments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) As a result, federal tax liens arose in favor of the United States and against all property and rights to property belonging to Charles and Victoria LeBeau as of the assessment dates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) From 1995 to 2008, a delegate of the Secretary of the Treasury made assessments against Charles LeBeau for federal payroll taxes owed by him and his sole proprietorship, the Law Offices of Charles P. LeBeau, for eighteen tax periods between 1994 and 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 19, 2010, the United States brought a civil action against Victoria LeBeau, Charles LeBeau, and Charles LeBeau's sole proprietorship\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking to reduce to judgment the federal tax assessments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) On October 29, 2012, the Court entered a money judgment against Charles and Victoria LeBeau with respect to the federal income tax liabilities in the amount of $1,157,165.85 plus statutory interest accruing after July 1, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) The LeBeaus have not made any payments towards the money judgment and it remains unsatisfied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) On October 29, 2012, the Court also entered a money judgment against Charles LeBeau, with respect to the employment tax liabilities, in the amount of $371,257.66 plus statutory interest accruing after July 1, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Charles LeBeau has not made any payments towards the money judgment and it remains unsatisfied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 18, 1980, Charles and Victoria LeBeau acquired the Property as \"Husband and Wife, as joint tenants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) On April 1, 1987, by quitclaim deed, Charles and Victoria transferred title to the Property to Victoria LeBeau for no consideration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) By grant deed dated May 6, 1988, Victoria LeBeau transferred title to the Property to Charles and\n   Victoria LeBeau, as joint tenants for no consideration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) On May 11, 1988, five days after the transfer, Charles and Victoria LeBeau executed a deed of trust on the Property in favor of Security Allied Services to secure a loan in the amount of $305,250.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) By quitclaim deed dated August 9, 1989, Charles and Victoria LeBeau transferred title to the Property solely to Victoria LeBeau for no consideration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By interspousal transfer grant deed dated March 22, 1991, Charles LeBeau again transferred his interest in the Property to his wife, Victoria LeBeau, for no consideration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) On April 10, 2003, Charles LeBeau signed and filed Articles of Organization with the California Secretary of State for an entity known as Casa de Erin, LLC, for which he was the registered agent, and which has since been suspended by the California Secretary of State. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) During its existence, Casa de Erin, LLC was the alter ego/nominee of Charles LeBeau and/or Victoria LeBeau. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) By quitclaim deed dated April 22, 2003, Victoria LeBeau transferred title to the Property to Casa de Erin, LLC, for no consideration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) By quitclaim deed dated January 12, 2006, Casa de Erin, LLC rescinded the deed and transferred the Property back to Victoria LeBeau, for no consideration, who currently remains the Property's nominal title holder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Upon information and belief, Charles LeBeau has continued to reside at the Property and has retained all the benefits and burdens of ownership. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28, 29)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Despite Victoria LeBeau's purported sole ownership in the Property, on July 24, 2014, Charles LeBeau executed a mortgage modification agreement for the Property with Bank of America, the Trustee for the Property's mortgage, and he is listed as the borrower in documents recorded with the San Diego County Recorder's Office on August 1, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) For the 2014 tax year, Bank of America issued an IRS Form 1098 to Charles LeBeau for $4,598 in interest paid for the mortgage on the Property; for the 2015 tax year, Bank of America issued an IRS Form 1098 to Charles LeBeau for $4,652 in interest paid for the Property's mortgage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The SAC claims that Charles and Victoria LeBeau continue to be the true and beneficial owners of the Property and Victoria LeBeau holds Charles LeBeau's interest in the Property as his nominee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38, 39.) Alternatively, on information and belief, the transfers of the Property were sham transactions made with the intent and purpose to hinder, delay, or defraud the creditors of Charles and Victoria LeBeau, including the United States, and are therefore void. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Alternatively, on information and belief, the transfers were not reasonably equivalent exchanges in value and were made at a time when Charles LeBeau knew he had, would have, or intended to incur debts beyond his ability to pay as they became due. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 14, 2013, the United States recorded an abstract of the two judgments obtained in Case No. 10cv817 with the San Diego County Recorder's Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f), the United States is entitled to enforce its judgment liens upon the Property, to have the Property sold at a judicial sale free and clear of all rights, titles, claims, liens, and interests of the parties to this action, and to have the proceeds distributed, after payment of the costs of sale, to the United States and to the defendants in accordance with the amount and priority of their claims as they establish in this action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) On April 3, 2018, the IRS recorded a Notice of Federal Tax Lien with the San Diego County Recorder of Deeds at Doc. No. 2018-0130582 against the LeBeaus for\n   the federal payroll tax liabilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) The SAC asserts three causes of action for fraudulent transfer and nominee liability, enforcement of judgment liens, and enforcement of federal tax liens.

(Dkt. No. 42 at 11.)

No. 27-16), with a denial on April 25, 2003 by the IRS and the denial was not appealed with the U.S. Tax Court. (Dkt. No. 77-1 at 4.)

Moreover, while the request for innocent spouse relief was wholly denied on April 25, 2003, (Dkt. No. 77-1), interestingly, on May 16, 2018, the IRS granted \u00a7 6015(f) relief in part in the amount of $193,272.00 and denied relief as to $40,437.00 for the same tax year. (Dkt. No. 65-4 at 17.)
