MCFADDEN, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a case about a professor's poor choices and the disciplinary actions that followed. Reginald Robinson is a tenured law professor at Howard University. During a lecture on agency law, he distributed a quiz to his class. One of the quiz questions described in graphic detail types of body waxes and the way aestheticians perform them. Mr. Robinson called on two female students to discuss their answers to the question. They later reported that the exchange made them feel uncomfortable and that at least one other student had left the classroom. After investigating, University officials determined that the question was indeed inappropriate and issued Mr. Robinson a confidential letter of reprimand\n   . He was also required to participate in sensitivity training, to submit future quiz and exam questions to the Dean's Office for approval, and to have a few of his future lectures monitored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Impenitent, Mr. Robinson sued the University and various University officials. He alleges breach of contract, bad faith, violations Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (\"Title IX\"), sex discrimination, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and other claims. The Court will dismiss some of these allegations for failure to state a claim. Because the Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and because they have shown that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, the Court will grant the Defendants summary judgment on the remainder of Mr. Robinson's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the fall of 2015, Mr. Robinson taught a course called \"Agency, Partnerships, and Other Unincorporated Business Associations.\" Am. Compl. 13, ECF No. 19. To test students' understanding of the concepts covered, he often used in-class quizzes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Meaningful participation\" in these evaluations \"require[d] students to reveal their choices and to defend those choices based on the legal principles and relevant/material facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. The relevant part of the quiz question at issue said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Among other services, P offered Brazilian and bikini waxes - sometimes called \"Sphynx,\" bare waxing, or Hollywood waxing.... T looked confused, and so A explained that a Full Brazilian (\"FB\") would render T hairless from belly button to buttocks, and a FB required [that] T would be naked from the waist down. A FB required A to touch T's body and to adjust T's body so that A could access every follicle of pubic hair. Next, A explained a Modified Brazilians [sic] (\"MB\"). A MB left a thin strip of hair at the top of T's genitalia,\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , a \"landing strip.\" T opted for FB. A again told T that A would have to touch T's genitals to complete the waxing. T agreed, and T signed the service contract and initialed the space for acknowledging A's information. T got undressed in a private salon, where T also drank hot herbal tea. At A's behest, T, w [sic] who was waist down naked, got on the waxing table. Once on the table, with instrumental tones wafting, T drifted into light sleep; A completed the FB. Upon awaking, T felt physically uncomfortable, asking A if A had touched T improperly....

Am. Compl. Ex. 25, ECF No. 13 at 208. The professor pressed her to answer the question, as he \"still wanted to know what choice she had made.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also sought an answer to the hypothetical from a second female student, before moving on to the remainder of his lecture.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 208-209.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The two students filed complaints against him with the University. Am. Compl. 3. Based on their allegations, Candi Smiley, the University's Deputy Title IX Coordinator, issued Mr. Robinson a Notice of Complaint. Compl. Ex. 10a, ECF No. 1\n   at 188. It said that the University's Title IX Office would investigate his conduct as required by federal law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It specified that Mr. Robinson was alleged to have engaged in \"acts of sexual harassment\" and \"acts of gender-based discrimination\" in violation of the University's Title IX Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And it explained that the \"charges will be 'sustained' if it is found that the important facts contained in an allegation are more likely true than not\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that those facts violate one or more of\" the University's Title IX Policy standards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Notice also described Mr. Robinson's rights and the decision-making process. He had the right to submit a written response to the charges against him, to verbally present his position to the Deputy Title IX Coordinator, and to retain counsel for any interviews with the University.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 190. The letter warned Mr. Robinson that the \"decision of the Title IX Decisional Authority is the final administrative action of the University and is not subject to appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189-90. The \"Decisional Authority\" is \"the person or persons who will review the final Report of Investigation\" prepared by the Deputy Title IX Coordinator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After completing her investigation, Ms. Smiley issued a Report of Investigation and Findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Ms. Smiley found insufficient evidence to sustain the charge of gender discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Report identified the University's Provost, Anthony Wutoh, as the Title IX Decisional Authority.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Upon completing his review, Mr. Wutoh issued a Notice of Findings. It informed Mr. Robinson that the University agreed with the Report's conclusions, and that he would therefore be subject to disciplinary action. Compl. Ex. 24, ECF No. 1-1 at 47-48. A confidential letter detailing his conduct, the actions taken, and the possible punishments for future violations of the Title IX Policy was \"placed in his file.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Robinson appealed this decision in a letter to Mr. Wutoh. Am. Compl. 24. In response, the Provost explained that, \"[i]n accordance with the Howard University Title IX Policy, I serve as the ... Title IX Decisional Authority. As with all cases, I carefully reviewed the recommendation from the Title IX Office before rendering a decision in this matter. The decision reached ... is final, and is not subject to reconsideration or appeal.\" Am. Compl. Ex. 13, ECF No. 13 at 196.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dissatisfied, Mr. Robinson pursued several strategies to force a reversal of the decision. He sent \"his documents to a [sic] FIRE,\" a nonprofit organization he believed could help him \"end the sex discrimination he faced.\" Am. Compl. 25. He appealed the Provost's decision to the University's Faculty Grievance Commission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And when these efforts failed, Mr. Robinson filed a gender discrimination claim against the University with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n   (the \"EEOC\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dismissal and Notice of Rights, Compl. Ex. 31, ECF No. 1-1 at 65. The EEOC dismissed his complaint, as it was \"unable to conclude that the information obtained establishes violations of the [applicable] statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Robinson then filed this case. He accuses the University, Mr. Wutoh, Ms. Smiley, and Title IX Coordinator Vanessa Love of \"knowingly fraudulent,\" \"deliberately deceptive,\" and \"arbitrary and capricious\" conduct. Am. Compl. 1, 3. The operative complaint features several claims, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Breach of contract and the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Erroneous outcome, deliberate indifference, and unlawful retaliation in violation of Title IX;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Negligence; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 A request for declaratory and injunctive relief styled as a claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Defendants maintain that the actions taken by the University complied with its Title IX Policy and all relevant laws. Thus, they moved to dismiss or, based on the extra-pleadings evidence before the Court, for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Mr. Robinson began working for the University in 1994, and he relies on the 1993 Faculty Handbook in support of his argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. 10. It notes that \"Sections 2 and 3 of this handbook ... are incorporated into the individual contract of employment of each faculty member, and they are subject to change by the Board of Trustees as conditions require.\" Compl. Ex. 18, ECF No. 1-1 at 24. Section 2.2.1.2 of the Handbook discusses sexual harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. It states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   It is the policy of Howard University to maintain the university community as a place of work and study for staff, faculty, and students free of sexual harassment and all forms of sexual intimidation and exploitation.\n   <em>\n    The entire text of the policy and procedures is set forth in Appendix B\n   </em>\n   . All faculty members as well as staff and students are subject to this policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Appendix B describes the University's \"Sexual Harassment Policy and Procedures\" approved by the Board of Trustees in 1989.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. Ex. 3, ECF No. 20-3 at 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Defendants correctly assert that the University publishes a separate policy called the \"Title IX (Student) Policy on Prohibited Sexual Harassment and Gender-Based Discrimination in Education Programs and Activities.\" Defs.' Mot. at 15; Ex. 4, ECF No. 20-4 at 2. This document's original \"Effective Date\" is listed as June 5, 1999, suggesting that it is distinct from the 1989 statement on sexual harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But evaluating the allegations in the light most favorable to Mr. Robinson, the Court assumes that the University intended the operative version of its Title IX Policy to be incorporated into faculty's employment contracts. The language of the two policies is substantially similar in many important respects. For instance, both define and provide examples of sexual harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. Ex. 3 at 107; Defs.' Mot. Ex. 4 at 8. Thus, the University could have breached its contract with Mr. Robinson if it violated its Title IX Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   No such violation occurred. Mr. Robinson claims that the University \"refused to give Plaintiff proper, meaningful notice of the fact specific and spurious allegations made by the two complaining female law students.\" Am. Compl. 66. The Policy includes a section titled \"Notice to the Respondent.\" Compl. Ex. 10b, ECF No. 1-1 at 5.

Ex. 10a, ECF No. 1 at 188-191.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Mr. Robinson acknowledged receipt of this Notice, argued that it was deficient, denied the allegations against him, and asked for more details about the complaints.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. 16, ECF. No. 1-1 at 15-18. Consistent with the Title IX Policy and the Notice of Complaint, Ms. Smiley scheduled an oral interview with Mr. Robinson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. 20, ECF No. 1-1 at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   After that interview, Mr. Robinson wrote that he was \"finally glad to know the underlying circumstances behind these allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In an email to Ms. Smiley, he defended his quiz question by asking her to visit a website depicting men's underwear and told her \"[y]ou'll see that men wear bikini underwear, too.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also suggested that he would \"send [her] additional information, so that [she] can appreciate the context from which [he] was working\" when he wrote the question.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Over the next few days, he sent Ms. Smiley several emails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. 21-23, ECF No. 1-1 at 40-46.

So, based on the Notice of Complaint, his correspondence with Ms. Smiley, and the many arguments he raised in his defense, Mr. Robinson had ample notice of and opportunity to respond to the claims made against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Next, Mr. Robinson argues that the findings in Ms. Smiley's Report were based on the application of a \"subjective experience test, which gave undue evidentiary weight and institutional imprimatur to the female victims' narratives ....\" Am. Compl. 66. He also contends that the Report \"completely lacked the required findings of material fact on the legal predicate for sexual harassment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67. These assertions fall flat. The Report employed a preponderance of the evidence standard and is replete with supporting factual findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. Ex. 1 at 3-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Ms. Smiley concluded, for example, that Professor Robinson \"exhibited a past pattern of behavior that makes it more likely than not[ ] that he has created hypotheticals of a sexual nature that made students uncomfortable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. From 1998 - 2002, Mr. Robinson sent several \"emails of explicit sexual jokes\" to University faculty members. Later, \"a faculty member alleged Professor Robinson made inappropriate comments to her about socializing with him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. And the Associate Provost for Faculty Development reported that \"Professor Robinson's exams were always among the most challenging to review ... we sent them back to him to change hypotheticals that we thought were too ... I don't want to say sexual [sic] explicit but they're just insensitive ... to women.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. Thus, far from relying solely on the subjective testimony of the complainants, Ms. Smiley considered objective contextual evidence in determining that Mr. Robinson's question constituted unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Mr. Robinson also believes that the Policy mandated that the University complete its investigation within \"60 calendar days\" of receiving the complaint. Am. Compl. 66. Not so. True, the Policy states that the Title IX Officer \"will have 60 calendar days to conduct an impartial, thorough and timely investigation of all complaints alleging\n   harassment or discrimination under this policy.\" Compl. Ex. 10b, ECF No. 1-1 at 6. But it also allows the Officer to take additional time, requiring only that the she \"notify the\n   <em>\n    Complainant\n   </em>\n   , in writing, that additional time is needed for completion of the investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). There is no evidence, and Mr. Robinson does not allege, that such written notice was not provided to the students who lodged the complaint. In any event, any breach of this requirement would implicate the complainants' rights, not his.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In sum, the University did not breach Mr. Robinson's contract or the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. The Defendants' investigation of his conduct complied with the University's Title IX Policy. By all available indicia, the fact-finding process appears to have been impartial, thorough, and reasonable. So the Court will grant summary judgment for the Defendants on Mr. Robinson's contract claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In an audacious move, Mr. Robinson next argues that he, rather than his students, is the victim of a Title IX violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. 69-76. He suggests that, by \"erroneously finding [against] and disciplining Plaintiff\" the University violated Title IX because its actions were motivated by the \"anti-male bias\" of Ms. Smiley, the Title IX Coordinator, and Mr. Wutoh.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73. This claim fails under the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal standard. In the alternative, relying on Ms. Smiley's Title IX Report, the Court finds that, even if Mr. Robinson has sufficiently alleged a Title IX claim, the Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 provides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program receiving Federal financial assistance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

In fact, the available evidence shows that the University applied its facially gender-neutral Title IX policy in a reasonable manner.

Even if Mr. Robinson's investigation were handled\n   poorly, Ms. Smiley improperly weighed the evidence against him, and he was denied a complete opportunity to contest the allegations against him, he has still failed to sufficiently allege conduct so outrageous and extreme as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency.

His IIED claim fails to clear the bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   His NIED claim falls short, too. Under the District of Columbia's laws, a plaintiff may recover for NIED under either of two theories. First, the \"well-established 'zone of danger' test allows a plaintiff to recover 'for mental distress if the defendant's actions caused the plaintiff to be in danger of physical injury and if, as a result, the plaintiff feared for his own safety.' \"\n   <em>\n    Islar v.

Second, a plaintiff can recover if there is a \"special relationship\" between the parties that \"necessarily implicates the plaintiff's emotional well-being.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7280234\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/22/789/#p796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Mr. Robinson does not allege the existence of a zone of danger or any risk of physical injury.

And he suggests that the University \"intentionally, recklessly and/or negligently fail[ed] to conduct a proper conflicts check to assure that Plaintiff's appeal was decided by an unbiased investigator other than by Smiley who was biased and conflicted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   His negligence claim suffers from the same fatal defect as the rest of his allegations. It is based on unfounded speculation and conclusory statements. Negligent hiring or supervision, for instance, requires a showing that \"an employer knew or should have known its employee behaved in a dangerous or otherwise incompetent manner, and that the employer, armed with that actual or constructive knowledge, failed to adequately supervise the employee.\"\n   <em>\n    Giles v.

Thus, Mr. Robinson has failed to sufficiently allege a negligence claim. And, even if Mr. Robinson he has adequately stated claims for IIED, NIED, and negligence, Ms. Smiley's Title IX Report and the University's actions discussed above show that neither she, Mr. Wutoh, nor other University officials intentionally, recklessly, or negligently caused Mr. Robinson the emotional distress he felt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Finally, Count 10 of the First Amended Complaint seeks declaratory and\n   injunctive relief. Am. Compl. 98. Mr. Robinson contends that his \"career opportunities have been severely damaged,\" and he seeks a permanent injunction requiring the University \"to eliminate the anti-male bias and improper, unknown and unpublished processes and procedures\" used by the Title IX Office. \"A request for declaratory judgment constitutes a form of relief, not a cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Fitts v.
