Brennan Jr.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   No deep reading of history books is necessary to know that widespread pretrial detention is a relatively recent development in American law. A district judge's consideration of a defendant's danger to the community in deciding whether to set bail is a similarly new innovation. Indeed, because, dating back to the English common law until just a few decades ago, pretrial detention was limited to the question of whether the Defendant would return to court, orders of detention were exceedingly rare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A more common thread over time, however, is that, both historically and under our current system, the Government has always borne the burden of persuading the Court that pretrial detention is necessary. Within our current federal system, the Court can immure a pre-trial defendant if the Government proves that the defendant presents a risk of flight or a danger to the community. Under risk of flight, the Government must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, both that a defendant presents a risk of flight if not detained and that there are no conditions which will reasonably assure the defendant's presence if she is released. Under dangerousness, the Government must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, not only a defendant's potential danger to the community, but also that no conditions can reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community. This quite meaningful showing will only apply to a limited number of individuals. This onerous standard also reflects an acknowledgment that as Justice Marshall opined, a defendant's interest in maintaining her liberty before trial is paramount, and an essential component of protecting the presumption of innocence. Due to the tremendous stakes involved, an assessment of whether an individual must be detained before trial must be conducted on a case-by-case basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Synthesizing these essential principles, the obvious conclusion is that courts\n   must be vigilant not to unduly rely upon a proffer of a set of accusations and weighty evidence in support thereof to substantiate an order of pretrial detention. After all, in this District, among many others, such a strong proffer is typical. Rather, a careful balancing of all of the relevant factors is essential to ensuring that not even one defendant is unnecessarily deprived of her interest in liberty pending trial, all while protecting the community at large, and, by extension, ensuring the integrity of and respect for the criminal system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 25, 2018, I heard the Government's appeal of the duty magistrate's decision to grant bail to Ramon Paulino, the sole defendant in this matter (\"Paulino\" or \"Defendant\"). Although I concluded that the Government had not met its burden in this case, I do not take these allegations lightly. They involve the Defendant and fellow gang members assaulting a minor on the side of a highway in broad daylight. It goes without saying that these activities are dangerous. What the Government has failed to provide, however, is sufficient evidence demonstrating that there are no conditions, such as home incarceration and electronic monitoring, that will reasonably assure the safety of the community. They further failed to demonstrate, for reasons set forth herein, that conditions could not be put in place mitigating any flight risk he presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following my decision, the Government took another appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On July 30, 2018, the Circuit remanded the case with instruction to elaborate on my rationale for granting bail. This memorandum opinion now expands upon my earlier ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Charges\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This case arises out of a multi-year, ongoing investigation in this District of a gang known as the \"Trinitarios,\" operating in the New York City area and elsewhere and comprised primarily of males of Dominican descent. Complaint (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 6. The Trinitarios have certain measures to ensure the loyalty of their membership, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8a-8d, and have rivalries with other gangs in the New York area. Compl. \u00b6 8e. Their ongoing rivalry with the \"Bloods\" gang has resulted in fights both in prison and on the streets. Compl. \u00b6 8e. Many members of the Trinitarios sell narcotics in the area and smuggle drugs into prisons. Compl. \u00b6 8f.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 18, 2018, a passenger in a car travelling near the East Gun Hill Road Exit of the Bronx River Parkway in the Bronx, New York observed, and produced video footage of, approximately twelve individuals, among them Paulino, beating and stabbing a minor victim (the \"Victim\") during the day in the median strip of the multi-lane highway. Compl. \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Video of Incident. The Victim was a member of the \"Grizzlies,\" a set of the \"Bloods\" gang. Compl. \u00b6 13. As corroborated by the bystander's video and further photographs, an eyewitness identification via a photo array, as well as a confession later obtained from Paulino, Paulino lifted a piece of wooden debris over his head and slammed it downward two times in the vicinity of where the Victim was lying. Compl. \u00b6 10, 15, 16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Video at 00:02-00:06.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The eyewitness observed Paulino\n   actually hitting the Victim with the debris. Compl. \u00b6 15. At the end of the video, an individual appearing to be the Victim gets up and starts to walk away from the scene. Video at 00:10-00:19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After several bystanders called 9-1-1, law enforcement officers responding to the scene observed a group of individuals, including Paulino, running away from the location of the assault. Compl. \u00b6 14. The NYPD arrested Paulino and transported him to the precinct, where he was\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   , interviewed, then released. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16. Paulino admitted that he was in a park adjacent to the location of the assault with various members of the Trinitarios, before they chased after the Victim and he followed. Compl. \u00b6 16b. He admitted to witnessing the assault of the Victim, but he denied participating in it. Compl. \u00b6 16a-c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to hospital personnel, the Victim was stabbed approximately thirteen to sixteen times, with stab wounds in his lung and kidney. Compl.\u00b6 11a. The Victim went into cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital, but was revived, and later received emergency surgery to address his wounds. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11b-c. Friends of the Victim later indicated that a high-ranking Trinitarios member had ordered a \"hit\" on the Victim on account of a dispute between the Victim's girlfriend and a female member of the Trinitarios. Compl. \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On or about June 21, 2018, Paulino was re-arrested,\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   , and agreed to be re-interviewed by investigators. Compl. \u00b6 16. Paulino again denied having participated in the assault, but after being shown the bystander's video, he admitted his involvement, and that he was the one swinging the wooden debris near the Victim. Compl. \u00b6 16c. Although initially denying membership in the Trinitarios, he later admitted it. Compl. \u00b6 16d.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 22, 2018, the Government filed a criminal complaint charging Paulino with one count of assault with a deadly weapon in aid of racketeering (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), (3) ).

The facts of\n   <em>\n    Sabhnani\n   </em>\n   -a non-presumption case where the Second Circuit approved of home monitoring and electronic surveillance, among other conditions-thus warrant some discussion.

And though the magistrate had approved of a bail package with home detention with electronic monitoring, with expenses borne by Defendants,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 68, the district court took issue with Defendants' insufficient financial disclosures, and further found home detention \"impractical because it would require the imposition of onerous monitoring conditions on defendants' children....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Defendants appealed, and the Circuit vacated and remanded, concluding\n   that the physical restrictions proposed by the parties-which included home confinement, electronic monitoring, 24-hour visual surveillance with on-side private security guards-were \"extraordinary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77, 79.

But the reality is that this case likely falls somewhere closer to the tropics on a hypothetical globe of violent criminal conduct. Certainly, this is neither the worst case the U.S. Attorney's Office has ever seen (6/25/18 Tr. at 23:14-15), nor was it a schoolyard fight in which Paulino merely got in \"two licks\" (6/25/18 Tr. at 25:4-6). But, it is safe to say that this was a brutal and heinous attack, in which the Victim was so badly beaten and stabbed that he went into cardiac arrest, was left hospitalized, and required emergency surgery. It is a crime of violence, one which the law, and the Court, takes very seriously.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203156\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) (defining crime of violence as \"an offense that has an element of the offense the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\"). Whether Paulino's personal involvement was simply impulsive, or whether he was aware of the alleged \"hit\" on this rival gang member, the conduct he is alleged to have undertaken conveys an unacceptable disregard of human life. That this is just one episode of prolonged gang violence taking place in this District only exacerbates the severity of the offense conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Certainly, the evidence against Defendant appears to be weighty. The nature of the attack is corroborated by a cell-phone video starting mid-way through the attack up to its conclusion seconds later.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Not only the video and photographs, but also bystander accounts and Paulino's own words identify him as the\n   individual swinging an object downward at the Victim. However, the case is in its infant stages.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But the circumstances of the instant offense, and Paulino's specific role in it, as well as the lack of certain aggravating factors, are notable to the Court in assessing whether there are no conditions that would reasonably assure the safety of the community. The attack itself, while allegedly premeditated, does not appear to have been carried out with any measure of advance planning or sophistication on Paulino's part, or that of anyone involved.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Sept. 10, 2009 (denying bail in presumption case where \"defendant [was] a cunning individual with dangerous proclivities who typically enlist[ed] others to violate the law on his behalf\"). It occurred in the median of a highway in broad daylight, required crossing multiple lanes of traffic, and involved what appear to have been improvised weapons.

The video evidence suggests that Paulino was acting, at most, as a henchman or follower within a group of many young men, most of whom were assailing the Victim as well. The Government need not prove that Paulino had any enhanced role in order to prove dangerousness. But the fact that such proof is not required does not eliminate consideration of Paulino's role in the offense, and in the gang generally. His role not only relates to his history and characteristics, but also contributes to assessing the specific danger that releasing Paulino possibly presents: that he may show up with a group of Trinitarios to beat or hector the gang's enemies. As will be explained more fully below, this danger can be effectively mitigated with home incarceration and electronic monitoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Regarding Defendant's other personal characteristics, though he has a criminal history, it is not as substantial as one might expect for someone deemed so dangerous that pre-trial detention is mandated, consisting of one 2018 disorderly conduct conviction (a violation) and one 2015 conviction for possession of burglar's tools (a misdemeanor).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Paulino is also expecting a child in October, ostensibly providing an incentive not to commit further crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Thus, while the Government has shown that Paulino presents some danger to the community, they have not proven by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions could be set that reasonably assure the safety of the community.

And though this case differs from\n   <em>\n    Sabhnani\n   </em>\n   in a few obvious ways, the Government has similarly failed to demonstrate, with clear and convincing evidence, that the proposed home confinement and electronic monitoring would not \"reasonably mitigate\" any concerns that Defendant is a safety risk.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202110795\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    Sabhani\n   </em>\n   was a risk of flight case, the violent conduct in this case, though certainly severe, is no more severe than that at issue in\n   <em>\n    Sabhnani\n   </em>\n   . The primary distinction is that Paulino is a member of the Trinitarios. However,\n   <em>\n    Orena\n   </em>\n   does not suggest, nor would the Court be justified in concluding, that gang membership alone renders these conditions ineffective. If anything, the\n   <em>\n    Colombo\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Orena\n   </em>\n   line of cases reflects a unique concern with\n   <em>\n    leaders\n   </em>\n   of gangs, or at the least primary actors in gangs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Expanding the\n   <em>\n    Orena\n   </em>\n   rule accordingly would have the effect of rendering any individual charged with an assault in aid of racketeering offense too dangerous for release under such conditions, which would constitute an abandonment not only of the presumption, set by Congress, in favor of release, but of the individualized inquiry required when considering conditions under the statute and relevant case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Indeed, the speculative nature of the Government's argument is all the more apparent when the record is reviewed holistically, assessing the danger that this particular defendant is suggested to present.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Stewart\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-CR-360A,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205403305\">\n    2011 WL 5403305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (W.D.N.Y. Nov. 8, 2011) (granting bail to RICO Defendant, who was to be charged with violent crimes, where the nature of the danger was drug abuse and home incarceration and drug testing would \"alleviate\"\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   danger). That Defendant appears to be a follower, rather than a leader or primary actor, suggests that he might be an individual for which home incarceration with GPS monitoring could effectively mitigate the risk of dangerousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   By communicating directly or through third persons, leaders of gangs under home-incarceration can still deploy others to carry out acts of violence. Home incarceration and electronic monitoring would thus be ineffective in keeping these leaders from commanding violence. Like a hungry, home-bound customer orders sushi while others gather the ingredients, prepare the meal, make the delivery, in a \"beef\" between rival gangs, the gang leader issues an edict while other gang members assemble the crew, grab the weapons, and mete out pain. Just as the sushi restaurant cannot make a delivery unless the customer places an order, so too gang members await permission and instructions from their leaders before engaging in targeted violent activity against other gangs. Paulino places no orders; he simply participates in a larger group delivering pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In addition, Paulino's activities with the gang do not involve solo acts of violence. His violently swinging wooden debris at the Victim is part of a brutal group-inflicted beating that involved multiple stabs, kicks, punches, and strikes. His acts are violent, yet not essential to inflicting harm. His actions don't require special access to weapons nor do they require particularized skill. This is entirely consistent with his early 2018 case. His actions are unnecessary; he is assuredly, easily replaceable. The evidence indicates that Paulino's value to the gang is not based on his ability to strategize, motivate, or communicate. As far as the gang is concerned, Paulino's greatest asset is his physical presence coupled with his physical strength. Depriving the Trinitarios of his physical presence renders his physical strength nugatory. Home incarceration and electronic monitoring accomplish this goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Any suggestion that the Trinitarios may seek him out, or vice versa, while under supervision of this nature, is highly dubious. Seemingly, a criminal enterprise would want nothing to do with a non-essential member being monitored by the Government, especially since he is a mere member, as opposed to a boss or supervisor. His presence near any member of the Trinitarios would bring unwanted attention from law enforcement with no real benefit to the gang. This assumes also that Paulino would want anything to do with them, as well, such that he would be willing to circumvent the watchful eyes of his family members, who are also proposed sureties.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dono\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665908\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/275/35/#p37\">\n    275 F.

As to the menacing incident, it does not appear that Paulino violated the order of protection over the months that followed.

Nor are there allegations of threats of future harm to the victims or their families, as is often present in these cases.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dono\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665908\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/275/35/#p37\">\n    275 F.

To be sure, as the Government argued, this does not make monitoring any less reactive, and the Court cannot be assured that monitoring will occur at all hours. 6/25/18 Tr. at 34:11-35:4. However, in examining a given set of conditions, absolute certainty of their efficacy is not required, only a \"reasonable assurance....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2159351\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/420/176/#p179\">\n    420 F.2d at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reasoning that \"[t]he law requires reasonable assurance but does not demand absolute certainty, which would be only a disguised way of compelling commitment in advance of judgment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the above-stated reasons, taken together, the Court need not merely rely on Paulino's good-faith promises that he will comply with conditions,\n   <em>\n    Orena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"661973\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/986/628/\">\n    986 F.2d at 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the circumstances before the Court otherwise suggest that the conditions could be effective, which is enough in this non-presumption case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    2) Risk of Flight\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court reaches a similar conclusion as to risk of flight. Although Paulino spent no insignificant amount of time in the Dominican Republic during his childhood, it reasonably appears that New York City is his home and that he intends to stay here. He is an American citizen and the bulk of his family members are here, or in other nearby states. Although not currently employed, Paulino is recently employed. In addition, Paulino is expecting a newborn child in October, a significant incentive not to flee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Government emphasizes the Defendant's past bench warrants and his probation status when arrested here.

Notably, Defendant was released, albeit for only approximately forty-eight hours (6/25/18 Tr. at 31:23-25), between his first arrest and interview and his arrest on the charges presented here, and thus, despite anticipating possible charges, made no efforts to flee.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773146\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/48/#p50\">\n    837 F.2d at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering that Defendant took \"no steps\" to flee jurisdiction in three-week period between execution of search warrant at home and arrest).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   To be sure, reasonable minds may differ about the degree to which such a calculus changes for a defendant once he faces\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   charges.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As such, the Government's appeal of Judge Pitman's bail determination is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Defendant's release is stayed for an additional three business days following the issuance of this order, so that the Government may, if it so chooses, restore the matter to the active docket of the Second Circuit by letter, and pursue a further stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    The Complaint alleges that Paulino used a \"large log\" to assail the Victim, but also suggests that an eyewitness described it as a \"tree branch.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 15. However, based on what the video depicts of the weapon and the rapid motion in which Paulino downwardly swings it, it is far more plausible that the weapon was something lighter than a log, such as a branch or a piece of wooden debris that might commonly be found on the shoulder of a well-trafficked transit route, such as a piece of broken railroad track.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Upon remand, the parties each submitted additional letter briefing regarding the issues that the Circuit raised in its decision.
