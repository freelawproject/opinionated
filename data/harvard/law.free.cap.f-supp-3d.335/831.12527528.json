The Magistrate Judge recommends that this case be remanded because complete diversity does not exist between the parties due to Plaintiffs' inclusion of the Parish of West Feliciana, a non-diverse party, as a named Defendant.

(\"North South\"), Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (\"Nationwide\"), and the Parish of West Feliciana (\"West Feliciana\" or the \"Parish\") in the Twentieth Judicial District Court for the Parish of West Feliciana, State of Louisiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The matter was removed to this court by Red Frog on November 15, 2017 on the basis of diversity jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Per its Notice of Removal, Red Frog asserts that, with the exception of West Feliciana, the parties to this action are completely diverse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   With\n   respect to West Feliciana, Red Frog asserts that the Parish was improperly joined for the sole purpose of defeating diversity jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Notice of Removal, Red Frog asserts that pursuant to an agreement between West Feliciana and Red Frog (the \"Venue Agreement\"), Red Frog \"received 'exclusive use' of the West Feliciana Parish Sports Park\" (the premises wherein the Warrior Dash was hosted) and that West Feliciana \"[i]n no manner...[had] anything to do with the construction of the allegedly-defective obstacle or the provision of medical services at the event....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Red Frog avers that pursuant to the Venue Agreement \"any and all responsibility for the condition, maintenance, use, occupation, operation, or alteration of the West Feliciana Sports Park was passed to Red Frog\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that \"Louisiana law imposes no legal duty on West Feliciana Parish to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , (1) monitor/supervise a private event (the Warrior Dash) that occurs on property that it leases to private entities and (2) ensure that temporary structures that may be used during a private event that occurs on its leased premises are safe.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On November 22, 2017, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to Remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs argue that they have stated viable claims against West Feliciana and that the Parish is not entitled to statutory immunity pursuant to Louisiana's Recreational Use Statute for these claims. Plaintiffs further assert that the question of whether they have stated a claim against West Feliciana should be limited to a 12(b)(6)-type analysis, and that piercing the pleadings would be inappropriate. In opposition, Red Frog contends that the Parish was improperly joined because it is entitled to statutory immunity and because it otherwise owed no duty under Louisiana law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Removal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A defendant may remove \"any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   When original jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, the cause of action must be between \"citizens of different States\" and the amount in controversy must exceed the \"sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subject matter jurisdiction must exist at the time of removal to federal court, based on the facts and allegations contained in the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   In removed actions, diversity of citizenship must exist both at the time of filing in state court and at the time of removal to federal court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The removal statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is strictly construed and any doubt as to the propriety of removal should be resolved in favor of remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The removing party has the burden of proving federal diversity jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Remand is proper if at any time the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Forum Defendant Rule Does Not Require Denial of the Motion to Remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In opposition to the Motion to Remand, Red Frog includes a discussion of the forum defendant rule and asserts that West Feliciana was not served at the time of removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   The forum defendant rule of \u00a7 1441(b) provides that when the federal court's original jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, the civil action \"may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined\n   <em>\n    and served\n   </em>\n   as defendants is a citizen [of the State] in which such action is brought.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The majority of courts that have considered the question, including multiple district courts within this circuit, have ruled that the plain language of \u00a7 1441(b)(2) bars removal only where the forum defendant was properly served at the time of removal, and that the presence of a forum defendant will not create a defect if that defendant was not properly served at the time of removal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs do not rely on the forum defendant rule in support of their Motion to Remand, and it is unclear why Red Frog includes an analysis of same in its opposition. To the extent Red Frog argues that the citizenship of an unserved, non-diverse defendant should be disregarded for purposes of this court's jurisdictional analysis,\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Fifth Circuit has held that \"non-diverse citizenship cannot be ignored simply because [the defendant is] an unserved defendant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A non-resident defendant cannot remove an action if the citizenship of any co-defendant, joined by the plaintiff in good faith, destroys complete diversity, regardless of service or non-service upon the co-defendant. Whenever federal jurisdiction in a removal case depends upon complete diversity, the existence of diversity is determined from the fact of citizenship of the parties named and not from the fact of service.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly,\n   the citizenship of West Feliciana cannot be ignored on the basis that it was not served at the time of removal, and the undersigned proceeds with consideration of the propriety of Plaintiffs' joinder of West Feliciana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Improper Joinder Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The party seeking removal based on improper joinder of a non-diverse defendant bears a \"heavy\" burden of proving that the joinder was improper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   To meet its burden, the removing party must show (1) an actual fraud in the pleading of jurisdictional facts, or (2) an inability of the plaintiff to establish a cause of action against the non-diverse party in state court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Red Frog has not alleged actual fraud in the Petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The undersigned will therefore only consider the second approach (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , inability to establish a cause of action) in analyzing the propriety of West Feliciana's joinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Under the second approach, \"the test for [improper] joinder is whether the defendant has demonstrated that there is no possibility of recovery by the plaintiff against an in-state defendant, which stated differently means that there is no reasonable basis for the district court to predict that the plaintiff might be able to recover against an in-state defendant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court must resolve all disputed questions of fact and ambiguities in the controlling state law in favor of the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the court concludes that the plaintiff has any \"possibility of recovery against the party whose joinder is questioned\" then joinder is proper and the case must be remanded for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The possibility must be reasonable, not merely theoretical.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Fifth Circuit has explained that to determine whether a plaintiff has a reasonable basis of recovery under state law, a court can resolve the issue in one of two ways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The court may conduct a Rule 12(b)(6)-type analysis, looking initially at the allegations of the complaint to determine whether the complaint states a claim under state law against the in-state defendant. Ordinarily, if a plaintiff can survive a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge, there is no improper joinder.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, where a plaintiff has omitted or misstated \"discrete facts that would determine the propriety of joinder,\" the district court may \"pierce the pleadings and conduct a summary inquiry\" to determine whether a non-diverse defendant has been improperly joined.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit has explained\n   that, \"[a]lthough a court may pierce the pleadings and consider summary-judgment type evidence, the standard for finding improper joinder is not the summary judgment standard in which an absence in the plaintiff's proof alone can be fatal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The examples of improper joinder based on \"discrete and undisputed facts\" outside the pleadings that\n   <em>\n    Smallwood\n   </em>\n   provides are consistent with this language requiring a defendant to \"preclude\" the possibility of recovery: evidence showing that \"the in-state doctor defendant did not treat the plaintiff,\" that \"the in-state pharmacist defendant did not fill a prescription for the plaintiff patient,\" that \"a party's residence was not as alleged, or any other fact that easily can be\n   <em>\n    disproved\n   </em>\n   if not true.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although the district court may consider such discrete and undisputed facts, the Fifth Circuit has \"frequently cautioned the district courts against pretrying a case to determine removal jurisdiction....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Red Frog further avers that \"[r]egardless of whether the injuries to Ms. Allen and Mr. Allen fail to satisfy the $75,000.00 jurisdictional threshold, the injuries and settlement demand provided by Ms. Stricklin clearly do.

While the undersigned finds that Ms. Stricklin's pre-removal settlement demand supports the position that the amount in controversy with respect to her claim likely exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, it is not necessary to reach the issue of whether this court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of Kara Jo Allen and Gabriel Allen because the undersigned finds that West Feliciana is a properly joined defendant and therefore the parties to this suit are not completely diverse.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Per the Notice of Removal, Red Frog avers that it is a limited liability company with one member, Joseph Reynolds, who is a citizen of Illinois.

Ms. Gaesor asserts,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , that the Venue Agreement \"did not grant West Feliciana Parish the right to monitor or supervise the event or conduct inspections or repairs of the obstacles\" and that \"[n]o West Feliciana Parish employee or representative was present at the West Feliciana Parish Sports Park in a supervisory capacity or to inspect the Diesel Dome during preparations for the 2016 Warrior Dash or on the day of the actual race....\" R. Doc. 25-2, \u00b6\u00b6 6 &amp; 9. As noted above, to the extent Red Frog asks the court to rely on Ms. Gaesor's interpretation of the Venue Agreement, the undersigned has instead reviewed the Agreement itself. To the extent Red Frog asserts that as a factual matter, no employee or representative of West Feliciana was present in a supervisory capacity or to inspect the Dome, such assertion seems to lend support to Plaintiffs' allegation that West Feliciana failed to inspect the Dome despite a duty to do so, and, in any event, the Parish's role and responsibility with respect to the Warrior Dash is more appropriately determined via discovery rather than solely on Ms. Gaesor's Declaration.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"70\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Red Frog argues that West Feliciana cannot be held liable under general negligence law because it had no ownership, custody, or control over the Diesel Dome. R. Doc. 25, pp. 14-15. In support of that position, Red Frog relies on\n    <em>\n     White v. Gulf States Utilities Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7548474\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/525/145/\">\n     525 So.2d 145\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (La. App. 3 Cir. 1988). In\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    , the court affirmed a directed verdict in favor of Gulf States Utility Company where there was no evidence in the record to \"even intimate that Gulf States had custody\" over a temporary construction elevator and therefore could not be held liable for injuries plaintiff sustained when his arm became lodged between the elevator's counterbalance and the tower itself. Red Frog contends that \"similar to Gulf States Utilities from the\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    case, the Parish had no ownership, custody, or control over the Diesel Dome obstacle or supervised the Warrior Dash.\" R. Doc. 25, p. 15. The undersigned finds that the Parish's custody or control over the Dome, especially in light of Plaintiffs' allegations that the Parish was required to inspect and test the Dome, to be a fact issue not amenable to a determination within the context of an improper joinder analysis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"71\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    La.
