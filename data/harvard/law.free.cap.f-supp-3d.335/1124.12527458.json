No. 59). Plaintiff McCall Law Firm, PLLC (\"McCall\") timely filed its response to the motion (Dkt. No. 64). For the reasons set forth below, the Court denies the Crystal Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   McCall is a law firm located in Pope County, Arkansas (Dkt. No. 4, \u00b6 1). Individual defendants Mr. and Ms. Galan are residents of Ontario, Canada. On January 30, 2015, McCall originally filed this action against Crystal Queen, Inc.,\n   <em>\n    d/b/a\n   </em>\n   Crystal Training, a Canadian corporation, in the Circuit Court of Pope County, Arkansas (Dkt. No. 1, \u00b6 1). On September 21, 2015, McCall filed its amended class action complaint in that court to add defendants Mr. and Ms. Galan (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). On December 3,\n   2015, Crystal Training removed the case to this Court with the consent of separate defendants Mr. and Ms. Galan (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exhibit 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   McCall's amended class action complaint alleges that all defendants violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (\"TCPA\"), codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , by purposefully transmitting an unsolicited advertisement by facsimile to a telephone facsimile machine belonging to McCall located in Pope County, Arkansas (Dkt. No. 4). McCall alleges that the unsolicited facsimile advertised computer software training sessions (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On March 10, 2016, Mr. and Ms. Galan filed separate motions to dismiss (Dkt. Nos. 21, 23). The Court denied both motions to dismiss (Dkt. No. 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After their motions to dismiss were denied by the Court, Mr. and Ms. Galan filed their answers to the amended class action complaint (Dkt. Nos. 41, 42). In their answers, Mr. and Ms. Galan both asserted multiple affirmative defenses, including lack of standing, constitutional violations, and class defects (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Counsel for all defendants filed a motion to withdraw as counsel on October 3, 2017 (Dkt. Nos. 55, 56). In the same motion, counsel informed the Court that a motion to strike class allegations was imminent (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4). The Court granted the motions to withdraw and directed Mr. and Ms. Galan to inform the Court whether they would proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   ; the Court also directed Crystal Training to procure new counsel or risk a default judgment (Dkt. No. 58, at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Former counsel for Crystal Defendants, Ms. Wymore, filed the present motion to strike class allegations (Dkt. No. 59) on October 24, 2017. Neither the Galans nor Crystal Training have informed the Court about their future plans for acquiring legal representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The present motion is styled as a motion to strike, which is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f). As an initial matter, the Court notes that \"striking a party's pleadings is an extreme measure, and, as a result ... motions to strike under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) are viewed with disfavor and are infrequently granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Stanbury Law Firm v.

Per Rule 12(f), \"the court may order stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\" A district court has \"liberal discretion\" when deciding whether to strike any portion of a pleading pursuant to Rule 12(f).\n   <em>\n    Stanbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11246307\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/1059/#p1063\">\n    221 F.3d at 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to a leading treatise,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [There] appears to be a general judicial agreement, as reflected in the extensive case law on the subject, that [motions to strike] should be denied unless the challenged allegations have no possible relation or logical connection to the subject matter of the controversy and may cause some form of significant prejudice to one or more of the parties to the action. Any doubt about whether the challenged material is redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous should be resolved in favor of the non-moving party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   5C Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1382 (3d ed. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court construes the Crystal Defendants' standing and constitutional arguments as a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h) (noting that \"a defense of failure to state a claim ... may be made\n   ... by motion for judgment on the pleadings\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A court will grant a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings if a plaintiff has \"[f]ailed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(2)(C). A motion for judgment on the pleadings is subject to the same standard as is a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    NanoMech, Inc. v.

When considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Court must accept as true \"all factual allegations set out in the complaint and must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, drawing all inferences in his favor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wishnatsky v.

The Court disagrees and finds that McCall has standing to bring the present TCPA action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Standing is a jurisdictional issue, so the Court addresses it first.

Furthermore, McCall claims \"there is publicly-available evidence\" which supports its class allegations, though no citation to such evidence is provided (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). Therefore, according to McCall, the \"commonality\" and \"typicality\" requirements of Rule 23(a) are satisfied (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reversed a district court's denial of class certification in a case where the proposed class members received unsolicited fax advertisements without an opt-out notice.\n   <em>\n    Sandusky Wellness Center, LLC v.

The appeals court held that a class of individuals who allegedly received unsolicited fax advertisements in violation of the TCPA met the ascertainability, commonality, and predominance requirements of Rule 23.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257920\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/992/#p998\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257920\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/992/#p998\">\n    at 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The second amended complaint claims that, on January 15, 2016, McCall received an unsolicited fax transmission on its fax machine \"advertising Crystal Training's upcoming QuickBooks and Excel Training Classes ....\" (Dkt. No. 4, \u00b6 14 (internal quotation omitted) ). McCall argues that the fax advertisement in question did not contain an \"Opt-Out Notice that complies with the requirements of 47 C.F.R. 64.1200(a)(4)(iii) and (iv).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16). McCall claims that, \"[u]pon information and belief,\" the Crystal Defendants sent identical fax transmissions \"to hundreds, if not thousands, of telephone facsimile machines ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   McCall's alleged class is similar to the one alleged in\n   <em>\n    Sandusky\n   </em>\n   : the proposed class consists of individuals who received unsolicited facsimile advertisements without an opt-out notice. Rule 23(a)(2)'s commonality\n   requirement appears, construing the pleadings liberally, to be satisfied because each class member allegedly received an unsolicited fax advertisement without an opt-out notice. Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement is met because McCall's complaint raises questions of law, including whether each fax violates the TCPA, and fact, including whether each class member received an unsolicited fax, that predominate over individual issues. McCall also sufficiently alleges facts regarding the numerosity and adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a). While the Crystal Defendants' arguments are well-taken, given McCall's allegations and the procedural posture of this case, the Court is not satisfied that it is appropriate to deny class certification at this time. Instead, the Court will allow McCall to proceed with discovery to develop the factual issues. Accordingly, the Court denies the Crystal Defendants' Rule 12(f) motion to strike class allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The TCPA's Damages Provision Is Constitutional\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Crystal Defendants contend that the TCPA's damages provision violates the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The Court construes these arguments as a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Court declines to find the TCPA's damages provision unconstitutional at this stage of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    1. It Is Premature To Rule On The Crystal Defendants' Eighth Amendment Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Crystal Defendants argue that the TCPA's remedy violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution because it is grossly excessive and disproportionate (Dkt. 60, at 12-14). Under Section 227(b), \"[a] person or entity\" may bring an action to recover the greater of either the \"actual monetary loss\" from a violation of \u00a7 227(b) or \"to receive $500 in damages for each such violation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(B). Damages for each transmission may be trebled to $1,500 per violation if the Court finds that the Crystal Defendants knowingly or willfully violated the TCPA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(C). At this time, the Court declines to rule on this issue, as this is currently an individual action and the possibility of a constitutionally excessive award is low. The appropriate time for a ruling on this matter is later, if and after a class is certified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murray v. GMAC Mortg.

The TCPA's Damages Provision Is Not Facially Unconstitutional\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Crystal Defendants attack the damages provision of the TCPA under the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution (Dkt. No. 60, at 10-12). At the outset, the Court notes that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections do not govern the TCPA, which is a federal statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bolling v.

Courts are perhaps hesitant to strike down the TCPA's statutory penalties because Congress possesses \"a wide latitude of discretion to prescribe penalties for violations of [its] laws, and those penalties, which often serve a deterrent effect, are to be considered with due regard for the interests of the public, the numberless opportunities for committing the offense, and the need for securing uniform adherence [to the law].\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3680560\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/251/63/#p66\">\n    251 U.S. at 66-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3680560\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/251/63/#p66\">\n    40 S.Ct. 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Second, the Eighth Circuit found that the TCPA directly advanced this interest because it \"plac[es] restrictions on those responsible for a large portion of the problem ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 658. On the third\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   prong, the Eighth Circuit pronounced that the TCPA achieved a \"reasonable fit between the means it adopts and the ends it seeks to serve.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 660.\n   <em>\n    Missouri ex rel.

The Crystal Defendants are essentially arguing that Congress should have adopted a less restrictive alternative remedy.\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   does not require that Congress adopt the least restrictive possible remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353527\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/357/#p367\">\n    535 U.S. at 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353527\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/357/#p367\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nixon\n   </em>\n   , 323 F.3d at 659. While Congress\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   enacted a less restrictive regulation, such as a \"do not fax list,\" it instead created a scheme that places the burden of unsolicited facsimile advertisements upon senders, rather than on consumers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This Court is persuaded that Congress's damages provision under the TCPA reasonably \"fits\" the goals of the TCPA. Accordingly, the Court holds that, on its face, the TCPA's ban on facsimile advertisements is a constitutional regulation of commercial speech. Based on the limited pleadings and filings in this case, the Court is not satisfied that the hypothetical damages the Crystal Defendants face under the TCPA violate the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
