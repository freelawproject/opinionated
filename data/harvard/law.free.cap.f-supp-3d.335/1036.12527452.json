The monopolist, Comcast Corporation, denied its competitor, Viamedia, Inc., access (or access on terms Viamedia considered reasonable) to much-needed sales platforms called interconnects. Hurting as it lost revenue and customers turned to Comcast, Viamedia sued under Section 2 of the Sherman Act and various state antitrust laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., R. 1; Am. Compl., R. 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At the motion-to-dismiss stage, the Court ruled that Comcast had no antitrust duty to deal with Viamedia and thus its refusal to deal was not cognizably anticompetitive under\n   <em>\n    Verizon Commc'ns Inc. v.

Now, at the summary-judgment stage, the question is whether Comcast's conduct can be characterized as something more-tying, exclusive dealing, or another form of anticompetitive conduct. It cannot. Undisputed facts reveal that Viamedia's alternative theories are lacking as a matter of law. Undisputed facts demonstrate that Comcast's refusal to deal with Viamedia-not coercive conduct directed at their mutual customers-is what caused Viamedia's injuries and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court are Comcast's motion for summary judgment (R. 264), motion to exclude opinions proffered by Viamedia, Inc.'s damages expert, Thomas Lys, Ph.D. (R. 212), and motion to exclude certain opinions proffered by Viamedia's liability expert, Harold Furchtgott-Roth (R. 208). For the reasons explained below, the Court grants Comcast's motion for summary judgment, grants in part Comcast's motion to exclude Dr. Furchtgott-Roth's opinions and denies the remainder as moot, grants Comcast's motion to exclude Dr. Lys's opinions, and enters judgment in Comcast's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

With those principles and the Rule 56 standard in mind, the parties' respective Local Rule 56.1 statements and responses describe the following backdrop to this lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Spot Cable Business and Interconnects\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cable networks, like ESPN or CNN, typically allocate small windows of air\n   time-two to three minutes per hour-to the multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") that show their programming. CSF \u00b6 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   These windows, according to industry parlance, are called \"availabilities,\" \"avails,\" or \"spot cable ads.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9. About a quarter of the time, MVPDs retain those avails to advertise their or their affiliates' services. VSF \u00b6 5. MVPDs sell the remainder to outside advertisers-and how they choose to do so is the focus of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CSF \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   There are many MVPDs nationwide, including Comcast, RCN Corporation, Wide Open West (\"WOW!\"), Charter Communications, Inc., Atlantic Broadband, and Verizon Communications. MVPDs come in different forms-cable operators, like Comcast or Charter; telecom providers, like Verizon and AT &amp; T; overbuilders, like WOW! and RCN; and satellite providers, like DISH or DirectTV.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Most MVPDs offer their services in one or more metropolitan regions, called designated market areas (\"DMAs\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. There are typically four or more MVPDs in a DMA. Comcast Ex. 2, Furchtgott-Roth Report \u00b6 17 (R. 273-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In any given DMA, there are different ways in which MVPDs sell avails to advertisers. Some MVPDs sell directly through their own sales force. CSF \u00b6 10. Others hire advertising-representation firms that specialize in spot cable advertising (\"Ad Reps\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Viamedia is such an Ad Rep, and it has no corporate affiliation with any MVPD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Viamedia, in fact, is the only independent Ad Rep with significant market presence. VSF \u00b6 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Comcast, under the trade name Comcast Spotlight, also does business as an Ad Rep, both on its own behalf and on behalf of other MVPDs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   CSF \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When an MVPD hires an Ad Rep, the two typically enter into an \"advertising purchase and sale\" agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Under these agreements, an Ad Rep is responsible for managing and selling an MVPDs' avail inventory (or some portion of it) to advertisers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; VSF \u00b6 1. Ad Reps can represent their MVPD customers: (1) locally, selling only a part of an MVPD's avails in a DMA to local advertisers; (2) regionally, selling all of the MVPD's avails in a DMA; or (3) nationally. Furchtgott-Roth Report \u00b6 21. In any event, Ad Reps' sales responsibilities entail ancillary responsibilities, too, including: marketing and pricing the avails; maintaining the software and hardware needed to run, insert, traffic, monitor and advertise spot cable ads; organizing inventory into schedules and ensuring each ad runs correctly during those schedules; and performing financial services, like accounting, billing, and collection. VSF \u00b6 1. Ad Reps are also responsible for working with interconnects to sell avails.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These services make up \"Ad Rep Services,\" according\n   to Viamedia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Furchtgott-Roth Report \u00b6\u00b6 22-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   An interconnect is a \"one stop shop\" where advertisers can purchase spot cable ads on a DMA-wide basis. CSF \u00b6 16. Developed by MVPDs in the 1990s, interconnects solve a market inefficiency. Before interconnects, an advertiser wanting to reach television audiences with commercials running at the same time on the same channel across the DMA had to either rely on over-the-air broadcast stations exclusively or negotiate separately with each MVPD. CSF \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, Resp. to \u00b6 14. An interconnect-of which there is one per DMA-fixes that problem by pooling together avails among the DMAs' MVPDs, scheduling allocations, selling and coordinating the sale of those avails, and billing the parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17, Resp. to \u00b6 17. These collective services make up \"Interconnect Services,\" according to Viamedia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Furchtgott-Roth Report \u00b6\u00b6 30-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Over the last decade or so, the largest MVPD in a DMA has come to operate that DMA's interconnect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 44. In operating the interconnect, the controlling MVPD makes investments to support and maintain the platform. The degree and nature of those investments are disputed, but, at a minimum, MVPDs invest in and maintain a sales infrastructure for the interconnects. CSF \u00b6 20, Resp. to \u00b6 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Comcast Ex. 14 at 147:11-14 (\"David Solomon, Viamedia's Chief Revenue Officer, testifying that, \"I'm sure [Comcast] ha[s] over the past 18 years ... spent significant [sic] to establish support, build and maintain their infrastructure\" over the interconnects\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ad Reps, pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements, profit from the sale of MVPDs' avails based on an agreed revenue share, or split, with the MVPD. CSF \u00b6 38. The split is the percentage division of the revenue generated from the avails' sales, with a share going to the Ad Rep and the remainder to the MVPD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A higher split share for the Ad Rep means a worse price for the Ad Rep's services to the MVPD, and vice versa.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. Also important, of course, is the amount of revenue generated-an MVPD could concede a less favorable split if it thought that the Ad Rep would be able to generate more revenue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Resp. to \u00b6\u00b6 38, 39. Ad Reps also sometimes provide MVPDs with minimum-revenue guarantees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Revenue splits and guarantees are \"critical points of competition\" between Ad Rep firms vying for MVPD business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As to other terms of Ad Rep-MVPD agreements, the industry standard is exclusive, region-wide, full-turnkey representation. CSF \u00b6\u00b6 25-27. In a full-turnkey representation, the MVPD sells all of its avails in one or more DMA (absent the portion it wants to retain for self-advertising) to a single Ad Rep.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Ad Rep then enjoys the \"exclusive right to manage and sell\" the avails.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27; VSF \u00b6 2. This arrangement offers \"one stop shopping\" for both MVDPs and Ad Reps. CSF \u00b6 28. Full-turnkey representation comes with other services, too; Viamedia, for example, assists MVPDs with their branding efforts, product promotions, and technical problems. VSF \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Though the most prominent, full-turnkey is not the only form of Ad Rep Services. Some MVPD customers hire Ad Reps to represent them locally, and sign over only a portion of their avails in a DMA.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Furchtgott-Roth Report \u00b6\u00b6 24-25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53 (\"Spot Cable Ad Rep Services and Interconnect Services are separate products regardless of whether Spot Cable Ad Rep Services are provided on a full turnkey basis\"). Other MVPDs may self-provide Ad Rep Services. Furchtgott-Roth Report \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Interconnect operators can also work directly with an MVPD customer to sell a portion of the MVPD's avails without a third-party Ad Rep.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53; CSF \u00b6 29. This arrangement is called an \"interconnect-only\" agreement. CSF \u00b6 30. In such an agreement, the MVPD sells a portion of its avails to the interconnect operator for sale on a DMA-wide basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Interconnect-only agreements allow interconnect operators to provide Interconnect Services directly to MVPDs. VSF \u00b6 67. To sell the remaining avails on a local (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , not regional or DMA-wide) basis, MVPDs with an interconnect-only agreement may sell their own avails or hire an Ad Rep for \"local-only\" agreements. CSF \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31, 33, 126;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   VSF \u00b6 67. Verizon and Frontier, Verizon's successor in certain DMAs, have previously opted for this arrangement in some DMAs. CSF \u00b6\u00b6 32-37. For its part, Comcast has been willing to enter into interconnect-only agreements; since December 2011, 14 percent of Comcast's agreements with MVPDs have been interconnect-only.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129. Comcast entered into its most recent interconnect-only deal in September 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125; Comcast Ex. 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Comcast's Competition with Viamedia and Control of the Interconnects\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Viamedia and Comcast compete as Ad Reps for business from MVPD clients in many DMAs. VSF \u00b6 9. The record reflects that both have respective advantages. Comcast, as a large MVPD, and in some DMAs the largest (and therefore the operator of the interconnect), requires less incremental operation expenses to represent fellow MVPDs. CSF \u00b6 115; Comcast Ex. 96 at 16 (internal Viamedia presentation stating \"Viamedia can not [sic] compete economically within the footprint of a major cable company\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Comcast Ex. 18 at 93:5-19. Particularly relevant here, Comcast operates the interconnects in Chicago, Detroit, and Hartford, Connecticut.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. At the same time, some MVPDs have expressed that \"all things being equal\" they would prefer that a competitor, like Comcast, not represent them. VSF \u00b6 7; Viamedia Ex. 69 at 8 (\"RCN is not comfortable having its largest and most formidable rival as its representative in the spot cable market\"). This benefits an unaffiliated Ad Rep, like Viamedia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Viamedia's former Chief Financial Officer, Christopher Black, has also testified that Viamedia had \"[l]ong term relationships with ... certain MVPDs\" and provided strong customer service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8; Viamedia Ex. 8. Both Viamedia and Comcast pursue full-turnkey relationships with their MVPD clients,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55; VSF \u00b6 7, although, as noted, Comcast has entered into interconnect-only agreements with some frequency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ad Reps require interconnect \"access\" to compete effectively for MVPDs' business because of the substantial amount of advertising revenue interconnects generate. Am. Compl. \u00b6 73; CSF \u00b6 111; VSF \u00b6 20. The parties engage in a semantic debate about whether Ad Reps access interconnects \"on behalf\" of their MVPD clients, and whether the MVPD clients \"feel\" as though they participate in the interconnects, but the economic facts of the transaction are straightforward. For an Ad Rep to obtain access, the interconnect operator contracts with the Ad Rep to acquire a portion of ad inventory from the Ad Rep, which the Ad Rep has already acquired responsibility for selling from its MVPD-client.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CSF \u00b6 42; Comcast Ex. 34. The interconnect operator then arranges for the sale of those avails on the interconnect, and distributes proceeds to the Ad Rep accordingly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This was the agreement Comcast and Viamedia entered into in 2003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Pursuant to that agreement, Comcast had the exclusive right to sell through its Chicago and Detroit interconnects a portion of an ad inventory for which Viamedia had acquired responsibility from two of its clients, RCN and WOW!.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Viamedia's representations of RCN and WOW! were, as is typical, exclusive and full-turnkey, meaning that RCN and WOW! could not resell their avails through another third party in the Chicago and Detroit DMAs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 49. Viamedia's exclusive relationship with RCN was to expire at the end of 2015, and its exclusive relationship with WOW! was to expire at the end of 2014. CSF \u00b6\u00b6 88, 96; VSF \u00b6\u00b6 26, 32. Further, the 2003 agreement contained a non-solicitation clause, which prohibited Comcast from contacting RCN or WOW! for certain periods. CSF \u00b6 45. The 2003 agreement between Comcast and Viamedia contemplated an expiration date of May 31, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Months before that expiration date, in December 2011, Comcast notified Viamedia that it would not be renewing the agreement. VSF \u00b6 15; CSF \u00b6 47. As a result, from June 2012 until the expiration of Viamedia's exclusive contracts with RCN and WOW!, Viamedia, RCN, and WOW! lost out on revenue they may have made if Viamedia could have continued to use Comcast's interconnects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   VSF \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Comcast did not renew its contract with Viamedia so that it could pursue full-turnkey relationships with RCN and WOW!.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. According to Comcast, it \"prefers to do direct deals with MVPDs rather than intermediaries like Viamedia.\" CSF \u00b6 48. Put another way, Comcast's strategy, starting in 2011, was \"to get\" MVPDs to employ Comcast on a full-turnkey basis.

To that end, Comcast stopped contracting \"with 'middlemen' media firms, such a Viamedia.\" Viamedia Ex. 69 at 9. One Comcast executive explained: \"Working through a middleman, intermediary, like Viamedia really brought no value to the table other than their contract with their respective MVPDs,\" and so the company looked to deal directly with the MVPDs.

VSF \u00b6 23. This came as no surprise to Comcast. In 2011, it knew that Viamedia had the exclusive right to sell all of WOW! and RCN's avails in Chicago and Detroit \"for several years into the future,\" VSF \u00b6 14, and it conducted an internal analysis that projected that its decision to not renew with Viamedia would negatively impact Comcast Spotlight, Viamedia, RCN, and WOW! in 2012,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.

CSF \u00b6\u00b6 54, 57. In that period, Viamedia bid for and lost several MVPD clients-and it attributes many of those losses, and others, to Comcast's conduct in Chicago, Detroit, and Hartford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

In 2014, RCN and Viamedia began to negotiate renewing their full-turnkey agreements. CSF \u00b6 96. During negotiations, Viamedia \"stepped back its guarantees\" and gave a \"less favorable\" offer in November of that year, which caused RCN to react negatively. CSF \u00b6 97. RCN then, and for apparently the first time in its relationship with Viamedia, requested Viamedia's financials, which showed that the company was suffering. VSF \u00b6 33. According to Viamedia, without interconnect access in Chicago and Detroit, it was \"unable to make a competitive financial offer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.

According to Dr. Furchtgott-Roth, Ad Rep Services and Interconnect\n   Services are \"separate products\" because there is a \"sufficient demand to purchase\" those services separately. Furchtgott-Roth Report \u00b6 47. He cites \"substantial evidence\" in support, including Viamedia's own \"business model\" and the MVPDs that receive \"unbundled\" Ad Rep and Interconnect Services. By a \"conservative\" estimate, he submits, 21.5% of cable subscribers use an MVPD that relies on unbundled services, once subscribers to MVPDs that self-provide Ad Rep Services are removed from the mix.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. He includes in that group MVPDs that enter into full-turnkey agreements with third-party Ad Reps, which in turn contract with the interconnect operator to have a portion of the avails sold on the interconnects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Furchtgott-Roth further notes that, although Interconnect Services also entail the selling of avails to advertisers, Ad Rep Services include additional \"back office\" services, unlike Interconnect Services, which entail \"creating and maintaining schedules of advertising, inserting advertising, negotiating with and monitoring Interconnect operators, and allocating advertising inventory among multiple sales channels.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. In further support of his separate-products opinion, Dr. Furchtgott-Roth states that \"some MVPDs unbundle\" services by entering into interconnect-only agreements and \"self-providing\" Ad Rep Services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Having defined separate products, Dr. Furchtgott-Roth explains his tying opinion. Interconnect Services are the tying product, and Ad Rep Services are the tied product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. Evidence of Comcast's tying policy, according to Dr. Furchtgott-Roth, is found in testimony in which a Comcast executive-who worked in the Chicago and Detroit DMAs-agreed with the proposition that \"if an MVPD wants to get access to Comcast [Spotlight] controlled Interconnect, it has to hire Comcast [Spotlight] as its ad sales representative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. Dr. Furchtgott-Roth also cites testimony and documents suggesting that WOW! and RCN \"understood\" that they had to purchase Ad Rep Services from Comcast Spotlight to obtain access to the interconnects in 2014 and 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Furchtgott-Roth reasons further that Comcast had to \"exclude\" Viamedia from Comcast-controlled interconnects as a \"necessary\" part of this tying policy, as it ostensibly made clear in 2011 when it \"announced\" that it was not going to renew its Interconnect agreement with Viamedia as a \"continuation of a strategy to have full turnkey direct relationships with the MVPDs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. Similarly, Comcast Spotlight's chief operating officer testified that non-renewal with Viamedia \"freed [Comcast Spotlight] up\" to \"have the opportunity to present and have a direct relationship with WOW and RCN.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That tying practice has \"manifested\" in at least ten other DMAs as well, according to Dr. Furchtgott-Roth, as Comcast has also declined Viamedia interconnect access in those DMAs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. Dr. Furchtgott-Roth opines further that the same conduct \"that amounts to tying also amounts to exclusive dealing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   These practices lead Dr. Furchtgott-Roth to conclude that Comcast has foreclosed competition in the market for Ad Rep Services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. That is, \"by tying Spot Cable Ad Rep Services to Interconnect Services and entering into multi-year, exclusive contracts to provide both services as a bundle, Comcast Spotlight has created a formidable competitive advantage for itself over Viamedia.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. There is additional market foreclosure, Dr. Furchtgott-Roth opines, because MVPDs recognize that interconnect access is necessary to maximize their profits on avails, and Comcast has cut off Viamedia's access to Comcast-controlled interconnects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Dr. Lys's Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Dr. Lys's Amended Report calculates the damages Viamedia has purportedly suffered as a result of Comcast's conduct. He opines, ultimately, that Comcast has caused Viamedia $158 million in damages. Comcast Ex. 6, Lys Am. Report \u00b6 37 (R. 273-9). Dr. Lys's opinions assume Comcast's liability for committing anticompetitive conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. His opinions make the additional assumptions-albeit phrased as \"understanding[s]\" in his Amended Report-that Comcast's anticompetitive behavior resulted in the loss of several MVPD contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-59. Specifically, Dr. Lys predicates his opinions on the \"understanding\" that \"Comcast's anticompetitive conduct\" caused Viamedia to lose the RCN and WOW! agreements in 2015, had a \"material adverse effect on\" Viamedia's retention of an agreement with Verizon in 2013, and caused Viamedia to fail to obtain an agreement with Atlantic Broadband in 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   His opinions also assume that Comcast's exclusion of Viamedia from the interconnects in Chicago, Detroit, and Hartford caused Viamedia to lose interconnect-related revenues,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56, and that Viamedia lost \"out of pocket expenses\" from Comcast's conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. Dr. Lys divides his damages opinions into seven categories. His ultimate conclusion analyzes Viamedia's damages relating to: (1) interconnect-revenue losses in Chicago and Detroit; (2) interconnect-revenue losses in Hartford; (3) lost future agreements with WOW! for two DMAs; (4) lost agreements with RCN for five DMAs; (5) lost agreements with Verizon for nine DMAs; (6) lost agreements with Atlantic Broadband for six DMAs; and (7) out-of-pocket expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On April 4, 2018, the Court held an evidentiary hearing regarding Dr. Lys's opinions pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Daubert v.

At the hearing, Dr. Lys explained his Amended Report in greater detail. In addition, he confirmed that his Amended Report assumed causation. The facts supporting his causation assumptions had been provided by Viamedia's management, although Dr. Lys noted that he \"poked\" their assertions to ensure that they had some sound basis. Dr. Lys elaborated that he did not think causation in this case could be demonstrated with economic analysis, because the market is one for services, not commodities. At the hearing, Viamedia's counsel, too, confirmed that Dr. Lys was not offered as an expert on causation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

First, it argues that Comcast did not sell interconnect-only deals in Chicago, Detroit, and Hartford, where Comcast denied Viamedia use of the interconnects. This case, however, is not limited to those markets-Viamedia challenges Comcast's conduct in the markets in which it operates the interconnects generally. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 180;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Furchtgott-Roth Report \u00b6\u00b6 63-73. Second, Viamedia contends that substantial evidence of unbundled sales does little to defeat a tying claim in cases where there is an \"announced condition,\" \"rebuffed request for separate provision,\" or \"publicized policy\" of tying.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, ANTITRUST LAW \u00b6\u00b6 1756a, 1756b. True enough, but this is no such case. The record lacks evidence showing that Comcast told customers that they could not receive an interconnect-only deal-that is, Interconnect Services-standing alone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Even focusing exclusively on Chicago, Detroit, and Hartford, there is insufficient evidence of conditioning. \"A high percentage, even 100 percent, of unbundled sales does not itself indicate that two products may have been tied together\" because \"buyers may have all bought the products bundled because they preferred them together.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081852\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/676/#p685\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1756b2.

The real rub of Viamedia's tying claim is, instead, that Comcast withheld the tying product\n   <em>\n    from its rival Viamedia.\n   </em>\n   The consequence: customers that contracted with Viamedia could not obtain Comcast's Interconnect Services through their Viamedia representation, and customers wanting a full-turnkey deal that made available to them both Interconnect Services and Ad Rep Services could not get such a deal through Viamedia.

The same is true here. Viewing the record in Viamedia's favor, Comcast said that its \"practice\"-in an industry dominated by full-turnkey business, where MVPDs generally prefer not to do interconnect-only deals-is that an MVPD must employ Comcast to have its avails sold on the interconnects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   VSF \u00b6 13. Likewise, RCN and WOW! did not complain that were unable to receive Interconnect Services from Comcast on a standalone basis. The record shows they complained, at most, that they could not receive Interconnect Services\n   <em>\n    through\n   </em>\n   Viamedia, and had to work with Comcast directly because they wanted full-turnkey representation that could make available Interconnect Services.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , VSF \u00b6 18. This evidence is, at a minimum, equally consistent with Comcast's refusal to deal with Viamedia as it is a tying arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   None of this is to say that, as a matter of law, for a tying condition to be cognizably anticompetitive it must be applied directly and only to the end user, not its representative.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    COPECA, Inc. v. Western Aviation Servs. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761819\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/653/141/#p147\">\n    653 F.Supp.2d 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147 (D.P.R. 2009) (not seeing \"the relevance\" that a defendant applied an alleged tie \"via an intermediary\" because the defendant could still \"impose its condition\"). It is to say, however, that at summary judgment the claimant must present evidence tending to exclude the possibility that the defendant engaged in legitimate conduct. Viamedia lacks any evidence that Comcast withheld Interconnect Services from customers (as opposed to Viamedia) unless they also purchased Ad Rep Services, and it has not otherwise pointed to evidence suggesting that Comcast's conduct was anything more than a refusal to deal with Viamedia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Another wrinkle of Viamedia's claim is worth addressing. Although Viamedia does not define Ad Rep Services as only full-turnkey services,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Furchtgott-Roth Report \u00b6\u00b6 22-29, it occasionally refers to Comcast's tie as one of Interconnect Services to full-turnkey Ad Rep Services,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   VSF \u00b6 18, CSF, Resp. to \u00b6 48. That changes little. For one, the record is devoid of evidence that customers could not receive Comcast's Interconnect Services standing alone (only that they could not receive those services through Viamedia's representation). Equally important, in a full-turnkey relationship with a third-party Ad Rep the MVPD does not directly contract for Interconnect Services. It relies on its Ad Rep-to which it has assigned all of its avails in a DMA-to make sure that a portion of those avails are sold on the interconnects.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , VSF \u00b6\u00b6 1-3. Focusing on that scenario, there can be no anticompetitive tie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Professors Areeda and Hovenkamp explain why. Suppose an ingot manufacturer \"refuses to sell separately but rather fabricates into products like building wall sections, which it sells directly to builders.\" Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, ANTITRUST LAW \u00b6 1748a. A rival fabricator demands ingot separately \"so that it too can bundle it with fabrication services in order to make and sell walls. When the defendant refuses, [the rival] claims the defendant is tying ingot to fabrication services.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761819\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/653/141/#p147\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The claim fails as a matter of law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   [T]he gravamen of the complaint is not that the defendant's bundled sales have foreclosed rivals from selling unbundled fabrication to the defendant's customers.

For example, the plaintiff does not want the defendant to offer ingot separately to builders; nor would doing so eliminate any relevant \"foreclosure\" when builders do not want \"un-tied\" ingot in order to arrange separately for its fabrication.

Not so. \"Even if the separate provision of ingot [the tying product] and fabrication [the tied product] is common in competitive analogues,\" there is no liability for tying \"when the plaintiff's theory of injury is not that customers of the defendant's bundle would buy the items unbundled if they could, but rather that a rival could sell the\n   <em>\n    same bundle\n   </em>\n   if only the defendant would sell it a particular input.\" Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, ANTITRUST LAW \u00b6 1748b;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761819\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/653/141/#p147\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1748b n.2 (a finished-product exists even where the claimant meets the \"threshold requirement of showing buyer interest because we can find some buyers desiring the items unbundled\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   This is the \"gravamen\" of Viamedia's tying claim-that Comcast's refusal to provide it interconnect access prevents it from selling the kind of full-turnkey Ad Rep Services that WOW! and RCN desire.

To the contrary, the record presents ample evidence of Comcast's decision to stop dealing with middlemen and go after full-turnkey relationships with more MVPDs. As such, in the but-for world, Comcast still would have refused to deal with Viamedia; it just could not further condition services or engage in anticompetitive exclusive dealing.
