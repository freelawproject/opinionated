Dennis Saylor IV, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a patent dispute concerning a pharmaceutical product: abuse-deterrent, extended-release oxycodone. Plaintiffs Purdue Pharma L.P.; The P.F. Laboratories, Inc.; Purdue Pharmaceuticals L.P.; and Rhodes Technologies (collectively, \"Purdue\") have brought suit against Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. The amended complaint asserts claims for infringement of three related patents pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b), (c), and (e)(2)(A). The patents at issue are U.S. Patent Nos. 9,073,933 (\"the '933 patent\"), 8,652,497 (\"the '497 patent\"), and 9,155,717 (\"the '717 patent\"). The infringement claims arise out of Collegium's filing of a New Drug Application (\"NDA\") for its abuse-deterrent, extended-release oxycodone products, XTAMPZA ER. On November 21, 2017, the Court issued a Memorandum and Order on Claim Construction, in which it construed five disputed claim terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Collegium has moved for summary judgment on three grounds. First, it maintains that the '933 patent is invalid under a theory of issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel. That contention is based on a\n   judgment from the Southern District of New York, affirmed by the Federal Circuit, that three related patents owned by Purdue are invalid. Second, Collegium asserts that even if the '933 patent is valid, it is entitled to judgment of non-infringement as a matter of law because it is not literally infringing and oxycodone myristate (the active ingredient in its product) is not the equivalent of oxycodone hydrochloride (the active ingredient in Purdue's product). Third, it argues that summary judgment of non-infringement of the '497 and '717 patents is appropriate because those patents claim the addition of an \"irritant,\" and its product does not contain an \"irritant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the following reasons, Collegium's motion for summary judgment will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This dispute concerns pharmaceutical products designed to deter abuse of addictive pain medications, such as oxycodone, as well as methods for reducing potentially toxic impurities in oxycodone pharmaceuticals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Oxycodone Generally\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Oxycodone is an opioid. (Pl. SOF \u00b6 91). Opioid drugs are used to treat pain, but are also subject to abuse. (Def. SOF \u00b6 3; Pl. SOF \u00b691). Extended-release (\"ER\") formulations of oxycodone are often prescribed to treat severe pain that requires around-the-clock dosing. (Def. SOF \u00b6 2; Pl. Response \u00b6 2). ER formulations contain a larger amount of oxycodone than other dosage forms because the oxycodone is intended to be released over a 12- to 24-hour period. (Def. SOF \u00b6 5; Pl. Response \u00b6 5). For example, Purdue's original ER OxyContin, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1995, was designed to deliver oxycodone over a 12-hour period. (Pl. SOF \u00b6 93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Abuse-Deterrent Oxycodone\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Unfortunately, the ER formulations of oxycodone are attractive to abusers. To \"dosedump,\" defeat the ER mechanism, and receive a rapid high, abusers may crush or dissolve the drug and then orally ingest, insufflate (that is, snort), smoke, or inject the drug. (Def. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; Pl. Response \u00b6\u00b6 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a result, the FDA has placed a high priority on the development of abuse-deterrent opioids. (Def. SOF \u00b6 9; Pl. Response \u00b6 9). The FDA approved an abuse-deterring version of OxyContin in 2010. (Pl. SOF \u00b6 94). That version incorporated two features: (1) a harder tablet, to resist crushing, and (2) a gelling agent, to impede snorting and injecting of any powder resulting from successful crushing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Those features are the subject of two of the patents at issue (the '497 and '717 patents ). In April 2013, the FDA granted abuse-deterrent OxyContin the first abuse-deterrent labeling. (Pl. Response \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Collegium has developed an abuse-deterrent, ER formulation of oxycodone called XTAMPZA ER. (Def. SOF \u00b6 14; Pl. Response \u00b6 14). Collegium filed an NDA with the FDA for XTAMPZA ER, seeking approval to manufacture and sell the drug. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def. SOF \u00b6 24). That NDA forms the basis of Purdue's First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") for patent infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Removal of Impurities from Oxycodone\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Oxycodone, as manufactured, contains a potentially toxic impurity. The impurity is 14-hydroxycodeinone (\"14-hydroxy\"), an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone (\"ABUK\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The FDA has been concerned about lowering or eliminating the level of 14-hydroxy\n   for some time.\n   <em>\n    In re OxyContin Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065993\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/994/367/#p385\">\n    994 F.Supp.2d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 385 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).

Purdue is a named assignee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The '933 patent claims both a product (an oxycodone composition) and a process for preparing it by removing a source of 14-hydroxy from that product-that is, 8a,14-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrocodeinone (\"8a\")-during manufacture. Representative claim 1 recites \"An oxycodone hydrochloride composition which comprises at least 95% oxycodone hydrochloride and [8a] and less than 25 ppm of [14-hydroxy].\" Representative claim 10 recites \"A process for preparing an oxycodone hydrochloride composition having less than 25 ppm [14-hydroxy], comprising removing [8a] from an oxycodone base composition and converting the oxycodone base composition to an oxycodone hydrochloride composition having less than 25 ppm [14-hydroxy].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   According to the patent, methods for reducing the amount of 14-hydroxy in an oxycodone hydrochloride composition were known in the prior art. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   col.1, ll. 47-col. 2 ll. 2). At the time of the patent, existing procedures for reducing toxicity in oxycodone hydrochloride produced levels of 14-hydroxy greater than 100 ppm.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 17 at 5-6). The examiner's determination was based on a comparison to Purdue's existing patents, including the low-ABUK patents. The rejection read: \"Although the conflicting claims are not identical, they are not patentably distinct from each other because Oxycodone hydrochloride [API] having less than 25 ppm [14-hydroxy] of the cited patent encompasses [the] instant claims.\" (Def. Ex. 17 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To avoid the double-patenting rejection, Purdue filed terminal disclaimers on October 1, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 18 at 12-13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Purdue noted that it \"traverse[d] these rejections\" and that \"[t]he filing of these terminal disclaimers is neither an\n   admission of the propriety of the rejections nor an admission that the inventions claimed ... are not 'independent and distinct' from the inventions\" of the low-ABUK patents. (Def. Ex. 18 at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The examiner maintained the obviousness rejection of the '933 patent claims in light of the prior art. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Ex. 30 at 6-10). In response, on March 4, 2015, Purdue asserted that the examiner acknowledged that \"the existence of [8a] was not known prior to the priority date of the present application,\" and that therefore \"one skilled in the art would not have 'figured out to dehydrate [8a]' as asserted by the Examiner.\" (Pl. Ex. 30 at 7). On March 23, 2015, after Purdue's response was submitted, the examiner allowed the claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

The three patents at the center of this dispute describe an improved oxycodone API product containing less of the 14-hydroxy impurity than any oxycodone API available at the time of the invention. This product is an improvement but not an invention. Low-ABUK oxycodone stood within reach of any person of ordinary skill with the desire to use routine science and common sense to improve oxycodone API product.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Purdue holds out 8a as its contribution to the art. And, indeed, identifying 8a was genuine insight. But the evidence overwhelmingly proved that 8a imparts no significance to the structure of 14-hydroxy. It imparts no distinguishing characteristics to oxycodone. And it imparts no significance to the product claimed by the patents. Knowledge of 8a permits a skilled artisan to understand\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   14-hydroxy reappears in a synthetic scheme with a salting step. But knowledge of 8a does not explain\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   to fix the problem.

She rejected the argument that the PTO's double-patenting rejection of the '933 patent, and Purdue's subsequent terminal disclaimer, required the application of issue preclusion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6-7. And she rejected the argument that the doctrine of inherency required that the '933 patent be invalidated based on its similarities to the invalid low-ABUK patents.

Put another way, if a patent for an oxycodone composition with less than 25 ppm 14-hydroxy is invalid as obvious, it seems that a patent for the same product, with a meaningless impurity included, should likewise be invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   There is no question that Purdue had a fair opportunity to litigate those issues, or that the\n   <em>\n    Teva\n   </em>\n   case resulted in a valid and binding final judgment. The critical question therefore seems to be whether the factual findings concerning 8a were essential to the\n   <em>\n    Teva\n   </em>\n   judgment. The answer to that question is unclear. On the one hand, Judge Stein expressly ruled that he would disregard the 8a limitation in the low-ABUK patents, because his decision concerned only the product, not the process. But Purdue itself contended that its discovery of 8a, and the consequences of that finding, were the central issues in the case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Purdue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4083318\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/1345/#p1355\">\n    811 F.3d at 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Purdue contends that the court failed to properly credit the discovery of 8a as the core of the claimed inventions\"). And if none of the factual issues concerning 8a were essential to the judgment, it is at least noteworthy that so much trial time was consumed addressing those very issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   However, the parties have not briefed the issue of whether any specific subsidiary factual findings made by the\n   <em>\n    Teva\n   </em>\n   court were necessary to the judgment, and therefore should have preclusive effect. And it is certainly possible that the proper analytical approach is not to employ principles of issue preclusion, but rather a traditional summary judgment approach-that is, to consider whether there is a material dispute as to the significance of 8a. Judge Stein found that \"the evidence overwhelmingly proved\" that 8a had no significance in the final product. Perhaps there is no material evidence to the contrary, and perhaps a finding of obviousness would result from such a finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Under the circumstances, this Court will not resolve those questions here. It does appear, however, that the materiality of the 8a limitation in the product claims is very much in doubt, and therefore casts doubt on the validity of claims 1 and 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n    <em>\n     The 95% Limitation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Both claims 1 and 16 further recite that the claimed products include \"at least 95% oxycodone hydrochloride.\" ( '933 patent col. 34 ll. 27-28, col. 35 ll. 13-14). The obviousness of that limitation was not decided or discussed in the\n   <em>\n    Teva\n   </em>\n   case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mylan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20784989\">\n    2017 WL 784989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-9 (noting that\n   <em>\n    Teva\n   </em>\n   \"does not discuss the percentages of oxycodone in the prior art\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Collegium again contends that issue preclusion should apply, based on the doctrine of inherency. For reasons similar to those set forth above, the Court cannot determine whether the doctrine should apply under the present circumstances. Collegium also focuses on a statement in the '072 patent's specification that \"[p]referably, the oxycodone hydrochloride preparation ... contains at least 95% oxycodone hydrochloride,\" to argue that the low-ABUK patents disclosed a formulation with at least 95% oxycodone hydrochloride. ( '072 patent, col. 5 l. 65-col. 6 l. 1). But that formulation was not necessarily present in the '072 patent or its claims; it was only \"preferably\" present.

Furthermore, Collegium argues that the claims \"are even more narrow,\" claiming only the subset of oxycodone hydrochloride \"that contain[s] a reduced amount of [14-hydroxy].\" (Def. Summ. Judg. Br. at 34). Purdue counters that\n   <em>\n    Wrigley\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable because \"the focus of the '933 patent is not on any particular oxycodone salt, but rather an oxycodone composition with reduced levels of [14-hydroxy] and 8a.\" (Pl. Summ. Judg. Opp. at 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Although it is perhaps a close call, this Court will not apply\n   <em>\n    Wrigley\n   </em>\n   to preclude Purdue's ability to argue that oxycodone myristate is equivalent to oxycodone hydrochloride. It is true that throughout the specifications and claims in the '933 patent, Purdue stated that the invention was (1) an oxycodone hydrochloride composition having low levels of 14-hydroxy and 8a and (2) the process for preparing that particular composition. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '933 patent col. 2 ll. 30-46, col. 6 ll. 34-50, col. 34 ll. 26-30). The \"Background of the Invention\" section specifically states that the patent was responding to the \"continuing need in the art to provide an oxycodone hydrochloride composition that contains reduced amounts of [14-hydroxy].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   col. 2 ll. 20-23). Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Wrigley\n   </em>\n   , the disclosure of the '933 patent\"focuses narrowly on [oxycodone hydrochloride salt], and not on [oxycodone salts] generally.\"\n   <em>\n    Wrigley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895625\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/1356/\">\n    683 F.3d at 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Wrigley\n   </em>\n   , the record evidence does not support the inference that the '933 patent's inventors were explicitly aware of the alleged interchangeability of oxycodone myristate when they chose to narrowly claim only oxycodone hydrochloride.

In its argument that XTAMPZA ER cannot infringe\n   the '933 patent under the doctrine of equivalents, Collegium compares the functions of \"hydrochloride\" or \"hydrochloric acid\" in Purdue's product and \"myristic acid\" in its own product. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Summ. Judg. Br. at 29-31; Def. Summ. Judg. Reply at 6-7). Collegium maintains that myristic acid functions \"to lock oxycodone up in wax so that it is not accessible to an abuser.\" (Def. Summ. Judg. Br. at 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   There is undisputed record evidence supporting that claimed function of myristic acid. First, it is undisputed that myristic acid functions as an \"API solubilizer in formulation.\" (Pl. Response \u00b6 69; Def. Ex. 9 at COLL0001212, Table 10). Similarly, it is undisputed that myristic acid works to \"solubilize the oxycodone base drug substance in the microsphere formulation.\" (Pl. Response \u00b6 24; Def. Ex. 9 at COLL0001212). Based on that evidence, Collegium asks this Court to find that \"myristic acid ... functions to solubilize oxycodone in the wax matrix and hydrochloric acid ... functions to make oxycodone bioavailable,\" and are therefore not equivalents. (Def. Summ. Judg. Reply at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Purdue, on the other hand, maintains that the correct comparison for the function-way-result test does not involve myristic acid at all. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Summ. Judg. Opp. at 28). Purdue argues that \"[t]he claim element that is literally missing from [XTAMPZA ER], and for which the doctrine of equivalents is relevant, is\n   <em>\n    oxycodone hydrochloride\n   </em>\n   , not 'hydrochloride.' The equivalent element is\n   <em>\n    oxycodone myristate\n   </em>\n   , not myristic acid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At least for summary judgment purposes, the Court agrees with Purdue's assessment. Nowhere in the '933 patent's claims does Purdue claim \"hydrochloride\" or \"hydrochloric acid\"; rather, the specific claim element is an \"oxycodone hydrochloride composition.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , '933 patent col. 34 l. 27). Thus, the oxycodone hydrochloride salt composition is the missing element in XTAMPZA ER, and oxycodone myristate salt is the appropriate comparator under the doctrine of equivalents. In its reply brief, Collegium even seems to concede this point. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Summ. Judg. Reply at 6 (\"It is undisputed that the pharmaceutical salt in [XTAMPZA ER] is oxycodone myristate, not the oxycodone HCl salt claimed in the '933 patent.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The Court therefore must determine whether the alleged equivalency of oxycodone myristate and oxycodone hydrochloride is a question for a jury. Stripping away the evidence concerning myristic acid, Collegium only presents one argument that oxycodone myristate and oxycodone hydrochloride are not equivalents. It argues that while oxycodone hydrochloride is the API in OxyContin, oxycodone myristate does not perform the API function in XTAMPZA ER. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Summ. Judg. Br. at 29; Def. Ex. 26 at P3430662; Def. Ex. 9 at COLL0001212, Table 10). Rather, according to Collegium, the API in XTAMPZA ER is oxycodone base, not oxycodone salt. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 9 at COLL0001212, Table 10). But in its Rule 56.1 Reply Statement, Collegium seems to refute its own argument and acknowledge that oxycodone myristate is, in fact, the API. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 131, 134). Purdue also refers to Collegium's own statement to the SEC and the FDA that XTAMPZA ER \"has the same active ingredient as OxyContin.\" (Pl. Ex. 11 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Purdue has also submitted expert testimony from Dr. Stephen Byrn. Dr. Byrn's affidavit states that \"[t]he function of both the claimed oxycodone hydrochloride and Collegium's oxycodone myristate is to provide oxycodone, which provides pain relief to a patient.\" (Byrn Decl. \u00b6 15). He opines that by stating that \"[o]xycodone is present\n   as myristate salt in the XTAMPZA ER formulation,\" (Def. Ex. 27 at COLL0023272), \"Collegium is acknowledging that the role of the oxycodone salt is to deliver the oxycodone,\" (Byrn Decl. \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   While the Court agrees that this articulation of the function of the two salts may be overly broad, Collegium has provided insufficient evidence as to the function of oxycodone myristate-as opposed to myristic acid-to refute Purdue's theory. Collegium only asserts that oxycodone myristate is \"almost insoluble in water,\" which Purdue disputes, and that oxycodone hydrochloride is highly water soluble. (Def. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 71-72; Pl. Response \u00b6\u00b6 71-72). What significance, if any, these facts have on the function of the two salts is not made clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   It appears that Purdue has presented a genuine issue of disputed material fact as to whether oxycodone myristate performs substantially the same function as oxycodone hydrochloride, and that accordingly summary judgment is inappropriate. The Court therefore need not consider whether there are disputed issues concerning the \"way\" or \"result\" aspects of the equivalency test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Direct and Indirect Infringement of Process Claims 10 and 14\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Collegium argues that it cannot infringe process claims 10 and 14 because (1) it does not perform all of the claimed steps itself and (2) it does not direct or control the companies that do perform the claimed steps. Purdue, however, asserts that Collegium directs or controls the manufacturing processes of Noramco and Patheon that infringe claims 10 and 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   It is undisputed that Noramco manufactures, pursuant to contract, oxycodone base for Collegium's oxycodone myristate compositions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 124-25). It is also undisputed that Patheon manufactures XTAMPZA ER for Collegium, converting oxycodone base to oxycodone myristate. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 129-31). Accordingly, it would be premature at best to grant Collegium summary judgment of non-infringement of claims 10 and 14 based on the record before the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Akamai Techs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331183\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1020/#p1022\">\n    797 F.3d at 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"an actor is liable for infringement under \u00a7 271(a) if it ... contracts with another to perform one or more steps of a claimed method\"). Thus, the Court will deny summary judgment of non-infringement with respect to claims 10 and 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The '497 Patent and the '717 Patent : Non-Infringement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Finally, Collegium argues that it is entitled to summary judgment of non-infringement of the '497 patent and the '717 patent because the myristic acid used in XTAMPZA ER is not an \"irritant.\" The resolution of that issue turns on the Court's previous construction of the term \"irritant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   As noted, Collegium uses myristic acid in XTAMPZA ER to dissolve oxycodone base in wax. Although Purdue does not dispute that myristic acid has such a purpose, it contends that myristic acid was also included in XTAMPZA ER to act as \"an abuse-deterring irritant.\" (Pl. Response \u00b6\u00b6 23-24). Purdue points to the high ratio of myristic acid to oxycodone base in the microspheres, as well as the fact that any excess myristic acid remains in XTAMPZA ER in its acid form, to support its claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 149-50, 153). According to Purdue, the molar ratio of myristic acid to oxycodone base in XTAMPZA ER is 6:1, while Purdue asserts that the molar ratio of a complex of oxycodone base and myristic acid would be 1:1. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23; Byrn Decl. \u00b6 28). This, Purdue contends, is evidence that the extra myristic\n   acid functions solely as an irritant. For additional support, Purdue cites results of abuse-potential studies conducted by Collegium, which state effects such as \"irritation, burning, and facial pain\" after snorting \"may be desirable for this type of product as this may serve as a nuisance to an abuser who attempts to snort the drug.\" (Pl. Response \u00b6 163).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Collegium disputes Purdue's assertions that \"[t]he amount of myristic acid in [XTAMPZA ER] is more myristic acid than necessary for all of the oxycodone base to be part of an oxycodone myristate salt.\" (Pl. Response \u00b6 151; Def. Reply \u00b6 151). It contends that all of the myristic acid is necessary to solubilize oxycodone and drive salt formation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Summ. Judg. Reply at 11-12; Def. Ex. 37 at COLL0001253). Its NDA for XTAMPZA ER specifically states that excess myristic acid is necessary to ensure that enough oxycodone myristate is formed and to reduce the concentration of free oxycodone base.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Ex. 37 at COLL0001253 (\"[E]xcess free acid ... serves to drive salt formation, [thereby] reducing the free base concentration in the system and preventing its precipitation.\"). It also reported that it attempted to make the API using a 1:1 ratio, but it failed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at COLL0001252 (\"During early stage development ..., [attempts at] combining the free acid and the free base of oxycodone at a molar ratio of 1:1 were unsuccessful.\"). Ultimately, it concluded that the lowest ratio of myristic acid to oxycodone that was capable of completely dissolving the oxycodone base was 1:5.6.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at COLL0001251.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   With respect to the abuse-potential studies, Collegium explains that its NDA stated that irritation after snorting was \"likely caused by particle size and lack of solubility of the wax microspheres.\" (Def. Reply \u00b6 163; Def. SOF \u00b6 90). Collegium also denies that myristic acid was included for any purpose other than solubilizing oxycodone in the wax matrix. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def. Reply \u00b6 155; Def. SOF \u00b6 84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   In its summary judgment and claim construction briefing, Collegium advocated for \"irritant\" to be construed as meaning \"a compound used to impart an irritating or burning sensation to an abuser administering a tampered dosage form of the present invention,\" based on the common specification's definition. Collegium does not dispute that myristic acid has some irritating qualities, at least under exaggerated exposure conditions. And while it may downplay the significance of the tests it conducted, Collegium does not dispute that an\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   volatilization study and an intranasal abuse study produced results that showed XTAMPZA ER may cause irritation when abused. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 85-87, 90; Def. Ex. 6 at COLL0013058-59, COLL0013077-78). Collegium, however, maintains that Purdue can point to no evidence that Collegium uses myristic acid for the purposes of imparting an irritating or burning sensation to someone abusing the drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The issue, however, is not Collegium's intent. In construing the term \"irritant\" in the two patents, the Court steered clear of assigning the disputed claim term \"a meaning ... that depends on the state of mind of the accused infringer.\"\n   <em>\n    Amazon.com, Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11078270\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/1343/#p1353\">\n    239 F.3d 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Rejecting Collegium's proposal, the Court construed \"irritant\" to mean \"a compound that imparts an irritating or burning sensation to an abuser administering a tampered dosage form of the present invention.\" (Mem. &amp; Order on Claim Construction at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   But the Court limited its construction based on the plain language of Purdue's claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   Thus, by its plain terms, the claim is for a product with four components (or types of components)-drug, a release carrier, an irritant, and an excipient (A, B, C, and D). A product with only three components (a drug, a release carrier, and an excipient, or A, B, and D) would not appear to infringe, even if one or more of those components happens (as an unintentional consequence) to impart an irritating sensation upon tampering. In other words, if a drug contains a pharmaceutical excipient (component D) with an excipient function (function Z) that also happens to irritate when the product is abused, that excipient would not qualify as an \"irritant\" under the claim, because excipients and irritants are different components, according to its plain language.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). The Court also looked to the prosecution history to find that \"Purdue clearly and unambiguously expressed surrender of items that overlap-for example, as both a pharmaceutical excipient and an irritant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Here, Purdue has conceded that at least some of the myristic acid in XTAMPZA ER has an excipient function. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Response \u00b6 23 (agreeing that \"one alleged purpose for including myristic acid in Xtampza is that it is capable of dissolving oxycodone base in the wax matrix\"); Mem. &amp; Order on Claim Construction at 11 n.2 (noting that solvents are an example of an excipient) ). Substances with overlapping functions do not infringe on the asserted claims of the '497 and '717 patents because the language of the claims prohibit, and Purdue expressly surrendered, that interpretation. But one way to interpret Purdue's argument is that the same substance may have parallel, non-overlapping functions. Its argument suggests that XTAMPZA ER contains both an excipient (myristic acid) and an irritant (excess myristic acid, not necessary to solubize oxycodone )-in other words, that the product contains a quantity of myristic acid serving an excipient function and a separate quantity of myristic acid serving an irritant function (but not an excipient function).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   In theory, such an argument might succeed, assuming that the excess myristic acid had no function other than being an irritant. But Collegium has put forth evidence that what appears to be \"excess myristic acid\" is in fact an excipient and performs a necessary function. Purdue has not rebutted that evidence with anything other than speculation and argument. Again, Purdue claimed a composition with a separate \"irritant\" component. It does not (and likely could not) claim every composition that happened to have an irritating quality under some set of circumstances, whether or not the irritant was a separate component. Accordingly, and under the circumstances, the Court will grant summary judgment as to non-infringement of the '497 and '717 patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the motion for summary judgment of Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
