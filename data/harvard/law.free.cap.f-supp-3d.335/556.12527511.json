On their face, USDOT's regulations apply to both \"current\" and \"former\" employees. The principal question is this case is whether application of the regulations to \"former\" employees is lawful, as the statute pursuant to which the regulations were enacted-the Housekeeping Statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -speaks only of \"employees.\" The case arises out of another case,\n   <em>\n    Pirnik v. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.\n   </em>\n   , 15-CV-7199 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.) (\"\n   <em>\n    Pirnik\n   </em>\n   \"), in which Plaintiffs here bring securities-fraud claims against Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (\"FCA\") and other defendants. In an effort to obtain evidence concerning FCA's communications with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\"), a part of USDOT, Plaintiffs sought to depose a former NHTSA employee, and USDOT-invoking its\n   <em>\n    Touhy\n   </em>\n   regulations-denied the request. Pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20500\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs bring this suit to challenge that denial as \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and in excess of [USDOT's] statutory jurisdiction.\" (Docket No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 59). Defendants now move to dismiss or,\n   in the alternative, for summary judgment; Plaintiffs cross-move for summary judgment. (Docket Nos. 23, 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Based on the text, structure, and purpose of the Housekeeping Statute, the Court concludes that USDOT's\n   <em>\n    Touhy\n   </em>\n   regulations are unlawful to the extent that they apply to former employees. Accordingly, and for the other reasons stated below, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED, and Defendant's motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The antecedents\" of today's Housekeeping Statute \"go back to the beginning of the Republic, when statutes were enacted to give heads of early Government departments authority to govern internal department affairs.\"\n   <em>\n    Chrysler Corp. v.

Notably, until 1993, the definition of \"employee\" did not include the words \"or former.\" In that year, however, USDOT amended its regulations to (among other things) extend to the testimony of former employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Testimony of Employees of the Department and Production of Records in Legal Proceedings (\"Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20Fed.%20Reg.%209224\">\n    57 Fed.

Plaintiffs allege that these representations were materially false and/or misleading because FCA ignored various safety obligations and misled federal regulators, including NHTSA. Accordingly, at least some of Plaintiffs' allegations in\n   <em>\n    Pirnik\n   </em>\n   turn on FCA's compliance and communication with NHTSA. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20Fed.%20Reg.%206719\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 6, 2018, Plaintiffs' counsel issued a subpoena to Robert Garris, a former NHTSA employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 21). Garris had worked in NHTSA's Recall Management Division, where he conducted investigations regarding the performance of safety recalls initiated by vehicle manufacturers, including a recall initiated by FCA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15). Pursuant to the USDOT's\n   <em>\n    Touhy\n   </em>\n   regulations, Plaintiffs' counsel submitted a request to NHTSA to take Garris's deposition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23). On March 6, 2018, NHTSA denied that request by letter, stating that it \"seeks to delve behind the formal record,\" that Garris would \"have little or no [relevant] knowledge,\" and that Plaintiffs could obtain evidence of communications between NHTSA and the FCA defendants from the FCA defendants themselves. (Compl., Ex. 2 (\"Denial Letter\"), at 3-4). NHTSA acknowledged that Garris was \"a former employee\" and that his testifying would thus \"not divert him from performing any governmental duties,\" but concluded that other NHTSA employees would \"have to take time away from their official duties to prepare for the deposition, as well as travel to them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). Balancing the \"stated need for the testimony of Mr. Garris\" against the purposes of USDOT's regulations, NHTSA therefore denied the request.

First, the statutory term \"employees\" is most naturally read to mean those having an existing employment relationship with the agency in question-i.e.,\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   employees.\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , for example, defines \"employee\" as \"[s]omeone who\n   <em>\n    works\n   </em>\n   \"-present tense-\"in the service of another person (the employer) under an express or implied contract of hire, under which the employer has the right to control the details of work performance.\" Black's Law Dictionary\n   (10th ed. 2014) (emphasis added).

If a business posts a sign on a door stating \"Employees Only,\" it would plainly be unreasonable for a former employee to construe that as an invitation and enter. Indeed, a former employee who did so could undoubtedly be charged with trespassing, and could not be heard to complain that the sign was ambiguous, let alone an invitation to enter.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Not surprisingly, courts in those cases have tended to eschew \"a narrow construction\" of the term \"employee\" on the ground that such a construction \"would not give effect to the statute's purpose, which is to furnish a remedy against an employer's use of discrimination in connection with a prospective, present, or past employment relationship to cause harm to another.\"\n   <em>\n    Pantchenko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"861819\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/581/1052/#p1054\">\n    581 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1055 ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dunlop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993320\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/548/139/#p140\">\n    548 F.2d at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (relying on \"the broad purposes and clear policies\n   of the Fair Labor Standards Act\" to conclude that the term \"employee\" in that statute's anti-retaliation provision includes a former employee). By contrast, the Housekeeping Statute is \"simply a grant of authority to the agency to regulate its own affairs,\"\n   <em>\n    Chrysler Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1779842\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/281/#p309\">\n    441 U.S. at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1779842\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/281/#p309\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and there is no similar reason to construe its use of the term \"employees\" as broadly. In fact, construing the statute to mean that a person who works for a federal agency, however briefly, is forever subject to that agency's regulatory authority would raise a host of practical-if not constitutional-questions.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Absent a clearer indication in the statute, there is no basis to conclude that Congress intended such a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants second argument is more easily rejected. They contend that USDOT's \"power to apply its\n   <em>\n    Touhy\n   </em>\n   regulations to former employees is also grounded in section 301's grant of authority to each agency to regulate the 'use ... of [agency] property,' \" as the term \"property\" includes \"even intangible property, such as patents, trademarks, and information learned in the course of government employment.\" (Defs.' Br. 16). But that novel reading of the Housekeeping Statute cannot be squared with the 1958 amendment, which clarified that the statute \"does not authorize withholding information from the public or limiting the availability of records to the public.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, taken to its logical conclusion, it would authorize federal agencies to promulgate regulations covering not only former employees, but anyone who became privy to \"official government information\"-including members of the press (or other branches of the federal government). That would be absurd and, again, would raise a host of practical-if not constitutional-questions. And once again, absent a clearer indication in the statute, there is no basis to conclude that Congress intended such a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In sum, the text, structure, and purpose of the Housekeeping Statute lead to only one reasonable conclusion: that the term \"employees\" in the statute refers solely to current employees. It follows that USDOT's\n   <em>\n    Touhy\n   </em>\n   regulations are invalid to the extent that they extend to former employees and that the Denial Letter-which was based on those regulations-was arbitrary and capricious and in excess of statutory jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   That does not necessarily mean, however, that Plaintiffs are entitled to depose Garris in\n   <em>\n    Pirnik.\n   </em>\n   That is because Defendants could conceivably challenge the subpoena pursuant to Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which authorizes a court to \"quash or modify a subpoena\" on various grounds. Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3)(A). In fact, the parties brief the\n   question of whether Rule 45 would justify quashing the subpoena for Garris's testimony (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs. Br. 22; Docket No. 26, at 14-22), albeit only because some courts have held that Rule 45 -rather than the APA-provides the relevant standard to assess the merits of an agency's refusal to complay with a subpoena.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re SEC ex rel. Glotzer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9232092\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/184/#p190\">\n    374 F.3d 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 190-92 (2d Cir. 2004) (discussing cases). In light of that, and the fact that this Court is presiding over\n   <em>\n    Pirnik\n   </em>\n   as well, there is an argument for just deciding the issue here. But, strictly speaking, the proper means to raise an objection under Rule 45 would be by motion in\n   <em>\n    Pirnik.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, while the Court has no doubt that Defendants have standing to challenge the subpoena to Garris on one Rule 45 ground that they invoke-namely, that it calls for disclosure of information protected by the deliberative-process privilege, which is held by the Government,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pleasant Gardens Realty Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202982632\">\n    2009 WL 2982632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-5 &amp; n.10 ;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mir v.

Separate and apart from the fact that such a reading would be at odds with the 1958 amendment, the question presented in\n    <em>\n     Touhy\n    </em>\n    was merely one of internal organization-whether, in accordance with the version of the Housekeeping Statute then in effect, a department head could assume authority for deciding whether a \"subordinate[ ]\" should obey or challenge a subpoena.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931590\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/340/462/\">\n     340 U.S. at 467-68\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931590\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/340/462/\">\n     71 S.Ct. 416\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Contrary to Defendants' suggestion (Defs.'
