(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 486). Dr. Gosy further opined that Plaintiff would be able to perform those same activities with her left hand, fingers, and arm only 75% of the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In his decision, the ALJ gave \"great weight\" to much of Dr. Gosy's opinion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p32\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p32\">\n    at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). However, the ALJ rejected Dr. Gosy's opinion related to Plaintiff's ability to use her right hand, fingers, and arm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The sole reason given by the ALJ for his rejection of this aspect of Dr. Gosy's opinion was that the right side manipulative limitations Dr. Gosy identified were purportedly \"inconsistent with the right-handed claimant's activity level.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In particular, the ALJ claimed that Plaintiff had been able to \"help install a floor, mulch a garden, and paint a bathroom, including behind the toilet, despite her impairments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court finds that the ALJ failed to give \"good reasons\" for his rejection of Dr. Gosy's opinion regarding Plaintiff's capacity to use her upper right extremity. The Court initially notes that \"a reason ... that relies on a mischaracterization of the record cannot be a good reason [for disregarding a treating source's opinion].\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

In\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , the court held that the ALJ had not provided \"good reasons\" for dismissing the treating physician's opinion when he mischaracterized evidence regarding the claimant's enjoyment of \"mentally stimulating puzzles,\" which the ALJ thought \"established that [the claimant] could not have 'significantly impaired concentration and persistence[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271722\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/478/#p485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271722\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/478/#p485\">\n    at 484-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted that \"[w]hile [the plaintiff] did testify that he used Sudoku or word puzzles to try to get his mind off his pain, he qualified this by stating that he could only focus on doing a puzzle about 10 to 15 minutes before he became frustrated by his pain.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271722\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/478/#p485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this case, the ALJ claimed that Plaintiff had \"help[ed] install a floor\" and that this activity was inconsistent with Dr. Gosy's opinion. (Dkt. 7 at 31). However, a review of Plaintiff's testimony reveals that her participation in the floor installation project was limited to bringing drinks for the workers and \"picking the color of the board that would go next.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55). Plaintiff specifically stated that she had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   personally installed the floor boards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ's decision mischaracterized the record, making it appear without basis that Plaintiff had used her right hand, fingers, and arm in a manner inconsistent with Dr. Gosy's opinion during the floor installation project. This was improper and cannot constitute a good reason for rejecting the opinion of a treating physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court further notes that while Plaintiff did report to her physicians on one occasion that she was mulching her garden using a wheelbarrow, she was immediately instructed to stop, in part because\n   she \"should not be pushing heavy wheel barrels [sic].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 524). Plaintiff also told the ALJ that she did not garden consistently. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60). As with the floor installation project, the ALJ's decision ignored these pertinent details and overstated the record regarding Plaintiff's activities. Similarly, with respect to the time Plaintiff painted the bathroom, Plaintiff testified that she had done so out of a sense of guilt regarding relying on her parents for care and that the activity had caused her \"terrible pain.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58). Moreover, the ALJ made no inquiry into Plaintiff's use of her hands during this activity-namely, whether and to what extent Plaintiff used her right hand, arm, and fingers. As such, the ALJ ignored relevant information and reached conclusions that were unwarranted when properly considering Plaintiff's activities in context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271722\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/478/#p485\">\n    213 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   484-85 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kain v.

In this case, the only reason the ALJ gave for rejecting Dr. Gosy's opinion regarding Plaintiff's ability to use her right hand, fingers, and arm was the purported inconsistency between Plaintiff's activities and that opinion. However, Dr. Gosy, who had treated Plaintiff for several years and was familiar with her history, apparently did not find those same activities indicative of greater ability than set forth in his opinion. The ALJ's mere disagreement with that conclusion, without\n   <em>\n    medical\n   </em>\n   evidence to corroborate that disagreement, is not a \"good reason\" to disregard it. No such medical evidence was identified or discussed by the ALJ. Accordingly, the Court finds that the ALJ failed to give good reasons for his assessment of Dr. Gosy's opinion, in violation of the treating physician rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The ALJ's error in this regard was not harmless. At the hearing in this matter, the VE testified that an individual who was limited to sedentary work and \"could manipulate with their dominant hand no more than 10 percent of the day and manipulate with their nondominant hand no more than 75 percent of the day\" would \"not be able to maintain competitive employment.\" (Dkt. 7 at 67). As such, had the ALJ afforded controlling weight to Dr. Gosy's opinion, a finding of disability would have followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In light of the VE's testimony, the Court has considered whether further administrative proceedings are required or if the matter should be remanded solely for calculation and payment of benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), the district court has the power to affirm, modify, or reverse the ALJ's decision with or without remanding for a rehearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Peach v.

While the ALJ did not articulate good reasons for declining to afford Dr. Gosy's opinion controlling weight, because of these conflicts in the medical evidence, the Court cannot conclude on the record before it that no such reasons could potentially exist.
