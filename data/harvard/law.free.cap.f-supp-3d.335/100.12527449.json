INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs Maria Chaves and Francisco Monteiro brought this case against the defendants U.S. Bank, N.A. as Trustee (\"U.S. Bank\") and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\") challenging the defendants' foreclosure on their home in Marlborough, Massachusetts. Plaintiffs obtained a refinancing loan from Wells Fargo in September 2003.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Stip. of Facts (Docket No. 40) \u00b6 2. In exchange for the loan, plaintiffs granted Wells Fargo a mortgage on their property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3. Plaintiffs defaulted on the loan by failing to make required payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. U.S. Bank, as the mortgagee pursuant to an assignment executed in 2012, sold the property at a foreclosure sale on April 24, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs filed this action in state court shortly after, on May 6, 2015, seeking primarily to unwind the sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. It was removed to this court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction on June 17, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The operative pleading, the First Amended Verified Complaint, asserted eight claims against defendants related to the origination, servicing, and foreclosure of their mortgage loan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 16 (Compl.). Plaintiffs were seeking, among other things, an injunction, declaratory relief voiding the foreclosure sale and awarding plaintiffs title to the property, and damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court dismissed Counts I, II, III, V, and VI on September 27, 2017, and simultaneously denied without prejudice plaintiffs' request for leave to amend the complaint because they failed to submit a memorandum as required by Local Rule 7.1(b) (1) for the District of Massachusetts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 32 (Sept. 27, 2017 Order) at 19. Plaintiffs subsequently withdrew Count VIII,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Joint Stip. of Facts \u00b6 22, and did not renew their request for\n   leave to amend. Therefore, only Counts IV and VII remain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Count IV claims defendants violated M.G.L. Chapter 244 \u00a7 35A, the terms of the mortgage contract, and M.G.L. Chapter 93A because they allegedly failed to provide plaintiffs with notice of their right to cure their default before foreclosing. Therefore, according to plaintiffs, the foreclosure sale is void. Count VII claims defendants violated M.G.L. Chapter 244 \u00a7 14, which establishes the notice requirements for conducting a foreclosure by power of sale, because defendants did not properly announce postponements of the foreclosure sale. Plaintiffs contend the foreclosure sale is, therefore, void for this separate reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants have filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on both remaining counts (the \"Motion\"), which plaintiffs oppose. For the reasons explained in this Memorandum, the Motion is being allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.

Paragraph 22 of the plaintiffs' mortgage states that before accelerating the loan and invoking the statutory power of sale, the lender must give the borrowers notice of the default and their right to cure, in a manner substantially similar to that required by \u00a7 35A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.

As the foreclosure sale in\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   occurred before the SJC decided\n   <em>\n    Pinti\n   </em>\n   in July 2015, the First Circuit affirmed dismissal of the plaintiff's claim that the foreclosure sale was void for violating the contractual notice provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516418\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/160/#p164\">\n    886 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   165 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pinti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20N.E.3d%201213\">\n    33 N.E.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1226-27 ).

In their First Amended Verified Complaint, plaintiffs previously attested that the February 2, 2015 sale was postponed, and also that there was a public postponement on at least February 9, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 140-41. Therefore, the affidavit plaintiffs filed in support of their opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment is insufficient to create a genuine dispute concerning whether the postponements were publicly announced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, even accepting as true the assertions in the plaintiffs' affidavit, a possible dispute concerning whether defendants failed to publicly proclaim the postponements would not constitute a violation of \u00a7 14 and, therefore, is not material. While defendants must \"strictly adhere\" to the publication and mailing requirements of \u00a7 14, after the statutorily required notices are provided, questions concerning the mortgagee's subsequent conduct during foreclosure proceedings are viewed \"in light of the mortgagee's general obligations of good faith, diligence, and fairness.\"\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=703%20N.E.2d%201192\">\n    703 N.E.2d at 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, although public proclamation is a\n   <em>\n    permissible\n   </em>\n   way to postpone a sale, it is not\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stephens-Martin v.

Thus, failure to publicly proclaim a postponement does not necessarily violate a mortgagee's obligations to deal fairly with the mortgagors in the foreclosure process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20732087\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Here, plaintiffs only assert in a conclusory manner that defendants \"did not act diligently and in good faith with us when performing the foreclosure sale by failing to use due diligence and follow the required statute.\" Pltfs. Aff. \u00b6 15. This assertion of bad faith and lack of diligence based solely on statutory noncompliance is negated by the fact that defendants\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   comply with \u00a7 14, as explained earlier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pemstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=630%20N.E.2d%20608\">\n    630 N.E.2d at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants' compliance with \u00a7 14 was complete when it published three times and mailed the notices of February 2, 2015 sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.G.L. c. 244 \u00a7 14. There is no additional evidence of bad faith conduct or lack of diligence concerning the foreclosure process. In any event, even if a factfinder could conclude that defendants failed to exercise reasonable diligence or exhibited bad faith with respect to the postponements, such conduct would not violate \u00a7 14 because, as explained earlier, \u00a7 14 does not govern postponements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=703%20N.E.2d%201192\">\n    703 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1194-95 ;\n   <em>\n    Stephens-Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20732087\">\n    2015 WL 732087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (holding that although mortgagees must \"strictly adhere to ... \u00a7 14, with regard to publishing for three consecutive weeks and notice to the mortgagee by registered mail,\" there is no statute addressing postponements).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Therefore, plaintiffs have failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact concerning whether defendants complied with Chapter 244 \u00a7 14 before conducting the foreclosure sale of their property on April 24, 2015. Defendants' Affidavit of Sale in the statutory form provides prima facie proof of compliance with the publication and mailing requirements of \u00a7 14, and plaintiffs have failed to introduce evidence sufficient to make this issue triable.
