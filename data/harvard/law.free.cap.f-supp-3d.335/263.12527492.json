Because no violation of the\n   Fourth Amendment occurred, the magistrate judge reasoned that suppression is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Legal Objections to the Report and Recommendation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Acevedo and Santos set forth two legal objections to the R &amp; R. First, the defendants argue that the \"Magistrate Judge can't find that [t]he officers had collective knowledge of the suspect's [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] description when it was never provided to the Court.\" (Docket No. 129 at p. 2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 130 at p. 10.) Second, Acevedo and Santos contend that police officers lacked reasonable suspicion and probable cause. (Docket No. 129 at pp. 4-8; Docket No. 130 at pp. 10-13.) The Court addresses each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Collective Knowledge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The defendants ground their objection regarding the purported absence of collective knowledge on a false premise: that the police officers never received a description of the defendants. (Docket No. 129 at p. 2.) The magistrate judge found that \"[t]he collective information known to officers was sufficient to warrant a reasonably prudent person in believing Defendants had committed an offense.\" (Docket No. 121 at p. 25.) Investigative stops, such as the\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop conducted by Officer V\u00e1zquez, \"generally occur in a dynamic environment marked by the potential for violence.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Reasonable Suspicion and Probable Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The defendants' analysis regarding reasonable suspicion is flawed. Acevedo and Santos evaluate the tip provided by Ortiz in a vacuum. They assert that \"[a] tip two individuals are associated with a stolen vehicle does not give the police\n   <em>\n    carte blanche\n   </em>\n   to begin arresting or detaining anyone and everyone.\" (Docket No. 130 at p. 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 129 at p. 4.) In sum, the defendants describe the tip received by Sergeant Col\u00f3n as a \"vague description ... insufficient to establish reasonably suspicion, let alone probable cause.\" (Docket No. 130 at p. 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Acevedo and Santos neglect to address the relevant circumstances preceding the defendants' detention. (Docket No. 130 at p. 12.) Acevedo inserts a condensed summary of the \"facts justifying the seizure,\" but omitted the following facts from his analysis: (1) Officer M\u00e9ndez observed bullets inside the copper-colored SUV, (2) the SUV that Officer M\u00e9ndez observed was reported as stolen by means of a carjacking, (3) the defendants failed to comply with the police officer's instructions to stop, and (4) Sergeant Col\u00f3n recovered bullets and a firearm from the path traveled by the defendants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1625072\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/802/553/#p557\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   A motion to suppress cannot rest on a narrow evaluation of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(Docket No. 34.) The magistrate judge initially set the suppression hearing for July 24, 2017, but subsequently granted the parties leave to conduct plea negotiations. (Docket Nos. 50, 52 and 57.) The negotiations resulted in plea agreements between the United States and both defendants. (Docket No. 58.) The Court presided over two change of plea hearings. (Docket Nos. 66 and 69.)
