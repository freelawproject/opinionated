PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   James Lynch, Lloyd Jones, and Baron Spencer bring this putative federal civil rights and common law false imprisonment class action against the City of New York. The City moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' constitutional claims for failure to state a claim and urges this Court to decline supplemental jurisdiction over the false imprisonment claims. For the reasons that follow, the City's motion to dismiss is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case concerns the constitutionality of pre-trial detention of people who have obtained judicial orders entitling them to release upon paying bail. In New York, \"cash bail in the amount designated in the order fixing bail may be posted\" at any time after an individual has been committed to custody.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Crim.%20Proc.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20520.15\">\n    N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law \u00a7 520.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). And \"[u]pon proof of the deposit of the designated amount,\" the detainee \"must be forthwith released from custody.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Crim.%20Proc.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20520.15\">\n    N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law \u00a7 520.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). The following is drawn from the allegations in the Complaint, which are presumed true for purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In broad strokes, the Complaint alleges that the City's byzantine and dysfunctional procedures for bail payment and release result in unreasonably lengthy delays in permitting bail to be posted and subsequently releasing detainees for whom bail has been paid. Although bail may be paid at the courthouse after the arraignment judge fixes the amount, Plaintiffs assert that the City routinely transports defendants to Department of Correction (\"DOC\") facilities as a matter of administrative convenience before friends and\n   family have the opportunity to post bail. (Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.) Once a defendant arrives at a DOC facility, a 12- to 22-hour intake process begins, during which the defendant is categorically ineligible to be released on bail. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.) In relevant part, this delay is further exacerbated by various inefficiencies in accepting bail, such as insufficient staff and DOC's antiquated paper-based records system. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-39.) Plaintiffs claim that the sacrifice of liberty in the name of administrative convenience continues even after bail has been accepted. For instance, because a DOC captain must sign off on each bail release, DOC waits until a critical mass of bailed-out detainees has gathered so their releases may be approved and processed\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   . (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that the City knew or should have known that its bail payment and release process could cause needless delay and the concomitant detention of individuals long after the legal basis for detention has dissipated. In particular, Plaintiffs point to a 2015 report authored by the Center for Court Innovation, a non-profit organization, identifying many of these deficiencies (the \"CCI Report\"). (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 30, 35, 39.) The CCI Report also made various recommendations to ensure that bail holds were honored, to allow bail to be posted during the intake process, to allocate sufficient staff, to remove reliance on paper-based systems, and to track the time between acceptance of bail and release. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51-56.) These recommendations, according to Plaintiffs, fell on deaf ears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The pre-trial detentions of the three putative class representatives are emblematic of these delays--James Lynch endured a 23-hour detention between posting bail and his release, Baron Spencer was forced to wait 18 hours after his bail was paid, and Lloyd Jones was released over 9 hours after his friends and family's 22-hour odyssey to post his bail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    James Lynch\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lynch was detained at the Anna M. Kross Center (\"AMKC\") on Rikers Island. (Compl. \u00b6 68.) On March 29, 2017, the Bronx Freedom Fund paid his $500 bail, which the City received at 3:56 p.m. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.) Sometime between 8:00 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., DOC personnel informed Lynch that his bail had been paid and directed him to gather his belongings in preparation for release. (Compl. \u00b6 71.) Lynch waited for hours to be released, but nobody arrived to escort him out. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.) Instead, DOC personnel advised him to be patient when he inquired as to his release. (Compl. \u00b6 73.) Around the designated \"lights out\" time at 11:00 p.m., Lynch realized that he would need to spend the night at AMKC and scrambled to secure his bedding, which he had given away in anticipation of his release. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72, 74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Around 4:00 a.m. on March 30, 2017--roughly twelve hours after the City received Lynch's bail payment--DOC personnel began to transport other inmates in the housing area who had court appearances that day. (Compl. \u00b6 75.) Although Lynch also had a court appearance that day, nobody came to process his release despite his pleas to DOC personnel. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 76-78.) Lynch was only escorted out of his housing area at approximately 9:00 a.m. and taken to an intake area, where he remained for another few hours. His detention at AMKC finally ended at 2:40 p.m., roughly 23 hours after the City received his bail payment. (Compl. \u00b6 81.) And not only did the City delay Lynch's release after his bail was posted, but they detained him for so long that he missed his scheduled court appearance and a bench warrant was ordered. (Compl. \u00b6 84.) Lynch's\n   bail receipt indicated that he had no outstanding warrants or detainers that would have precluded his immediate release. (Compl. \u00b6 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Baron Spencer\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Spencer was also a pre-trial detainee at AMKC. (Compl. \u00b6 107.) And as with Lynch, the Bronx Freedom Fund paid his $1,000 bail on December 19, 2015, which the City received at 1:38 p.m. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106, 108.) Lynch was only informed that his bail had been paid and directed to pack up his belongings close to midnight, over ten hours after the City received the payment. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 110-111.) But he too was not immediately released. Instead, DOC personnel escorted him to an intake area with several other detainees to spend the night, even as DOC officers slept, ate, or socialized in the intake area. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 111-112.) Spencer was released the next morning, approximately 18 hours after his bail was paid. (Compl. \u00b6 113.) Like Lynch, Spencer's bail receipt indicated no outstanding warrants or detainers that would have prohibited his immediate discharge. (Compl. \u00b6 109.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Lloyd Jones\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As with Lynch and Spencer, the Complaint avers that Jones suffered an unreasonable period of detention after his bail had been paid. But Jones' ordeal also illustrates how the City's bail processing practices needlessly delay the payment of bail after it has been set. In his case, the DOC's delay in accepting bail resulted from internally contradictory obligations created by DOC's procedures and directives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Jones was arraigned on January 7, 2017 at approximately noon, at which point the judge set bail at $2,000. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 86-87.) Jones' friends and family scrambled to collect money for bail, having been assured that he would remain at the courthouse for a short time so bail could be tendered. (Compl. \u00b6 88.) Within thirty minutes, a friend arrived to do so but was told to return after 2:00 p.m. because Jones' bail could not yet be accepted. (Compl. \u00b6 89.) The friend returned just after 2:00 p.m. as instructed. (Compl. \u00b6 90.) But now, the problem was not with the prematurity of the attempt to pay bail, but rather, that it was too late to pay bail at the courthouse because the DOC had whisked Jones away to the Vernon C. Bain Center (\"VCBC\"). (Compl. \u00b6 90.) Following several unsuccessful attempts to ascertain Jones' eligibility for bail, his friend attempted to pay bail in person at VCBC around 8:00 p.m. (Compl. \u00b6 92.) DOC personnel advised that Jones could not be released on bail because his intake process was ongoing and that his friend should check after midnight. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 93-94.) Yet again, DOC's left hand did not know what its right hand was doing. By the time Jones' friend called after midnight as directed, the employee responsible for processing bail had already left for the night. (Compl. \u00b6 95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Another friend and Jones' mother finally succeeded in paying bail in person the next morning at 10:30 a.m.--approximately 22 hours after the first attempt to pay bail. (Compl. \u00b6 97.) Several hours elapsed before DOC personnel informed Jones that his bail had been paid and that his paperwork was being processed. (Compl. \u00b6 99.) At around 7:00 p.m., DOC personnel transported Jones to a cell in VCBC's intake area with other detainees waiting to be released after paying bail. (Compl. \u00b6 100.) DOC released Jones at 8:00 p.m. on January 8, 2017, over 9 hours after it received his bail payment. (Compl. \u00b6 101.) And as with Lynch and Spencer, Jones' bail receipt indicated no outstanding warrants or detainers that would have prevented his immediate release.

Because the Complaint extensively references and quotes from the CCI Report, this Court deems it incorporated by reference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The City contends that Plaintiffs' constitutional claims fail for two independent reasons. First, the City asserts that Plaintiffs fail to allege an underlying constitutional violation because the length of time for which they were allegedly detained was presumptively reasonable. Second, the City submits that the Complaint does not allege a policy or practice under\n   <em>\n    Monell v. Department of Social Services\n   </em>\n   and its progeny. Likewise, the City seeks dismissal of the false imprisonment claims, though not on the merits. Rather, the City argues that supplemental jurisdiction should not be exercised over Plaintiffs' false imprisonment claims in the absence of a plausible federal claim. Finally, the City seeks to bar Plaintiffs' claims based on their failure to allege physical injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Prison Litigation Reform Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In relevant part, the PLRA bars actions \"brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody\" without a prior showing of physical injury. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e). As a threshold matter, neither side disputes that Plaintiffs had been released from confinement when they filed this action. The parties' disagreement boils down to whether the language \"confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility\" applies to prisoners\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   while they are confined or extends to actions filed after their release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The City urges the latter reading, relying on\n   <em>\n    Cox v. Malone\n   </em>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   court held that \u00a7 1997e(e)'s bar also applied to actions brought by \"former inmates incarcerated at the time of the alleged injury but subsequently released.\"\n   <em>\n    Cox v. Malone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431196\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/199/135/#p140\">\n    199 F.Supp.2d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). It explained that although the Second Circuit had held in another case that the PLRA's exhaustion requirement did not apply to individuals who were no longer incarcerated, its rationale could not be extended to \u00a7 1997e(e)'s physical injury requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431196\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/199/135/#p140\">\n    199 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   139 (citing\n   <em>\n    Greig v.

In particular, the\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   court reasoned that the PLRA's exhaustion requirement\n   was a procedural one meant to stem frivolous complaints by prisoners with little to lose and everything to gain.\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431196\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/199/135/#p140\">\n    199 F.Supp.2d at 139-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

By contrast, because the\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   court found that \u00a7 1997e(e)'s physical injury requirement was a \"\n   <em>\n    substantive\n   </em>\n   limitation on the type of actions,\" the purpose of \"weed[ing] out frivolous claims where only emotional injuries are alleged\" was equally served irrespective of whether the individual was detained or not at the time of filing.\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431196\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/199/135/#p140\">\n    199 F.Supp.2d at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This Court declines to follow\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   's reasoning for several reasons.

Plaintiffs allege that the City systemically infringes pre-trial detainees' liberty interests in paying bail by routinely removing them from the courthouse before bail can be posted and transferring them to DOC facilities to begin a multi-hour intake procedure during which they are categorically ineligible for release. Construing all inferences in favor\n   of Plaintiffs, the Complaint suggests that there is no reason--aside from accommodating shift changes and bus schedules--that detainees cannot be held at the courthouse to allow bail to be paid; nor is there any reason why bail cannot be accepted during the intake procedure. Ultimately, whether the City can demonstrate a legitimate governmental objective is a matter for summary judgment or trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Likewise, Plaintiffs sufficiently plead that DOC has a practice of forcing detainees who have already paid bail to remain detained until a critical mass forms such that their releases may be approved and processed in one fell swoop. According to Plaintiffs, there is no justification for this practice aside from convenience. At this stage of the litigation and especially given the primacy of the right to be free from bodily restraint, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that the City acted with deliberate indifference based on its purported knowledge from the CCI Report that its deficiencies in bail processing and release could result in unnecessary over-detentions of pre-trial detainees.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hancock v.

Based on these propositions, it concluded that the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated because she failed to allege any impermissible reasons to overcome the presumptive validity of her five-hour detention.\n   <em>\n    Scalpi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20858916\">\n    2016 WL 858916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   But the City's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Scalpi\n   </em>\n   is misplaced, in large part, because the cases on which Scalpi relies are inapposite. As discussed, this Court disagrees that the Fourth Amendment applies to Plaintiffs' claims, which--unlike those in\n   <em>\n    Mikulec\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Russo\n   </em>\n   --do not challenge the underlying constitutional basis to detain them in the first instance. Further,\n   <em>\n    Mikulec\n   </em>\n   states that a jurisdiction that releases the accused or provides probable cause determinations within 48 hours of arrest comports with the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Mikulec\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3835765\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/909/214/#p227\">\n    909 F.Supp.2d at 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of course, such a pronouncement is entirely appropriate in the Fourth Amendment context because it simply means that after restraining the liberty of an individual, the government must either promptly demonstrate the basis for continued detention or release the individual if it cannot. Such a presumption balances the State's \"strong interest in protecting public safety by taking into custody those persons who are reasonably suspected of having engaged in criminal activity\" with a warrantless arrestee's right to a prompt determination of probable cause, and the 48-hour bright line reflects the \"everyday problems of processing suspects through an overly burdened criminal justice system.\"\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216695\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/44/#p56\">\n    500 U.S. at 53, 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216695\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/44/#p56\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Attempting to apply\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   's presumption to this factual scenario is more elusive. At minimum, the liberty interest of a pre-trial detainee whose bail has been paid is undoubtedly greater than that of a warrantless arrestee, while at the same time, a bail determination may diminish the State's public safety interest.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2180329\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/379/764/#p773\">\n    379 F.3d at 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The different balance of interests between this case and\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   suggests that its presumption would be inapt here. And even assuming the propriety of a\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   -type presumption, the City does not offer any rationale for why 48 hours reflects the time needed to undertake administrative tasks incident to release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4189757\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/793/260/#p274\">\n    793 F.Supp.2d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing why \"courts appear to agree that the maximum permissible administrative delay in the overdetention context likely falls well short of the 48-hour horizon set out in\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   \").

But the Complaint, taken as true, sufficiently alleges municipal liability based on\n   the City's widespread practices of immediately transporting detainees to DOC facilities to begin an intake process during which they are categorically ineligible for release and continuing to detain those who have paid bail so that releases may be approved and processed in the aggregate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green v.
