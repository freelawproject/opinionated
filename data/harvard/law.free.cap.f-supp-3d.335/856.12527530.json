MAZZANT, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending before the Court is AHS Staffing, LLC's (\"AHS\") Application for a Preliminary Injunction against Defendants Quest Staffing Group, Inc. (\"Quest\"), Jaclyn Ward (\"Ward\"), Michelle Swann (\"Swann\"), and Sandra Dominguez (\"Dominguez\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") (Dkt. # 15). After reviewing the relevant pleadings and motion, the Court finds that the motion should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   AHS matches nurses and other healthcare professionals (\"Candidates\") on temporary and permanent bases with \"hospitals, healthcare groups, occupational healthcare clinics, individual practitioners, networks, psychiatric facilities, government institutions and managed care entities and/or through contract management groups.\" (Dkt. # 14 at p. 4). The healthcare staffing industry is highly competitive, so AHS must offer and deliver highly skilled healthcare providers at competitive rates to survive and thrive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In order to ensure its competitive advantage, AHS claims to have compiled confidential and proprietary information, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (1) [T]he identity of [AHS's] customers, clients, healthcare providers, contacts, prospects, and Candidates; (2) the business, finances and special needs of [AHS], its customers, clients, contacts, prospects, and Candidates; (3) [AHS's] policies and procedures; (4) [AHS's] compensation plans and employee benefits; (5) confidential market studies; (6) pricing studies, information and analyses; (7) current and prospective business projections; (8) business plans and strategies; (9) non-public financial statements and information of [AHS], its clients and Candidates with whom [AHS] works; (10) methods of bidding, bids to customers, clients and prospects and profit margins; (11) unique software programs and databases developed by [AHS] including, but not limited to, all computer disks, slides, files, manuals, or other information pertaining to such software programs and databases; and (12) information regarding its employees' and Candidates' performance, compensation, skill sets and the confidential information known by the employees. (the \"Confidential Information\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (Dkt. # 14 at pp. 4-5). AHS purports to have developed and continually revised its Confidential Information through great labor and cost and that its Confidential Information is among its most valuable assets. AHS allegedly stores its most valuable Confidential Information-i.e. Candidates' contract statuses, professional skills, work history, availability, and compensation structures-in its Applicant Tracking System (the \"Database\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   AHS claims that its then-employees Ward, Swann, and Dominguez (collectively, the \"Individual Defendants\") maliciously changed the information for Candidates in the Database to whom the Individual Defendants were assigned as recruiters in order to hurt AHS's business. AHS further alleges that the Individual Defendants then left with a sizable amount of Confidential Information to work for its direct competitor, Quest. AHS next contends that Defendants have been using its trade secrets and confidential business information to compete with AHS in breach of their contractual and common law duties to AHS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 9, 2018, AHS filed suit against Defendants, asserting claims for (1) violation of the computer fraud and abuse act against the Individual Defendants; (2) harmful access by computer against the Individual Defendants; (3) breach of contract against Ward; (4) breach of contract against Swann and Dominguez; (5) request for declaratory relief against the Individual Defendants; (6) misappropriation of trade secrets under the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\"TUTSA\") against Defendants; (7) tortious interference against Defendants; (8) breach of fiduciary duty against the Individual Defendants; and (9) civil conspiracy against Defendants (Dkt. # 14). On July 9, 2018, AHS filed its application for a preliminary injunction, asking the Court to enjoin Defendants from using\n   AHS's trade secrets (Dkt. # 15). On July 23, 2018, Defendants filed their response (Dkt. # 24). On July 25, 2018, AHS filed its reply (Dkt. # 25). On July 26, 2018, Defendants filed their sur-reply (Dkt. # 27).

AHS argues that the Individual Defendants breached their employment and technology agreements with AHS by taking the Confidential Information in the Database. AHS also asserts that the Individual Defendants were high-level employees and this status forged an independent duty to keep the Database secret and to use it properly. Defendants counter that AHS did not fully apply its security measures associated with the Database to the Individual Defendants.

AHS explains that \"companies like AHS gain a competitive advantage through their knowledge of the market, including open positions and qualified and available candidates, and their ability to quickly match the two together.\" (Dkt. # 16 at p. 3). As a result, AHS contends that its database \"greatly increases AHS's chances of winning business.\" (Dkt. # 16 at p. 3).

Smith further explains that if a competitor were \"able to gain access to this information, [it] would immediately gain a significant advantage over AHS and other industry leaders.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 1 at p. 3). AHS's Chief Technology Officer Brian Schwidder (\"Schwidder\") asserted in his affidavit that the development of the Database \"required the investment of significant resources and was done over a considerable time as AHS continued to obtain additional information about its Candidates, customers and the market and continued to update the [Database] to reflect that information.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at p. 2). Schwidder elaborates that if AHS's competitors gained \"access to [the Database, AHS's] competitive efforts would be severely hampered because [those competitors] would be able to more efficiently match and place Candidates (both current and prospective) with customers (both current and prospective) using information not generally known in the industry.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Smith declares that AHS protects the Database by (1) \"making employees sign confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-disclosure agreements at the outset of their employment\"; (2) keeping \"all employees ... subject to company policies that require them to maintain the confidentiality of all AHS information ...\"; and (3) having employees sign technology agreements that \"limit the uses for which employees may use the information in [the Database] to acceptable uses in furtherance of those employees' job responsibility for AHS.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 1 at p. 3). AHS asserted that Swann and Dominguez signed technology agreements, \"promising to protect all [of AHS's] confidential information.\" (Dkt. # 25 at p. 6; Dkt. # 25, Exhibit 1 at pp. 6-7). Finally, AHS claimed to keep the Database \"on a secure cloud server [where it] is password protected.\" (Dkt. # 25 at p. 2). Though Defendants stress that \"these safeguards were not implemented with respect to [the Individual Defendants],\" courts do not require absolute protection of confidential information for it to qualify for trade secret protection.\n   <em>\n    360 Mortg.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20900577\">\n    2016 WL 900577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (finding that an employer protected a database's confidentiality by restricting its access with a \"secure password,\" stressing its confidentiality in meetings, and labeling it as confidential). Accordingly, AHS demonstrated that it derives economic value from the Database, the Database's Confidential Information is not readily ascertainable, and it takes reasonable measures to keep the Database secret. Thus, the Court concludes that AHS has sufficiently shown a likelihood that the Database qualifies as a trade secret for purposes of this preliminary injunction analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. AHS Made a Prima Facie Case that Defendants Acquired Its Trade Secret by Improper Means\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   AHS argues that the Individual Defendants misappropriated its trade secrets by taking Confidential Information from the Database and recruiting AHS's top talent after joining Quest. AHS further avers that since the Individual Defendants went to a direct competitor of AHS, their disclosure of Confidential Information from the Database is inevitable. Aside from contending that the Database is not a trade secret, the Defendants claim that AHS offered no evidence that they \"improperly used any information that was not readily ascertainable or [protected] as a trade secret.\" (Dkt. # 24 at p. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   TUTSA partly defines \"misappropriation\" as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (A) acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (B) disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (i) used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (ii) at the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that the person's knowledge of the trade secret was:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (a) derived from or through a person who used improper means to acquire the trade secret;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (b) acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain the secrecy of or limit the use of the trade secret; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (c) derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain the secrecy of or limit the use of the trade secret....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Tex.

Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 134A.002(2) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   AHS presented a wealth of circumstantial evidence that strongly indicates Defendants acquired its trade secret by improper means. In the preliminary injunction hearing, AHS explained first that all three of the Individual Defendants misrepresented their reasons for leaving AHS as well as their next professional endeavor. Swann told AHS that she was leaving the company to look for a new job. Ward assured AHS that she planned to take a sabbatical from business and suggested that she might eventually pursue physician recruitment with a different company-a field wholly separate from AHS's staffing business. Finally, Dominguez claimed that she was leaving AHS to manage a hair salon. None of the Individual Defendants mentioned Quest in their parting conversations with AHS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   When Ward departed AHS on May 11, 2018 she had already deleted her entire email \"inbox,\" \"sent box,\" and \"deleted box\" contrary to company policy. At the time of the preliminary injunction hearing, AHS had still not been able to recover Ward's deleted emails. Dominguez left AHS on May 12, 2018. Swann left AHS on May 18, 2018. Thereafter, all three of the Individual Defendants joined Quest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Before the Individual Defendants left the company, AHS claims that they made extensive changes to the Database. Schwidder declares that the Individual Defendants \"had access to [the Database] and the information therein as part of their job responsibilities at AHS.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at p. 3). Schwidder explains that those with access to the Database were able to \"delete or hide key information\" and AHS keeps a \"detailed log of any changes made to important records, including who made the change, when the change was made and the type of change.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at p. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Schwidder asserts that before the Individual Defendants departed AHS there were \"widespread and unusual alterations of Candidate records in critical fields [of the Database] including Assigned Recruiter, Status and Contact Information.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at p. 3). Schwidder claims that \"[t]he alterations [he] discovered were well beyond the scope of any alterations that would have been made in the normal course of business.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3\n   at p. 3). All told, Schwidder declares that 531 candidates \"had their Assigned Recruiter deleted,\" 237 Candidates \"had their Status changed,\" and seventeen (17) Candidates \"had their Contact Information altered.\" (the \"Modified Candidates\") (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at p. 4). Given the highly irregular \"nature, scope, and timing of these changes,\" Schwidder asserts that he believes \"it is reasonable to assume that these changes were made as part of a deliberate effort to modify the [Database] to the detriment of AHS prior to the departure of the Individual Defendants.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at p. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Specifically, Schwidder states that \"Swann was responsible for changing at least [193] Candidate profiles before she unexpectedly terminated her employment with AHS. Over 60 [percent] of these Candidates were changed into 'non-placeable' or 'unavailable' Status.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at p. 4). Schwidder further declares that \"Ward was responsible for changing at least [189] Candidate profiles before leaving AHS. Over sixty [ (60) ] of these Candidates were changed into 'non-placeable' or 'unavailable' Status.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at p. 4). Finally, Schwidder states that \"Dominguez was responsible for changing at least ninety-three [ (93) ] Candidate profiles, the majority of which had their Assigned Recruiter deleted. Of these ninety-three [ (93) ] Candidates, twenty-four [ (24) ] had their Status changed-most were changed into a 'nonplaceable' or 'unavailable' status.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at p. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As AHS explained at the preliminary injunction hearing, these alterations turned \"hot\" leads for Candidates into \"cold\" leads and removed them from AHS's consideration for immediate staffing assignments. AHS further explained that the alterations of the Candidates' contact information were aimed to stop AHS from being able to contact the Candidates and, as a result, to prevent AHS from assigning them to staffing opportunities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   AHS claimed that \"[a]fter convincing the Individual Defendants to resign from AHS to work with them, Quest and the Individual Defendants began to solicit AHS customers via phone and email.\" (Dkt. # 16 at p. 6). Smith declares \"[s]ince [the Individual Defendants] terminated their employment with AHS and accepted employment at competitor Quest, [AHS has] lost at least thirty [ (30) ] of [its] most sought-after Candidates in the form of lapsed and non-renewed contracts.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 1 at p. 6). Smith explains that \"[t]his is highly unusual and in [his] opinion, directly related to [the Individual Defendant's] alteration of these Candidates' profiles.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 1 at p. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In their affidavits, the Individual Defendants do not address Schwidder's implication that they maliciously altered critical information in the Database before leaving or Smith's insinuation that they caused the irregular loss of many of AHS's most sought after Candidates after their departure (Dkt. # 24, Exhibit 1-3). Instead, Swann and Dominguez only claim that they \"remove[d] their names as the recruiter assigned to a prospect or candidate.\" (Dkt. # 24, Exhibit 2 at p. 2, Exhibit 3 at p. 3). Only Ward denies changing the status of Candidates (Dkt. # 24, Exhibit 1 at p. 4). Moreover, the Individual Defendants do not wholly deny taking confidential information from the Database. At most, Ward claims that she \"never downloaded information from the [Database] or transferred [Database] information to [her] new employer, Quest.\" (Dkt. # 24, Exhibit 1 at p. 4). Ward also claims that she deleted her emails \"based on [her] understanding that these steps were required in order to reissue [her] AHS laptop\n   to another employee.\" (Dkt. # 24, Exhibit 1 at p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Ward avers that \"[b]efore leaving AHS [she] accessed the [Database] maintained by AHS ... to remove my name as the recruiter assigned to a prospect so that another recruiter at AHS could be assigned to the prospect.\" (Dkt. # 24, Exhibit 1 at p. 4). Dominguez makes a similar claim, adding that \"[she] informed John Clements of the change [she] made on the system without objection from him, and [she] provided Mr. Clements with a full list of the prospects and candidates [she] had been recently working with at AHS.\" (Dkt. # 24, Exhibit 2 at p. 2). Finally, Swann asserts that she also \"removed [her] name as the recruiter assigned to a prospect or candidate so that the prospect or candidate could be reassigned by AHS to a new AHS recruiter.\" (Dkt. # 24, Exhibit 3 at p. 3). Swann stated that it \"was [her] understanding this was AHS standard practice.\" (Dkt. # 24, Exhibit 3 at p. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   John Clements (\"Clements\")-President of the NurseStat Division of AHS-counters these denials of misconduct by declaring that he never ordered any of the Individual Defendants to make any changes to the Database before leaving AHS and did not know about their modifications to the Database when she departed (Dkt. # 25, Exhibit 1 at p. 4). At the preliminary injunction hearing, AHS further explained that there was no way that it would have instructed the Individual Defendants to modify the Database since it did not even know about the changes until after the Individual Defendants had left AHS. Accordingly, AHS adequately demonstrated that the Individual Defendants acquired its trade secret by improper means and Quest acquired AHS's trade secret when it knew or had reason to have known that it was acquired by improper means or used\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   AHS's trade secret after it was \"derived from or through a person who used improper means to acquire the trade secret.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 134A.002(3). Thus, the Court finds that AHS made a prima facie case that Defendants obtained its trade secret by improper means for purposes of this preliminary injunction analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.

Clements declares that Swann contacted one of AHS's \"most promising Candidates\n   <em>\n    on behalf of Quest\n   </em>\n   ,\" making \"specific reference to the Candidate's current placement, end date and location.\" (Dkt. # 25, Exhibit 1 at p. 5) (emphasis added). Clements claims that \"[t]his information is not publicly available, and could have only been learned by ... Swann in the course of her employment with AHS and through her access to the [Database] because this Candidate had worked exclusively with AHS in the past.\" (Dkt. # 25, Exhibit 1 at p. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   At the preliminary injunction hearing, AHS presented documentary evidence of a phone call between one of AHS's Candidates (\"Candidate A\") and Swann on July 3, 2018. In that conversation, Swann told Candidate A that \"[s]he knew that [Candidate\n   A's] contract was up in Greenville, North Carolina June 9 and repeated this several times and wanted to talk to [Candidate A] about a new travel assignment.\" (Dkt. # 25, Exhibit 2 at p. 2). Candidate A explained in the documentary evidence that she asked Swann \"how she even knew about [Candidate A's] contract and told her again [that Candidate A had] never spoken to her ever and [Swann] insisted [they] had and wanted to follow up from [their] previous conversation.\" (Dkt. # 25, Exhibit 2 at p. 2). AHS stressed that Candidate A's contract end date on June 9 was \"absolutely not publicly available\" and the timing of Candidate A's contract termination-a few weeks before Swann contacted her on July 3-made her a \"hot\" lead. AHS also offered an email solicitation that Swann sent to Candidate A as evidence of use of its trade secret (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 5 at p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   AHS next offered an email string beginning with Ward's solicitation of one of AHS's Candidates and ending with the Candidate's AHS recruiter explaining that the Candidate \"called [her] last night to ask if [AHS] sold her info because she's not signed up with anyone but [AHS, yet] she is getting calls and emails all of a sudden.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 2 at p. 2). Again, the Candidate's contract had \"just ended in April\" and Ward contacted her on May 22, 2018 (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 2 at p. 2). Accordingly, AHS presented two cases where the Individual Defendants-specifically, Ward and Swann-solicited AHS's Candidates using non-public information shortly after the end of their contract dates. As AHS explained, such Candidates were \"hot leads\" since their contracts had just expired and they were likely looking for new assignments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Next, Schwidder declares that he \"learned of another call made by Dominguez to one of [AHS's] Candidates [where she] similarly solicits the ... Candidate [and] references the amount that Quest can pay as compared to 'competitors.' \" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at p. 5). Schwidder contends that this \"indicates knowledge of AHS's compensation structure that Dominguez necessarily would have learned through her employment with AHS and [her] access to [the Database].\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at pp. 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Additionally, Dominguez's alleged alteration of the Database-i.e. changing at least ninety-three (93) Candidate profiles, deleting the assigned recruiter for the majority of these Candidate profiles, and changing the status for twenty-four (24) of the Candidate profiles to \"non-placeable\" or \"unavailable\"-was a \"use\" of the Database as it was \"exploitation ... likely to result in injury to the trade secret owner.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at p. 4);\n   <em>\n    GE Betz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516312\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/318/#p326\">\n    885 F.3d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wellogix, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570424\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/867/#p874\">\n    716 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   877 ). After all, by allegedly making these alterations, Dominguez turned hot leads into cold leads, prevented AHS from pursuing the most available Candidates, and injured AHS's business of staffing Candidates with healthcare providers. Indeed, AHS demonstrated that the Individual Defendants all used the Database on this basis since all of the Individual Defendants allegedly modified the Database to turn hot leads into cold leads by changing Candidate statuses to \"non-placeable\" and \"unavailable.\" (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 6 at p. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   All of this evidence strongly indicates that the Individual Defendants and, indeed, Quest as their employer used the Database to their benefit and to AHS's detriment. In its briefing and in the preliminary injunction hearing, AHS clearly and comprehensively connected the dots between this copious circumstantial evidence and its cause of action for misappropriation of Trade Secrets under TUTSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Thus, the Court finds that AHS presented a prima facie case for misappropriation of trade secrets under TUTSA and is likely to succeed on the merits of this facet of its misappropriation of trade secrets claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    iv.

Put simply, AHS claims that Ward had a contractual as well as a statutory obligation not to disclose its trade secret-i.e. the Database. AHS provided a multitude of evidence that Ward improperly obtained and used AHS's trade secret-i.e. the Database's confidential information-in breach of the duly executed Employment Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   at 5-13. AHS offered a mountain of direct and circumstantial evidence to suggest that Ward (1) tampered with the Database to harm AHS's business, (2) sent emails, impliedly containing Confidential Information from the Database, and then erased those emails to cover her tracks, and (3) disclosed Confidential Information from the Database to Quest. In turn, AHS made a prima facie case that Ward breached the section of her Employment Agreement, mandating that she\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   shall not\n   <em>\n    disclose, convert, or use\n   </em>\n   any of the Trade Secrets, directly or indirectly, nor use them in any way, either during the term of this Agreement or thereafter; except as required in the ordinary course of [her] employment for the benefit of [AHS].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (Dkt. # 25, Exhibit 5 at p. 5) (emphasis added). Though the Court quotes the language associated with the Trade Secret provision of the Employment Agreement, Ward's actions also apparently run afoul of the Proprietary Documents, Confidential Information, Handling of Covered Items, and Duty Not to Disclose Provisions of the Employment Agreement (Dkt. # 25, Exhibit 5 at pp. 4-6). After all, AHS demonstrated that the Database contained confidential information-most critically its top Candidate's contract information. Next, AHS presented sufficient evidence that its Trade Secrets and Confidential Information were \"acquired at the expense of the Company or through the labor of its employees,\" making them Proprietary Documents under the Employment Agreement (Dkt. # 25, Exhibit 5 at p. 5). Put simply, the provisions of the Employment Agreement with regard to AHS's Confidential\n   Information overlap and AHS has made a prima facie case that Ward violated at least one and possibly all of them through her alleged malfeasance. Thus, the Court finds that AHS is likely to succeed on the merits of this portion of its breach of contract claim against Ward. Since AHS demonstrated that it is likely to succeed in these facets of its breach of contract claim against Ward, the Court will not consider whether Ward violated the Employment Agreement's non-solicitation provision. Since the Court finds that AHS is likely to succeed on the merits of its trade secret misappropriation claim and breach of contract claim against Ward, the Court will decide whether AHS satisfied the remaining criteria to obtain a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

AHS faces irreparable harm by Defendants' misappropriation of trade secrets because Defendants can benefit from AHS's trade secrets without first investing the time, expense, and labor necessary to research and compile the confidential information in the Database.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc. v.

Defendants' possession of confidential information from the Database allows them to enhance Quest's proprietary database through AHS's labor. This cannot be undone by money alone. Any calculation of monetary damages would fail to fully appreciate the harm done by Defendants' developing a more robust database by skipping the necessary research and development undertaken by every other competitor.\n   <em>\n    Halliburton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6906418\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/444/251/#p260\">\n    444 S.W.3d at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Balance of Hardships\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   When deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction, \"courts must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    555 U.S. at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Courts consider several factors in balancing the equities. Notably, courts consider the threat of disclosure of the trade secrets by defendants,\n   <em>\n    Cisco Sys., Inc. v. Huwaei Techs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107491\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/266/551/#p555\">\n    266 F.Supp.2d 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 555-58 (E.D.

Tex. Dec. 28, 2006), and whether denial will cause a loss of current market share or simply reduce prospects for expansion,\n   <em>\n    Flywheel Fitness, LLC v. Flywheel Sports, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:13-CV-48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012138593\">\n    2013 WL 12138593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (E.D. Tex. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Here, the equities favor a preliminary injunction limited to the Modified Candidates-i.e. the 531 Candidates in the Database who had their assigned recruiter deleted, the 237 Candidates in the Database who had their status changed, and the seventeen (17) Candidates in the Database who had their contact information altered (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at p. 4). As previously discussed, the Court finds that disclosure of AHS's Confidential Information from the Database by its former employees to Quest-AHS's Direct Competitor-is probable. Ward claimed that Quest\n   has a larger database than AHS so a preliminary injunction will not destroy Quest (Dkt. # 24, Exhibit 1 at p. 3). For the same reasons, precluding Defendants from contacting the Modified Candidates may reduce Quest's prospects for expansion but will not cost it any market share. Thus, the equities favor granting a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Indeed, \"the undoubted tendency of the law has been to recognize and enforce higher standards of commercial morality in the business world.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2063196\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/366/497/#p502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hyde Corp. v.

Here, a preliminary injunction serves the public interest by depriving Defendants of the benefit of the allegedly misappropriated trade secret and, in so doing, enforces better business ethics by depriving the alleged wrongdoers of the benefit of their wrongdoing. Thus, the Court finds that a preliminary injunction will only serve the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   It is therefore\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff's Application for Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. # 15) is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants Quest Staffing Group, Inc., Jaclyn Ward, Michelle Swann, and Sandra Dominguez, their officers, agents, servants, consultants, contractors, employees, attorneys, and any person or entity in concert or participation with them, are hereby\n   <strong>\n    ENJOINED\n   </strong>\n   from contacting the Modified Candidates in AHS Staffing, LLC's Applicant Tracking System-i.e. the 531 Candidates in the Database who had their assigned recruiter deleted, the 237 Candidates in the Database who had their status changed, and the seventeen (17) Candidates in the Database who had their contact information altered (Dkt. # 16, Exhibit 3 at p. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that this Preliminary Injunction shall not be effective unless and until AHS Staffing, LLC files an appropriate bond or cash deposit in lieu thereof in the amount of $1,500.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The Court discusses Quest's use of the Database in the following section.\n    <em>\n     Infra\n    </em>\n    at 13-15 \"AHS Made a Prima Facie Case that Defendants Used Its Trade Secret Under TUTSA.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
