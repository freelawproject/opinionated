Wood, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Erin Terrazzino purchased a bag of Great Value All Natural Pita Chips (\"Pita Chips\") from Defendant Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s (\"Walmart\") website. Terrazzino alleges that despite the fact that the Pita Chips were prominently branded as \"All Natural,\" the product contained a variety of synthetic, artificial, and heavily-processed ingredients. Consequently, Terrazzino has filed this lawsuit alleging that Walmart's representation of the Pita Chips as \"All Natural\" was false, misleading, and deceptive. Presently before the Court is Walmart's motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b), 12(b)(1), and 12(b)(6). (Dkt. No. 13). For the reasons explained below, Walmart's motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As alleged in the Complaint, Walmart manufactured, distributed, advertised, labeled, and sold the Pita Chips. (Compl. \u00b6 23, Dkt. No. 1.) The Pita Chips' packaging prominently displayed the words \"All Natural\" in all capital letters on the front center of the bag. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) The package also had a stamp on the bottom-right side of the bag that said \"All Natural\" and \"Cholesterol Free\" around the edge and \"baked\" in the center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37 &amp; Fig. 2.) The image below shows the packaging's general appearance:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Despite this advertising, the Pita Chips actually contained a variety of synthetic, artificial, and heavily-processed ingredients, including enriched wheat flour, which contains niacin, thiamine mononitrate, and folic acid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Enriched flour is formed when wheat seeds are ground to remove the outer layer of the seed, as well as almost all nutrients. The flour is then synthetically bleached with chemical additives to give it a white color. After bleaching, synthetic substances (including niacin, thiamine mononitrate, and folic acid ) are added to the flour to restore nutritional value to the Pita Chips. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 4, 2017, Terrazzino purchased the Pita Chips through Walmart's online store, paying approximately $2.00 for the bag. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) On the webpage where the Pita Chips were sold, there was an \"about this item\" section, which listed the following ingredients: \"Enriched Wheat Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid ), Sunflower Oil, Sea Salt, Yeast, Oat Fiber, Sugar, Wheat Starch, Ascorbic Acid, Silicon Dioxide.\" (Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. 1 at 4 of 12, Dkt. No. 58.) To view these ingredients, however, a user had to go through one of two processes: the user could either scroll three pages\n   of web content to the \"about this item\" tab, and then click on the \"read more\" tab to find the ingredients (Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. A, Dkt. No. 21); or the user could click on an earlier \"read more\" tab, which would take her straight to the \"about this item\" tab, and then click on a second \"read more\" tab to find the ingredients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Terrazzino has brought the present class-action lawsuit, alleging that Walmart's representation that the Pita Chips were \"All Natural\" was false, misleading, and deceptive. She seeks to represent the following classes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    The National Class\n   </em>\n   : All persons who, between March 3, 2012 and present purchased one or more bags of \"Great Value All Natural PITA CHIPS\" at a Walmart store located in the United States or online at www.walmart.com.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    The Illinois Class\n   </em>\n   : All persons who, between March 3, 2014 and present purchased one or more bags of \"Great Value All Natural PITA CHIPS\" at a Walmart store located in Illinois or online at www.walmart.com while in Illinois.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51, 52.) Terrazzino's complaint alleges common law claims for breach of express warranty (Count I) and unjust enrichment (Count II) on behalf of the National Class, and violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Practices Act (\"ICFA\") on behalf of the Illinois Class (Count III).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Rule 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Walmart first argues that Terrazzino lacks standing to assert claims premised on the laws of states other than Illinois and therefore any such claims must be dismissed. Specifically, Walmart contends that because Terrazzino claims no injuries in any state other than Illinois, she has no standing to pursue statutory causes of action under the laws of any other state. Terrazzino counters that this argument is premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[T]he question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or particular issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Apex v.

This split stems from the interpretation of two Supreme Court cases:\n   <em>\n    Amchem Products, Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Amchem\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court\n   considered whether a class should be certified for settlement purposes and held that dispositive class certification issues were \"logically antecedent to the existence of any Article III issues.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/\">\n    521 U.S. at 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Both\n   <em>\n    Amchem\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   concerned certification of settlement classes in asbestos litigation, and in both cases the Supreme Court made its decision based on class certification issues.\n   <em>\n    Amchem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/\">\n    521 U.S. at 628-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248131\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/815/\">\n    527 U.S. at 864-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248131\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/815/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 2295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

One difference between\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   and Terrazzino's case, however, is the fact that the class representatives in\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   were all personally injured by the operation of the same statute that caused injuries to all other members of the proposed class.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11440155\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/308/673/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11440155\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/308/673/\">\n    at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, in contrast, Terrazzino brings claims not just under the laws of the state in which she resides and was injured-Illinois-but also under the laws of every other state. Whether a court may postpone a standing analysis until after class certification when the plaintiff seeks to represent nationwide class members, even when she only has a connection to one state, is a question that has divided courts in this District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dairy Farmers of Am., Inc.

Nonetheless, the Court believes that Walmart has presented a true standing question. Terrazzino claims that because of Walmart's false, misleading, and deceptive representations and omissions, she was injured in a number of ways, including being deprived of the benefit of the bargain because the product she purchased was different from what Walmart represented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Terrazzino thus has alleged a concrete and particularized injury, and she has constitutional standing to pursue her claim. The \"standing\" issues highlighted by Walmart are solely the product of Terrazzino's attempt to represent a national class. What Walmart really contests is Terrazzino's ability to represent the class, and that issue is best addressed at the class certification stage.

The\n   <em>\n    Ibarrola\n   </em>\n   court held that to arrive at a reasonable understanding of \"no refined sugars,\" the plaintiff should have considered the ingredient label on the back of the package, which notified the consumer that the product contained evaporated cane juice and molasses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290573\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/83/751/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290573\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/83/751/\">\n    at 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although Walmart argues that\n   <em>\n    Ibarrola\n   </em>\n   is similar to the case presently before this Court, it is readily distinguishable. Significantly, the plaintiffs in the two cases absorbed different information prior to purchasing and consuming the products. In\n   <em>\n    Ibarrola\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff admitted that she purchased the product in person, read the entire product label before purchasing it, and in doing so learned that the product contained evaporated cane juice and molasses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290573\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/83/751/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290573\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/83/751/\">\n    at 755, 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, in contrast, Terrazzino does not allege that she read the ingredient label. Further, Terrazzino purchased the Pita Chips through Walmart's website, rather than at a physical store. Terrazzino claims in her response to the motion to dismiss that it was not only possible to purchase the Pita Chips without reading the ingredient lists, but that Walmart made it fairly inconvenient and even arduous to access the ingredient list. (At the pleading stage, the Court has no basis to doubt this assertion.) In contrast, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Ibarrola\n   </em>\n   only had to flip over the package to learn more about the ingredients contained in the product. As the ingredients were arguably much more difficult to ascertain here than in\n   <em>\n    Ibarrola\n   </em>\n   and Terrazzino has not alleged that she actually read the ingredient label for the Pita Chips,\n   <em>\n    Ibarrola's\n   </em>\n   reasoning has little application here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Alternatively, Walmart asks the Court to apply the reasoning employed by the district court in\n   <em>\n    Kelly v.

In\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff alleged that she purchased chips which were falsely labeled as \"All Natural\" and containing \"no preservatives,\" when in fact the chips contained numerous artificial and synthetic ingredients.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269072\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/81/754/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269072\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/81/754/\">\n    at 756-57, 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

App. Ct. Dec. 14, 2011) ). Terrazzino has alleged that Walmart falsely labeled the Pita Chips as \"All Natural\" to increase sales of the product. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39, 40.) According to Terrazzino, Walmart was well aware that claims of \"All Natural\" are material to consumers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Thus, Walmart \"knew and intended that consumers would purchase the [Pita Chips] which [were] labeled 'All Natural' over comparable products not so labeled, furthering [Walmart's] interest of increasing\" its pita chip sales and decreasing sales of other comparable products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Put another way, according to the complaint, Walmart's labeling of the Pita Chips as \"All Natural\" was more than just a failure to perform, it was the scheme through which Walmart achieved its fraud. These allegations demonstrate that Terrazzino's ICFA claim is more than just a repackaged breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Breach of Warranty Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Walmart also contends that Terrazzino fails to plead a breach of warranty claim adequately because she has not alleged pre-suit notice. Under Section 2-607 of the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\"), a buyer alleging a breach of warranty must notify the seller of the breach \"within a reasonable time after she discovers\" it or else she is \"barred from any remedy.\" 810 ILCS 5/2-607(3)(a). The notice must, at a minimum, let \"the seller know that the particular transaction is still troublesome and must be watched.\"\n   <em>\n    Connick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=221%20Ill.%20Dec.%20389\">\n    221 Ill.Dec. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=675%20N.E.2d%20584\">\n    675 N.E.2d at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Terrazzino has not alleged that she provided direct pre-suit notice. This does not necessarily doom Terrazzino's claim, however. Pre-suit notice is not required in two circumstances: \"(1) when the seller has actual knowledge of the defect of the particular product; or (2) the seller is deemed to have been reasonably notified by the filing of the buyer's complaint alleging breach of the UCC warranty.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=675%20N.E.2d%20584\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=221%20Ill.%20Dec.%20389\">\n    221 Ill.Dec. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=675%20N.E.2d%20584\">\n    675 N.E.2d at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The second exception only applies when the buyer alleges a personal injury as a result of breach.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=675%20N.E.2d%20584\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=221%20Ill.%20Dec.%20389\">\n    221 Ill.Dec. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=675%20N.E.2d%20584\">\n    675 N.E.2d at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Terrazzino has not alleged a personal injury, that exception does not apply here. Instead, Terrazzino argues that the first exception applies-she contends that Walmart had actual knowledge that the Pita Chips were not natural, and therefore direct pre-suit notice was unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But nowhere in the complaint does Terrazzino allege that Walmart had actual knowledge that its Pita Chips were not all natural. Terrazzino only makes two allegations as to Walmart's knowledge. First, she alleges that Walmart knew that consumers would purchase the Pita Chips because they were labeled \"All Natural\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   and pass over similar products that were not so labeled. (Compl. \u00b6 40.) And second, she alleges that Walmart knew consumers bought the Pita Chips with the expectation that they would be free of any artificial or synthetic ingredients. (Compl. \u00b6 85.) Neither of these allegations is sufficient to state a claim of Walmart's actual knowledge that its product contained a defect-namely, that its Pita Chips were not all natural. Because Terrazzino failed to provide pre-suit notice and has not demonstrated an applicable exception, her breach of warranty claim (Count I) is dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Walmart argues that Terrazzino's unjust enrichment claim should be dismissed because it is simply a restated breach of contract claim. But \"unjust enrichment is based on an implied contract, where there is a specific contract which governs the relationship of the parties, the doctrine of unjust enrichment has no application.\"\n   <em>\n    People ex rel. Hartigan v. E &amp; E Hauling, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4738855\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/153/473/\">\n    153 Ill.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=180%20Ill.%20Dec.%20271\">\n    180 Ill.Dec. 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=607%20N.E.2d%20165\">\n    607 N.E.2d 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177 (1992). The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow pleading of alternative statements of a claim. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d). And Terrazzino is entitled to plead unjust enrichment as an alternative to her breach of contract claim. Accordingly Walmart's motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim is denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Injunctive Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, Walmart argues that injunctive relief is unavailable to Terrazzino in this action. Terrazzino seeks to \"enjoin[ ] Defendant's unlawful actions.\" (Compl. \u00b6 102). To state a claim for injunctive relief, plaintiff must allege that a defendant's conduct is likely to cause her harm in the future.\n   <em>\n    Camasta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151433\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/732/#p737\">\n    761 F.3d at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Terrazzino is now aware that the Pita Chips at issue here are not \"All Natural,\" as described on the label. Therefore, she is not likely to be harmed by the \"All Natural\" misrepresentation in the future-she will simply avoid buying those Pita Chips.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Camasta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151433\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/732/#p737\">\n    761 F.3d at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Since Camasta is now aware of JAB's sales practices, he is not likely to be harmed by the practices in the future.\"). Because Terrazzino has failed to allege that it is reasonably likely that she will be harmed again in the future, her claim for injunctive relief is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Walmart's motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 13) is granted in part and denied in part. Specifically, the motion is granted with respect to Terrazino's claim for breach of express warranty in Count I and her request for injunctive relief; those claims are dismissed without prejudice.
