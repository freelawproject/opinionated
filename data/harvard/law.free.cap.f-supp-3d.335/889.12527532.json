Rosenthal, Chief United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Second World War and the Korean Conflict ended over 65 years ago and took place thousands of miles away, but some effects of those wars are present and nearby. These consolidated cases address responsibility for the costs of cleaning up environmental damage from the production of materials the military needed during World War II and the Korean Conflict. These cases involve two of the country's largest and longest-running oil refineries and the chemical plants, or \"Plancors,\" on and adjacent to them, one in Baytown, Texas, the other in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   During World War II, the United States entered into contracts with Humble Oil and Standard Oil to produce high-octane aviation gas and other products needed for combat. Exxon Mobil Corporation is the successor entity for both Humble Oil and Standard Oil.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the contracts, the United States encouraged Exxon to produce as much as possible to meet the military needs. Exxon, like other oil companies that entered into similar contracts, retained ownership and day-to-day operational control over the work, including waste management. The Baytown and Baton Rouge refineries and plants disposed of hazardous waste in nearby bodies of water, including the Houston Ship Channel and the Mississippi River. Both feed into the Gulf of Mexico. Exxon has spent, and will continue to spend, millions in cleanup costs. Exxon sued under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"CERCLA\"), seeking reimbursement for the percentage of those costs attributable to the United States's wartime activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   There are three phases to these cases, which are in turn related to ongoing litigation in the Court of Federal Claims. In\n   2015, this court ruled on the liability issues, finding that both Exxon and the United States were responsible for the cleanup costs.\n   <em>\n    Exxon Mobil Corp. v.

Tex. 2015) (\"\n   <em>\n    Exxon I\n   </em>\n   \"). The next question is how much each is responsible for. This opinion addresses the cross-motions for partial summary judgment on the Phase II equitable-allocation issues-the method to determine what percentage of the cleanup costs each party must bear. Part III is a bench trial to resolve the factual disputes and conflicting inferences necessary to fix the relative shares and the amount of past costs and the share of future costs that each party must pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The United States and Exxon each filed lengthy briefs, a large record, and supplemental briefing on additional issues. The court heard oral extensive argument on the cross-motions. Based on the pleadings; the motions, responses, replies, and supplemental briefing; the record; the arguments of counsel; and the applicable law, the cross-motions for partial summary judgment, (Docket Entries No. 200, 202), are granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The issues on which summary judgment is denied will be addressed at the bench trial set to begin on\n   <strong>\n    February 19, 2019\n   </strong>\n   .

During this period,\n   the refineries and the plants that supplied them raw materials operated at maximum production capacity to help the war efforts. The swift and large increase in production capabilities also increased hazardous wastes. The remediation work undertaken years later is regulated by CERCLA, which was, of course, passed decades after World War II and the Korean Conflict ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Exxon alleges that through December 2014, it has incurred approximately $77 million in past response costs attributable to the wartime-related contamination, and that it will incur significant additional future response costs.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Baytown Facility Cleanup Units\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At the Baytown facility, nine cleanup units are at issue: Separator 3M, Separator 10, the Upper and Lower Outfall Canals, the Velasco Street Ditch, the South Landfarm, two Facilities Operations Areas (\"FOA\"), and the Tank Farm 3000 groundwater plume area. (Gov't MSJ, Ex. 27; Appendix A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Separator 3M was an earthen, unlined impoundment that stored refinery wastes. The wastes stored and disposed of at Separator 3M included sludge generated by Separator 10, which operated from the wartime period through 1982, and sludge generated by Separator 12, which replaced Separator 10, between 1982 and 1984. (Gov't Facts \u00b6 4; Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 4). The amount of sludge Separator 10 generated was reduced starting in 1951, as part of Exxon's postwar Effluent Improvement Program. This program included constructing \"Effluent Filtration Units\" to treat the sludge and to recycle the oil in that sludge. When Separator 3M was operational, Exxon removed sludge from it \"about every two years,\" taking the sludge either to the South Landfarm or to a licensed \"Class I off-site disposal facility.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Exxon closed part of Separator 3M in January 1985 to construct a new \"wastewater treatment aeration basin.\" (Gov't Facts \u00b6 6). The northern half of Separator 3M was \"clean closed\" in 1984, and the southern half was \"clean closed\" in 1986. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). \"Clean closure\" signifies \"that all hazardous wastes have been removed from a given RCRA regulated unit and any releases at or from the unit have been remediated so that further regulatory control under RCRA Subtitle C is not necessary to protect human health and the environment.\" EPA MEMORANDUM RE: RISK-BASED CLEAN CLOSURE (Mar. 16, 1998).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State of Texas required the closures, certifying the closure of the northern half in 1998 and the closure of the southern half in 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Separator 10 was a concrete-walled, clay-bottomed oil-water separator. After Separator 10 was \"modernized\" in 1950, approximately 300 barrels of oil a day were skimmed from the surface, and five tons of sediment a day were dredged from the bottom. (Gov't Facts \u00b6 10). From 1929 to 1950, the sludge from Separator 10 was sent to Separator 3M. After Separator 10 stopped operating, Exxon sent this hazardous waste to the South Landfarm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Closing Separator 3M and Separator 10 generally consisted of excavating contaminated materials in each separator and the soil beneath it. (Gov't Facts \u00b6\u00b6 12-13). The parties point to conflicting evidence showing the reasons for closing these separators. The United States contends that Exxon closed the separators to avoid upgrading them to comply with the then newly enacted EPA regulations. Exxon disputes that characterization, arguing that the separators were closed to address the threat that hazardous substances would be released into the underlying groundwater.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Upper and Lower Outfall Canals are two unlined earthen ditches that carried wastewater from the Baytown refinery to the Houston Ship Channel. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Upper and Lower Outfall Canals carried over 90 percent of the wastewater generated at the Baytown facility. In September 1991, Exxon submitted a RCRA permit application seeking a \"delay of closure\" for both Canals to allow them to continue to receive non-hazardous wastewater and stormwater from the Baytown refinery. Between March and June 1994, 23,822 tons of sludge were excavated from the Upper Outfall Canal. (Gov't Facts \u00b6\u00b6 17-18). The parties dispute the toxicity levels of the sludge and the dates when it was removed from the Lower Outfall Canal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Velasco Street Ditch was an earthen ditch that carried stormwater and wastewater along the northern part of the Baytown refinery. Exxon took several interim cleanup steps in the early to mid-1990s, some required by the State of Texas. (Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 23). In 1991, Exxon excavated 20,000 tons of sludge from the Velasco Street Ditch to comply with federal EPA requirements. (Gov't Facts \u00b6 25). In 1993, Exxon asked the State of Texas to agree to a \"delay of closure\" approach so that it could continue using the Velasco Street Ditch to receive non-hazardous wastewater and stormwater. In 2008, Exxon \"clean closed\" the Velasco Street Ditch rather than upgrade it to meet RCRA's standards for hazardous waste-management units. (Gov't Facts \u00b6 23). No groundwater monitoring was required or has been conducted since November 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The South Landfarm was an unlined landfill in the southern part of the Baytown refinery. Exxon used this landfill to dispose of refinery wastes. Exxon excavated sludge and soil from the closure of Separators 3M and 10 and stored them at the South Landfarm. (Gov't Facts \u00b6 29). In 1985, Exxon submitted a closure plan for the South Landfarm to the State of Texas. A revised closure plan was submitted in 1988. Exxon closed the South Landfarm under RCRA's interim status regulations, with the State of Texas overseeing the closure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   From 1988 to 1990, the South Landfarm had a \"rest period\" to allow the waste materials to degrade and dry out. The closure process included a historical assessment and evaluation of alternative options; constructing a levee around the unit to prevent flooding that risked carrying contaminated materials to adjacent areas; biodegradation of some of the waste; installing a clay cap on the unit; covering the cap with top soil and grass; installing a \"final cover\"; submitting a closure report to the State of Texas; and, after Texas accepted Exxon's certification, conducting ongoing groundwater monitoring. (Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 33). In 1991, Texas certified the closure of the South Landfarm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For several of the Baytown units-Separator 3M, Separator 10, the Upper and Lower Outfall Canals, the Velasco Street Ditch, and the South Landfarm-the United\n   States cites the testimony of Alborz Wozniak, the United States's cleanup expert, that \"there is no evidence\" that Exxon closed the units because they posed an imminent risk to human health or the environment. Exxon vigorously disputes this characterization of the evidence of risk. Exxon cites the conflicting testimony of Stephen Johnson, its cleanup and National Contingency Plan expert. Johnson testified that Exxon had determined that these units contained elevated levels of hazardous wastes and substances and that the State of Texas had determined that the public and the environment were at risk from exposure to those substances. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Gov't Facts \u00b6 31; Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Tank Farm 3000 area is in the same location as the former Baytown Ordnance Works and other Ordnance Works structures. In the early 1990s, Exxon discovered two groundwater plumes in the Tank Farm 3000 area. The State of Texas directed Exxon to \"locate any ongoing source of hydrocarbon release in the area of Tank Farm 3000 and to abate the release,\" and Exxon investigated the nature, extent, and source of those plumes. (Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 161). The parties dispute the source of the groundwater contamination at the Tank Farm 3000 area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In March 1995, Exxon and the State of Texas entered into an agreed order. The order required Exxon to conduct a RCRA Facility Investigation for 22 solid-waste-management units. To do so, Exxon applied for two Facilities Operations Areas (\"FOAs\") at the Baytown site. An FOA is an area that addresses \"multiple sources of [Contaminants of Concern] within an operational chemical or petroleum manufacturing plant which is required to perform corrective action on property regulated under [the Texas statute relating to municipal hazardous waste] pursuant to a hazardous waste permit or commission corrective action order.\" 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE . \u00a7 350.131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Exxon began the five-step process of applying for an FOA for the Baytown refinery in September 2003. The process included assessments, monitoring, corrective-action programs, a formal application, and extensive correspondence and meetings with the State of Texas. In September 2016, the State approved the FOA application by amending Exxon's RCRA permit to establish the \"Baytown Refinery FOA.\" As a result, Exxon asked the State to terminate the March 1995 agreed order, which it did. The cleanup requirements in that order were incorporated into the FOA provisions. Exxon also began the five-step FOA application process for the Baytown chemical plant in September 2003. The application process for the chemical plant FOA is incomplete and has not yet been approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Exxon spent approximately $8 million on the Baytown refinery and chemical plant FOA applications. Exxon has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs in connection with those applications. The FOAs cover both wartime-related and non-wartime-related solid-waste-management units, more units than those Exxon claims have a federal nexus in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The parties dispute Exxon's reasons for applying for the FOAs and dispute the extent of the cleanup operations at the FOAs. The Baytown refinery FOA process, when completed, will provide a final, site-wide cleanup remedy for the refinery. (Exxon Facts \u00b6 699). Exxon points to expert testimony that the Baytown chemical plant FOA, which is awaiting approval from the State of Texas, will provide a similar final, site-wide cleanup remedy for the plant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 700).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Baton Rouge Cleanup Units\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Three cleanup units are at issue at the Baton Rouge facility: the Shallow Fill Zone, the Old Silt Pond, and the Rice Paddy Landfarm. Each of the units involved extensive oversight by the State of Louisiana. There is no site-wide, permanent cleanup remedy in place at the Baton Rouge facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Shallow Fill Zone is a large area on the western boundary of the Baton Rouge refinery where wastes were deposited. Exxon began monitoring groundwater contamination at the Shallow Fill Zone in 1980 under its RCRA permit. In 1986, the State of Louisiana expressed concern that there were actual or potential releases of hazardous substances in the Shallow Fill Zone and required Exxon to do a subsurface investigation to determine if those concerns were warranted. Exxon met with Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality officials and investigated whether the waste in the Shallow Fill Zone was \"leaching from the solidified material\" and discharging into the Mississippi River. (Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Exxon's hydrogeologic investigation showed contaminated groundwater and high concentrations of hazardous substances. After Exxon submitted its report in February 1987, Louisiana ordered Exxon to investigate, to monitor the groundwater, to remove free-phase hydrocarbons from the Shallow Fill Zone, and to submit a corrective-action plan to remove or treat the groundwater contamination. In 1987, Exxon installed groundwater recovery wells on the western boundary of the Shallow Fill Zone along the Mississippi River, to recover \"light non-aqueous phase liquid hydrocarbons.\" (Gov't Facts \u00b6 48). Between 1987 and 2015, Exxon removed approximately 26,000 gallons of those liquid hydrocarbons. In 2008, Louisiana \"closed out\" the two 1987 orders, but it required Exxon to continue to monitor and remove hydrocarbons from the groundwater under a corrective-action and monitoring plan, under the State's supervision and oversight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Old Silt Pond was a hazardous waste-disposal unit containing solid and liquid wastes. This earthen impoundment in the Shallow Fill Zone became operational in 1945 and continued operating until it reached capacity in the late 1950s. In the 1970s, 5 of the 20 acres of the Shallow Fill Zone began operations that continued until the late 1980s. In June 1988, Exxon submitted a closure plan to the State of Louisiana that required interim response activities. The Old Silt Pond was closed under RCRA interim status regulations. When Exxon began to implement the closure plan it had submitted, it encountered difficulties that led to a modified plan proposing \"ex-situ solidification\" of the sludge and materials and \"re-deposition of the solidified materials\" into the Old Silt Pond, followed by a RCRA cap. (Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 54). A \"RCRA cap\" is a \"layer of clay, or other impermeable material installed over the top of a closed landfill to prevent entry of rainwater and minimize leachate.\" ( RCRA GLOSSARY OF TERMS ). Louisiana approved the modified plan. After Exxon installed the cap, it submitted a closure report, which Louisiana approved, with the requirement that Exxon conduct post-closure groundwater monitoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Rice Paddy Landfarm was an earthen land-treatment unit for silt contaminated with wastewater and sludge. In 1988, Exxon submitted a closure plan to the State of Louisiana. The plan considered two alternatives-natural biodegradation or closure as a landfill. The first, biodegradation, did not reduce the oil content below one percent by 1990, and Exxon installed a RCRA cap. Louisiana required Exxon to\n   conduct post-closure groundwater monitoring. In 1994, Louisiana issued a closure certification for the Rice Paddy Landfarm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As this summary shows, many-but not all-of the facts are undisputed.

The Baytown chemical plant FOA application is still pending. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 699, 700). The refinery FOA allows Exxon to postpone cleaning up certain contamination. The United States cites a 2003 Exxon report stating that the facility investigation activities had been deferred indefinitely \"pending Exxon's submission of the FOA application.\" (Gov't Facts \u00b6 42). Exxon spent $8,056,656 on the FOA applications, but it did not break down that amount to identify which costs were incurred in connection with which FOA application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43). The United States points to expert testimony, and Exxon does not dispute, that the FOAs include \"more cleanup units than those Exxon claims have a federal nexus\" to this litigation.

The United States points to the testimony of Peter Gagnon, Exxon's consultant who oversaw much of the environmental cleanup work at the Baytown facility, that the final cleanup work that has been delayed under the FOA will be completed \"[h]ypothetically, when the refinery\n   no longer operates.\" (Gov't Facts \u00b6 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The United States points out that Exxon has admitted that its applications for the two Baytown FOAs were voluntary, in the sense that they were not required by the State of Texas. The United States argues that the \"FOA investigations were only 'required' to demonstrate\n   <em>\n    eligibility\n   </em>\n   for the FOA program,\" (Gov't Reply at 2), and cites cases denying recovery for costs related to preliminary investigations in sites where the plaintiffs did not intend to cleanup the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young v.

First, Exxon applied for the Baytown FOAs to \"conduct State-required future response actions in a much more cost-effective manner,\" making them \"voluntary\" in a way that is not disqualifying under CERCLA. (Exxon Response at 44). Second, Exxon cites the testimony of its project manager, Leon Paredes, that \"[o]ne of the primary reasons that Exxon enrolled the Baytown Facility in the FOA program was because the company determined that conducting these environmental investigations, monitoring and cleanup activities at this facility under the FOA program would enable the company to conduct these activities in a much more cost-effective manner.\" (Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 37). Exxon explains that the FOA process allowed for \"a more streamlined and cost-effective permanent remedy\" because, with an FOA, many solid-waste-management units can be addressed \"holistically\" at once, rather than one-by-one. (Exxon Facts \u00b6 694). Exxon's environmental consultant conducted a comparative cost analysis and estimated that Exxon would achieve \"millions of dollars\" in future cleanup cost savings under the FOA program. (Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Exxon vigorously disputes the United States's factual assertion that the cleanup activities for the solid-waste-management units at issue have been deferred indefinitely. \"During the period of 2004 to 2014 for which Exxon has claimed response costs related to [RCRA Facility Investigation] activities, four wartime [solid-waste-management units] ( [units] 59, 60, 62 and 69) were the subject of a significant portion of the [RCRA Facility Investigation] activities, including, for example, groundwater monitoring well installation; soil, groundwater and other environmental media sampling and analysis work; the preparation and submittal of investigatory reports ....\" (Exxon Response to Gov't\n   Facts \u00b6\u00b6 42, 43). Under the FOA, \"Exxon will continue to conduct periodic groundwater monitoring around the Site\" and \"over the next few years Exxon also will be required to conduct a cleanup action in Mitchell Bay to address contamination resulting from ... former wartime waste units.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exxon Facts \u00b6 697; Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In short, the United States argues that the FOA costs are not necessary response costs because Exxon was not acting under state compulsion and because Exxon used the FOAs to delay, rather than to implement, cleaning up the hazardous wastes. Exxon argues that the FOAs were to respond to the State-required response actions in a more cost-effective and efficient way to implement that cleanup. Because Exxon was not avoiding required cleanup work, but trying to do it better, the FOA costs were \"necessary\" as an effective way to conduct state-required cleanup of the contamination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Exxon's argument is supported by the record and the legal standards. Exxon has submitted and pointed to undisputed record evidence showing that it used the FOAs to accomplish the State-required cleanup work, less expensively and more efficiently than would otherwise be the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(Exxon Facts \u00b6 697; Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 37). The structure of the FOA program allows cleanup operators to prioritize the riskier areas to work on first, and to implement a schedule and plan that reduce overall cleanup costs and increase efficiency. The record shows that the FOAs would allow Exxon to work on a number of solid-waste-management units in a comprehensive way, rather than piecemeal, producing a better, more effective, and less costly result. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 693, 694; Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Undisputed record evidence showing Exxon's work preceding and implementing the FOAs shows that, as a matter of law, the FOA costs were necessary response costs under CERCLA. The court grants Exxon's motion for partial summary judgment on this issue to this extent, and denies the United States's cross-motion. But there are genuine factual disputes material to determining the specific amounts of cleanup costs attributable to wartime-related production at the covered solid-waste-management units, as opposed to other units and other, non-wartime, work. There are also genuine factual disputes material to determining what percentage of the covered FOA costs is attributable to the United States. As the United States correctly points out, because Exxon has not broken down its costs between the different units, or even between the two FOA applications, the court is not presently able to determine the relative percentages or dollar amounts that the United States and Exxon must pay. These issues will be addressed based on an expanded record at the bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Whether Exxon's Actions Were \"Removal\" or \"Remedial\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Under CERCLA, the statute of limitations is determined by whether Exxon's\n   responses were a \"removal\" action, for which the limitations period is \"3 years after completion of the removal action,\" or \"remedial\" actions, for which the limitations period is \"6 years after initiation of physical on-site construction of the remedial action.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209613\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2)(A)-(B).

The 2000 EPA Memorandum stating that, although remedial actions are permanent solutions, \"removals can also achieve permanent solutions,\" complicates the issue. (Removal Memorandum at 4 n.3).

Exxon's Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Exxon proposes using four criteria in deciding whether an action is a \"non-time-critical\" removal action or a remedial action. (Exxon MSJ at 22). Exxon's proposed factors are \"time-sensitivity\"; the complexity of the problem and the action; the comprehensiveness of the proposed action; and the likely cost of the action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These four factors come from the 2000 EPA Memorandum on the use of non-time-critical removal authority in Superfund response actions. (Removal Memorandum at 3). Exxon compares the actions it took with the definitions of \"remedial\" and \"removal\" actions in CERCLA and the examples in the National Contingency Plan. (Exxon MSJ at 21-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The United States does not dispute that the CERCLA definitions and the National Contingency Plan examples are relevant to classifying the response actions as remedial or removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Time Sensitivity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The 2000 EPA Memorandum defines \"time sensitivity\" as \"the need to take relatively prompt action.\" (Removal Memorandum at 3 n.2). Exxon argues that \"time sensitive\" must be different from \"imminent threat\" for there to be any meaningful difference between \"time-critical\" and \"non-time critical\" removal actions. (Exxon Response at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   CERCLA's statutory language does not distinguish between time-critical and non-time-critical response actions. The 2000 EPA Memorandum explains that the\n   threshold question in deciding whether an action is a non-time-critical removal action or a remedial action \"is whether a CERCLA decisionmaker is faced with a threat to human health or the environment that, though not time critical, is nonetheless sufficiently serious that the added time needed to comply with remedial requirements ... would be unacceptable.\" (Removal Memorandum at 5 n.6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Complexity of the Problem and Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Remedial actions are appropriate for more complex, costly, site-wide problems, while removal actions are generally targeted at less complicated, more contained problems that cost less to address. (Removal Memorandum at 3-4). The 2000 EPA Memorandum indicates that complexity is secondary to \"time-sensitivity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). The Memorandum explains that a removal action may be appropriate to address a costly and complex problem that is also time-sensitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Comprehensiveness of the Solution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Exxon urges the use of the \"comprehensiveness\" of the proposed solution as a factor. (Exxon MSJ at 23). The EPA considers \"permanence per se\" to be \"misleading\" because permanent solutions may result from removal actions as well as remedial actions. (Removal Memorandum at 3-4 n.3). The 2000 EPA Memorandum distinguishes between permanent response actions that achieve \"immediate risk reduction,\" from other permanent response actions designed for less acute risks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). If the purpose is to achieve immediate reduction of an acute risk, the action is more appropriately classified as a removal action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). If an action is \"comprehensive\" or \"site-wide,\" it is appropriately classified as a remedial action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Court's Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   CERCLA defines a removal action as \"the cleanup or removal of released hazardous substances from the environment, such actions as may be necessary to monitor, assess, and evaluate the release or threat of release of hazardous substances, the disposal of removed material, or the taking of such other actions as may be necessary to prevent, minimize, or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare or to the environment, which may otherwise result from a release or threat of release.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (23). CERCLA defines a remedial action as \"those actions consistent with permanent remedy taken instead of or in addition to removal actions in the event of a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment, to prevent or minimize the release of hazardous substances so that they do not migrate to cause substantial danger to present or future public health or welfare or the environment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The court also considers the factors set out in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.415\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). The following factors have particular relevance to this record: \"[a]ctual or potential exposure to nearby human populations, animals, or the food chain from hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants\"; \"[a]ctual or potential contamination of drinking water supplies or sensitive ecosystems\"; \"[h]igh levels of hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants in soils largely at or near the surface, that may migrate\"; and \"[o]ther situations or factors that may pose threats to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.415\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The court also considers the National Contingency Plan examples of actions that \"as a general rule\" are removal actions. Those examples include: \"[c]apping of contaminated soils or sludges-where needed to reduce migration of hazardous substances\n   or pollutants or contaminants into soil, ground or surface water, or air\"; \"[e]xcavation, consolidation, or removal of highly contaminated soils from drainage or other areas-where such actions will reduce the spread of, or direct contact with, the contamination\"; and \"[c]ontainment, treatment, disposal, or incineration of hazardous materials-where needed to reduce the likelihood of human, animal, or food chain exposure.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.415\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In addition to the CERCLA definitions and the National Contingency Plan examples, the court considers the \"permanence\" of a response action, but with the qualifier that the more \"comprehensive\" a cleanup action, the more likely it is to be considered a remedial action. This qualifier is supported by the 2000 EPA Memorandum and the case law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   [T]he Removal Memo describes courts' reliance on the \"permanence\" of the response as \"sometimes misleading\": \"As a practical matter, removal actions are often permanent solutions such as can be the case in a typical soil or drum removal.\" ...\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Geraghty &amp; Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11151056\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/234/917/#p925\">\n    234 F.3d at 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Even if the replacements for these wells are integral to the long-term remediation of the site, that does not mean that their initial placement cannot be categorized as removal.\"). This observation seems logical, as we do not want to tie the EPA's hands or compel it to adopt short-term remedies for fear that any more permanent solutions automatically will be dubbed \"remedial actions.\" Nor would it make economic or practical sense to impose a requirement that removal actions must be only temporary in nature. The Removal Memo instead uses the term \"comprehensiveness\" to distinguish between the use of removal authority to conduct interim or partial response actions that are focused on immediate risk reduction as compared with final or \"comprehensive\" response at the site.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   These informal interpretations combined with the descriptions in the National Contingency Plan provide a persuasive interpretation that\n   <em>\n    removal actions encompass interim, partial time-sensitive responses taken to counter serious threats to public health\n   </em>\n   .

Instead, the court adopts the factors set out in the 2000 EPA Memorandum, including: time-sensitivity, defined as \"the need to take relatively prompt action\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; \"the complexity of\n   both the problems to be addressed and the action to be taken\"; \"the comprehensiveness of the proposed action\"; and \"the likely cost of the action.\" (Removal Memorandum at 3). Although the court considers the cost of the response action as a distinguishing factor-the parties and the 2000 EPA Memorandum both recommend it-that factor carries relatively less weight because the United States and the 2000 EPA Memorandum acknowledge that both removal and remedial actions can be costly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Number of Response Actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The parties dispute the number of response actions at each facility. Exxon argues that its response activities are a single, continuous removal action at each facility. (Exxon MSJ at 30-32). The United States argues that Exxon's response activities at each facility were different remedial actions. (Gov't MSJ at 11-13). The parties devote much argument to comparing their competing characterizations of the facts here to the facts described in other cases, but the parties agree that the threshold issue, whether there can be multiple response actions at a facility, is one of statutory interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sunoco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108859\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/1233/#p1240\">\n    337 F.3d at 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Permanence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The United States argues that many of the cleanup activities at the Baytown\n   facility resulted in permanent remedies. (Gov't Response to Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 545, 560, 576, 596, 611, 612, 629). It is undisputed, however, that Exxon is still working on cleaning the environmental contamination and is incurring cleanup costs as they arise. Exxon has not achieved a permanent remedy on a facility-wide basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   This factor weighs in favor of classifying the response activities at the Baytown facility as a single removal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Time-Sensitivity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The United States argues that because Exxon waited years to respond to the hazardous waste threats, the cleanup actions it finally took were not time-sensitive. (Gov't Response to Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 535, 576, 589). The guiding metric is \"the need to take relatively prompt action.\" (Removal Memorandum at 3);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boston &amp; Me.

Instead, CERCLA explicitly contemplates that a removal action could occur after some delay.... Thus, a removal action could occur well after hazardous substances are first discovered.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The record shows that Exxon took actions based on the State of Texas's requirements and in response to threats that hazardous substances would be released into public waterways and soils. For example, Exxon closed Separator 3M and Separator 10, which contained significant concentrations of benzene and toluene, \"to control, minimize, or eliminate, to the extent necessary to protect human health and the environment, any post-closure escape of hazardous waste....\" (Exxon Facts \u00b6 541). Although these and other cleanup measures were in response to serious threats to public health and the environment, the threats were not recently discovered, urgent, or immediate.

The Complexity of the Problem and Action and the Comprehensiveness of the Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   At the facility-wide level, Exxon investigated and did soil-excavation work to respond to threats of hazardous-substance releases on an interim basis. (Exxon Facts \u00b6 540). Some response actions at the Baytown facility were expressly referred to as \"interim corrective actions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 626).

Conclusion as to the Baytown Facility\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Exxon's response actions at the Baytown facility were a single continuous removal action. Aside from the facts about the Baytown refinery FOA-which the parties agree offers a comprehensive, facility-wide solution-the record indicates that no permanent solution at the Baytown facility has been reached. No Record of Decision has issued. Monitoring at many of the units is ongoing.

(Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 534-535, 545, 555-557, 563, 571-573, 642, 644).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Exxon's activities closely align with CERCLA's definition of a removal action and with the examples of removal actions in the National Contingency Plan, including capping contaminated soils or sludges where needed to reduce the migration of contaminants into soil, groundwater, or surface water; excavating; consolidating or removing highly contaminated soils; and containing, treating, disposing of, or incinerating hazardous materials where needed to reduce the likelihood of human, animal, or food-chain exposure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1985 NCP \u00a7 300.65(c)(6); 1990 NCP \u00a7 415(e)(6). At Separators 3M and 10, the Upper and Lower Outfall Canals, and the Velasco Street Ditch, for example, Exxon removed hazardous soil to reduce the spread of environmental contamination. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 539, 540, 574, 580; Exxon MSJ, Table 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Even though Exxon's response activities at the Baytown facility included discrete measures performed over many years, those activities were interim, piecemeal measures to address serious threats to human health and the environment. They are appropriately characterized as parts of a single removal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Baton Rouge Facility\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The parties again dispute whether Exxon was reacting to threats of hazardous material release at each Baton Rouge unit. (Gov't Response to Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 716, 734, 753, 774). Undisputed record evidence shows that Exxon's activities at the Baton Rouge units were interim actions responding to what the State of Louisiana determined to be serious threats to public health and to the environment that required prompt response. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 716, 721, 734-736, 753-754). Exxon's response activities at the Baton Rouge facility, including at the Shallow Fill Zone, the Old Silt Pond, and the Rice Paddy Landfarm, align with CERCLA's definition of a removal action and the National Contingency Plan examples. No Record of Decision has been issued, monitoring continues, and the activities were not conducted in a comprehensive, facility-wide manner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 719; Exxon MSJ, Table 4). Applying the factors of permanence, time-sensitivity, comprehensiveness, complexity, and cost, the activities at the Baton Rouge facility are appropriately characterized as a single removal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   At each of the Baytown and Baton Rouge facilities, Exxon's activities are a removal action under CERCLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Exxon's Tables 6 and 7 set out the units and the Plan version that applied to the cleanup work at each unit. (Exxon MSJ, Tables 6, 7). Experts for both Exxon and the United States analyzed each cleanup action in relation to the applicable Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The United States argues that Exxon did not substantially comply with the National Contingency Plan requirements. Exxon responds that the extensive involvement by the States of Louisiana and Texas brought Exxon's cleanup work into National Contingency Plan compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The Second and Seventh Circuits have held that extensive state involvement is dispositive evidence of a response action's compliance with the Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v.

But the state involvement here went well beyond mere approval of Exxon's plans. The undisputed record evidence shows that Texas and Louisiana were extensively involved in Exxon's cleanup response activities at the two facilities, establishing compliance with the National Contingency Plan, as a matter of law. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 559, 560, 566; Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27). On this issue, Exxon's motion for partial summary judgment is granted and the United States's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The specific reasons for this conclusion at each facility and cleanup unit are set out below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The South Landfarm Unit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The United States argues that Exxon's closure of the South Landfarm did not comply with the 1985 Plan's public-participation requirements for remedial actions. Exxon responds that the 1985 requirements do not apply to the closure of the South Landfarm because its was part of a removal action, not a remedial action, and because Exxon did most of the closure work before the 1985 Plan requirements were adopted. (Exxon Response at 24). Exxon is correct. Its activities at the South Landfarm were part of a removal action,\n   so Exxon need not establish public participation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Even if the South Landfarm closure and related activities were part of a remedial action, Exxon nonetheless substantially complied with the public-participation requirement because of the extensive involvement in the cleanup by the State of Texas. \"State participation in the cleanup may fulfill the public participation requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    First Edwards, LP v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 566-567). It is undisputed that the State's involvement in the South Landfarm extended beyond mere approval. Because Exxon has submitted evidence of extensive oversight and involvement, and because the United States does not dispute the extent of Texas's involvement at the South Landfarm, Exxon's motion for partial summary judgment is granted on the issue of compliance with the National Contingency Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Upper Outfall Canal and the Velasco Street Ditch Units\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The United States argues that Exxon did not provide for public participation in the cleanup of the Velasco Street Ditch and did not give the public an adequate opportunity to comment before selecting the cleanup measures for the Upper and Lower Outfall Canals. The United States argues that Texas's involvement at the Velasco Street Ditch and Canals was not comprehensive and does not satisfy the public-participation requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Johnson, Exxon's cleanup expert, testified that the State of Texas required these cleanups and \"reviewed, commented on, and ultimately approved of all work done by Exxon.\" (Exxon Facts \u00b6 585). The undisputed record evidence includes documents exchanged between Exxon and the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, which directed modifications to Exxon's cleanup plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The undisputed evidence of Texas's active involvement in Exxon's cleanup activities at these units show that its involvement extended well beyond mere approval. The State's input and oversight at these units meets the public-participation requirement and establishes substantial compliance with the National Contingency Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The United States also argues that Exxon did not do a feasibility study or a remedial investigation at the Velasco Street Ditch unit. (Gov't MSJ at 25). These requirements apply to remedial, but not to removal, actions. Because Exxon's cleanup activities at this unit were part of a removal action, Exxon did not need to satisfy those requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Shallow Fill Zone\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The United States argues that Exxon did not comply with the 1985 National Contingency Plan requirements for the Shallow Fill Zone to evaluate possible alternatives before submitting its proposal to the State of Louisiana, conduct public participation, and to consider options. (Gov't MSJ at 25-26). But Exxon has submitted and identified undisputed record evidence that the State of Louisiana was extensively involved in the Shallow Fill Zone cleanup work. (Exxon Facts \u00b6 713, 714, 717, 718). Louisiana issued Exxon a corrective-action order for the Shallow Fill Zone, reviewed Exxon's preliminary assessment report, and required Exxon to perform most of the cleanup activities at that unit. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 725-731). The undisputed evidence of Louisiana's extensive and comprehensive involvement satisfies the public-participation requirement and, as a matter of law, shows substantial compliance with the 1985 National Contingency Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Rice Paddy Landfarm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   The United States argues that Exxon did not comply with the 1985 National Contingency Plan requirements because it did not evaluate alternatives before selecting natural biodegradation as the closure method for the Rice Paddy Landfarm. (Gov't MSJ at 26). Because Exxon's activities at the Rice Paddy Landfarm were part of a removal action rather than a remedial action, the 1985 National Contingency Plan did not require Exxon to evaluate alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Even if Exxon's activities at Rice Paddy Landfarm were part of a remedial response action, the record evidence shows that Exxon evaluated alternatives. Michael Pisani, an engineer who helped Exxon in its meetings and discussions with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, testified that Exxon \"considered and evaluated different cleanup alternatives\" before selecting natural biodegradation for the Rice Paddy Landfarm. (Exxon Facts \u00b6 760; Ex. 12 at 22). Exxon closed the Rice Paddy Landfarm under the order and supervision of the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. The undisputed record evidence shows that Exxon complied with Louisiana's orders and monitoring in the cleanup activities at the Rice Paddy Landfarm. The undisputed evidence shows that the State's involvement at the Landfarm extended well beyond mere approval and shows Exxon's substantial compliance with the National Contingency Plan, as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. The Insurance-Settlement Proceeds Exxon Received\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   In the 1990s, Exxon sued its insurers to recover its environmental-cleanup costs at hundreds of thousands of sites across the United States. In the North American Coverage Case, Exxon argued that its insurance policies covered environmental-cleanup costs at the Baytown and Baton Rouge facilities. Exxon eventually settled that case for $269 million.

First, Exxon cites the collateral-source rule, which in this context means that insurance offsets do not kick in unless the total amount of insurance recovery, plus the amount recovered in the CERCLA action, exceeds 100 percent of the response costs. Exxon argues that because the recovered settlement proceeds plus the costs claimed here do not exceed 100 percent of the response costs, there is no double recovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NCR Corp. v.

Exxon calculates\n   the Coverage Case settlement proceeds attributable to the Baytown facility at $2.9 million and those attributable to the Baton Rouge facility at $3.3 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   One problem with determining the offset amount is that the Coverage Case settlement did not break down the settlement amounts attributable to cleanup costs at different facilities or sites. Instead, the settlement broke the amounts down only by \"business segments.\" Exxon recovered insurance proceeds attributable to cleanup costs at sites besides the Baytown and Baton Rouge facilities, costs that Exxon does not claim in this case. The United States does not dispute this. (Gov't MSJ at 29 n.20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Exxon contends that \"[m]ost of the [Coverage Case]-claimed costs are not CERCLA-claimed costs because the [Coverage Case] included substantial cleanup and other types of costs incurred ... with respect to non-wartime waste units or areas of contamination at both sites.\" (Exxon Response at 28, n.30). Exxon also points out that the Coverage Case litigation was for cleanup costs incurred before 1998, and most of the cleanup costs Exxon claims in this litigation were incurred after 1998. Exxon's Table 16 contains more detailed information about the differences between the costs claimed in the Coverage Case litigation and the costs Exxon claims here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Two issues must be resolved: first, whether to apply an offset for the Coverage Case settlement proceeds; and second, if an offset applies, the amount. The statute and case law are clear that an insurance-settlement offset is appropriate before equitable allocation to prevent double recovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Litgo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072008\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/369/#p391\">\n    725 F.3d at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the summary judgment record is clear that there are genuine factual disputes material to determining the proper offset amount for the Coverage Case settlement. The United States points to facts supporting offset amounts of $8.65 million for Baytown and $11.24 million for Baton Rouge. Exxon points to different facts supporting lower amounts, in a table setting out the costs claimed in the Coverage Case litigation and the costs claimed here. (Exxon Response, Table 16). Exxon's calculations support much lower offset amounts, $2.9 million for Baytown and $3.3 million for Baton Rouge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   On the issue of using an insurance-settlement offset to prevent double recovery, the court grants partial summary judgment for the United States on the propriety of a settlement offset, but denies the motion for partial summary judgment on the amount.

Exxon's accounting expert, Paul Ficca, testified that Exxon accurately accounted for these costs. (Gov't Facts \u00b6 71). The United States's accounting expert, E.J. Janik, reviewed Exxon's claim and concluded that there is insufficient documentation for $23 million of the $77 million Exxon claims. For $6.7 million of that $23 million, Janik concludes that they are disallowed as a matter of law because Exxon has not produced both an invoice and proof of payment or the equivalent. (Gov't Facts \u00b6\u00b6 73-74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   The United States moved for partial summary judgment on three cost-documentation issues. First, the United States asks for a determination that \"Exxon's evidentiary burden for proving its costs under the National Contingency Plan requires it to produce invoices and proof of\n   payment, or equivalent documentation, to support each individual cost that it seeks.\" (Gov't MSJ at 31). Second, the United States seeks a determination that the accounting records, litigation database, and cost summaries Exxon relies on are insufficient, as a matter of law, to support the claimed amounts. Third, the United States seeks to \"deduct the $6.7 million in costs for which Exxon has no invoice and no proof of payment and has offered no competent evidence to prove those costs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The United States also asks the court to \"order Exxon and the United States and their respective experts to work together to seek agreement on what amount of the remaining $70 million in costs is accurately accounted for and what amount remains in dispute.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   At oral argument, the United States provided a detailed and helpful spreadsheet setting out Exxon's claimed costs and the type of documents supporting them.

Whether Exxon's Documentation Is Reliable and Admissible\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Exxon's accounting expert, Paul Ficca, testified that Exxon adequately accounted for all $77 million in past costs. Ficca testified that Exxon's accounting-system records and the North American Coverage Case database are sufficiently accurate and reliable that Exxon can rely on them to prove the costs for which Exxon is missing some or most of the supporting documents. The United States responds that: (1) the Evaluated Receipt Settlement Program records are an inadequate substitute for invoices from third-party vendors; (2) the accounting-system records are not a sufficiently reliable substitute for the actual invoices; (3) the North American Coverage Case litigation database is not admissible because it was created for litigation; and (4) Ficca's cost summaries are inadmissible because they are based on inadmissible underlying documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Evaluated Receipt Settlement Program Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Exxon included a chart with a breakdown of its costs and how they are documented. (Exxon MSJ, Figure 3). The different categories are \"invoice, payment, and cost report\"; \"invoice and cost report\"; payment and cost report; and cost report. According to Exxon, the costs with invoices, payments, and cost reports account\n   for 80 percent of Exxon's claim. (Exxon MSJ, Figure 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   The United States's accounting expert, E.J. Janik, disputes these figures. He determined that the percentages of Exxon's claimed costs supported by an invoice, proof of payment, and an accounting record are 63 percent of the claimed costs for the Baytown facility and 77 percent of the claimed costs for the Baton Rouge facility. (Gov't Response to Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 829, 833). Janik also concluded that approximately $23 million of Exxon's claimed costs are not supported by an invoice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   One reason for the disparity between the parties' numbers is a disagreement about whether the Evaluated Receipt Settlement program records are an \"invoice.\" $8.6 million of Exxon's costs are supported by these program records. The United States's spreadsheet provided at oral argument includes examples of screenshots of these program records. Ficca, Exxon's accounting expert, testified that the screenshots from the Evaluated Receipt Settlement program do not describe all of the goods and services the vendor provided. (Gov't Response to Exxon Facts \u00b6 802). Ficca also testified that, before Exxon employees approved any payment to a vendor from the Evaluated Receipt Settlement program, they would review information besides the screenshots, including purchase orders that contained more detailed information about the costs that were listed in the Evaluated Receipt Settlement program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Exxon points out that Evaluated Receipt Settlement program \"is a procedure for paying a supplier for materials without receiving a paper invoice.\" (Exxon Facts \u00b6 802). Exxon argues that the program records effectively replaced paper invoices and effectively operated as invoices for Exxon's day-to-day business. Exxon's accounting expert testified that instead of a contractor generating an external invoice, the Evaluated Receipt Settlement program was used to create \"[a]n internal invoice ... for the amount shown on the Purchase Order when the Good Receipt ... is posted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 804).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   The costs supported by the Evaluated Receipt Settlement program records are sufficiently reliable to be considered supported by an invoice. One of the United States's witnesses, A.J. Gravel, testified that \"if no paper invoice exist[s,] an [ERS record] would serve as an invoice\" because those records \"[have] much of the information that you would see in an invoice. It's got the [general ledger] code, the vendor code which gives you the vendor name, the company code, it has the invoice number, invoice clearing number, the amount, the discount base.\" (Exxon Facts \u00b6 806). The undisputed record evidence about the information in the Evaluated Receipt Settlement program records shows that these records function as an electronic equivalent of an invoice. Exxon's costs supported by those records are sufficiently documented to be considered supported by an invoice, as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Exxon's Internal Accounting System Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Ficca testified that because Exxon has produced documents that validate many of the claimed cost items shown in Exxon's accounting records, the accounting records are sufficiently reliable and complete to prove the remaining costs for which Exxon lacks documents like an invoice, a canceled check, or both. The United States argues that Ficca's testimony is not supported by the record. According to the United States, for many of the claimed costs, the accounting system \"is missing basic information, such as the invoice number, invoice date, or vendor name.\" (Gov't MSJ at 38). The\n   United States points to several costs that Ficca cited that turned out to be inaccurate. One item was for roughly $200,000, for which there was no invoice or proof of payment. There were two other instances of \"duplicative\" or overlapping costs. The three erroneous costs totaled approximately $575,000. Because of these discrepancies, the United States argues that all of Exxon's accounting-system records are suspect and cannot be used to prove Exxon's costs. During discovery, Ficca removed those costs from Exxon's claims \"out of an abundance of caution.\" He also removed all costs for which there was no invoice, invoice number, and vendor name, totaling an additional $310,000. (Gov't Facts \u00b6\u00b6 96-97).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Exxon points out that it had four different accounting systems between 1985 and the present, creating some variation in the information available. Exxon points to: (1) Ficca's comparison of all available proof-of-payment and invoice records, which match about 90 percent of the accounting-record entries to the accounting records; (2) annual audits by PricewaterhouseCoopers, concluding that Exxon's accounting systems conformed to generally accepted accounting principles; (3) annual evaluations by Exxon management, concluding that it had effective internal controls over its financial reporting; (4) regulation of Exxon's financial reporting by the SEC and the FTC; (5) the periodic risk assessments describing Exxon's accounting practices; and (6) Ficca's and Johnson's conclusions that \"Exxon had robust internal policies in place.\" (Exxon MSJ at 34-35; Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Exxon is a large, regulated, publicly traded company. The accounting systems are reliable records of regularly conducted activity, supported by the indicia of accuracy and trustiness shown by the comparisons Ficca performed, the audits, the internal control reviews, the regulatory supervision, and other safeguards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.R.

The Records from the North American Coverage Case Litigation Database\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   In the 1990s, Exxon developed a damages database for the North American Coverage Case litigation. Exxon seeks to prove some of its otherwise undocumented costs based on the records in that database. The United States argues that (1) Exxon has not authenticated the Coverage Case database; (2) Exxon has not identified a hearsay exception for the database, which is not a record of regularly conducted activity; and (3) Ficca's lack of personal knowledge about the development of the Coverage Case database precludes him from establishing the predicate for its admission as competent summary judgment evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Exxon responds that \"the vast majority of the costs supported by the [Coverage Case] records are also supported by an actual invoice and/or proof of payment as well.\" (Exxon Response at 35). According to Exxon, the Coverage Case records support $20.7 million of the claimed cleanup costs at the Baton Rouge facility and $2.6 million at the Baytown facility. Of the Baton Rouge amounts, $16.2 million is supported by both an invoice and proof of payment, and $2.4 million is supported by either an invoice or proof of payment. Of the Baytown amounts, $1.5 million is supported by both an invoice and proof of payment, and $750,000 is supported by either an invoice or proof of payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Exxon also cites Federal Rule of Evidence 803(16), the hearsay exception for statements made in ancient documents. FED. R. EVID. 803(16) (statements in documents are \"not excluded by the rule against hearsay\" if the document \"was prepared before January 1, 1998, and whose authenticity is established\"). The Coverage Case database was developed in the 1990s, under conditions and circumstances that do not create suspicion about its authenticity. Exxon also cites Rule 807(a)(3), which provides that evidence is admissible if \"it is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence that the proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts.\" FED. R. EVID. 807(a)(3). Finally, Exxon points out that the United States itself relied on the Coverage Case database, and that its own experts admitted the database entries are accurate. The United States's argument for an insurance offset for the Coverage Case settlement proceeds relies heavily on the database.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Exxon has the better argument, amply supported by the undisputed record evidence. Although the Coverage Case database was prepared for litigation, most of the claimed costs reflected in the database are also substantiated by both separate invoices and pay records. Because the United States relies on the Coverage Case database to support its own argument about the offset for the insurance settlement proceeds in these consolidated cases and concedes the database's accuracy for that purpose, the database is sufficiently reliable to be admissible and support Exxon's claims. The United States's motion for partial summary judgment on this issue is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Ficca's Cost Summaries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   The United States seeks partial summary judgment that Ficca's cost summaries are not admissible because they are based on inadmissible underlying documents. The cost summaries must satisfy Federal Rule of Evidence 1006, which provides that a party may use a \"summary, chart, or calculation to prove the content of voluminous writings ....\" FED. R. EVID. 1006. The United States argues that the cost summaries contain substantial information from the Coverage Case database and other inadmissible sources, including hearsay statements by Exxon officers or employees. The United States argues that the cost summaries also do not comply with Rule 1006's requirement that Exxon make \"originals, or duplicates available for examination\" by both parties. Specifically, it points to Exxon's decision to turn over \"only invoices and invoice detail for ... line items greater than $5K.\" (Gov't Facts \u00b6 106).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Ficca's cost summaries are made up of the tables attached to his reports. Exxon responds that these tables are precisely the type of summary Rule 1006 contemplates. The cost items in the spreadsheets show thousands of pages of invoices, proof-of-payment records, and accounting records. Exxon produced these to the United States, and they are available for inspection\n   in and by the court. According to Exxon, Ficca clearly noted any instance in which he also relied on a fact witness. Those fact witnesses were made available for deposition and will be available to testify in court. The documents Ficca reviewed were produced to the United States. In some instances, the underlying invoices could not be located, but the contractor work and the covered costs were verified by other documents that Exxon produced to the United States. (Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 106).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Ficca's cost summaries are admissible. The underlying documents are voluminous. For any of the underlying documents that the United States contends Exxon has not yet produced, Exxon must make those documents available to the United States at least 30 days before the bench trial is scheduled to begin. While there may be factual disputes about whether particular underlying documents are admissible, such as some of the claimed costs not supported by invoices or pay records, the cost summaries are not inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Requested Order to Work to Agree on the Amount in Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   This one is easy. The court orders the parties to work together to seek agreement on the amount of claimed costs that are accurately accounted for and on the amount that remains in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. Prejudgment Interest, Run-Rate, and Consultant-Investigation Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Exxon moved for partial summary judgment that it is entitled to prejudgment interest, to its costs based on the run rate, and to consultant-investigation costs. At this stage, an award of prejudgment interest is premature because the court has not equitably allocated the costs among the parties. Exxon's claimed costs for the run rate are estimates of its costs between 2015 and 2019. (Exxon MSJ, Table 8). Because those are estimated costs and because the documents supporting them and showing the cleanup units to which they are attributable are limited, the court will consider whether these costs are recoverable as necessary costs of response at the bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   The United States objects to the $250,000 Exxon claims for \"consultant investigation costs,\" on the ground that Exxon has not produced invoices, proof of payment, or other documents for these costs. Because the current record does not provide a secure basis to resolve these objections, the court will consider these costs at the bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   <strong>\n    IX. Whether to Allocate the United States a Zero Share of Some of Exxon's Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   A party seeking summary judgment on CERCLA allocation has the usual burden of proof as to proposed factual findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exxon I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364635\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/108/486/\">\n    108 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   504 ;\n   <em>\n    Acushnet Co. v Mohasco Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11575660\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/191/69/#p79\">\n    191 F.3d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 79 (1st Cir. 1999).

The United States wants to be allocated a zero or\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   share for the costs to cleanup several of the units.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc. v.

Tex. 2009) (\"When a PRP contributes only minimally to the contamination at issue, it may be appropriate to allocate zero response\n   costs to that party.\"). The United States's motion for partial summary judgment that it is not required to pay any or little of the costs is denied. For the reasons set out below for each cleanup unit, determining the United States's equitable share of responsibility for Exxon's claimed cleanup costs at these units requires weighing conflicting evidence and expert testimony and reconciling or resolving the inconsistent inferences the parties draw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Lower Outfall Canal Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   The United States makes two arguments for why it should be allocated a zero share of the cleanup costs for the Lower Outfall Canal. It argues that it is not responsible because Exxon's consultant reported that \"the hazardous constituents in the Lower Outfall Canal sludge were well below regulatory levels,\" and because \"Exxon reported to Texas that the sludge 'did not have to be removed' but that Exxon did so voluntarily.\" (Gov't MSJ at 45, citing Gov't Facts \u00b6 45). At oral argument, however, the United States conceded that the cleanup costs for the Lower Outfall Canal were recoverable as necessary response costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atl. Research Corp. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644534\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/827/#p836\">\n    459 F.3d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 836-37 (8th Cir. 2006) ;\n   <em>\n    Consol.

Because the costs were necessary and the sludge at the Lower Outfall Canal qualified as hazardous waste under the RCRA, the United States's motion for partial summary judgment allocating a zero share of the cleanup costs to the United States is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The FOA Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   The United States argues that it should be allocated a zero share of the Facility Operation Area costs because the FOAs cover more cleanup units than those Exxon claims in this litigation, and because Exxon's inability to break down the cleanup costs by the specific unit leaves no way to distinguish between cleanup costs for units used for wartime production and costs unrelated to wartime activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   These arguments are unpersuasive. Exxon acknowledged that the FOAs cover cleanup costs for non-wartime wastes and for units that are not claimed in this litigation. Exxon argues that its allocation model accounts for and deducts the percentage of the cleanup costs for non-wartime wastes and units within the FOAs. Because there are genuine factual disputes material to determining the percentage and amount of the FOA costs attributable to the wartime-related production cleanup costs, and because the United States will be liable for at least a share of the FOA costs, the United States's motion for partial summary judgment that it must pay none or a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   share of the cleanup costs is denied. The allocation and amount of these FOA costs must be addressed at the bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Old Silt Pond and the Rice Paddy Landfarm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   The Old Silt Pond and the Rice Paddy Landfarm units at the Baton Rouge facility are geographically distinct from other units at that facility. Exxon has claimed $9,977,687 in cleanup costs for the Old Silt Pond, $4,622,578 for the Rice Paddy Landfarm, and an additional $3,302,781 at both units. The United States argues that Exxon has not produced evidence that it is liable for any of the cleanup costs at these units.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   The United States cites the testimony of Exxon's expert historian, A.J. Gravel, and Exxon documents stating that it first began using the Old Silt Pond in 1945. The United States's aerial-photography expert, Mary Sitton, testified that she did not see evidence of waste disposal at the Old Silt\n   Pond in three photographs taken before and during World War II, from September 1, 1939 to August 14, 1945. (Gov't MSJ at 47-48). As to the Rice Paddy Landfarm, Sitton testified that she saw no evidence of waste disposal in photographs taken during World War II. Exxon's aerial-photography expert, Wayne Grip, testified that he could not tell whether inundated areas within the Rice Paddy Landfarm contained oil, and that the earliest date on which he could see light-toned materials was September 1947, after the end of World War II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   After World War II and during the Korean Conflict, four of the six Baton Rouge chemical plants, or Plancors, remained in operation. Two Plancors discharged waste into the Monte Sano Bayou, far north of the Old Silt Pond and the Rice Paddy Landfarm. The other two Plancors \"used the refinery's waste processing system, [but] there is no evidence of the volume of wastes sent from those plancors to the refinery.\" (Gov't MSJ at 49). According to the United States, although the two Plancors \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have contributed some small amount of waste to the Old Silt Pond and Rice Paddy Landfarm during the short time they were in operation after World War II (approximately 2 years and 5 years respectively), their contribution to the contamination is surely\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   compared to the refinery's contribution over the several decades it used those areas for waste disposal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   The United States also argues that in 1976, Exxon built a 15-acre impoundment on top of the Rice Paddy Landfarm to dispose of waste at that unit. The impoundment operated until November 1988. The United States argues that Exxon's costs to address the Rice Paddy Landfarm contamination were therefore primarily incurred to address hazardous wastes added in the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon responds by pointing to evidence that wartime wastes were disposed of at the Old Silt Pond and the Rice Paddy Landfarm before those units began operating, and that World War II operations and subsequent Plancor and Korean Conflict operations contributed significant waste and contamination to those areas. (Exxon Response at 47-48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   As to the Old Silt Pond, Exxon argues that, although the unit was physically separate from the other Baton Rouge units, hazardous materials drained through the adjacent Callaghan's Bayou and regularly overflowed into the Old Silt Pond. Exxon cites a Baton Rouge refinery memorandum estimating that, during World War II, the spring floods discharged 80,000 cubic yards of oily silt and sludge into Callaghan's Bayou every year. Exxon also cites the expert testimony of Grip, Gravel, and Johnson, that Callaghan's Bayou was dredged and the hazardous materials were disposed of in the Old Silt Pond. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 512, 515; Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6\u00b6 114, 115, 127). Finally, Exxon cites evidence of a separate \"earthen drainage ditch\" running through the middle of the Old Silt Pond used to handle wastes during World War II. (Exxon Facts \u00b6 513).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   As to the Rice Paddy Landfarm, Exxon cites a 1980s EPA investigation report concluding that \"prior to the installation of the landfarm, the area beneath the unit was used as a landfill ... since the early days of the refinery\" and \"the land filled wastes included sludges and miscellaneous wastes.\" (Exxon Response at 49). Exxon also argues that wartime-production wastes within the area were the \"driver\" that caused Exxon to undertake significant cleanups at both the Old Silt Farm and the Rice Paddy Landfarm units. Exxon cites testimony from its environmental consultant who conducted and oversaw the cleanups. The consultant testified that the State\n   of Louisiana considered both the Old Silt Farm and the Race Paddy Landfarm to be closely \"interrelated with\" the nearby Shallow Fill Zone wastes. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 733, 753; Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6\u00b6 118, 126). Exxon argues that it would have incurred a less-costly cleanup action had there not been hazardous wartime contaminants far below the ground surface.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Determining the United States's involvement at these two units is fact-intensive. The record reveals that the facts are both disputed and unclear. The parties offer conflicting facts and inferences from those facts. The United States nonetheless seeks partial summary judgment that it was responsible for a zero or a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   share of the contamination and the cleanup costs at these units. The United States points to evidence and expert testimony indicating that its involvement in the war material production and related hazardous waste generation was minimal. Exxon points to conflicting facts and expert testimony that the United States was significantly involved in the wartime material production and waste generation at the units. These genuine factual disputes are material to determining the United States's equitable share and preclude the partial summary judgment ruling the parties seek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Tank Farm 3000 Area\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   The Tank Farm 3000 area is an area of groundwater contamination at the former Baytown Ordnance Works, which is geographically distinct from the other cleanup units at the Baytown facility. Exxon claims $5,481,340 in cleanup costs for the Tank Farm 3000 Area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   The United States argues that the cleanup costs for this area were spent to address \"groundwater plumes\" discovered in the early 1990s. Exxon's engineers conducted a study and reported to the Texas Water Commission that, based on the chemical composition of the plumes, the contamination was likely from units built after the Ordnance Works stopped operating in 1945. The study concluded that the contamination was likely due to a \"Linear Paraffins Unit\" in operation between 1964 and 2009, a \"Paraxylene Extraction Unit\" in operation between 1952 and 1980, and a \"Naphtha Rerun Unit,\" part of the original Ordnance Works that is still in use today. (Gov't Facts \u00b6\u00b6 152-157, 165).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   According to the United States, Exxon's only evidence supporting its claim that the cleanup costs are related to wartime production is a 1998 letter from Exxon to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission stating that \"the main source of the ... plume is believed to be historic.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 166). Exxon responds with two points. First, the 1990s investigation \"was only intended to identify first where the current contamination was and the extent of the contamination\"; it was not intended to be a \"forensic investigation of the historical sources of the contamination\" or to identify the responsible parties. (Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6\u00b6 161). Second, Exxon points to the testimony of its contaminant-contribution expert, Peter Gagnon, that \"there was a direct correlation between the nature of the groundwater contaminants and the types of products, by-products, feed stocks or wastes associated with the [Ordnance Works] operations, including toluene, naphtha, xylene, kerosene, paraffins, and reformate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Exxon Facts \u00b6 504). Exxon contends that undisputed evidence shows that wartime production at the Ordnance Works was \"a primary source\" of the Tank Farm 3000 area groundwater contamination. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 503, 504; Exxon Response to Gov't Facts \u00b6 161).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   The record is not as clear as either the United States or Exxon describes. Instead,\n   the record evidence shows genuine factual disputes material to determining the United States's equitable share of the cleanup costs at this unit. The United States cites evidence that wartime production was not a major cause of the pollution; Exxon cites conflicting expert testimony citing other facts and rebutting that characterization. Because of the conflicting evidence, a ruling that the United States caused none or a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   amount of the contamination at this site is premature. The cross-motions for summary judgment on this issue are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   <strong>\n    X.

His analysis took the following steps:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   \u2022 First, he determined the amount of waste generated at each refinery and chemical plant during the years of operation by using the \"production-based\" factor of the crude-oil \"throughput\" capacity as a \"surrogate\" for the amount of waste generated each year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   \u2022 Second, he determined the parties' relative responsibility in generating that waste for each year. This second \"inter-allocation\" step used several factors, including that the United States:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-309\">\n   \u2022 (1) mandated maximum production of avgas and war products;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-310\">\n   \u2022 (2) required the refineries to enter into the avgas contracts and comply with all their directives;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-311\">\n   \u2022 (3) controlled all significant plant activities, including the use of crude oil and other raw materials;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-312\">\n   \u2022 (4) \"effectively\" controlled waste-generating operations at the chemical plants and refineries; and\n   \u2022 (5) denied approval of most waste-handling improvements, despite its knowledge that the wartime operations generated increased wastes that overwhelmed the waste-handling systems.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   \u2022 Third, he attributed to the United States a 40 percent degree of involvement for the refinery operations; a 60 percent degree of involvement for the government-owned Plancors and Baytown Ordnance Works operations; and a 100 percent degree of responsibility to the United States for each year in which Exxon supplied avgas under its wartime contract obligations-the 1942-1945 wartime period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   (Exxon MSJ at 55-57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   Exxon contends that these determinations incorporate other equitable factors, including the United States's knowledge and acquiescence; the benefits to the country from the wartime-production activities; the Court of Federal Claims ruling in the stayed contract case that the United States was fully responsible for cleanup costs incurred under these contracts,\n   <em>\n    Exxon Mobil v.

Exxon's \"Fundamental Tenets\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   Exxon next proposes that the equitable allocation incorporate several \"fundamental tenets,\" including site-specific conditions, a production-based approach, credit for post-war waste-handling improvements, and acknowledgment of the United States's control of avgas production during World War II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Site-Specific Conditions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   Exxon argues that, consistent with the Phase I opinion's conclusion that the Baytown and refinery and chemical plants are each a single \"facility,\" and that the Baton Rouge refinery and chemical plants are a single \"facility,\" the model reflects the integrated nature of the privately owned refineries and the government-owned chemical plants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exxon I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364635\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/108/486/\">\n    108 F.Supp.3d at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Exxon argues that this integration was a \"critical\" factor in enabling the United States to control the overall Baytown and Baton Rouge facility operations during wartime. The government-owned chemical plants were integrated with the refinery operations \"in order to maximize avgas and war products production.\" (Exxon MSJ at 58). Exxon cites documents and expert testimony supporting its conclusion that the government-owned chemical plants supplied the privately owned refineries with the raw materials to make avgas on an accelerated production schedule. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 232, 305-307). Exxon also cites evidence and testimony that the United States intentionally put its chemical plants near the refineries to take advantage of the refineries' infrastructure and waste-processing systems. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 234-235, 245, 252, 268, 276-277, 285-287, 294, 308-312, 319, 370). Exxon's argument is that the allocation must account for the United States's significant involvement in generating and providing the raw materials to the refineries, which allowed the refineries to exponentially increase their avgas production during the wartime periods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The \"Production-Based\" Approach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   Exxon argues that this approach \"most accurately reflects the actual operating conditions of the respective plants during their periods of operation.\" (Exxon MSJ at 60). Exxon cites expert testimony that the \"crude processing rate of a refinery\" is the most precise and accurate surrogate for measuring the amount of hazardous waste generated. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 100, 348-52). Exxon's expert on forensic waste issues, Gregory Kipp, testified that the rate and\n   amount of waste generation was directly proportional to the rate and amount of avgas and other wartime material produced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 348). Exxon's other experts, David Lerman and Stephen Johnson, as well as the United States's technical expert, agreed that waste generation was proportional to production. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   Exxon describes this approach of using \"crude oil throughput capacity\" as a \"typical\" and accurate way to reflect the amount of waste generated on an annual basis. Exxon cites four CERCLA cases using historic production volumes as surrogates for waste generation to determine each party's cleanup-cost share.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Post-War Waste-Handling Improvements at the Facilities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   Exxon argues that the allocation method should include credit for implementing new waste-improvement systems at the facilities after the war. These systems achieved dramatic reductions in \"oil losses, generation of slop and slop oil, and discharge of oil and other contaminants in the wastewaters.\" (Exxon MSJ at 62 (citing Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 351, 373-416, 440-453) ). During the war, the United States required Exxon to maximize avgas production and denied Exxon's requests to construct a \"master separator\" to reduce hazardous materials. Exxon cites historical evidence and expert testimony about the post-war improvements, and the savings and environmental progress attributable to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   The United States vigorously opposes the amount of credit Exxon should receive for its post-war pollution-reduction improvements. The parties have advised the court that this issue is the single most significant disagreement between them in the allocation analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   <strong>\n    d. The United States's Control and Other Equitable Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   Finally, Exxon points to historical evidence, the Phase I opinion, and other court opinions addressing evidence of extensive government control over the production of avgas. Exxon argues that this degree of control should be a substantial factor in the equitable allocation. The other equitable factors Exxon proposes are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-328\">\n   (1) the knowledge and acquiescence of the United States in the contaminating activities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-329\">\n   (2) delay in the implementation of waste-reduction measures caused by United States wartime policies;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-330\">\n   (3) the value of the wartime contamination-causing activities to the United States's national-defense efforts; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-331\">\n   (4) the parties' intent to allocate responsibility between them, evidenced by the contract provisions that the Court of Federal Claims found imposed liability on the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   Exxon cites the Court of Federal Claims opinion holding the United States responsible for 100 percent of cleanup costs based on a provision in avgas contracts pertinently identical to those at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shell IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12322038\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/130/8/\">\n    130 Fed.Cl. at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The United States's \"Time-on-the-Risk\" Model\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   The United States points to several conclusions in the Phase I opinion that it argues support its approach. First, the \"time-on-the-risk\" approach accounts for the conclusion that each of the Baytown and Baton Rouge sites is a single \"facility,\" but also considers each party's status as an \"owner\" or \"operator\" at various locations and units in each facility.\n   <em>\n    Exxon I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364635\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/108/486/\">\n    108 F.Supp.3d at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the United States, this distinction is important because most of Exxon's past cleanup costs\n   are confined to the refineries, and \"the United States - were it not for the existence of the Government owned and operated plants outside the refinery - would not be liable\" for the refinery-generated cleanup costs. (Gov't MSJ at 53). The United States argues that the equitable allocation should account for the following considerations:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   \u2022 Both the United States and Exxon are liable under CERCLA as current or former owners and operators of chemical plants at both Baytown and Baton Rouge.\n   <em>\n    Exxon I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364635\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/108/486/\">\n    108 F.Supp.3d at 491, 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 530 ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   \u2022 The United States did not own or operate either refinery; only Exxon did.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364635\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/108/486/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   \u2022 The United States should not be asked to contribute to costs associated with wastes generated after its involvement ended;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   \u2022 The allocation should account for the fact that avgas production made up a small portion of each refinery's wartime production, and the United States should not be asked to contribute to the remediation of wastes associated with making commercial products, including during wartime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   (Gov't MSJ at 53-54). The United States's approach allocates to itself two percent of the costs at the Baytown facility and one percent of the costs at the Baton Rouge facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   The United States argues that Exxon's approach treats the refinery wastes as a whole and does not account for either costs at different units and the hazardous wastes each generated or for the parties' status as \"operators\" at the facilities. For example, the United States points to the South Landfarm unit at the Baytown facility. Exxon's approach credits it for waste reduction at this unit after the war \"without accounting for the fact that the United States is connected to the unit only because Exxon deposited separator sludge there during the 1980s that amounts to approximately 2 percent of the total unit waste.\" (Gov't MSJ at 55 (citing Low 2012 Report at 18-19) ). According to the United States, Exxon's approach ignores these facts and fails to account for circumstances supporting a lower allocation to the United States at this unit. The United States's expert, Matthew Low, compiled a \"weighted average\" of wastes for on a unit-by-unit basis, rather than on a facility-wide basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Step 1: Assigning Response Costs to Years\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   The United States disputes the extent Exxon would reduce its responsibility allocation for post-war waste-processing improvements. The dispute is \"about whether the period of Federal involvement contributed a greater proportion to the wastes Exxon has cleaned up, and, if so, whether the available data permits the court to make a reasonable estimate about any differential more than 75 years later.\" (Gov't MSJ at 56). Exxon's production-based approach gives it a \"multiplier\" for Exxon's site-wide waste-reduction efforts. The United States argues that this approach works in theory, but overestimates the benefits of the post-war waste-reduction efforts based on unreliable data. Instead, Low divided the waste generated at each facility by the total years of operation, holding the rate of waste generation constant over time. Unlike Exxon's approach, the United States's approach keeps waste generation at a constant because Low \"found no reliable data from which to make waste reduction estimates.\" (Low Report at 12-14). According to the United States, Exxon's approach overly emphasizes \"throughputs,\" which eventually increased over 300 percent at the Baytown facility\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   World War II ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Step 2: Costs Subject to Allocation During the \"Federal\" Period\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   Next, the court must decide which of the costs assigned to the \"federal\" period in Step 1 should be allocated in the \"cost pool\" for allocation between the parties. The United States argues that during World War II, the \"majority\" of the products the refineries made were for \"ordinary commercial consumption.\" (Gov't MSJ at 59). The United States argues that the allocation approach should: (1) limit the \"scope and impact\" of its contractual obligation to indemnify Exxon for costs produced \"by reason of\" the production of avgas; (2) limit the share of the United States's responsibility for \"war products\" other than avgas; and (3) \"account for the waste load that the Government-owned plants imposed on refinery systems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Cir. 2014). The United States had to pay for 100 percent of the environmental costs generated \"by reason of\" avgas production at the refineries under the taxes clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   The United States argues that its liability for wastes generated \"by reason of\" avgas production should be limited based on records showing that avgas made up only 14 percent of wartime production at Baytown and about 19 percent at Baton Rouge. (Low 2012 Report at 26, 37). The records, according to the United States, also establish that approximately 50 percent of wartime aviation gasoline was made up of \"blending materials imported from other refineries and physically mixed with local stocks\" and that those imports would have produced little or no waste at the Exxon properties. (Gov't MSJ at 60 (citing Ex. 21, Kittrell Expert Report at 5, 29-28) ). To account for these figures, the United States asks the court to add to the cost pool 7 percent of costs for the Baytown contract and 9.5 percent for the Baton Rouge contract, and in Step 3 to allocate 100 percent of only those costs to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   Exxon's approach, according to the United States, inflates these figures by using the contractual \"price-escalation\" clause, which provided that the \"prices herein above set forth are based upon ... a normal operation of said refinery in which substantial quantities of motor fuel and other products must necessarily be produced and sold in connection with the production of 100 octane aviation gasoline\" and that, if \"normal operations\" were disrupted, the seller could either reduce the amounts of avgas delivered, or raise the price. (Gov't Facts \u00b6 172). The United States argues that Exxon's approach improperly assumes that refinery operations were\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   disrupted by the onset of the 100-octane avgas program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-352\">\n   <strong>\n    b. \"Other War Products\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   Another issue within Step 2 is whether to assign costs to account for production of what the parties refer to as \"other war products.\" These\n   products are \"commodities other than aviation gasoline that the United States purchased during World War II including, for example, Navy fuel oil and diesel for ships, military lubricants, and asphalt.\" (Gov't MSJ at 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   The United States points to the Phase I ruling that it did not \"operate\" the refineries. As a result, its approach does not include costs associated with wastes from these non-avgas wartime products. The United States makes a \"reasonable estimate\" of these costs based on historical evidence that \"critical war products\" comprised 30 to 35 percent of the refinery production, then subtracting the avgas component and the component comprising the sales of all-purpose 80-octane gas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Estimating \"Government Plant\" Waste Load Impacts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   The final part of the United States's Step 2 analysis is to estimate the impact of the government-owned chemical plants on the refineries' total waste output. The United States is responsible for a portion of the refinery-related costs based on the interactions among the government-owned Plancors and the Baytown Ordnance Works, and the privately owned refineries. The chemical plants consist of the \"Plancors\" and the Baytown Ordnance Works. The parties agree that the Plancors and Ordnance Works imposed \"waste loads\" on the refineries and that the associated costs must be included in the allocation pool. These waste loads are based on the crude oil that ran from the refineries to the Plancors and to the Baytown Ordnance Works. The waste loads also included waste streams from the government-owned Plancors that were returned to the refineries and processed in the refinery separators. The United States argues that these waste loads were \"modest.\" Low estimated that they comprise seven percent of the waste generated at the Baytown facility and two percent of the waste generated at the Baton Rouge facility. (Low Supp. Report at 4-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Step 3: Equitable Allocation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   The United States argues that several factors, consistent with the Phase I opinion, are important to equitable allocation. The United States's approach accounts for its status as non-operator at both refineries and as owner and co-operator of the government-owned chemical plants, and excuses it from paying for the wastes generated by \"normal\" refining operations. The next factor the United States proposes is accounting for its \"limited\" role in the refinery operations and for the fact that Exxon owned and operated the refineries for profit, even during wartime. The final factor, argued in the alternative, measures \"the impact of the Government's interaction with the refinery during World War II, while still accounting for the idea that the refiners managed their own operations.\" (Gov't MSJ at 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Court's Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   The court adopts the agreed general steps for the method:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-361\">\n   (1) assigning shares of waste to the various years of plant operation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-362\">\n   (2) determining the portion of costs that are associated with the periods of the United States's involvement and are attributable to war products for which the United States is responsible; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-363\">\n   (3) equitably dividing the portion of wartime-related costs that it determines to be subject to allocation, based on the parties' respective degree of involvement with the wartime activities and several other equitable factors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   The court adopts some elements of each parties' proposal in the allocation method it will apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Allocating Response Costs to Years\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   The first step in the process is to assign response costs to years. The court will divide the response costs into four time periods, on which the parties generally agree:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-367\">\n   (1) 1928 to 1941, the pre-World War II period during which only Exxon was involved at the facilities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-368\">\n   (2) 1942 to 1945, the World War II period, which included wartime production of avgas and other war products;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-369\">\n   (3) 1946 to 1955, during which Exxon and the United States were involved at both facilities; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-370\">\n   (4) 1956 to the present, during which only Exxon was involved at the facilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   The parties' primary dispute at Step 1 is whether to apply a \"production-based\" or a \"time-on-the-risk\" approach. The court will apply a production-based approach using \"throughputs\"-the amounts of oil and rubber each facility produced-to approximate the amount of hazardous waste generated in a given period. This approach accounts for the record evidence, including the testimony of the United States's experts, showing a proportional relationship between crude-oil production volume and the amount of hazardous waste generated. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 348-352). The facilities produced new, more, and more hazardous types of hazardous wastes during World War II than during the three other periods. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 91, 179, 353-364, 427-428). The production-based model accounts for the amount of crude oil produced and waste generated in each period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-372\">\n   In contrast, the United States's proposed \"time-on-the-risk\" approach operates on the assumption that each facility generated the same amount of waste each year. That approach does not adequately account for the waste generation levels that widely varied between the wartime and non-wartime periods. The United States acknowledges this shortcoming, but it argues that the available data is insufficient and too unreliable to support a production-based approach. As is true with much of the evidence in this case, the data is old and invites competing interpretations. But the lack of data certain to be reliable-a lack that Exxon disputes-is not enough to adopt a model that does not attempt to account for the actual facility conditions and the significantly different levels of crude-oil production and waste generation in different years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-373\">\n   The production-based approach is also supported by the CERCLA case law.\n   <em>\n    New York State Electric &amp; Gas Corp. v.

Exxon cites a 1943 report setting out the percentages of product output at the Baytown refinery, showing that nearly all of the output during World War II consisted of war products, and a 1943 report for the Baton Rouge refinery showing that all of the production at that refinery during World War II consisted of war products.

Post-War Waste-Handling Improvements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   During World War II, the United States limited and strictly regulated the use of wartime material in order to prioritize wartime oil production. Using wartime materials and resources for pollution control was considered \"non-essential.\" (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 33-35, 158-163). A 1946 government report on the effect of the wartime priorities stated that \"personnel could not be diverted from more pressing objectives to study the complex problems related to waste prevention or treatment-nor could construction materials be secured for such purposes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 326);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cadillac/Fairview\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11452563\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/299/1019/#p1026\">\n    299 F.3d at 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The government made a policy decision not to divert scarce resources from the war effort to stop the pollution.\"). Exxon produced avgas and other war products at full capacity, with government-directed little regard for hazardous waste production or the environment. On several occasions, Exxon sought approval from the Petroleum Administration for War and the War Production Board to construct waste-processing\n   improvements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 172-180). Those requests were denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   The World War II production overloaded Exxon's waste-processing systems. After the War, Exxon implemented substantial waste-management improvements. The process-control improvements included: a \"Leak Detection &amp; Repair Program\" (\u00b6\u00b6 174, 377-379); a \"Segregated Sanitary Sewage System\" in 1949 (\u00b6\u00b6 382, 389); an \"Effluent Filtration Unit\" in 1951 (\u00b6\u00b6 385-387); a \"Spent Caustics Collection System\" in 1951; and \"Cooling Water Towers\" in 1952 (\u00b6\u00b6 377-389). The waste-handling improvements included: upgrading Separator 10 in 1950 (\u00b6 383); installing three new \"preseparators\" in 1951, 1954, and 1958 to process wily wastewater emulsions in the refinery sewer lines, (\u00b6\u00b6 384, 394, 395); and installing a \"Sour Water Stripper\" in 1952 that treated hazardous waste, (\u00b6 393). These improvements contributed to significant hazardous-waste reduction in the post-wartime period at both facilities. Exxon points to record evidence showing that at the Baytown facility, oil losses were reduced by 60 percent; corrosion leaks were reduced by 93 percent; separator sludge was reduced by 70 percent; oily wastewater was reduced by 95 percent; and the total amount of contamination in the wastewater was reduced by 99 percent. (Exxon MSJ, Table 13). The improvements at the Baton Rouge facility were similar: oil losses were reduced by 60 percent; separator sludge was reduced by 60 percent; oily wastewater was reduced by 75 percent; and the total amount of contamination in the wastewater was reduced by 99 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Table 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   The United States's and Exxon's experts agree that the improvements were significant. (Exxon Facts \u00b6\u00b6 351, 373-416, 440-453). Exxon's allocation model allocates adjustments and a \"multiplier\" to account for the corresponding reduction in waste generation. (White 2012 Report at 59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   The United States vigorously contests Exxon's adjustment amounts and waste-reduction multipliers. It argues that Exxon's waste-reduction adjustments are unreliable because they \"operate as a switch,\" by \"turning off\" waste production after World War II, and ignore decades of ongoing, and increasing, crude-oil production at the refineries in the years after World War II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   The United States also challenges the data underlying Exxon's waste-reduction factors. At the Baytown facility, the United States contends that: (1) the waste-reduction factors were calculated by impermissibly multiplying numbers that lack record support; (2) the 70 percent reduction in waste at Separator 10 should not result in a 70 percent reduction factor for the entire refinery; (3) a large part of the waste-reduction effects Exxon describes were from cleaning up toxic waste sources separate from the refinery's waste-disposal system; (4) some of the \"pre-separators\" were designed to recapture oil rather than to reduce pollution; and (5) the 90 percent reduction factor Exxon proposes for the Baytown facility included a reduction for air emissions unrelated to the cleanup costs incurred in this case. (Gov't Response at 42-48). The United States challenges Exxon's Baton Rouge waste-reduction adjustments on similar grounds, including that it improperly attributed results from a single cleanup unit to the entire refinery, multiplied numbers lacking in record support, and incorporated wastes generated long after the United States's wartime involvement ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   In short, the parties agree that Exxon made substantial post-war waste-reduction improvements, but disagree about the magnitude and impact of those improvements on the equitable allocation. There\n   are genuine factual disputes material to determining the nature, extent, effects, and timing of the waste-reduction measures Exxon took. The parties propose conflicting inferences about the relative culpability as a result of these factual disputes. These disputes preclude summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   At the bench trial, the court will consider Exxon's post-World War II waste-processing improvements. Those improvements at the facilities were substantial and appear to support significant waste-reduction adjustments that in turn reduce Exxon's responsibility. But because the underlying numbers and data supporting those adjustments are disputed, the parties may support and contest those numbers, the data, and the particular adjustment amounts and multipliers at the bench trial. But based on the present record, it is clear that the United States has undervalued the benefits and allocation impact of Exxon's post-wartime waste-reduction measures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   <strong>\n    XI. Declaratory Judgment for Future Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   The United States moved for partial summary judgment that Exxon is not entitled to a declaratory judgment allocating future cleanup costs. (Gov't MSJ at 68). Exxon cross-moved for partial summary judgment that it is entitled to a declaratory judgment allocating future costs. (Exxon MSJ at 55 n.54) (\"At such time as the Court determines the Government's equitable allocation for past costs, a declaratory judgment as to the Government's specific and allocable share of future response costs is also ripe and appropriate.\"). The Phase I opinion stated that \"[d]uring Phase II, the court may issue a declaratory judgment equitably assigning the parties' shares of future costs if the evidence is not unduly speculative or otherwise subject to challenge.\"\n   <em>\n    Exxon I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364635\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/108/486/\">\n    108 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   536-37 (citing\n   <em>\n    New York v.

The first category is units at which Exxon has already incurred and will continue to incur cleanup costs. This category includes, among others, Separators 3M and 10, the South Landfarm, the Upper and Lower Outfall Canals, the Velasco Street Ditch, the Baytown FOAs, the Shallow Fill Zone, the Old Silt Pond, and the Rice Paddy Landfarm. The second category, the future costs related to the adjacent waterbodies, include activities at the Houston Ship Channel, Black Duck Bay, Scott's Bay, Mitchell Bay, the Mississippi River, and the Monte Sano Bayou.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-425\">\n   The parties conducted extensive discovery related to allocation and costs, including future response activities. Exxon argues that a declaration of the United States's \"specific allocable share of future response costs, which is based on the [United States's] contribution to contamination during the wartime over seventy years ago, is ripe and appropriate, and serves the interests of judicial economy.\" (Exxon Response at 77). The United States agrees that a declaratory judgment may be entered for future costs for the cleanup units at issue where past costs have been incurred, as long as the court first finds that: \"(1) Exxon has incurred necessary costs of response consistent with the National Contingency Plan; (2) Exxon's\n   recovery is not barred by CERCLA's statute of limitations; and (3) the United States is responsible for an equitable share of Exxon's past costs at that unit.\" (Gov't Response at 72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-426\">\n   The parties agree that a declaratory judgment is appropriate as to the future costs for the cleanup units at which Exxon has already incurred past costs. The court will enter a declaratory judgment assigning the United States its share of the future cleanup costs at those units based on its share of the past costs determined at the bench trial.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Boeing Co. v.

The United States points to the following areas as examples of costs lacking record support:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-428\">\n   \u2022 Exxon Facts \u00b6 789 (past costs for Baytown waterbodies not listed)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-429\">\n   \u2022 Exxon Facts \u00b6 790 (citing past costs for Mitchell Bay shoreline work only)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-430\">\n   \u2022 Exxon Facts \u00b6 796 (past costs for Baton Rouge waterbodies not listed).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-431\">\n   The United States argues that determining the contamination cleanup costs for sediments and underlying waterbodies requires extensive information on the source and extent of this contamination. The United States points to the testimony of Peter Gagnon, Exxon's compliance consultant, that although Exxon has collected groundwater samples from the shorelines at Black Duck Bay, Mitchell Bay, and the Houston Ship Channel, Exxon has not sampled the underlying sediments and has not taken remediation steps or corrective action. (Gov't Facts \u00b6\u00b6 59, 180, 181). The United States also points to the testimony of Stephen Johnson, Exxon's National Contingency Plan expert, that there are no documents showing that the Mississippi River groundwater is contaminated or that Exxon will seek response costs to clean up the Monte Sano Bayou. (Gov't Facts \u00b6\u00b6 183, 185). The United States argues that future costs associated with adjacent waterbodies and their underlying sediments remains too speculative to include in a declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-432\">\n   Exxon responds that no additional factfinding is necessary to determine the amounts and liability allocation for the future costs of the adjacent waterbodies and the underlying sediments. According to Exxon, if, for example, the United States is 50 percent liable for the past costs incurred at the cleanup sites at issue in this litigation, it should be 50 percent liable for the cleanup costs incurred at waterbodies adjacent to the Baytown and Baton Rouge facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   Exxon relies primarily on two cases,\n   <em>\n    New York State Electric &amp; Gas Corp. v.

The\n   <em>\n    FirstEnergy\n   </em>\n   decision about future costs is not analogous to a declaratory judgment for liability for cleanup costs of adjacent, off-site waterbodies for which no past cleanup costs have been incurred, and for which equitable shares of past cleanup costs can not yet be determined. Similarly, the\n   <em>\n    La Plata\n   </em>\n   court considered the allocation of future responsibility as to only one property. Here, Exxon seeks recovery for future costs at several waterbodies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   Entering a declaratory judgment for the future cleanup costs for the numerous adjacent waterbodies is not so simple. In this case alone, the United States has disputed its share of responsibility for contamination at several individual cleanup sites based on the years these sites became contaminated. Similar issues could arise affecting the parties' relative liability for cleanup costs for the adjacent waterbodies. Exxon has produced little evidence about the levels of contamination in the adjacent waterbodies and their underlying sediments, about the contaminants' source, and about whether and to what extent the United States contributed to that contamination during the wartime. The facts related to allocating responsibility for adjacent waterbodies are not sufficiently developed and remain speculative. A declaratory judgment allocating future costs for the adjacent waterbodies, their underlying sediments, and other areas of contamination for which Exxon has not yet determined the amount and source of the contamination, taken response actions, or incurred past cleanup costs is premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   The cross-motions for partial summary judgment on this point are granted in part and denied in part. The court will enter a declaratory judgment that Exxon is entitled to recover future cleanup costs associated with the units at which Exxon has already incurred costs. At this stage, the court will not enter a declaratory judgment for the amounts, nor will the court enter a declaratory judgment that Exxon is entitled to recover future costs related to cleanup activities at the adjacent waterbodies and their underlying sediments for which no past cleanup costs have been incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-437\">\n   <strong>\n    XII.
