Plaintiffs' primary challenge is to Commerce's determination that Commerce did not have sufficient evidence to determine whether Huameng's subject sale was\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   , and contest this finding on several bases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

Defendant asserts that Commerce requested information repeatedly regarding Huameng's contractual expenses, which Commerce believed was necessary to verify Plaintiffs' claims that the sale was made \"on the basis of the terms in the contract and invoice.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Resp. 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 6;\n   <em>\n    Bona Fide\n   </em>\n   Memo at 5. Defendant argues that Huameng failed to cooperate by not providing information requested for the new shipper review and intentionally obfuscating its sales terms, leading to Commerce's conclusion that Huameng's single sale of single-clove garlic was not\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Resp. 29-30. The issue considered by the court is whether Commerce properly rescinded the new shipper review based on Commerce's asserted inability to complete the\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   analysis because of the failure of Huameng and its downstream U.S. customer to provide requested documentation relating to payment of expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Commerce found specifically that because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Huameng did not provide evidence that identifies the party that actually paid for [the] contractual expenses, the Department cannot definitely determine that the terms of the sales contract and commercial invoice were reported accurately. As a result, the Department continues to find that the lack of proof of payment for these expenses is indicative that the sale was not a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   transaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Final IDM at 6. Commerce requested that Huameng provide documentation showing that its U.S. customer paid for U.S. Customs duties, international freight, and marine insurance, and Huameng failed to provide such documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346569\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/1363/#p1373\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Commerce requested \"a copy of each type of agreement and all sales-related documentation generated in the sales process (including the purchase order, internal and external order confirmation, invoice, shipping and export documentation, and Customs entry documentation) for a sample sale in the U.S. market during the [period of review].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Response to Section A of Department's Questionnaire (\"SAQR\") Filed on Behalf of Jinxiang Huameng Imp &amp; Exp Co., Ltd. at 15-16, PD 23, bar code 3301651-01 (Sep. 1, 2015). Commerce could not \"definitively determine that the terms of the sales contract and commercial invoice were reported accurately,\" and found therefore that Huameng failed to \"comply fully\" with Commerce's requests.

Commerce concluded that the missing proof of payment documentation was indicative of possible \"unreported agreements\" between Huameng and its U.S. customer to falsely inflate prices \"to achieve a zero dumping margin,\" and that Huameng's sales were not\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bona Fide\n   </em>\n   Memo at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court finds that substantial evidence does not support Commerce's decision to rescind the new shipper review due to lack of sufficient information to conduct the statutory\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haixing Jingmei Chemical Products Sales Co., Ltd. v.

The court finds that Commerce should have instead used facts available, with or without an adverse inference, to fill any gaps in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Huameng responded to Commerce's questions regarding the matter and produced some documentation of sales expenses. For example, Huameng provided documentation of various transaction expenses, including ocean freight and related charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Supplemental Section A Questionnaire (\"SAQR\") Filed on Behalf of Jinxiang Huameng Imp &amp; Exp Co., Ltd. at 3, 7, PD 81, bar code 3453018-01 (Mar. 28, 2016). Commerce did not use the information provided to fill gaps in the record or draw adverse inferences, but rather concluded that the lack of information provided by Huameng and its downstream customer was indicative of a non-\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   transaction. The court concludes that in light of Commerce's statutory authority to utilize gap-filling information, Commerce's decision to rescind the new shipper review due to insufficient information is not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court remands this matter to Commerce for redetermination. The remaining arguments raised in the Parties' briefs are deferred pending the redetermination. The Parties may challenge any relevant remaining issues after Commerce concludes its remand redetermination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the reasons stated above, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the\n   <em>\n    Huameng Rescission\n   </em>\n   is remanded to Commerce for a redetermination of whether Huameng's subject sale was\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   as discussed in this opinion; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the following schedule shall govern the remand proceedings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   1.
