An evaluation of the \"treatment\" provided to a defendant is not one of those four factors and does not serve as an independent prerequisite to the\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   analysis. The text of \u00a7 4241(d) does not present \"treatment\" as a precondition for involuntary medication; rather, \"treatment in a suitable facility\" precedes the determination whether a defendant is likely to regain the capacity to permit the criminal proceedings to continue. In fact, the government's request for involuntary medication is essentially\n   <em>\n    a request to forcibly administer certain treatment\n   </em>\n   -usually antipsychotic medication-so a defendant's competency can be restored and trial may proceed. Nothing in the Supreme Court's discussion in\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   -or in any other court's consideration, for that matter-supports the imposition of a separate requirement that a particular \"treatment\" be afforded before the Attorney General may determine (through the assessment of medical experts) a need for, and a court may then order, involuntary medication. Because the Report and Recommendation did not provide an analysis of the four factors required by\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   , but instead imposed an independent \"treatment\" requirement, the Court will reject its recommendation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Hence, \"treatment\" is not an independent statutory prerequisite under \u00a7 4241(d) to involuntary medication to restore competency in addition to the four-factor\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   test. Nevertheless, the kind and quality of treatment provided to a defendant may still be relevant to a court's\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   analysis. For example, under the third\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   factor, the court must conclude that \"any alternative, less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results,\" and evidence that alternative treatments were tried but failed could serve as strong evidence that involuntary medication is \"necessary\" under this prong of the analysis.\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897706\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/166/\">\n    539 U.S. at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897706\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/166/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, if the government failed to provide a defendant with\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   medically appropriate treatment, it would likely be unable to meet its burden under the fourth factor to prove that a course of involuntary medication was \"medically appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897706\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/166/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And finally, as Magistrate Judge Robinson suggested,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. &amp; R. at 9 n.8, a defendant may raise any abnormalities in his treatment or conditions of confinement as \"special circumstances\" that mitigate the government's interest in bringing the defendant to trial under the first\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   factor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897706\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/166/\">\n    539 U.S. at 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897706\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/166/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the details of a defendant's treatment are relevant to the Court's analysis to the extent that they weigh in its consideration of the four\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   factors, but not as an independent bar to the government's motion to involuntarily medicate a defendant to restore competency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the Court sets aside the Report and Recommendation.
