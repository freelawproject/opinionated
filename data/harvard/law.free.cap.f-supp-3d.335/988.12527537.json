Dkt. 37 (2d Amend. Compl. (\"Compl.\") at \u00b6 1) (Page ID # 287). Now pending before this Court is the defendants' motion to dismiss (Dkt. 46). For the ensuing reasons, we\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following the 2010 Census, the Ohio General Assembly began the process of redrawing Ohio's congressional districts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 37 (Compl. at \u00b6 50-51) (Page ID # 302). Under then-applicable law, the Republican-controlled General Assembly had \"primary authority\" over redistricting, with advice provided by the six-person, bipartisan Joint Legislative Task Force on Redistricting, Reapportionment, and Demographic Research (\"Task Force\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42, 46 (Page ID # 300-01).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Republican members of the Task Force and other Republican officials responsible for drafting the 2011 map allegedly worked in a partisan way during the redistricting process, deliberately excluding non-Republicans from much of the drafting process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 44-58, 62-84 (Page ID # 300-03, 305-09). The plaintiffs further allege that the Republicans who worked on the 2011 redistricting process aimed to draw a congressional map that \"provide[d] for and maintain[ed] Republican control.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59 (Page ID # 304). They therefore crafted a congressional map that \"would virtually guarantee\" that Republicans won twelve districts and Democrats won four districts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61. To do so, the Republican drafters purportedly \"packed\" Democratic voters into four districts, and then \"cracked\" Democratic voters across the district lines of the twelve remaining districts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The 2011 map has now been used for three congressional elections: 2012, 2014, and 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86 (Page ID # 310). In each election, the Republicans have won the same twelve districts and the Democrats have won the same four districts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 86-87 (Page ID # 310). Although each party's number of seats has remained constant across the three elections, the statewide vote share for each party has fluctuated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86 (Page ID # 310). The plaintiffs allege that these electoral results are the product of partisan gerrymandering.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85 (Page ID # 309). The 2011 map will be in use for two more election cycles: 2018 and 2020.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42 n.1 (Page ID # 300).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 2018, the plaintiffs filed suit against Ryan Smith, the Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives; Larry Obhof, the President of the Ohio Senate; and Jon Husted, the Secretary of State of Ohio, in their official capacities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 1 (Initial Compl.) (Page ID # 1-44). The\n   plaintiffs can be categorized into two groups. First, there are five organizational plaintiffs: the Ohio A. Philip Randolph Institute (\"APRI\"), the League of Women Voters of Ohio (\"LWVO\"), the College Democrats at the Ohio State University (\"OSU College Democrats\"), the Northeast Ohio Young Black Democrats (\"NEOYBD\"); and the Hamilton County Young Democrats (\"HCYD\"). Dkt. 37 (Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 17-21) (Page ID # 292-94).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Second, there are seventeen individual plaintiffs who are Democratic voters living in Ohio and who, collectively, reside in all sixteen congressional districts: Linda Goldenhar (1st District), Douglas J. Burks (2nd District), Sarah Inskeep (3rd District), Cynthia Rodene Libster (4th District), Kathryn Deitsch (5th District), Luann Boothe (6th District), Mark John Griffiths (7th District), Lawrence Nadler (8th District), Chitra Walker (9th District), Tristan Rader (9th District), Ria Megnin (10th District), Andrew Harris (11th District), Aaron Dagres (12th District), Elizabeth Myer (13th District), Beth Hutton (14th District), Teresa Anne Thobaben (15th District), and Constance Rubin (16th District).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-38 (Page ID # 294-99).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiffs raise four claims. First, plaintiffs argue that the 2011 map burdens their First Amendment rights because the map was designed purposefully to disfavor them based on their political views.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 136-48 (Page ID # 328-30) (Count I). Next, plaintiffs claim that the 2011 map substantially burdens their right to vote in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 149-55 (Page ID # 331-32) (Count II). Third, the plaintiffs allege that the 2011 map intentionally discriminates against them by drawing district lines to dilute their votes on the basis of political association in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 156-64 (Page ID # 333-35) (Count III). Finally, the plaintiffs allege that the 2011 map exceeds the state's power under Article I of the U.S. Constitution to run elections because it is a product of partisan gerrymandering.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 165-69 (Page ID # 335-36) (Count IV).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendants move to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Dkt. 46 (Mot. to Dismiss) (Page ID # 448-71). They raise three arguments: (1) the plaintiffs' claims are nonjusticiable; (2) the plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to establish standing; and (3) laches bars the plaintiffs' claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3 (Page ID # 451-52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendants have moved under Rule 12(b)(1) for dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that the plaintiffs' claims are nonjusticiable and that the plaintiffs lack standing. \"A Rule 12(b)(1) motion for lack for subject matter jurisdiction can challenge the sufficiency of the pleading itself (facial attack) or the factual existence of subject matter jurisdiction (factual attack).\"\n   <em>\n    Cartwright v.

When, as here, the defendants raise a facial attack, \"the court takes the allegations of the complaint as true for purposes of Rule 12(b)(1) analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070092\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/752/#p759\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Additionally, the defendants move to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), arguing that the plaintiffs' claims are barred by laches. When analyzing a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court \"construe[s] the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff[s], accept[s] its allegations as true, and draw[s] all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Bickerstaff v.

Again, the plaintiffs will ultimately have to prove that\n   this reasonable inference is true, but their pleadings are sufficient at this stage of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, the organizational plaintiffs also have pleaded sufficient facts to establish injury-in-fact on their own behalf. They allege that the substantial burden imposed on voters through vote dilution hampers their own voter-outreach missions to engage voters in the political process. Dkt. 37 (Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 17-21) (Page ID # 292-94).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    b. Traceability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The defendants argue that none of the plaintiffs have established that their injuries are \"fairly traceable\" to the 2011 map. Dkt. 46 (Mot. to Dismiss at 19) (Page ID # 468). Instead, the defendants argue, any injury suffered by the plaintiffs \"is traceable to voting decisions voters made in 2010 and then continued to make in 2012 and thereafter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (Page ID # 469).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In essence, the defendants are arguing that Ohio's sixteen congressional districts neither pack nor crack Democratic voters and that the results of the elections utilizing this map are not evidence of partisan gerrymandering, but rather reflect the democratic process. The defendants' argument goes to the merits of this case, however, and not to whether the plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded standing. Taking the factual allegations in the complaint as true, the plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded facts showing that Democratic voters in Ohio have suffered vote dilution-either via packing or cracking-and that this dilution is causally connected to the 2011 map and the process by which it was created. Dkt. 37 (Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 44-58, 62-84, 86-88, 98) (Page ID # 300-03, 305-10, 315).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    c.
