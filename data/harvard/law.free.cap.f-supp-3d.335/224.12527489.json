The precedence of a criminal prosecution over a removal proceeding necessarily means that \"the Government\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   ... proceed on a dual criminal prosecution and deportation track ....\"\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205129012\">\n    2017 WL 5129012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Once the Government has invoked the district court's jurisdiction in the criminal prosecution, it must comply with the Bail Reform Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boutin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263723\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/269/24/#p26\">\n    269 F.Supp.3d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"[C]ase law, statutes, and regulations all give primacy to the criminal prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Boutin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263723\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/269/24/#p26\">\n    269 F.Supp.3d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 28. More so, \"if the two proceedings vindicate entirely separate interests, it stands to reason that they should proceed sequentially so that one does not jeopardize the other. It matters not what the underlying charge is in the criminal prosecution. Ultimately, if a defendant is ordered removed, and is removed from the United States prior to the disposition of the criminal matter, several important interests are prejudiced or jeopardized.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"The district court has priority or first standing and administrative deportation proceedings must take a backseat to court proceedings until the criminal prosecution comes to an end.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Sept. 20, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this particular case, the continued detention of these two individuals is even more egregious because the Court held a bail hearing, during which counsel for the Government agreed to certain conditions of release, which the Court ultimately granted. It is inexplicable that the same branch of the Government, through two of its agencies, is speaking out of both sides of its mouth. On one hand, the United States Attorney's Office wants to use these individuals as material witnesses in the prosecution of another case, while on the other hand, they are being detained presumably in anticipation of deportation. The Court should not be placed in a position to referee disputes between agencies of the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As such, and based on the supremacy of the Bail Reform Act over any administrative regulation, the United States Government is hereby\n   <strong>\n    Ordered\n   </strong>\n   to release from custody\n   <strong>\n    forthwith\n   </strong>\n   the defendants in the following cases: Crim. No. 18-MJ-1234 and Crim. No. 18-MJ-1235, subject to the same conditions previously established by the Court in each respective case. This Order is entered irrespective of any detention that may exist against these two individuals. Furthermore, such detainer shall not be enforced against these individuals as long as they remain under the conditions of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The United States Attorney's Office is hereby\n   <strong>\n    Ordered\n   </strong>\n   to serve a copy of this Order on MDC Guaynabo, in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, the United States Marshal Service, and the United States Department of Homeland Security. Proof of service shall be submitted to the Court before the close of business today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803028\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/900/1167/\">\n     900 F.Supp.2d 1167\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (D.
