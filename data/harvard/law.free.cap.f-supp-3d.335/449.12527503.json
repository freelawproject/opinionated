(Dkt. 1). Plaintiff asserts a claim pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" \u00a7 1983\") for alleged violations of his due process rights, and he also requests a declaratory judgment that, among other things, his state and federal civil rights were violated and Erie County Local Law 10-1989 (\"Local Law 10-1989\") is\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   , invalid, and unenforceable. (Dkt. 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court are Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 31) and Defendant's cross motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 36). For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 31) is denied, Defendant's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 36) is granted with respect to Plaintiff's federal due process claim, and the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's remaining state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action on July 29, 2016, bringing claims for violation of due process, violation of equal protection, First Amendment retaliation, state law defamation and negligence, and seeking a declaratory judgment. (Dkt. 1). On October 14, 2016, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint. (Dkt. 6). Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on November 4, 2016, alleging the same causes of action as the original complaint with the exception of the equal protection claim. (Dkt. 8). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on November 18, 2016. (Dkt. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court held oral argument on June 28, 2017, and issued a ruling from the bench granting in part and denying in part Defendant's motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 24 at 37-46). The Court dismissed Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation claim without prejudice but denied the motion to dismiss as to all other claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court issued a Text Order on June 29, 2017, confirming its ruling from the bench, and noting that Plaintiff had been granted leave to file a second amended complaint on or before July 17, 2017. (Dkt. 21). The Court subsequently extended this deadline (Dkt. 23), and Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on October 5, 2017\n   (Dkt. 25). Plaintiff repleaded his First Amendment retaliation claim and again alleged due process violations, negligence, and defamation, and sought a declaratory judgment with respect to his state and federal causes of action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 19, 2018, the Court entered a stipulation dismissing Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation, defamation, and negligence claims with prejudice, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1). (Dkt. 34). The same day, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 31). On February 20, 2018, Defendant filed a cross motion for summary judgment and response to Plaintiff's motion. (Dkt. 36). Plaintiff filed a reply in support of his motion on March 6, 2018 (Dkt. 38), and filed a response to Defendant's cross motion on March 20, 2018 (Dkt. 39). Defendant filed a reply in support of its cross motion on April 3, 2018. (Dkt. 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This Court held oral argument on the parties' motions for summary judgment on May 24, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44). The Court reserved decision and requested additional briefing on the issue of whether the County's alleged violation of its own internal rules rises to the level of a constitutional violation under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Plaintiff submitted additional briefing on June 1, 2018 (Dkt. 45), and Defendant submitted its response on June 15, 2018 (Dkt. 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The essence of this case is a dispute over a $500 fine imposed on Plaintiff by the Board for Plaintiff's failure to correctly fill out a financial disclosure form. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8 at 7). Plaintiff was formerly an Erie County Legislator, representing Erie County's Eighth District. (Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6 2; Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In May 2014, Plaintiff submitted his annual financial disclosure form for calendar year 2013, as required by Local Law 10-1989, which establishes a code of ethics for Erie County. (Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6 23; Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 23). Plaintiff's financial disclosure form contained erroneous information. (Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6 23; Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 23). Plaintiff maintains that he mistakenly listed the debts he owed as of the date of filing rather than the end of the previous year, as required by the form. (Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6 23). Plaintiff filed an amended financial disclosure form on October 13, 2015, in an attempt to correct his mistake. (Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6 25; Def. Stmt at \u00b6 25). Before filing the corrected statement, Plaintiff had paid off several debts that he owed as of December 31, 2013. (Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6 26; Def. Stmt at \u00b6 26 (denying knowledge) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff's financial disclosure form became an issue during his 2015 re-election campaign. (Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6 24; Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 24). The Board's Chair, Steven Schwartz (\"Schwartz\"), met with Plaintiff's legislative assistant, Robert Matthews (\"Matthews\"), in November 2015, and informed Matthews that the Board was \"look[ing] into\" the erroneous financial disclosure statement. (Dkt. 25 at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28). Schwartz then sent a letter to Plaintiff on December 7, 2015, requesting information concerning the debts noted in Plaintiff's form, as well as the dates of any repayment, among other things. (Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6 27; Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 27 (referring to the letter (Dkt. 14-5 at 2) for its contents) ). In the letter, the Board took \"no position ... with respect to accepting any revised form and whether any violations of the Code of Ethics exist[ ].\" (Dkt. 14-5 at 2). Plaintiff responded\n   by letter on January 14, 2016. (Dkt. 14-6 at 2-3), In that letter, Plaintiff explained that he had misread the \"when-as\" dates on the form regarding any debts outstanding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 1, 2016, the Board sent a letter to Plaintiff informing him that it was imposing a $500 fine because it had \"determined that a violation of the Ethics Code has occurred to the extent that you should have known that the statements made on the form were erroneous.\" (Dkt. 14-7 at 2). The Board's letter further stated that Plaintiff could file a request for reconsideration within 30 days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). By letter dated February 29, 2016, Plaintiff objected to and sought reconsideration of the Board's decision to impose the fine. (Dkt. 14-8 at 2). In his letter, Plaintiff argued that his error was not made \"knowingly and willingly\" or \"with intent to deceive\" and stated that Local Law 10-1989 provides a prescribed disclosure form that requires disclosure of debts \"as of the date of the filing,\" a requirement with which Plaintiff's submission complied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Board affirmed its decision by letter on April 4, 2016. (Dkt. 14-9 at 2). Plaintiff again requested reconsideration. (Dkt. 25-1 at 56-57). The Board refused to alter its original decision, and Plaintiff informed the Board by letter that he would pursue legal action due to the Board's alleged violation of his state and federal rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment should be granted if the moving party establishes \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

(Dkt. 36-3 at 16, 19). Defendant also argues that any failure to follow state law procedures and/or the County's internal guidelines is not equivalent to a federal constitutional injury.

Plaintiff acknowledges that his legislative assistant was informed in November 2015 that the Board was \"look[ing] into\" his erroneous financial disclosure form. (Dkt. 25 at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28). Plaintiff also received a letter from Schwartz, dated December 7, 2015, requesting information regarding Plaintiff's ethics disclosure forms. (Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6 27; Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 27). That letter advised Plaintiff that the Board was investigating his 2013 ethics disclosure form, and that the Board took \"no position ... with respect to ... whether any violations of the Code of Ethics exist[ed].\" (Dkt 25-1 at 2). The Board provided Plaintiff an opportunity to respond and to have any questions answered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff exchanged a number of letters with the Board before the Board's final determination was made. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 14-6; Dkt. 14-7; Dkt. 14-8; Dkt. 14-9; Dkt. 25-1 at 56-57; Dkt. 25-1 at 59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff's assertion that the Board's December 7, 2015, letter provided him \"at best ... notice of a nonspecific inquiry\" but failed to apprise him of the charges that were being considered is not supported by the evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 31-5 at 17). Before the Board's December 7, 2015, letter to Plaintiff, Plaintiff filed an amended 2013 financial disclosure form. (Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6 25; Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 25). The Board's December 7, 2015, letter is unmistakably related to this issue, inasmuch as it specifically states that \"issues were raised by a third-party with respect to [Plaintiff's financial disclosure form's] accuracy.\" (Dkt. 14-5 at 2). Furthermore, in Plaintiff's January 14, 2016, letter to the Board in response to its December 7, 2015, letter, Plaintiff stated that he \"learned of the error in [his] 2013 Disclosure Filing ... during [his] reelection campaign.\" (Dkt. 14-6 (Ex. 6) ). Plaintiff went on to explain that he \"had misread the 'when-as' dates regarding [his] debts outstanding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In other words, Plaintiff clearly understood that the Board was investigating the accuracy of his 2013 financial disclosure form and was afforded an opportunity to submit all relevant information to the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Board completed its investigation, notified Plaintiff of its conclusion that a violation of Local Law 10-1989 had occurred by reason of Plaintiff's false filing, assessed a $500 fine, and advised Plaintiff\n   of his right to request reconsideration of that determination (which Plaintiff then did). (Dkt. 14-7; Dkt. 14-8). These undisputed facts conclusively demonstrate that Plaintiff had actual notice of the pendency of the action against him and was provided a way to respond (and he did so respond). Thus, Plaintiff's notice was constitutionally sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v.

Plaintiff had the opportunity to present evidence to the Board regarding his ethics disclosure form. (Pl. Stmt. at \u00b6 27; Def. Stmt. at \u00b6 27). Plaintiff responded to the Board's December 7, 2015, letter, arguing that he merely \"misread the 'when-as' dates regarding any outstanding debts\" in completing the contested financial disclosure form. (Dkt. 14-6 (Ex. 6) ). The Board then assessed the fine and provided Plaintiff an opportunity to request reconsideration. (Dkt. 14-7 (Ex. 7) ). The Board rejected Plaintiff's requests for reconsideration. (Dkt. 14-9 (Ex. 9); Dkt. 25-1 at 56-57 (Ex. G) ).

The Court notes that it is undisputed that Plaintiff admitted to the Board he had erred in filling out the financial disclosure form. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 14-6).

However, because the Court concludes that the claimed violation of GML \u00a7 813 does not rise to the level of a due process violation, the Court does not need to resolve the issue of what impact, if any, the repeal of GML \u00a7 813 had on its purported incorporation by reference into Local Law 10-1989.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Plaintiff argues in his post-argument submission that should the Court deny his motion for summary judgment, it should permit the parties to engage in discovery and allow Plaintiff an opportunity to amend his pleading to assert an equal protection claim. (Dkt. 45 at 7). As to discovery, the record before the Court is sufficient to conclude that summary judgment is appropriate at this stage of the proceedings. Furthermore, Plaintiff's belated request to amend the complaint is procedurally defective under the Local Rules of Civil Procedure.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wi3, Inc. v.
