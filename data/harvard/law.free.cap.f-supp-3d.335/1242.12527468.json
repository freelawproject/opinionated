INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This trademark action involves One Ten Student Living and Campus Quarters, which are competing off-campus student housing facilities located in close vicinity to each other and owned and operated by Plaintiff ZP No. 314, LLC (hereinafter \"Plaintiff\" or \"ZP\") and the Defendants, respectively. ZP is a limited liability company and owner of One Ten Student Living (\"One Ten\"), which provides student housing and related services to local college students. (Doc. 60 at 4; Doc. 106 at 1). The One Ten facility is located at 110 Long Street, in Mobile, Alabama, and its website is www.liveoneten.com. (Doc. 60 at 4; Doc. 106-4 at 43-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant ILM Capital, LLC (\"ILM Capital\") is a real estate investment firm that owns the Campus Quarters facility. (Doc. 60 at 2; Doc. 66 at 2; Doc. 115 at 5). The Campus Quarters facility is also located in Mobile, Alabama, and its website is www.campusquarters.com. (Doc. 66 at 4; Doc. 106 at 1; Doc. 115 at 5-6). Defendant Mobile CQ Student Housing, LLC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (\"Mobile CQ\") owns the real property on which Campus Quarters is located. (Doc. 60 at 2; Doc. 66 at 4; Doc. 115 at 5). Defendant ILM Management, LLC (\"ILM Management\") manages Mobile CQ. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant WE Communities, LLC (\"WE Communities\") is a property management company that has managed Campus Quarters since approximately May 2016. (Doc. 60 at 2; Doc. 66 at 4; Doc. 115 at 5). Defendant Mary Schaffer-Rutherford (\"Rutherford\") is a former employee of WE Communities who managed Campus Quarters for approximately seven months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Michael Wheeler (\"Wheeler\") is the manager, CEO, and sole member of ILM Capital, ILM Management, and WE Communities.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The events giving rise to the instant cause of action center around eight domain names purchased by Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ZP contends that, through the registration and/or use of domain names that are confusingly similar to its marks, Defendants have willfully infringed on its marks, have acted as cybersquatters by intending to profit from the goodwill associated with ZP's marks, and have unfairly competed with ZP. In its amended complaint, ZP has alleged cybersquatting in violation of the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; unfair competition, contributory unfair competition, and vicarious unfair competition in violation of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; common law unfair competition; and unfair competition and trademark infringement in violation of Alabama Code Section 8-12-16 and state common law.

RELEVANT UNDISPUTED FACTS\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff ZP avers that it adopted the name \"One Ten\" for its student housing facility and began using the \"One Ten\" mark in interstate commerce as early as October 28, 2015. (Docs. 106 at 2; 106-1 at 3). Indeed, ZP used the One Ten mark in connection with the signing of a Management Agreement with Asset Campus Housing (\"ACH\"), the company that manages One Ten, and it circulated the agreement (which it named the \"One Ten Mgmt Agmt FE\") via email with a subject line titled \"One Ten PMA\" on October 29, 2015. (Doc. 106-3 at 4; Doc. 106-4 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 3, 2015, ZP registered the domain name \"liveoneten.com\" with the registrar GoDaddy.com. (Doc. 106 at 2; Doc. 106-1 at 3; Doc. 106-4 at 68-69). By February 26, 2016, ZP was using the domain name, \"liveoneten.com\" to market One Ten on ZDC's then-existing website. (Doc. 106 at 2; Doc. 106-1 at 3; Doc. 106-6 at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In late 2015, Defendant ILM Capital learned that ZDC would be building a new\n   student housing facility, and in April 2016, learned that the facility would be named \"One Ten.\" (Doc. 95 at 8; Doc. 98-1 at 5; Doc. 115 at 6). On April 12, 2016, Defendant ILM's general counsel accessed ZDC's website to view One Ten's advertisement. (Doc. 106 at 3; Doc. 106-2 at 9-10; Doc. 106-5 at 32; Doc. 106-6 at 2-3). The following month, Defendants ILM and Hawrylak began registering domain names that incorporated the words \"one ten.\" Specifically, on May 11, 2016, Defendant Hawrylak, acting on behalf of ILM Capital, registered the following domain names through third party domain name registar Go.Daddy.Com, LLC: \"onetenlive.com,\" \"liveontenmobile.com,\" \"liveone10.com,\" \"onetenstudentliving.com,\" and \"onetenliving.com\", which are collectively referenced as the \"May 11 domains.\" (Doc. 95 at 8; Doc. 98-1 at 5-6; Doc. 106 at 3; Doc. 106-2 at 5-6, 8; Doc. 106-5 at 20-24, 34; Doc. 106-7 at 5-6; Doc. 115 at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 26, 2016, the website for One Ten, www.liveoneten.com, went live. (Docs. 60 at 4; 66 at 3; 106 at 4; 106-3 at 3-4). The next day, May 27, 2016, Hawrylak registered three additional domain names, namely: \"onetenusa.com,\" \"liveonetenapartments.com,\" and \"liveonetenmobile.com\", which are collectively referenced as the \"May 27 domains.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 95 at 9; Doc. 98-1 at 7; 106 at 3; Doc. 106-2 at 5-6, 8; 106-5 at 20-24, 34; Doc. 106-7 at 5-6; Doc. 115 at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In May 2016, ZP created social media pages for One Ten and began making posts on those sites. (Doc. 106 at 3; Doc. 106-3 at 3-4; Doc. 106-4 at 43). On May 28, 2016, and June 3, 2016, within days of its first social media posts and its website going live, ZP was contacted by its first prospective tenants. (Doc. 106 at 4-5; Doc. 106-4 at 63-65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 14, 2016, Defendants began redirecting users of the May 11 domains to their own website, \"campusquarters.com\", such that, if a user typed in one of the May 11 domains into an internet browser, the user would be redirected to the website for Campus Quarters. (Doc. 95 at 8-11; Doc. 98-1 at 5-7; Doc. 106 at 5; Doc. 106-2 at 10-11; Doc. 115 at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 18, 2016, online leasing became available for One Ten, but student occupancy did not occur until a year later in August 2017. (Doc. 66 at 3, 83 at 7, 54-55; Doc. 89 at 2, 5; Doc. 115 at 6). On September 19, 2016, ZP learned that Defendants were redirecting users of one of the May 11 domains, namely \"onetenstudentliving.com,\" to the Campus Quarters website.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 106 at 7). On the same day, a representative from ACH, which manages One Ten for ZP, sent an email to Defendant Hawrylak requesting that Defendants end the redirection of the domain name. (Doc. 106 at 7; Doc. 106-5 at 18, 51-52). Hawrylak forwarded the email to an ILM representative asking for guidance on how to respond to the request, and the ILM representative advised Hawrylak, \"Tell him FU!\" (Doc. 106 at 7; Doc. 106-5 at 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 19, 2016, ZP's in-house counsel sent Defendants cease and desist letters, demanding that Defendants: \"(i) transfer any and all rights in and to the onetenstudentliving.com domain name to ZP NO. 314, LLC; (ii) cease and desist\n   from any and all use of the onetenstudentliving.com domain name; and (iii) cease and desist from any and all use of ZP NO. 314, LLC's name and the One Ten name.\" (Doc. 60 at 7; 66 at 7; Doc. 106 at 7-8; Doc. 106-1 at 3, 31-42; Doc. 106-5 at 25-29; Doc. 106-13 at 2-3). On September 20, 2016, after receiving the cease and desist letter dated September 19, 2016, Defendants ceased the redirection of all May 11 domains. (Doc. 83 at 9; Doc. 87-12 at 34-38; Doc. 95 at 12; 115 at 8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ZP sent a second cease and desist letter to Defendants on September 23, 2016. (Doc. 60 at 7; Doc. 66 at 7; Doc. 106 at 8; Doc. 106-5 at 3-4; Doc. 106-13 at 3, 6-7). The September 23 letter included a demand that Defendants relinquish and transfer the \"onetenstudentliving.com\" domain name to ZP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants declined to do so. (Doc. 112).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ZP filed the instant action on October 6, 2016. (Docs. 1). Subsequent thereto, on December 5, 2016, ZP applied with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") for registration of the trademark \"One Ten Student Living\". (Doc. 60 at 4; Doc. 66 at 3). With no objection from Defendants, the USPTO issued ZP a certificate of registration for the \"One Ten Student Living\" mark on July 25, 2017. (Doc. 60 at 5; Doc. 60-1; Doc. 66 at 3; Doc. 106 at 10; Doc. 106-17). Additionally, on March 16, 2017, ZP applied to register the trademark \"One Ten\" with USPTO. The application was approved on June 9, 2017 and publication occurred on October 17, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 60 at 5; Doc. 60-2; Doc. 106 at 10; Doc. 106-17). The Alabama Secretary of State issued certificates of registration for the marks on March 23, 2017. (Doc. 60 at 5; Doc. 60-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As noted,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , this action was instituted on October 6, 2016, when ZP filed its initial complaint against ILM Capital, WE Communities, Rutherford, and Mobile CQ. (Doc. 1). On November 3, 2016, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and/or for a more definite statement. (Docs. 9, 10). On February 21, 2017, ZP timely filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. (Doc. 32). In its motion, ZP requested leave to add three additional Defendants - Wheeler, Hawrylak, and ILM Mobile Management - as well as additional claims against all Defendants based on vicarious and contributory liability. On March 30, 2017, the Court granted ZP's unopposed motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint and denied as moot Defendants' motion to dismiss and/or for a More Definite Statement. (Doc. 39). Accordingly, ZP filed its first amended complaint on March 30, 2017, and Defendants filed their answers on April 13, 2017, April 27, 2017, May 2, 2017, and June 6, 2017. (Docs. 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On August 31, 2017, ZP filed a second motion to amend its complaint. (Doc. 55). In its motion, ZP requested leave to correct the name of a domain name that was inadvertently misidentified in its first amended complaint, in addition to adding facts related to its claims, elect statutory damages on its cybersquatting claims, and\n   withdraw its trademark dilution claims. With no opposition from Defendants, ZP's request to file a second amended complaint was granted. The second amended complaint was filed on September 19, 2017, and Defendants' answer was filed on October 3, 2017. (Doc. 60; Doc. 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , this action is now before the Court on the parties' respective motions for summary judgment and supporting briefs. The motions have been fully briefed, and are now ripe for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

(Doc. 106 at 11-24). According to ZP, its marks are distinctive, and Defendants registered and used domain names that are confusingly similar to ZP's distinctive marks in order to promote their own competing commercial interests and to divert internet users searching for ZP's website to Defendants' website, with the admitted intent to redirect and confuse the public and profit from the goodwill associated with ZP's distinctive marks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants, on the other hand, assert that because it is undisputed that their alleged misconduct occurred in May 2016, and because ZP had not acquired trademark rights in its marks prior to that time, ZP cannot prevail on its cybersquatting claim. Further, according to Defendants, Plaintiff's claims fail as a matter of law because Plaintiff's marks are merely \"descriptive,\" and they had not acquired secondary meaning as a matter of law prior to Defendant's alleged misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court begins its analysis with Count IV, Plaintiff's claim under the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (\"ACPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A). The ACPA was enacted to prevent cybersquatting, which the Eleventh Circuit has described as \"essentially extortion.\"\n   <em>\n    Jysk Bed'N Linen v.

The ACPA provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (1)(A) A person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of a mark, including a personal name which is protected as a mark under this section, if, without regard to the goods or services of the parties, that person -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (i) has a bad faith intent to profit from that mark, including a personal name which is protected as a mark under this section; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (ii) registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (I) in the case of a mark that is distinctive at the time of registration of the domain name, is identical or confusingly similar to that mark[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A).

The undisputed evidence shows that ZP applied for registration of the One Ten Student Living and One Ten marks in December 2016 and March 2017, respectively, and that the applications were accepted by, and registration obtained from, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on July 25, 2017 and October 17, 2017. Accordingly, any rebuttable presumption based on registration of the marks could apply only to Defendants' alleged violations occurring\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   July 25, 2017, when the first mark was registered. Defendants' alleged violations occurring\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   July 25, 2017 (which would include Defendants' May 2016 registration of the domain names, Defendants' June through September 2016 redirection of the websites, and Defendants' March 14, 2017 re-registration of the domain names) would\n   not be subject to a rebuttable presumption of distinctiveness based on registration of the marks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Unique Sports\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"884589\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/403/1229/#p1236\">\n    403 F.Supp.2d at 1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In order to proceed with its ACPA claims against Defendants (or prevail on its motion for summary judgment) based on violations occurring\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   July 25, 2017, ZP must show that the One Ten marks had acquired secondary meaning before each of the alleged violations. Applying the factors set forth above, the Court finds that ZP has failed to show that the One Ten marks had acquired secondary meaning\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   July 25, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, as discussed, a party may make a prima facie showing of acquired secondary meaning/distinctiveness \"by showing that the name has been used in connection with the proprietor's goods or service continuously and substantially exclusively for five years.\"\n   <em>\n    Welding Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3328847\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/1351/#p1357\">\n    509 F.3d at 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the undisputed evidence in the instant case shows that the earliest date on which ZP may argue that the marks were \"continuously and substantially exclusively\" in use is October 2015, one year before this action was instituted and approximately six months before Defendants registered the May 11 domains, which is substantially less than the five-year mark required by the Eleventh Circuit to make a prima facie showing.\n   <em>\n    Welding Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3328847\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/1351/#p1357\">\n    509 F.3d at 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

With regard to the length and manner of ZP's use of the marks, as noted,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the earliest date on which ZP arguably used the marks is October 2015, some six to seven months prior to Defendants' registration of the May 11 and May 27 domain names.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In October 2015, ZP made preparations to use the marks by determining that its housing facility would be named One Ten Student Living, by signing a management agreement with ACH utilizing the name, and by updating the ZDC Company Profile to include the facility by name. (Doc. 106 at 2; Doc. 106-1 at 3, 24; Doc. 106-3 at 4; Doc. 106-4 at 2). Between December 2015 and February 2016, ZP sent ZDC's Company Profile, which included one mention of the newly-styled One Ten Student Living, to approximately twenty-seven (27) vendors, lenders, and realtors throughout the country. (Doc. 106 at 2; Doc. 106-3 at 4; Doc. 106-4 at 2, 19-22, 24-25, 27-45). ZP registered its domain name, \"liveoneten.com,\" on December 3, 2015 (Doc. 106 at 2; Doc. 106-1 at 3; Doc. 106-4 at 68-69) and created a Twitter page for One Ten Student Living on May 19 2016, some eight days after Defendants' purchase of the May 11 domain names. (Docs. 106 at 3; 106-3 at 3-4; 106-4 at 43). These actions by ZP, all taken in the six to seven months preceding Defendants' registration of the domain names, weigh against a determination that the marks had acquired secondary meaning by May 11 or 27, 2016, or by June 14, 2016, the date on which Defendants began redirecting the May 11 domains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Investacorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1801792\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/931/1519/#p1522\">\n    931 F.2d at 1525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that there was no significance in an appellant's use of their mark \"other than appellant merely \"display[ing] its service mark on nearly all of its transactional documents.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   An examination of the marks' use during the period leading to the March 14, 2017, re-registration of the domain names is similarly unavailing. At the time that the Defendants re-registered the domain names on March 2017, in addition to the aforementioned actions, ZP had applied for federal registration of the One Ten Student Living mark in the Principal Register of the USPTO, but that registration had not been approved and, in any event, would not support a finding of acquired secondary meaning, as it occurred after the initial 2016 registrations, 2016 redirection, and March 2017 re-registration of the domains. Therefore, the length and manner of the marks' use weigh against a finding that ZP's marks had acquired secondary meaning either at the time of Defendants' May 2016 domain registrations, June 2016 through September 2016 redirection, or the March 2017 re-registration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 525-525 (finding that secondary meaning did not attach even though the plaintiff had used the mark for five years prior to defendant's use of the mark);\n   <em>\n    Donut Joe's, Inc. v.

(Doc. 85 at 63-67). In total, between December 2015 and December 2016, ZP spent $43,430.05 on advertising and promotions for One Ten, including $17,545.71 spent during the period in which the May 11 domains were redirected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The record reflects that the domain name, \"liveoneten.com,\" was registered on behalf of ZP on December 3, 2015, and that, by February 26, 2016, ZP had begun using the domain name to market One Ten Student Living on ZDC's then-existing website, such that internet users could see the advertisement for the housing facility. (Docs. 106 at 2; 106-1 at 3; 106-4 at 68-69; 106-6 at 2-3). This meager showing is not sufficient to establish that the marks had acquired secondary meaning by May 11, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Further, in determining whether secondary meaning had attached to the marks by March 2017, the Court notes that the website for One Ten went live on May 26, 2016 (Doc. 106 at 3; Doc. 106-3 at 3-4; Doc. 106-4 at 43); that ZP began its first open marketing efforts during the week of September 13, 2016 (Doc. 83 at 7; Doc. 95 at 59; Doc. 94-3 at 3; Doc. 115 at 6); and that ZP advertised the grand opening for One Ten Student Living as occurring on November 10, 2016 (Doc. 87-9 at 2-3; Doc. 115 at 6-7). Again, the amount of money spent by ZP on marketing and promotion of the marks, coupled with the marketing activities undertaken by ZP, support a finding that secondary meaning had not attached at the time of the alleged May 2016 or March 2017 violations.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Investacorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1801792\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/931/1519/#p1522\">\n    931 F.2d at 1519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the second factor weighed against secondary meaning when appellant spent approximately one hundred dollars per month on advertising)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conagra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"607742\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/743/1508/#p1513\">\n    743 F.2d at 1513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the second factor of this analysis supported a finding of secondary\n   meaning in favor of defendant when they spent over $400,000 per year on marketing and promotion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Having found that the first two factors support a finding that secondary meaning had not attached to ZP's marks by either May 2016 or March 2017, the analysis becomes even less favorable to ZP when considering the final two factors. For instance, there is little evidence in terms of the intentional efforts ZP made to promote a connection in the public's mind between the marks and the One Ten Student Living housing facility. ZP made social media posts to its Facebook and Instagram accounts on May 25 and 26, 2016, days after Defendants purchased the first domains on May 11, 2016. Further, as noted,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , in the months leading to the March 2017 re-registration of the domains, ZP engaged in certain marketing efforts in September 2016 and November 2016. However, these actions, without more, are insufficient to support a finding that secondary meaning had attached to the marks prior to Defendants' alleged violations from May 2016 to March 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, \"[w]hether the public actually identifies the name with plaintiff is the 'most telling factor' when determining whether a mark has acquired a secondary meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Ala.

The evidence of the length and manner of the use of the marks weighs against a finding of secondary meaning, and there is little evidence to establish the remaining factors. Thus, ZP has not met its heavy burden of establishing that the marks had acquired secondary meaning by May 11, 2016, May 27, 2016, June 14 through September 20, 2016, or March 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Accordingly, ZP's motion for summary judgment as to its cybersquatting claim (Count IV) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to the alleged violations occurring\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   July 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gulf Coast\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684904\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/508/1157/#p1164\">\n    508 F.Supp.2d at 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying plaintiff's motion for summary judgment when the mark at issue had been used for eight years; plaintiff spent over $7 million on advertisements and promotions; and plaintiff's actions were consciously taken to promote a connection between its service and its mark, but plaintiff failed to provide quantifiable data on whether the public actually identified its mark with its service).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Conversely, having found that the undisputed evidence establishes that ZP's marks lacked acquired secondary meaning/distinctiveness as a matter of law before July 2017, Defendants' motions for summary judgment on ZP's cybersquatting claim (Count IV) based on violations occurring\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   July 2017 are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

ZP argues that the fact that Defendants filed a \"notice\" of its re-registration of the domain names with the Court does not diminish the viability of its ACPA claim. (Doc. 113). The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the re-registration of domain names is actionable under the ACPA.

(Doc. 112). While Defendants maintain that the 2018 re-registration was intended to maintain the \"status quo\" during the pendency of this action, they have cited no case law that would support the proposition that the 2018 re-registration should not be considered actionable under the ACPA.

Also, onetenstudentliving.com completely incorporates the One Ten Student Living mark (for which ZP had attained registration by the time of Defendants' 2018 re-registration of the domain names). For one of the infringing domain names, Defendants merely substituted the word \"Ten\" for the number 10.

Second, the extent to which Defendants' domain names consist of its legal name or one that it commonly uses, it is uncontested that the phrases \"One Ten\" and \"One Ten Student Living\" are not associated with Defendants' legal name or one which it commonly uses. Third, there is no evidence that Defendants have previously used the domain names for the bona fide offering of goods or services. Fourth, there is no evidence that Defendants made any noncommercial or fair use of the marks. Fifth, Defendants did intend to divert internet users from ZP's site to its own by redirecting the May 11 domains, which are confusingly similar to ZP's marks, to the Campus Quarters website. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 106-5 at 54-58). Sixth, there is no evidence that Defendants offered to transfer, sell, or otherwise assign the domain names to Plaintiff or others for financial gain. ZP relies on Defendants' internal response of, \"Tel him FU!\" when ZP made its pre-suit demand to transfer the domain name prior to litigation. However, this evidence suggests hostility and bad faith, but does not reasonably suggest an intent to profit. Further, to the extent that ZP relies on communications made during settlement negotiations in support of this factor (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   doc. 106 at 19), the Federal Rules of Evidence clearly preclude the consideration of such communications for the purpose of providing the validity or invalidity of a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 408(a). Seventh, there has been no affirmative evidence establishing that Defendants used material and misleading false contact information when registering the domain names. While ZP points to Defendants' registration of the domain names using a privacy service as evidence of using false and misleading contact information (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   doc. 106 at 19, 21, 28), \"[u]se of a privacy protection service is not the same thing as providing false or misleading contact information.\"\n   <em>\n    Career Agents Network, Inc. v. careeragentsnetwork. biz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20743053\">\n    2010 WL 743053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 26, 2010). Eighth, in May 2018, Defendants re-registered eight domain names that they knew were confusingly similar to ZP's marks. Finally, as noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , ZP's marks were distinctive on the dates of the 2018 re-registrations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In addition to the factors enumerated above, the undersigned looks to the unique\n   circumstances of this case. The consideration of whether there has been a violation of the ACPA is limited to the very attenuated issue of whether a violation occurred when Defendants re-registered the domain names on May 11 and 27, 2018. The\n   <em>\n    Southern Grouts\n   </em>\n   court spoke directly to this issue. There, the Eleventh Circuit found that a plaintiff failed to establish a bad faith intent to profit when one of the instances on which the plaintiff relied included the fact that the defendant maintained control of the domain name at issue, including re-registering it after a cease-and-desist letter issued and again after the action was instituted.\n   <em>\n    Southern Grouts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4035635\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1235/#p1246\">\n    575 F.3d at 1245-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On this issue, ZP's evidence includes Defendants' response to one of its many demands that Defendants transfer the domain names to ZP, including the \"onetenstudentliving.com\" domain, to which Defendants responded: \"[i]n brief, that domain name is reserved for\n   <em>\n    potential future use in business operations.\n   </em>\n   \" (Doc. 106-13 at 21) (emphasis added). While the Court agrees with Defendants that its action in holding onto the domain names to prevent ZP from using them may not, alone, evince an intent to profit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Southern Grouts\n   </em>\n   , when taken together with the other circumstances of this case, including the fact that the marks were registered with the USPTO by July/October 2017; that Defendants had a history of redirecting the domains to its own website (prior to the marks' registration) for the admitted purpose of \"\n   <em>\n    achiev[ing] more traffic\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    for the Campus Quarters website\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 95 at 31); and the fact that Defendants intended to hold onto the domain names for\n   <em>\n    potential future use in their business operations\n   </em>\n   , such could reasonably suggest a bad faith intent to profit from the 2018 re-registration of the domain. Defendants' contradictory assertion that their only motive in re-registering the domain names in 2018 was to maintain the status quo during the pendency of this litigation simply places this issue in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In sum, at this juncture, the undersigned cannot find, as a matter of law, that Defendants did not act with a bad faith intent to profit with regard to the May 2018 re-registration of the domain names. Thus, there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to the element of bad faith intent to profit that prevents the issuance of summary judgment on this issue. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   both ZP's and Defendants' motions for summary judgment on ZP's cybersquatting claim (Count IV) as to any alleged violations occurring\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   July 2017 (specifically including, Defendants' May 11 and 27, 2018, re-registration of the domain names).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Unfair Competition Claims Under the Lanham Act and Based on Federal Common Law (Counts I, V)\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In the second amended complaint, Plaintiff also asserts claims for unfair competition under the Lanham Act (Count I) and unfair competition based on federal common law (Count V).

Thus, the legal standard for both common law and statutory unfair competition is essentially the same, such that resolution of the former will resolve the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   First, having previously found, as a matter of law, that Defendants' domain names at issue are confusingly similar to ZP's marks, that question is settled. Second, with respect to ZP's prior rights to the marks, the undersigned has previously found, as a matter of law, that the marks did not acquire secondary meaning\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   July 2017. Accordingly, ZP had no protectible interest in the marks under the Lanham Act or federal common law\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   July 2017. As a result, ZP's motion for summary judgment on its Lanham Act and federal common law unfair competition claims (Counts I and V) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to any alleged violations by Defendants occurring\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   July 2017. For the same reason, Defendants' motions for summary judgment on ZP's Lanham Act and federal common law unfair competition claims (Counts I and V) are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to any alleged violations by Defendants occurring\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   July 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   On the other hand, the Court has also found, as a matter of law, that ZP's marks acquired secondary meaning\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   they were registered with the USPTO in July and October 2017 and that ZP had a protectible interest in the marks at the time of Defendants' May 2018 re-registration of the domain names. The question remains, however, whether Defendants' re-registration of the domain names in May 2018 constituted use of ZP's marks \"in commerce.\" On that question, the Court finds that reasonable minds could differ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   As previously discussed, the evidence shows that, in May 2016, Defendants registered eight domain names on the Internet that the Court has found herein, as a matter of law, are identical or confusingly similar to the marks at issue in this case. Thereafter, from June to September 2016, Defendants redirected Internet users of five of those domain name websites to their own website for the express purpose of \"\n   <em>\n    achiev[ing] more traffic for the Campus Quarters website.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 95 at 31). Then, on October 7, 2016, Defendants refused to transfer the \"onetenstudentliving.com\" domain to ZP, stating that they were keeping it \"for\n   <em>\n    potential future use in business operations.\n   </em>\n   \" (Doc. 106-13 at 21) (emphasis added). Later, with full knowledge that ZP, their competitor, had obtained registration of the \"One Ten Student Living\" and \"One Ten\" marks in July and October 2017 with the USPTO, Defendants continued to re-register the domain names on the Internet in May 2018. This evidence arguably suggests that Defendants were using the confusingly similar domain names \"in commerce\" in May 2018 when they re-registered the domain name websites on the Internet. To the extent that Defendants assert that they merely \"parked\" the websites on the Internet after they ceased redirecting users to their website in September 2016, the undersigned finds that their actions in parking the names, and thereby preventing ZP's commercial use of the names, could arguably\n   constitute use \"in commerce,\" thus creating a genuine issue of material fact on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Court also notes that Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Juno Online Servs. v.

Ill. 1997), to support their position that \"registering or holding onto [sic] a domain name, without more, is not use in commerce.\" (Doc. 115 at 27). However, as noted by a sister court, \"a closer reading of\n   <em>\n    Juno\n   </em>\n   reveals that the court there addressed a situation where the 'only factual allegation in the complaint relating to 'use' was that the defendant\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have been 'warehousing the domain name, and where the plaintiff conceded that the defendant had never used the domain name in connection with its business.' \"\n   <em>\n    Southern Grouts &amp; Mortars, Inc. v. 3M Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011333151\">\n    2008 WL 11333151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3 (S.D.

That is a far cry from the facts of this case which include undisputed use of the domain name websites, namely, Defendants' redirection for several months in 2016 of five of the domain name websites to its own website, and an expressed intent to hold onto the websites for additional potential future use in commerce. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Juno\n   </em>\n   is distinct from the instant matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Having undertaken a thorough analysis of whether the May 2018 re-registration of the domains constitutes use in commerce for purposes of federal common law and the Lanham Act, the undersigned finds that there is sufficient disagreement that cannot be resolved at the summary judgment phase. That is, there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the 2018 re-registration of the domains constitutes a use \"in commerce\" under the Lanham Act and federal common law. Accordingly, both ZP's and Defendants' cross-motions for summary judgment on Plaintiff's Lanham Act and federal common law claims (Counts I and V) alleging violations by Defendants\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   July 2017 are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     State Law Claims (Count VI)\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In the second amended complaint, ZP asserts that Defendants are liable for trademark infringement and unfair competition under Alabama Code \u00a7 8-12-1,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and Alabama common law. (Doc. 60 at 12-14; Doc. 106 at 26). In support of its motion for summary judgment on these state law claims, ZP argues that its \"proof of trademark infringement and unfair competition by Defendants under the Lanham Act also suffices to prove its claims under the statutory and common law of Alabama.\" (Doc. 106 at 26). In opposition to ZP's motion and in support of their own counter-motions for summary judgment, Defendants argue that ZP's state law claims fail because ZP had no protectible rights in the marks. Also, according to Defendants, there was no likelihood of confusion between the domain names and the marks, and Defendants did not \"use\" the marks (as that term is contemplated in the Alabama Trademark Act)\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   September 20, 2016, when Defendants ceased redirecting users of the domain names to its own website.

Therefore, any use of the marks by Defendants before they were registered with the Alabama Secretary of State in March 2017 is not covered by the Act. Moreover, for the same reasons discussed with respect to ZP's cybersquatting and Lanham Act claims, the Court finds that ZP did not have a protectible interest in the marks under Alabama common law prior to their registration with the Alabama Secretary of State in March 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, ZP's state law trademark infringement claims (both statutory and common law) arising out of Defendants' use of the marks\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   March 2017 fail as a matter of law.

(Doc. 106 at 28-29). In addition, ZP argues that Defendants ILM Mobile Management LLC, We Communities LLC, Mobile CQ Student Housing LLC, and Mary Schaffer-Rutherford operated the Campus Quarters facility and actively participated in the use of the infringing domain names. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In opposition to ZP's motion and in support of their own counter-motions for summary judgment, Defendants argue that, \"[b]ecause none of the Defendants bear primary liability for unfair competition or trademark infringement, no Defendant can be secondarily liable for such conduct.\" (Doc. 115 at 29). In addition, Defendants dispute the degree of involvement of each of the Defendants in the decisions to register the domain names initially, to redirect the domain websites, and then to continue re-registering domain names. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court has previously found that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Defendants' re-registration of the domain names in 2018 violated ZP's rights in the One Ten and One Ten Student Living marks. The Court further finds that, with the exception of Defendant Mary Schaffer-Rutherford, the evidence regarding each Defendant's level of direct participation is in dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Having found as a matter of law that ZP had no protectible interest in the marks under federal or state law until the registration of the marks with the Alabama Secretary of State on March 23, 2017, and with the USPTO in July and October 2017, all claims of vicarious and contributory liability based on conduct occurring\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   those dates \"must fail as a matter of course.\"\n   <em>\n    Midlothian Lab.\n   </em>\n   , 509 F.Supp.2d at 1083. Therefore, ZP's motion for summary judgment as to its claims of vicarious and contributory liability based on Defendants' conduct occurring\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   March 23, 2017 (which would include the 2016 initial registration of the domain names, the 2016 redirection of the domain names, and the March 14, 2017, re-registration of the domain names) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , and Defendants' motions for summary judgment on said claims are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   However, because there are genuine issues of material fact as to (1) whether\n   Defendants' re-registration of the domain names in 2018 violated ZP's rights in the One Ten and One Ten Student Living marks under federal or state law, and (2) the level of involvement of each Defendant, aside from Defendant Mary Schaffer-Rutherford, in that conduct, both ZP's and Defendants' motions for summary judgment on ZP's claims for contributory and vicarious liability occurring\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   March 23, 2017 are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED,\n   </strong>\n   except that Defendant's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Defendant Mary Schaffer-Rutherford.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Defendant Rutherford's Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In their motions for summary judgment, Defendants universally dispute ZP's claims that any conduct in registering, redirecting, and re-registering the domain names at issue violated state or federal trademark or unfair competition law. In addition, Defendants divide themselves into groups based on the level of participation they are alleged to have had in the misconduct alleged in the second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   First, Defendants ILM Capital, Michael Wheeler, and Andrew Hawrylak refer to themselves as the \"ILM Defendants.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 95 at 3). These Defendants do not deny direct involvement in the registration, redirection, and re-registration of the domain names at issue (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), although the exact nature and extent of their involvement in the alleged conduct is not clear. In any event, these Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of non-involvement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Defendants ILM Management, WE Communities, and Mobile CQ filed a separate motion for summary judgment, essentially arguing that any actions taken with regard to the domain names at issue were taken by the ILM Defendants (ILM Capital, Wheeler, and Hawrylak) and that there is no evidence that Defendants ILM Management, WE Communities, and Mobile CQ had any relevant participation in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 96 at 3, 11). Defendants concede, however, that Defendant Wheeler is the manager and sole member of ILM Management, WE Communities, and Mobile CQ and had the power to control the affairs of those entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). In addition, ZP points out that the Campus Quarters property is owned by Mobile CQ, which is managed by ILM Management, which is in turn managed and owned by Wheeler, whose GoDaddy account\n   Hawrylak used to register the infringing domain names. (Doc. 121 at 32). Given the interrelated nature of the corporate entities involved and Defendant Wheeler's ownership/control over these entities, their specific role in the alleged infringing conduct murky at best. Therefore, summary judgment for Defendants ILM Management, WE Communities, and Mobile CQ is unwarranted at this stage of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   With respect to Defendant Rutherford, she too has filed a separate motion for summary judgment and argues that she was not involved in any conduct that would impose liability in this case. (Doc. 97 at 1). The Court finds that the undisputed evidence relating to Defendant Rutherford's involvement is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. The undisputed evidence shows that Defendant Rutherford was employed by WE Communities, as the general manager of Campus Quarters, between May and November 2016. (Doc. 97 at 2). The GoDaddy Account at issue was not in her name; she had no access to or control over the account; and her name does not appear anywhere in the documents produced by third parties relating to the GoDaddy Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In addition, she was not involved in the redirection of the domain names, and she no longer has any relationship, affiliation, or association with Campus Quarters (or any of the Defendants in this action). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Indeed, there appears to be no evidence of direct involvement by Rutherford in the registration, redirection, or re-registration of the domain names at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   ZP responds that Rutherford worked for WE Communities, which managed the Campus Quarters facility and is managed by Wheeler, and that \"she was feeding Hawrylak information about the One Ten and its electronic marketing efforts during the time he was registering the infringing Domain Names.\" (Doc. 121 at 33). ZP also points out that, on May 26, 2018, Rutherford sent an email to Hawrylak to notify him of One Ten's Instagram account and that One Ten's website had an image reflecting the appearance of the development. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Assuming these facts to be true, they do not evidence personal involvement by Rutherford in the registering, redirection, or re-registration of the domain names at issue. At best, they reflect that Rutherford was merely keeping an eye on her employer's competition. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendant Rutherford is entitled summary judgment on all claims alleged against her in the second amended complaint. Accordingly, Defendant Rutherford's motion for summary judgment is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
