(Dkt. 1). This Court has jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Presently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Dkt. 12; Dkt. 16). For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiff's motion (Dkt. 12) is granted in part, the Commissioner's motion (Dkt. 16) is denied, and the matter is remanded to the Commissioner for further administrative proceedings consistent with this Decision and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff initially filed an application for SSI on March 29, 2007.

(Dkt. 8-6 at 2-3). Plaintiff's application was initially denied on July 12, 2011. (Dkt. 8-4 at 2-5). At Plaintiff's request, a hearing on his claim was held before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\"), and on September 26, 2012, the ALJ issued an unfavorable decision. (Dkt. 8-2 at 12-28). The Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review on December 11, 2013 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4), and an action was commenced in this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civil Action No. 6:14-CV-06061.

The claimant also retains the ability to understand and follow simple instructions and directions; can perform simple tasks with supervision and independently; can maintain attention/concentration for simple tasks; can regularly attend to a routine and maintain a schedule; can relate to and interact with others to the extent necessary to carry out simple tasks, but should avoid work requiring more complex interaction or joint efforts with others to achieve work goals and should not have interaction with the public; and can handle reasonable levels of simple work-related stress in that he can make simple decisions directly related to the completion of his tasks, work in a position where he is not responsible for the work of others, and in work that involves little change in daily routine, work duties, or processes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 183). Plaintiff did have slight difficulty getting on and off the examination table and walking on his heels and toes, and was able to squat to only 50% of full. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff had slight discomfort in his knees bilaterally, but exhibited a full range of motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 184). Based on this examination, Dr. Toor opined that Plaintiff had \"moderate\" limitations in standing, walking, sitting, bending, lifting, pushing, and pulling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 185).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   More than two years after Dr. Toor's examination, in September 2013, Plaintiff twisted his left knee and fell. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-13 at 237). Plaintiff was determined to have a tear of the medial cartilage or meniscus of his left knee and underwent a left knee arthroscopy on October 17, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108-110). Plaintiff continued to suffer left knee pain in 2013 and 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 8-14 at 47, 66). In July 2014, he reported that he had experienced only a 50% improvement in his symptoms since his surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In August 2014, Plaintiff was instructed to begin wearing a left knee brace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78). Plaintiff's treating physician's assistant noted that Plaintiff might require a total knee replacement if his symptom continued to worsen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In November 2015, Plaintiff again complained of significant left knee pain and asked his treatment providers about possible options to alleviate it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127). An x-ray of Plaintiff's left knee was taken and showed tricompartmental joint disease, most advanced in the medial compartment, and a small effusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108). On December 20, 2015, Plaintiff reported to his physician that his knee pain continued to worsen and that he was experiencing swelling, occasional popping, and clicking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 151). On examination, Plaintiff had a limited range of motion in his left knee, with positive pain and crepitus on patellofemoral grind testing and positive pain over the patellar tendon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152). Plaintiff declined further conservative care and expressed interest in a second arthroscopy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A second arthroscopy was performed on Plaintiff's left knee on January 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 207-208). Plaintiff's post-operative diagnoses were chondral defect medial femoral condyle, posterior horn root tear lateral meniscus, lateral osteophyte in notch causing impingement, and patellofemoral degenerative changes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 207). In February 2016, Plaintiff reported he was continuing to experience knee pain post-surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In assessing Plaintiff's RFC, the ALJ accorded \"significant weight\" to Dr. Toor's 2011 opinion, stating that it was \"generally supported by the objective medical evidence[.]\" (Dkt. 8-8 at 30). The ALJ acknowledged that there had been a \"worsening of [Plaintiff's] left knee disorder following an injury in September 2013,\" but concluded that \"greater exertional and non-exertional limitations [than identified by Dr. Toor] are not supported by the objective clinical and laboratory findings from various treating and examining sources.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court finds the ALJ's consideration of Plaintiff's knee impairment unsupported by substantial evidence. First, Dr. Toor's opinion, which was rendered nearly five years before the ALJ's decision and before Plaintiff's September 2013 knee injury and two subsequent surgeries, was stale and not based on the complete medical record.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pagano v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CV-6537-FPG,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204276653\">\n    2017 WL 4276653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (W.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2017) (\"[A]s the ALJ pointed out himself, Dr. Miller's opinion was rendered before [the plaintiff's] ankle surgery and therefore does not account for his deteriorating condition. A stale medical opinion, like one that is rendered before a surgery, is not substantial evidence to support an ALJ's finding.\") (citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    Girolamo v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-CV-06309 MAT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202207993\">\n    2014 WL 2207993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (W.D.N.Y. May 28, 2014) (ALJ erred in assigning \"great weight\" to medical source statement that was \"based on an incomplete record\" because it was rendered before the plaintiff's \"surgery and related diagnostic testing\"). Accordingly, Dr. Toor's opinion cannot provide substantial evidence for the ALJ's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The ALJ also did not rely on any other competent medical opinion in considering Plaintiff's left knee condition. Only two opinions of record were issued after Plaintiff's September 2013 injury. First, nurse practitioner (\"NP\") Aileen Colunio issued an opinion on February 12, 2016, stating that she had \"never been provided medical evidence that would suggest [Plaintiff] is disabled.\" (Dkt. 8-13 at 305-306). However, NP Colunio, who worked for a pain management clinic, acknowledged that she had not treated Plaintiff for his knee and ankle pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 305). Accordingly, NP Colunio's opinion does not provide any meaningful information regarding the impact of Plaintiff's knee condition on his functional limitations. Second, physician's assistant Diane Legendre issued an opinion on September 15, 2014, in which she stated that Plaintiff's conditions, which were chronic and not expected to improve, prevented him from working. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 227). The ALJ gave this opinion \"little weight,\" stating that it was not supported by the clinical findings of record. (Dkt. 8-8 at 32). It is therefore clear that the ALJ could not have relied on either of these opinions in assessing Plaintiff's RFC in light of his worsening left knee symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant contends that the ALJ's RFC finding was supported by the \"voluminous medical record,\" including \"extensive progress notes\" and \"diagnostic testing.\" (Dkt. 16 at 27). However, as the Court noted above, an ALJ may not \"ma[ke] an RFC determination in the absence of supporting expert medical opinion[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Henningsen v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec. Admin.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365087\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/111/250/#p271\">\n    111 F.Supp.3d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 271 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (quotation omitted). This is not a\n   case in which Plaintiff had only minor impairments such that the ALJ \"was within [his] discretion to make a 'common sense judgment' concerning [Plaintiff's] limitations, and no medical opinion evidence was necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Lilley v. Berryhill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524911\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/157/#p161\">\n    307 F.Supp.3d 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 161 (W.D.N.Y. 2018). As detailed above, Plaintiff's knee impairment, as exacerbated by his September 2013 injury, was sufficiently severe that it necessitated two surgeries. Under these circumstances, it was necessary for the ALJ to rely upon a medical source's opinion in considering the limitations, if any, associated with this impairment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perkins v. Berryhill\n   </em>\n   No. 17-CV-6327-FPG,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203372964\">\n    2018 WL 3372964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (W.D.N.Y. July 11, 2018) (ALJ cannot render a common-sense judgment about a claimant's functional capacity where the record \"contain[s] complex medical findings and do[es] not suggest only minor impairment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Because the ALJ in this matter failed to rely on any competent medical opinion in assessing Plaintiff's RFC following his September 2013 knee injury and subsequent surgeries, his decision was unsupported by substantial evidence. Remand of this matter for further administrative proceedings, during which the record can be appropriately developed (including by obtaining an updated function-by-function medical assessment of Plaintiff), is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Remaining Argument\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the ALJ improperly relied on a questionnaire from 2011 in assessing the credibility of his subjective complaints. However, because the Court has already determined, for the reasons previously discussed, that remand of this matter for further administrative proceedings is necessary, the Court declines to reach this issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:15-CV-01160 (LEK),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207017395\">\n    2016 WL 7017395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (N.D.N.Y.
