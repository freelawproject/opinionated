Evertz moves to dismiss Cascades's complaint under Fed. R. Civ.

R. 1 \u00b6 1. Evertz is a competitor in that field who has at least one of its own patents.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. In 2007 and 2008, Evertz entered into three agreements with Cooper and two related licensing entities to settle a prior infringement dispute involving \"a different family of [Cooper] patents\" than the patents at issue in this case.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The key agreement for purposes of this motion to dismiss is a Mutual Release and Covenant Not to Sue that Cooper and Evertz entered into on March 10, 2008 (\"the Cooper Agreement\"). R. 1-1. The Cooper Agreement binds third-parties to whom \"Cooper assigns or licenses any of the Cooper Patents.\" R. 1-1 \u00b6 9. The Cooper Agreement contains two provisions central to Evertz's motion to dismiss. The first is a release in paragraph 2:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2. Cooper hereby releases Evertz with respect to any and all claims that he could have brought in any proceeding against Evertz for infringement of any existing patent presently or formerly owned or controlled by him or by any company owned or controlled by him or that might hereafter revert to him (\"Cooper Patent\"), with respect to any past, present or future products, methods, services, or systems of Evertz that previously, currently, or in the future are made, used, sold, offered for sale, imported or exported by Evertz.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. The second is a covenant in paragraph 4:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   4. Cooper hereby covenants that neither he nor any company owned or controlled by him will bring suit, initiate any proceeding or otherwise assert any claim, assist voluntarily in the prosecution of any claim, or receive or direct to any third party any payments arising from the prosecution or settlement of any claim, apart from payments arising from the Licensing Agreements, against Evertz or its affiliates or its affiliates, customers, distributors, resellers, OEMs or end-users of its past or current products, methods, services or systems before any court or administrative agency in any country in the world, based upon or arising out of any Cooper Patent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Reading these provisions together, in paragraph 4 Cooper covenants not to bring lawsuits \"based upon or arising out of any Cooper Patent,\" and \"Cooper Patent\" is defined in paragraph 2 as \"any existing patent\" meeting certain criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Around the same time Evertz and Cooper entered into the Cooper Agreement, Evertz also entered into license agreements with two related parties: Technology Licensing Company (\"TLC\") and IP Innovation. In those agreements, unlike in the Cooper Agreement, the license is explicitly defined to cover not only existing patents, but \"any related [patent] applications or patents,\" including \"divisionals.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 21-1 \u00b6 1.d (Evertz's agreement with TLC stating: \" 'Cooper Synch Stripper Patents' means, collectively, i. United States Patent No. 5,754,250... ii. United States Patent No 5,488,869... and iii. any related applications or patents obtained by TLC, or any successors-in-interest or assigns, via any foreign or domestic continuations, continuations-in-part, divisionals, reissues, or reexaminations of the '250 or '869 patents\"); R. 21-2 \u00b6 1.d (Evertz's\n   agreement with IP Innovation stating: \" 'Cooper Patents' means, collectively, i. United States Patent No. 5,424,780... [other specifically listed patents] ... x. and any related applications or patents obtained by Patentees, or any successors-in-interest or assigns, via any foreign or domestic continuations, continuations-in-part, divisionals, reissues or reexaminations of the [listed] patents\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In February 2009, eleven months after signing the Cooper Agreement, Evertz launched its IntelliTrak product line-the accused products in this case-that \"monitor lip sync information for excessive errors.\" R. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 35. Several years later, in 2014, Cooper formed Cascades \"to help ... Cooper benefit from the licensing of his lip sync error correction inventions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 15. Between August 2014 and June 2017, Cascades obtained the three patents designed to correct lip sync error at issue in this case: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,810,659 (\"the '659 patent\"), 9,071,723 (\"the '723 patent\"), and 9,692,945 (\"the '945 patent\") (\"patents-in-suit\"). R. 20-1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   These patents were based on divisional applications from prior Cooper patents, which means applications for an \"independent or distinct invention, carved out of a nonprovisional application.\" MPEP \u00a7 201.06. \"[T]he disclosure presented in a divisional application must not include any subject matter which would constitute new matter if submitted as an amendment to the parent application.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The three patents-in-suit all claim priority to a parent patent issued to Cooper in 2004:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C836%2C295\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 6,836,295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '295 patent\"). R. 20-1 at 8, 22, 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Beginning in 2014, Cascades tried to engage Evertz in licensing discussions related to Evertz's IntelliTrak products, invoking the patents-in-suit and related patents. R. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 15-34. But Evertz declined to negotiate licenses, citing the release in the Cooper Agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C836%2C295\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C836%2C295\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 16-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Evertz ignored many of Cascades's follow up communications.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C836%2C295\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C836%2C295\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 18-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In November 2017, Cascades filed this lawsuit asserting that the IntelliTrak products infringe on the patents-in-suit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C836%2C295\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C836%2C295\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 37-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   It is undisputed that the three patents-in-suit related to correcting lip sync error did not exist as of March 10, 2008 when Cooper signed the Cooper Agreement promising not to sue Evertz based on existing patents. Evertz has two theories as to why the Cooper Agreement nevertheless bars Cascades's infringement allegations. The first is that Evertz has an express license to practice the patents-in-suit because the covenant not to sue\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the Cooper Agreement by its terms covers \"not only ... the specific patent families at issue in the prior dispute,\" but \"\n   <em>\n    Cooper's entire patent portfolio.\n   </em>\n   \" R. 20 at 3 (emphasis in original). The second is that Evertz has an implied license to practice the patents-in-suit because to hold otherwise would deprive Evertz of the full benefit of its bargain with Cooper. The Court addresses each theory in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Express License\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Evertz first argues that it has an express license to practice the patents-in-suit based on the unambiguous language of the Cooper Agreement. Under Illinois law, which the parties agree governs this dispute, \"[i]f the language of a contract is facially unambiguous, [the Court] interpret[s] both its meaning and the intent of the parties as a matter of law, solely from the contract itself, without resorting to extrinsic evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Morningside N. Apts. I, LLC v. 1000 N. LaSalle, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=412%20Ill.%20Dec.%20433\">\n    412 Ill.Dec. 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20N.E.3d%20413\">\n    75 N.E.3d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 419 (Ill. App. Ct. 2017). Both parties agree that the Cooper Agreement is facially unambiguous and may be interpreted as a matter of law. But they paradoxically disagree as to what its unambiguous terms mean.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[P]atent license agreements can be written to convey different scopes of promises not to sue,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a promise not to sue under a specific patent, or more broadly, a promise not to sue under any patent the licensor now has or may acquire in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Endo Pharm. Inc. v. Actavis, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240391\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/1371/#p1379\">\n    746 F.3d 1371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Evertz maintains that the Cooper Agreement \"applies broadly not only to Cooper's patent portfolio that existed at the time the Agreement was executed,\" but also to claims arising from future patents that \"are progeny of ... a Cooper Patent that existed at the time of the Agreement.\" R. 20 at 2. Because the three patents-in-suit are undisputedly progeny of a \"Cooper Patent\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the '295 patent -Evertz maintains that the Cooper Agreement expressly covers the patents-in-suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The problem with Evertz's argument is that \"Cooper Patent\" is expressly defined in the Cooper Agreement as \"any\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   patent\" meeting certain conditions. R. 1-1 \u00b6 2 (emphasis added). The release in paragraph 2 applies only to claims for \"infringement\" of an \"existing patent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240391\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/1371/#p1379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And the covenant in paragraph 4 pertains to a \"suit ... against Evertz ... based upon or arising out of any Cooper Patent\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , any patent existing at the time of the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. It is undisputed that none of the patents-in-suit existed at the time of the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Evertz knew how to negotiate agreements with broader scopes. Evertz's agreements with TLC and IP Innovation explicitly define the scope of covered rights to include progeny of the listed patents, including divisionals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 21-1 \u00b6 1.d.iii (covering \"any related applications or patents obtained ... via any ... continuations, continuations-in-part,\n   <em>\n    divisionals\n   </em>\n   , reissues or reexaminations of [specified] individual patents\") (emphasis added); R. 21-2 \u00b6 1.d.x (same). By contrast, the Cooper Agreement covers only \"existing patent[s]\"; it does not define \"Cooper Patent\" to include not-yet-existing divisionals like the patents-in-suit. R. 1-1 \u00b6 2. In other words, the Cooper Agreement contains only \"a promise not to sue under [ ] specific patent[s],\" not \"a promise not to sue under any patent the licensor now has or may acquire in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Endo,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240391\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/1371/#p1379\">\n    746 F.3d at 1378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Evertz's contrary position focuses on the \"arising out of\" language in paragraph 4. R. 1-1 \u00b6 4. Evertz argues that \"arising out of\" is a broad term, and that \"the claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in this case [arise out of] the '295 patent, from which the Patents-in-Suit arise.\" R. 20 at 10. But paragraph 4 does not cover claims\n   <em>\n    arising out of patents\n   </em>\n   arising out of a Cooper Patent. It covers claims arising out of a Cooper Patent. R. 1-1 \u00b6 4. And\n   although \"arising out of\" is a broad term, based on its placement in the sentence, that term means that the scope of\n   <em>\n    claims\n   </em>\n   covered by the covenant is expansive. It does not mean the scope of\n   <em>\n    patents\n   </em>\n   covered by the covenant is expansive. No matter how broadly \"arising out of\" is construed, it does not change the undisputed fact the patents-in-suit are not themselves Cooper Patents; as such, Cascades claims here do not \"aris[e] out of any Cooper Patent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240391\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/1371/#p1379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Federal Circuit has expressly rejected Evertz's argument when construing similar language.

Quite the opposite: the\n   <em>\n    Diversified\n   </em>\n   court found that the district court had \"erroneously focused\" on \"the connection between the\n   <em>\n    patent\n   </em>\n   [-in-suit] and the [licensed] patent\"; the proper focus based on the wording of the release was on \"the connection between the\n   <em>\n    action\n   </em>\n   and the [licensed] patent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2187835\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/106/29/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2187835\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/106/29/\">\n    at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, there is no such connection. This action undisputedly concerns patents that do not meet the definition of a Cooper Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Evertz further argues that \"the Cooper Agreement as a whole\" supports its reading of paragraph 4. R. 20 at 10. Specifically, Evertz argues that because paragraph 2 already covers infringement lawsuits based on existing patents, and paragraph 4 uses broader, \"based upon or arising out of\" language, paragraph 4 must \"extend beyond claims of infringement of a specific Cooper Patent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2187835\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/106/29/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The only way for paragraph 4 to \"extend beyond\" paragraph 2, Evertz says, is for paragraph 4 to cover lawsuits arising out of Cooper patent \"progeny.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2187835\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/106/29/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But as Cascades points out, paragraph 4 can cover a broader swath of lawsuits than paragraph 2 without covering \"progeny\" of a Cooper Patent (a term that appears nowhere in the text of the Cooper Agreement). Lawsuits other than infringement actions could \"aris[e] out of\" a Cooper Patent and be covered by paragraph\n   4, including claims for correction of inventorship (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20256\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) or patent interference (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20291\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), which can be brought by a patentee.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fina Oil &amp; Chem.

And, in any event, paragraph 2 is a backward-looking release, and paragraph 4 is a forward-looking covenant. Even if they cover roughly the same territory, they are not rendered redundant by Cascades's (and the Court's) reading of paragraph 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court therefore rejects Evertz's express license arguments based on the plain language of the Cooper Agreement. Like in\n   <em>\n    Endo\n   </em>\n   , Evertz \"agreed to [a] license[ ] that do[es] not cover the patents at issue,\" and \"[y]ou get what you bargain for.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240391\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/1371/#p1379\">\n    746 F.3d at 1378-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In support, Evertz relies on a pair of Federal Circuit cases:\n   <em>\n    TransCore,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236773\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/1271/\">\n    563 F.3d 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    General Protecht Group, Inc. v.

In any event, key distinctions between this case and\n   <em>\n    General Protecht\n   </em>\n   remain: the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    General Protecht\n   </em>\n   asserted a continuation patent covering the \"same products\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755154\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/1355/#p1361\">\n    651 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1361 ), whereas this case addresses a divisional patent covering newly developed products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To be sure, the Court is relying on Cascades's complaint allegations as to the timing of the IntelliTrak products' launch. Although Evertz does not dispute this timing in its response papers, perhaps discovery will reveal that IntelliTrak launched prior to the Cooper Agreement. And there may be room for the implied license doctrine to apply to a divisional patent, if by practicing the licensed patent Evertz would necessarily practice the patents-in-issue.

In\n   <em>\n    Comcast\n   </em>\n   , because it was \"not clear whether the accused products incorporate technology covered by a patent subject to the license agreement,\" the Court found the record insufficiently developed to grant summary judgment on the implied license doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Cascades claims it is beyond dispute that the claims in the Cooper Patents can be practiced without infringing the claims of the patents-in-suit. R. 21 at 12-13. Evertz does not appear to dispute this conclusion; it avoids discussing claim scope. But it is possible that discovery will prove Cascades wrong. Claim construction has not yet taken place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In any event, as in\n   <em>\n    Comcast\n   </em>\n   , the current record does not support a finding on the implied license issue as a matter of law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203508201\">\n    2014 WL 3508201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.

Particularity of Pleading Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Evertz also argues in an underdeveloped footnote that Cascades's complaint\n   should be dismissed for failure to plead infringement with particularity. R. 20 at 7 n.10. The Court does not find this issue sufficiently developed for the Court to rule on it, and therefore agrees with Cascades that it is waived for purposes of this motion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fuery v.

Ill. Sept. 29, 2016) (\"Arguments raised only in footnotes are waived\"). Evertz should make this argument in a separate, developed motion if it believes it is appropriate to do so. Because Cascades suggests in response to this argument that it \"would take\" the \"opportunity to amend\" (R. 21 at 15), Evertz should consult with Cascades before filing another motion to dismiss to first give Cascades an opportunity to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For the reasons explained above, Court denies Evertz's motion to dismiss [18].\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The Court may consider these agreements because they are referred to in the complaint (R. 1 \u00b6 8).\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Bogie v.

Cascades argues that the scope of the covenant in paragraph 4 of the Cooper Agreement is limited to Evertz's \"past or current products,\" and this case involves a future Evertz product (IntelliTrak). R. 21 at 7-8. The Court agrees with Evertz that this argument is based on a strained and incorrect reading of the Agreement. In paragraph 4, Cooper covenants not to \"bring suit ... against Evertz or its affiliates, customers, distributors, resellers, OEMs or end-users\n    <em>\n     of its past or current products\n    </em>\n    ... based upon or arising out of any Cooper Patent.\" R. 1-1 \u00b6 4 (emphasis added). In this sentence, the phrase \"of its past or current products\" modifies \"end-users.\" The Court rejects Cascades reading of \"[t]he word 'of' [to] mean[ ] 'concerning,' \" such that Cooper promised not to bring suit \"against Evertz concerning its past or current products.\" R. 21 at 8. This reading is not supported by the plain language of the Agreement. Nor is it supported by the surrounding context. Paragraph 2 instead states that Cooper's promise not to sue for infringement\n    <em>\n     does\n    </em>\n    extend to \"future products\" of Evertz's, so long as the infringement claim is based on an \"existing patent.\" R. 1-1 \u00b6 2. This conclusion does not, however, impact the Court's holding. Regardless of whether the Cooper Agreement applies to future Evertz products, it applies only if a suit arises from a then-\"existing patent.\" And this suit does not arise from a then-existing patent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
