The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, and polycystic ovarian syndrome were non-severe.

With respect to Plaintiff's representations that she suffered from fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, the ALJ concluded that these were not medically determinable impairments.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 1.02B, 12.04, 12.06, and 14.10 in reaching her conclusion, as well as considering the effect of Plaintiff's obesity as required by Social Security Ruling (\"SSR\") 02-1p. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a range of light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 416.967(b), with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   is capable of sitting for up to six hours in an eight-hour workday; standing and/or walking for up to six hours in an eight-hour workday; and can lift and/or carry up to ten pounds frequently and twenty pounds occasionally.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 571).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On August 24, 2015, NP Rozario completed a Medical Source Statement form related to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 668-71). NP Rozario indicated on this form that Plaintiff was physically and mentally unable to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 669). He opined that Plaintiff's impairments would cause her to be off-task for more than 30% of the workday. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). NP Rozario further indicated that Plaintiff could walk less than one city block without rest or severe pain and that she could sit or stand for only ten minutes before needing to change positions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to NP Rozario, Plaintiff could sit for less than two hours in an eight-hour workday and would need to walk for ten minutes at five-minute intervals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 670). NP Rozario further opined that Plaintiff could never lift or carry less than ten pounds, and could never twist, stoop, crouch, squat, or climb ladders or stairs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He stated that Plaintiff could use her hands bilaterally to grasp objects only 25% of the time and could use her fingers bilaterally for fine manipulations only 20% of the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 671). Plaintiff could never use her arms bilaterally to reach. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). NP Rozario indicated that Plaintiff's impairments would cause her to be absent from work more than four days per month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In her decision, the ALJ accorded little weight to NP Rozario's various opinions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39). The ALJ explained that NP Rozario's opinions were unsupported by his own contemporaneous examinations of Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In particular, the ALJ noted that NP Rozario had recorded significant examination findings on only a single occasion, in the context of an acute incident that had caused lumbar spine pain,\n   and that his examinations of Plaintiff had otherwise been unremarkable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ further explained that NP Rozario's opinions were also inconsistent with treatment records from Plaintiff's other primary care providers, as well as her rheumatologists and nephrologists. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court finds no error in the ALJ's assessment of NP Rozario's opinion. It is appropriate for an ALJ to accord limited weight to an opinion where it is \"inconsistent with [the source's] examination findings.\"\n   <em>\n    Glena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20739096\">\n    2018 WL 739096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4. In this case, as the ALJ explained, NP Rozario's own examinations of Plaintiff were generally unremarkable, and inconsistent with the severe limitations found in his opinions. NP Rozario consistently observed only minimal abnormalities when examining Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 7 at 525, 562-63, 566). Notably, on January 2, 2015, NP Rozario recorded that an inspection of Plaintiff's shoulder revealed no asymmetry or deformity, no limitation in the range of motion, and a normal scapula. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 566). An x-ray of Plaintiff's shoulder the same day revealed a \"normal appearing right shoulder.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 574). These objective medical findings offer no support for NP Rozario's assessment that Plaintiff was severely limited in using her upper extremities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   NP Rozario did see Plaintiff on March 20, 2015, for an acute complaint of lower back pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 576). On this one occasion, Plaintiff had an antalgic gait, with a limitation of flexion and extension of the lumbar spine due to pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 577). However, Plaintiff still showed 5/5 motor strength throughout her extremities and had normal reflexes and intact sensation, which no motor or sensory deficits noted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Moreover, at her next appointment with NP Rozario on August 24, 2015, Plaintiff's physical examination results were once again essentially normal, with no back pain noted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 668-89). It was reasonable for the ALJ to find that this single abnormal exam was insufficient to support the extreme restrictions found in NP Rozario's opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The ALJ also appropriately found that NP Rozario's opinions were inconsistent with the record as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ross v.

Oct. 21, 2014) (nurse practitioner's opinion was \"entitled to lesser weight\" because it was \"inconsistent with the record as a whole\"). As the ALJ explained, treatment records from Plaintiff's other primary care providers and physicians did not support the limitations identified by NP Rozario. (Dkt. 7 at 39). In particular, the ALJ explained that between September 3, 2013, and May 1, 2014, physician's assistant Jordan Christie regularly observed that Plaintiff had no spinal tenderness, intact motor functioning, intact sensation, and normal gait. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36 (referring to\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 472, 476, 488, 504, 509) ). On June 4, 2014, rheumatologist Dr. Prem Tambar reported that Plaintiff had \"[n]ormal inflammatory markers\" and \"[n]egative detailed serological workup and lack of any other significant clinical findings,\" leading him to conclude that \"there does not appear to be any significant systemic involvement\" in Plaintiff's claimed impairments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35 (referring to\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 513) ). NP Kathleen Leigh-Simms observed on August 6, 2014, that Plaintiff had no evidence of active synovitis in her joints, normal gait, intact motor strength and sensory function in all extremities, and no muscle tenderness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35 (referring to\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 542) ). The ALJ did not err in discounting NP Rozario's opinion, which was highly restrictive, in light of the largely unremarkable findings consistently observed by Plaintiff's treatment providers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boland v.

At the first step, she found that Plaintiff's \"medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause some of the alleged symptoms\" but that \"the objective evidence is inconsistent with [Plaintiff's] statements regarding the extent of her limitations.\" (Dkt. 7 at 34, 37). Accordingly, the ALJ assessed Plaintiff's credibility, and concluded that there were \"several reasons why [Plaintiff's] allegations of debilitating symptoms\" were not fully credible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41). First, the ALJ noted that Plaintiff had \"described daily activities that are not limited to the extent one would expect, given the complaints of disabling symptoms and limitations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Second, the ALJ noted that Plaintiff's last employment had ended not because of her impairments, but because of a general layoff at her employer, and that Plaintiff had continued to seek work thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Third, the ALJ observed that Plaintiff's treatment had been \"routine and/or conservative in nature,\" consisting essentially of medication and routine follow-up visits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the ALJ improperly relied upon her activities of daily living in performing her credibility\n   assessment, because \"a claimant need not be an invalid, incapable of performing any daily activities, in order to receive benefits under the [Act].\" (Dkt. 10-1 at 16). This argument is misplaced. While it is true that the capability to perform activities of daily living is not inherently inconsistent with a finding of disability, \"[t]he law is clear that the ALJ may consider ... [a claimant's] purported activities of daily living for the purposes of a credibility determination.\"\n   <em>\n    Cahill v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:11-CV-148,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203777072\">\n    2012 WL 3777072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (D. Vt. Aug. 29, 2012). Indeed, the Commissioner's regulations expressly identify \"daily activities\" as a factor the ALJ should consider in evaluating the intensity and persistence of a claimant's symptoms.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.929\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(i). In considering activities of daily living, \"[t]he issue is not whether the clinical and objective findings are consistent with an inability to perform all substantial activity, but whether plaintiff's statements about the intensity, persistence, or functionally limiting effects of his symptoms are consistent with the objective medical and other evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Morris v.

Apr. 14, 2014). This is so because \"[o]ne strong indication of credibility of an individual's statements is their consistency, both internally and with other information in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201451996\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here, the ALJ properly found that Plaintiff's claims regarding her symptoms were inconsistent with the other evidence of record, including her own reports of her activities of daily living. Despite Plaintiff's claim that her impairments were completely disabling, she also reported that she was able to cook, clean, shop, and provide care to her child, who suffers from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7 at 37, 234, 374-75). These activities are inconsistent with the severity of symptoms Plaintiff claimed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rusin v.

As the ALJ also observed, the record indicates that in 2012, Plaintiff was able to take classes and study to be a medical assistant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37). In connection with those studies, Plaintiff's orthopedic surgeon approved her plan to participate in an internship that would require \"more writing and typing\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 715), which is wholly inconsistent with Plaintiff's claims regarding her ability to use her hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the ALJ mischaracterized her activities of daily living, because Plaintiff testified that her husband performed most of the cooking and cleaning and because her son spends a large part of the day in school. The Court is not persuaded by these arguments. Plaintiff's testimony before the ALJ was inconsistent with her prior reports, including to the consultative examiner, whom she told that she was able to \"cook three times a week, clean three to four times a week, do laundry once a week, and ... shop[ ] twice a month,\" in addition to \"provid[ing] daily child care.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 375). It was well within the ALJ's discretion to credit these prior reports by Plaintiff as to opposed to the more restrictive mode of living she reported at the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perozzi v.
