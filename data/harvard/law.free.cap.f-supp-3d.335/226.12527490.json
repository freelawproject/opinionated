Regulation 8067 required \"the extension of the established term of validity\" to \"be done during its term,\" and because Regulation 8067 was not extended prior to its expiration, the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals held that the \"decree had no effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7 (official translation at Docket No. 73 at p. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendants, nevertheless, have \"acted and/or continued to act in collecting [ ] Enhanced Security Fees in connection with the cargo scanning program.\" (Docket No. 19 at p. 13.) The defendants have also continued to collect enhanced security fees from the plaintiffs for \"non-containerized cargo such as cars, ISO tanks, cargo on platforms, and other types of cargo which are imported without using shipping containers,\" as well as \"cargo entering the Port of San Juan, through some marine terminals which do not have access to scanning stations,\" and \"cargo ... that [is] not being scanned at all,\" Docket No. 19 at pp. 13-15, despite the Court's ruling that the defendants cannot collect such fees from \"shipping operators that are not being scanned pursuant to Regulation [ ] 8067.\"\n   <em>\n    V\u00e1zquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205652076\">\n    2013 WL 5652076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15. The defendants have \"collected and derived economic benefit from the Enhanced Security Fees,\" and the plaintiffs have sustained \"substantial and continuing economic losses\" in amounts \"believed to be in excess of $150,000,000.00\" because of the defendants' actions.

(Docket No. 55.) According to S2 and Rapiscan, the plaintiffs \"lack standing to challenge the Enhanced Security Fees at issue because they did not pay them-the fees were imposed on ocean freight carriers who independently decided whether, and in what amount, to pass their own costs onto merchants such as Plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=P.R.%20Laws%20Ann.%20tit.%203%2C%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=P.R.%20Laws%20Ann.%20tit.%203%2C%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207\">\n    at p. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Like S2 and Rapiscan, PRPA asserts that the plaintiffs' claims are \"improperly anchored on their carriers' independent decisions to charge operating fees\" and thus do \"not satisfy the constitutional standing requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at p. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the alternative, PRPA argues that it \"is an arm of the state cloaked with sovereign immunity,\" which \"shields it from legal actions that precisely target its governmental functions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at p. 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . PRPA also contends that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (1) Plaintiffs' Section 1983 claims are mostly time barred; (2) Plaintiffs have failed to include the Ocean Freight Carriers, who are indispensable to any litigation challenging the collection of [enhanced security fees]; (3) the [ ] amended complaint fails to state a cause of action for unjust enrichment or undue collection; (4) Plaintiff's regulatory takings claim is flawed, inasmuch as it is incorrectly based on PRPA's alleged\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   acts; and (5) Plaintiffs' claim regarding PRPA's alleged\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   conduct are inapposite.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While the Court disagrees with the defendants' arguments regarding standing and immunity, the Court agrees that the plaintiffs fail to establish takings, procedural due process, and substantive due process claims pursuant to section 1983. The Court, nevertheless, finds that the plaintiffs state a valid Commerce Clause claim pursuant to section 1983, as well as Puerto Rico law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
