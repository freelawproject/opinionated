(Compl., Docket Entry No. 1.) On September 22, 2017, U.S. Underwriters and Image cross-moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each seeking a declaration as to their rights and duties under the insurance agreement at issue. Image also requests reimbursement for costs incurred in connection with this action. (Pl. Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pl. Mot.\"), Docket Entry No. 30; Pl. Mem. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (\"Pl.

For the reasons discussed below, the Court grants Image's cross-motion and denies U.S. Underwriters' cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(Compl. \u00b6 7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Image is a limited liability corporation with its principal place of business in Virginia. (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Image Answer \u00b6 7, Docket Entry No. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 4, 2010, Image entered into a \"Floor Cleaning/Janitorial Services Agreement\" (the \"Agreement\") with Walgreens Eastern Co., Inc. (\"Walgreens\"). (Pl. Statement of Material Facts Pursuant to Local R. 56.1 (\"Pl. 56.1\") \u00b6 2, Docket Entry No. 35.) On March 23, 2011, Image subcontracted the services in the Agreement to Sphinx, a corporation with its principal place of business in New York. (Compl. \u00b6 9; Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 3.) Under the subcontract, Sphinx,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , cleaned and waxed the floors of the Walgreens Pharmacy in Corona, New York (the \"Premises\"), upon the issuance of work orders by Image. (Subcontract Agreement between Sphinx and Image (\"Subcontract Agreement\") 2, annexed to Robert W. Muilenburg Decl. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (\"Muilenburg Decl.\"),\n   Docket Entry No. 30-2 as Ex. D, Docket Entry No. 30-6.) The work orders detailed the \"[s]ervices to be performed, the time frame of the [s]ervices to be performed, and the price to be paid to [Sphinx] for [its] [s]ervices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As part of its subcontract, Sphinx was also required to obtain general liability insurance naming Image as an additional insured. (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 7.) Sphinx thus obtained commercial liability insurance policy number CP 3554491 from U.S. Underwriters (the \"Policy\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 2, 2011, LeClerc, a Walgreens employee, fell and sustained bodily injuries at the Premises. (LeClerc Compl. \u00b6 24, annexed to Image Mot. as Ex. A, Docket Entry No. 25-2.) LeClerc testified that on the day of the accident, the Premises opened at 7:30 AM, about forty-five minutes later than usual, because the cleaning crew had left later than usual. (LeClerc Dep. 44:2-23, 47:20-48:6, annexed to Image Mot. as Ex. R, Docket Entry No. 25-19.) Consequently, the floors allegedly had yet to dry and remained wet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48:15-16.) After the Premises were opened to the public, a customer fell down in aisle five. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65:20-66:8.) About twenty to twenty-five minutes later, sometime between 8:00 and 9:00 AM, LeClerc also fell down in aisle five, suffering the complained of injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:2-5; 67:12-15.) LeClerc alleges that Image or its agents were responsible for ensuring that the Premises were safe and their failure to properly dry the floors violated their duties of reasonable care and diligence, causing her injuries. (LeClerc Compl. \u00b6 22-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties dispute whether Image qualifies as an additional insured under the Policy. Section II (A) of the Policy (the \"Additional Insured Provision\") provides the following definition of an additional insured:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Who is An Insured is amended to include as an additional insured the person(s) or organizations(s) shown in the Schedule, but only with respect to liability for \"bodily injury\", \"property damages\" or \"personal and advertising injury\" caused, in whole or in part, by:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1.

K to Image Mot. Docket Entry No. 25-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section II (B) of the Policy (the \"Exclusions Provision\") also provides certain policy exclusions specific to additional insureds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   With respect to the insurance afforded to these additional insureds, the following additional exclusions apply:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   This insurance does not apply to \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" occurring after:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   1. All work, including materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work, on the project (other than service, maintenance or repairs) to be performed by or on behalf of the additional insured(s) at the location of the covered operations has been completed; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   2. That portion of \"your work\" out of which the injury or damage arises has been put to its intended use by any person or organization other than another contractor or subcontractor engaged in performing operations for a principal as a part of the same project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The parties agree the term \"your\" in these sections is a reference to Sphinx, the named insured of the Policy.

Neither party offered any definitions for \"[t]hat portion\" or \"intended use.\" Nor did they offer any extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent as to these terms or section or guidance in the form of established customs, and state or federal law. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the Intended Use Clause would have excluded Image from coverage regardless of how \"[t]hat portion\" and \"intended use\" is understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The use of the term \"[t]hat portion\" indicates that Sphinx's work can and should be subdivided in interpreting the Intended Use Clause. By its very definition, \"portion\" suggests that Sphinx's work \"can ... take place in a piecemeal manner.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nautilus Ins. Co. v.

The term suggests that as Sphinx performs its duties, the Intended Use Clause excludes from coverage \"\n   <em>\n    each part\n   </em>\n   of the work that has been put to its intended use.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183835\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/726/#p734\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183835\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/726/#p734\">\n    at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). \"That portion\" thus cannot be interpreted\n   as encompassing the entirety of Sphinx's contract with Image.

The relevant portion of Sphinx's work is either all the required services on June 2, 2011, the date LeClerc was injured, and/or the area around aisle five of the Premises, the specific area where the incident occurred. Defined either way, that portion of Sphinx's work was put to its intended use by the opening of the Premises to customers. There is no dispute that the Premises, including aisle five, was open to the public without any reservation after Sphinx had cleaned and/or waxed the floors and left the Premises. LeClerc even testified that a\n   <em>\n    customer\n   </em>\n   had fallen down prior to her own injury near the area where she later fell.

Having considered the potential definitions for \"[t]hat portion\" and \"intended use,\" the Court cannot decipher any reasonable interpretation such that the Intended Use Clause would not apply in this case. However, Plaintiff cannot rely on this exclusion because it failed to meet the disclaimer requirements set forth in New York Insurance Law \u00a7 3420(d)(2) as discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    d.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, Image argues that the lengthy delay in disavowing coverage counsels against allowing its withdrawal, \"especially since [Plaintiff] has been controlling [Image's] defense since 2014.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiff disputes Image's characterization of its reservations.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff therefore asserts that insurers cannot have waived or be estopped from disclaiming \"coverage where none exists.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15.)
