On August 27, 2018, Magistrate Judge Barbara Moses recommended that this Court dismiss all of Plaintiff's claims. Dkt. 62. Plaintiff filed objections on September 7, 2018. Dkt. 65.

Gins's will, which was admitted to probate in February 2014, leaves the bulk of her estate - including the disputed work, if it was hers to bequeath - to defendant Reversible Destiny Foundation, Inc. (RDF). In this action, filed in October 2017, ABRF sues RDF, the Estate, and its executors, seeking orders requiring the \"immediate[ ] return\" of the work, a declaration that ABRF is its \"sole and exclusive owner,\" and damages for copyright infringement. The copyright claim furnishes the sole independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Now before the Court is defendants' motion, made pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), to dismiss all of ABRF's claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 19.) Defendants rely on the \"probate exception,\" which \"precludes federal courts from endeavoring to dispose of property that is in the custody of a state probate court.\"\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

The Mechanism of Meaning\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The work in dispute is one of two major versions or \"editions\" of an ambitious project, created by Arakawa and Gins over several decades, entitled\n   <em>\n    The Mechanism of Meaning\n   </em>\n   . Each edition comprises approximately 80 painted panels and other elements,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. (Dkt.

No 1-1), transferred to ABRF \"all right, title, and possession, including literary rights including copyright,\" to the works \"more fully described in Schedule A.\" Schedule A, in turn, identified the property being transferred as \"The Mechanism of Meaning,\" and went on to describe, in some detail, 82 individual painted panels, each of them 5 feet 8 inches by 8 feet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF page 3. The Deed did not mention the existence of more than one edition of the property being gifted. Nor did it list any physical components of the gift other than the panels described on Exhibit A, even though\n   <em>\n    The Mechanism of Meaning\n   </em>\n   was an \"ongoing work,\" Compl. \u00b6 16, which existed \"in different mediums, including a series of publications, drawings and paintings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 1989, ABRF sold one edition of\n   <em>\n    The Mechanism of Meaning\n   </em>\n   (referred to herein as the Sezon Edition) to the Saison Foundation, acting on behalf of what is now known as the Sezon Museum of Modern Art in Japan, for $3 million. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 17. According to the Sales Agreement between ABRF and the Saison Foundation, signed by Gins, ABRF conveyed \"1 set of the 'Mechanism of Meaning,' \" including \"81 paintings, 45 drawings, and 1 architectural model.\" Compl. Ex. 7. The Sezon Edition, completed in 1988, was \"the second of the two large editions\" of\n   <em>\n    The Mechanism of Meaning\n   </em>\n   created by Arakawa and Gins. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 40-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At issue here is the ownership of the other \"iconic\" edition of\n   <em>\n    The Mechanism of Meaning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 5, which remained in the artists' possession and is now, according to defendants, an asset of Gins's Estate (referred to herein as the Estate Edition). During their lifetimes, Arakawa and Gins continued to modify the Estate Edition and treated it, at least for some purposes, as their personal property, including the associated intellectual property. For example, the couple personally loaned the Estate Edition to the Guggenheim Museum (Guggenheim) in 1996, for an exhibition which opened in 1997. The Loan Agreement, which ran between the artists and the museum, described the loaned work as \"The Mechanism of Meaning (84 paintings)\" and did not mention ABRF.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Ronald D. Spencer, Esq. (Dkt. No. 20), \u00b6\u00b6 21-23 &amp; Ex. G.

Most of the returns were signed by Gins and/or Arakawa. None of them listed any edition of\n   <em>\n    The Mechanism of Meaning\n   </em>\n   (or, for that matter, any other artwork) as part of ABRF's assets. Nor was there any mention of the sale of the Sezon Edition in 1988.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Declaration of David R. Baum (Dkt.

No. 42-10), at 20:12-17. Govan was the organizer of the 1997 Guggenheim exhibition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Spencer Decl. Ex. H, at ECF page 2, and is now the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Art. Compl. \u00b6 10. Stephen Gins is a brother of Madeline Gins.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the time of her death, Gins resided in a townhouse at 124 West Houston Street in Manhattan, which also served as the couple's long-time studio and art storage space.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Spencer Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; Declaration of Johanna Post (Dkt. No. 27), \u00b6 7; Spencer Dep. Tr. at 128:10-130:24. ABRF's offices were located in the same building for \"many years,\" but were \"shut down in 2008,\" Post Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, for reasons described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Sometime in 2014, Gins's executors caused her extensive art collection - including the Estate Edition of\n   <em>\n    The Mechanism of Meaning\n   </em>\n   - to be removed from the townhouse and placed in a climate-controlled art storage facility, where it remains today. Spencer Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-13, 19, &amp; Exs. C-D. There is no evidence that the Estate Edition was segregated or labeled in any way that suggested it was not Gins's personal property. According to Spencer, the works in the townhouse \"sometimes\" bore labels, but the labels \"didn't identify who owned the work.\" Spencer Dep. Tr. at 130:10-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On April 8, 2015, the Estate filed a List of Assets-Inventory (Inventory) in the Surrogate's Court, reporting that the Estate included $9,642,934 in \"Miscellaneous &amp; Trust Property\" consisting of \"Artwork created by the decedent, her deceased spouse Shusaku Arakawa, and others.\" Reply Declaration of Judith M. Wallace, Esq. (Dk. No. 47), Ex. B, at 1, 9. The $9.6 million figure was based on an appraisal by O'Toole-Ewald, dated March 26, 2015, which the Estate did not file in the Surrogate's Court but did produce in this action. Wallace Reply Decl. Ex. C. According to the appraisal, the fair market value of \"Mechanism of Meaning Paintings\" was $4,980,000 \"before blockage discount,\" and $1,245,000 \"after blockage discount.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 22.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Gins's will provided for three cash bequests and \"left the balance of her estate\n   to RDF.\" Compl. \u00b6 27. RDF was formed by Arakawa and Gins in March 2010, shortly before Arakawa's death, \"as a new foundation to promote the work and philosophy of Arakawa and Gins that focused on architectural design as a tool to extend life, and to explore how not to die.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The formation of RDF was not prompted entirely by the artists' evolving philosophic interests. ABRF had invested significant funds, over at least two decades, with Bernard Madoff Investment Securities, LLC. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 20-21. In late 2008, ABRF learned that its Madoff accounts were \"worthless.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. This forced ABRF to \"dramatically scale[ ] back its work,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3, and shut down its office at 124 West Houston Street. Post Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Spencer Reply Decl. Ex. B (email from Post stating that \"Arakawa and Madeline closed the office that was operating under ABRF in December 2008 after the Madoff scandal broke\"). Worse yet, the trustee appointed to recover funds for the benefit of Madoff victims asserted a \"claw-back\" claim against ABRF, to which it had \"no meaningful defense.\" Compl. \u00b6 25. Thus, \"the new foundation was also formed due to a concern that ABRF's future would be negatively impacted, if not terminated, by any judgment recovered by the Trustee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   During their lifetimes, Arakawa and Gins, together with nonparty Momoyo Homma, served as directors of both of the foundations they created: plaintiff ABRF and defendant RDF. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 29. After the artists' deaths, Homma remained as a director of both foundations but control otherwise diverged. Homma appointed Johanna Post and her husband Andrew MacNair (both long-term associates of the artists) to the ABRF board.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-32;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Post Decl. \u00b6 5. The RDF board now includes Homma; defendants Spencer and Govan, and nonparty Alexandra Munroe, a senior curator at the Guggenheim. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10; Declaration of Judith M. Wallace, Esq. (Dkt. No. 21), Ex. A, at 9:16-10:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On October 7, 2015, ABRF director MacNair wrote an email, addressed to the executors of the Estate, stating, \"It appears that the Estate of Madeline Gins has possession of assets that belong to ABRF, Inc.,\" referencing\n   <em>\n    The Mechanism of Meaning\n   </em>\n   . Compl. \u00b6 40 &amp; Ex. 5. MacNair requested \"a return of ABRF assets in the current inventory of the Estate of Madeline Gins.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Estate rejected the request.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-43. Two years later, on October 10, 2017, ARBF filed this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiff's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   ABRF's contention, in a nutshell, is that when Arakawa and Gins gifted\n   <em>\n    The Mechanism of Meaning\n   </em>\n   to ABRF in 1987, they intended to transfer all right, title and interest to each and every edition of the work, past and future, as well as all associated copyrights.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 18 (\"The Deed of Gift was drafted to gift the entirety of\n   <em>\n    The Mechanism of Meaning\n   </em>\n   in all of its forms, stages, and editions to ABRF.\"). Because the language of the 1987 Deed is less than clear on this point, ABRF also relies on the post-gift conduct of the donors. Plaintiff notes, for example, that the Sezon Edition, as sold in 1989, included not only 81 \"paintings\" (roughly corresponding to the 82 panels listed on Exhibit A to the 1987 Deed of Gift) but also \"45 drawings and 1 architectural model,\" suggesting that ABRF owned more than the panels listed on Exhibit A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 43. Therefore, according to ABRF, the Estate Edition did not belong to Arakawa at his death, nor to Gins at her death. By the same token, ABRF contends, the Estate Edition is not now rightfully\n   owned by her Estate, and cannot be bequeathed to RDF.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In this action, ABRF alleges a federal claim for copyright infringement pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 501, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-55; a declaratory judgment claim pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 56-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and state law claims for conversion and replevin,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 60-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , all asserted against RDF, the Estate, and its executors.
