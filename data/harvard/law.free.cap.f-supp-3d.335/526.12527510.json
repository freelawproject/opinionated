CARTER, JR., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff RegenLab USA, LLC (\"RegenLab\") brings this action alleging patent infringement arising from the unauthorized use of its patented technology. Before this Court are Defendant Estar Technologies Ltd.

(\"Healeon\")'s motions to dismiss for improper venue. For the following reasons, the Court reserves decision on Estar's motion to dismiss pending a determination under the federal long arm statute; Eclipse's motion to dismiss for improper venue is DENIED; and Healeon's motion to dismiss for improper venue is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court only recites those facts necessary to resolving the instant motions. RegenLab, the United States affiliate of a Swiss manufacturer of medical and pharmaceutical products, brought suit for infringement of its \"'957 patent\" against Estar, an Israeli company and manufacturer of products that allegedly infringe the '957 patent, namely Mycells, Tropocells, \"Eclipse PRP\" and \"Healeon PRP\" (\"the accused products\");\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Eclipse, a Texas entity that distributes the accused products in the United States; and Healeon, a California entity affiliated with Eclipse. ECF No. 1 (\"Compl.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to an exclusive distribution agreement, Eclipse serves as Estar's sole distributor of the accused products in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Daniel J. Melman in Support of Estar's Motion to Dismiss (\"Melman Jdx. Decl\") Ex. B (\"Distribution Agreement\"). Estar imports the accused products to Eclipse's warehouse in Texas. Eclipse then distributes such products across the country, including in New York.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 44; Declaration of Stephen F.W. Ball, Jr. (\"Ball Venue Decl\") Ex. A, Declaration of Paul O'Brien (\"O'Brien Decl\"). Eclipse has sold the accused products in New York and made profits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Healeon also distributes Estar and/or Eclipse's products. Compl. \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   RegenLab filed the complaint commencing this action on November 11, 2016. ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   No. 1. On March 16, 2017, Estar moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. ECF Nos. 42-44 (\"Estar Initial Mem\"). That day, Eclipse and Healeon moved to dismiss for improper venue or, alternatively, to transfer this case to the Northern District of Texas. ECF Nos. 49 (\"Eclipse Initial Mem\"); 50 (\"Healeon Initial Mem\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently sought jurisdictional and venue discovery. On August 17, 2017, this Court denied without prejudice the pending motions to dismiss and granted jurisdictional and venue discovery. ECF No. 102. The Court, however, limited discovery on personal jurisdiction to the questions of whether (1) Estar derived \"substantial revenue from goods used or consumed\" in New York under C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(3)(i) and (2) Estar expects or reasonably should expect that its sales would have consequences in New York under C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(3)(ii).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following the completion of jurisdictional and venue discovery, Estar, Eclipse, and Healeon renewed their respective motions to dismiss. ECF Nos. 115 (\"Healeon Mem\"); 116 (\"Estar Mem\"); 117 (\"Eclipse Mem\"). Defendants filed their motions entirely under seal, without seeking leave from the Court. Plaintiff filed its opposition motions under seal on January 8, 2018. ECF Nos. 122 (\"Pl Jdx. Mem\"); 123 (\"Pl Venue Mem\"). Defendants filed their reply briefs under seal on January 19, 2018. ECF Nos. 125 (\"Estar Reply\"); 126 (\"Eclipse Reply\"). Healeon did not submit a reply brief. Defendants subsequently filed redacted versions of their memoranda of law in support of their motions to dismiss and reply briefs on ECF. ECF Nos. 134, 138, 145, 147, 148. Accordingly, the Court considers the motions fully submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 23, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion to unseal Defendants' memoranda of law in support of Defendants' motions to dismiss (ECF Nos. 134, 138 and 148); Plaintiff's memoranda of law in opposition to Defendants' motions to dismiss (ECF Nos. 120-21); and Defendants' reply memoranda of law (ECF Nos. 145, 147). ECF No. 151. Defendants responded in opposition on March 2, 2018. ECF No. 154. On April 5, 2018, the Court granted Plaintiff's motion to unseal and ordered Defendants to produce narrowly-tailored redactions. ECF No. 155.

The questions are whether (1)\n   <em>\n    Estar\n   </em>\n   specifically derived revenue from such goods in New York and (2) any such revenue was \"substantial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   First, the Court examines whether Estar benefited from Eclipse's sales of the accused products in New York. Plaintiff argues that Estar derives substantial revenue from New York because Eclipse sells products in New York on its behalf. Pl Mem at 7. For instance, in calendar year 2016, Eclipse sold 4,146 units of PRP and/or PRP kits for a total sales amount of $509,712.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O'Brien Decl. Estar benefited from those sales, Plaintiff contends, because each time Eclipse sold a product in New York it ordered more of that product from Estar. Pl Mem at 7. Estar asserts that only\n   <em>\n    Eclipse\n   </em>\n   , not Estar, derived revenue from New York. Def Reply at 3. Indeed, Estar disputes that it received any money from the sale of a PRP product in New York. Def Mem at 10 (citing Esteron Dep at 246:20-23). However, when asked\n   whether Estar \"ever received any money from the sale of a platelet-rich plasma product that was eventually deliverted to New York,\" Aaron Esteron (\"Esteron\"), Estar's CEO, responded that he did not know. Esteron Dep at 247:9-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, viewing uncontroverted facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Plaintiff has met its burden of alleging that Estar has received revenue from sales of Eclipse PRP in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, the Court considers whether such revenue is substantial. As discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   note 6, the Court does not have Eclipse's total profits for 2016 (or for any year). Moreover, this Court does not know how much revenue Estar receives from Eclipse relative to its revenue from other distributors or direct sales. Accordingly, the Court cannot determine whether any profits derived from Eclipse's sales to consumers in New York are \"substantial\" relative to Estar's overall revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   However, courts also look to absolute revenues. There is little caselaw elucidating what constitutes substantial revenue in absolute terms. Courts have found that $8.79 million was \"substantial\" even when it constituted only a small proportion of the defendant's total revenue,\n   <em>\n    Allen v. Canadian Gen. Elec. Co.

As an initial matter, Estar contends that the communications that occurred in 2017 are irrelevant, as they took place after the complaint was filed on November 11, 2016. Generally, \"personal jurisdiction depends on the defendant's contacts with the forum state at the time the lawsuit was filed.\"\n   <em>\n    Klinghoffer v. S.N.C.

Nevertheless, the Federal Circuit has distinguished tort cases, in which \"Defendant's contacts with the forum after the commission of the tort [generally have] no relation to the cause of action\" from patent infringement cases, which \"involve the continuous infliction of injury upon the victim\" thus making it \"arbitrary to identify a single moment after which defendant's contacts with the forum necessarily become irrelevant to the issue of specific jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Beverly Hills Fan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11329788\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/21/1558/#p1571\">\n    21 F.3d at 1562-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, this Court considers the post-complaint allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, Estar asserts that the contacts are insufficient to trigger jurisdiction. Estar notes that it never shipped the accused products to the aforementioned doctors; it is unaware if the doctors ever purchased or used the accused products; and it has never cooperated with them.

However, such isolated incidents are not enough to satisfy the long arm statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dental Supplies Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-696,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204217115\">\n    2017 WL 4217115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (E.D.N.Y.
