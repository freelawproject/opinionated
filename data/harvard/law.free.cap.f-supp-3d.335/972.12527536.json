Children Services referred the matter to the defendant, Dr. Randall Schlievert, and asked him to prepare a report on JJ's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dr. Schlievert, a private doctor who contracts with Children Services to evaluate possible child-abuse cases, concluded that JJ's injury was indeed \"non-accidental.\" Acting in part on Schlievert's report, prosecutors indicted Gokor on a felony charge of child endangerment. Seven months later the prosecutor's office reversed course and dismissed the charge after an expert whom Gokor had hired debunked Schlievert's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Gokor then brought this \u00a7 1983 suit, alleging that Dr. Schlievert set her prosecution in motion by preparing a false report that implicated her in JJ's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pending is Schlievert's motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). (Doc. 38). Construing that submission,\n   as the parties urge me to do, as a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), I deny Schlievert's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Gokor is a childcare provider with twenty years' experience. In September, 2014, she began working at Our First Love (First Love), a childcare center in Toledo that is open twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week. (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 28, 2014, Gokor arrived at First Love at 3:00 p.m. to begin her shift. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). Sometime before 5:00 p.m., one of Gokor's coworkers \"mopp[ed] the daycare's linoleum bathroom floor with bleach and water\" and finished her shift, leaving Gokor as the only adult to supervise the \"two children, including JJ, [who] remained in the toddler room.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Around 6:00 p.m, Gokor told the children to wash their hands because it was time for dinner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22). Gokor was escorting the toddlers to the bathroom when \"JJ took off running\" toward the bathroom, where \"his feet made contact with the previously washed linoleum floor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23). JJ \"slipped, [his] legs came out from under him, his body went into the air, and JJ crashed to the floor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While consoling JJ, Gokor realized that he could not walk or stand by himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25-26). She carried him to the dining area, but JJ continued to cry and would not eat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). Gokor felt JJ's left leg and noticed that it was swollen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Gokor called First Love's owner, Mary Robinson, and its assistant manager, Rugena Modisett, and explained what had happened; the two supervisors rushed to First Love. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31-37). JJ, meanwhile, \"had calmed down and was falling asleep.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36). When Modisett finally spoke to JJ's mother (after several unsuccessful attempts to reach her), Modisett told her \"she did not need to leave work to pick up JJ because he was beginning to fall asleep and ... his injury was not serious.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38). Gokor disagreed with that assessment but deferred to her superiors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Examination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   JJ's mother picked him up from First Love at 10:15 p.m. and took him to Toledo Children's Hospital. (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 40, 45). There Dr. Eugene Iszak ordered an X-ray, which revealed \"an acute left femur fracture.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47-48). JJ told a physician's assistant that he \"slipped and fell.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55) (internal brackets omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because \"the injury happened at daycare, the hospital [determined to] treat the injury as 'possible nonaccidental trauma.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49). Dr. Iszak told JJ's mother that Children Services \"would be contacted to investigate the circumstances surrounding JJ's injury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50). But \"[a]t no point did any Toledo Hospital medical personnel ever diagnose JJ as suffering from non-accidental trauma,\" nor did anyone express doubt that the fall Gokor described could have caused JJ's injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In mid-January, 2015, Gokor submitted to an interview with Detective Tonya Rider of the Toledo Police Department and Children Services Investigator Kim Fraber. (Doc. 30 at \u00b6 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After Gokor explained how JJ had fallen and denied all wrongdoing, Fraber told her that Dr. Schlievert \"would look at the [evidence], make a determination, and issue a report.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98). Fraber acknowledged that \"[a] lot of my investigation is going to be the outcome of what [Schlievert] has to say[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 99). Fraber also said that \"[w]e rely on\" Schlievert's\n   expertise because she and Detective Rider did not \"have that medical expertise[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 104).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Referral to Schlievert\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Sometime in early January, 2015, Children Services \"referred JJ's case\" to Schlievert \"for investigation pursuant to [a] contract for [his] services entered into by Lucas County.\" (Doc. 30 at \u00b6 78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dr. Schlievert is \"board certified in general pediatrics and child abuse pediatrics.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). He is also \"the sole physician contracted by Lucas County ... to provide forensic medical consultation services to Lucas County agencies concerning cases of physical abuse and to provide expert testimony in legal proceedings instituted by Lucas County agencies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Schlievert \"does not maintain a pediatric practice and does not treat pediatric patients outside of the context of child abuse investigations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Schlievert's Relationship with Lucas County and Its Agencies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ohio law requires that agencies like Children Services \"investigate each report of possible physical abuse [of a child] it receives to determine the circumstances surrounding the injuries, the cause of the injuries, and the person or persons responsible.\" (Doc. 30 at \u00b6 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   State law also requires that such agencies \"prepare a memorandum of understanding\" for investigating child-abuse cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This memorandum sets forth the \"operating procedure to be employed\" in cases of suspected child abuse, as well as the \"standards and procedures to be used in handling and coordinating investigations of reported cases of child abuse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 63-64). Signatories include \"law enforcement officers[,] the prosecuting attorney of the county, and each member of any children's advocacy center established within the county.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   O.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2151.421(K) &amp; 5101:2-33-26(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In Lucas County, the Family and Child Abuse Prevention Center (the Abuse Prevention Center), located in Toledo, functions as the county's designated child advocacy center. (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 65-66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Abuse Prevention Center maintains a \"Protocol for Multidisciplinary Response to Child Abuse,\" which aims \"to provide the community with a coordinated, multidisciplinary, and sensitive approach to child abuse [cases].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68). Under this protocol, the Child Maltreatment Program at Mercy Children's Hospital is the entity responsible for \"medical evaluations, which includes history, examination, appropriate diagnostic studies, and treatment of victims by a physician with specialized training in child abuse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The complaint alleges that Dr. Schlievert, whose office is located in the Abuse Prevention Center, \"is the physician referred to in the protocol.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A contract between Children Services and Mercy St. Vincent Medical Center \"for the services of [Mercy St. Vincent's] employee\" - Dr. Schlievert - obliges Schlievert to \"represent[ ] and promot[e] the philosophy of [Children Services] to community medical providers and hospitals, provide[ ] written documentation of physical examination for abuse and neglect to the appropriate caseworker as identified by [Children Services] where such documentation can be used as court evidence, and participate in court hearings, as requested by [Children Services] to provide testimony regarding abuse and neglect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 72, 75) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Schlievert's Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On January 8, and at Fraber's request, Schlievert issued a report concluding that\n   JJ's injuries were \"non-accidental.\" (Doc. 22; Doc. 30 at \u00b6 109). He based his findings on Fraber's \"case notes, the day care incident report, X-rays and medical records from Toledo Hospital.\" (Doc. 22 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   According to Schlievert:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   the history does not adequately account for [JJ's] injury. In addition, improbable statements by the daycare were made. [JJ] would not have been able to stand. The daycare failed to alert family to the obvious severe injury, prolonging pain as well. This injury is non-accidental.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Schlievert recommended that JJ not return to First Love, and that Children Services refer First Love to \"the state agency charged with daycare licensure\" because \"[c]hildren do not appear to be currently safe there.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Schlievert's report did not, however, identify any particular First Love employee as responsible for JJ's injury, nor did it mention Gokor by name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   When Schlievert prepared this report, Gokor alleges, he knew that police and prosecutors \"relied on his findings when making decisions about how to proceed on cases involving allegations of physical abuse\" and used his reports \"as the basis to bring about criminal charges and ... to initiate criminal proceedings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 81-82). He also knew that police and prosecutors would share his report among themselves while investigating Gokor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Gokor's Firing, Indictment, and Release\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   After Schlievert sent his report to Investigator Fraber, she contacted First Love and explained that Gokor \"could not [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] longer work with children.\" (Doc. 30 at \u00b6 107). First Love immediately fired Gokor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 108).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Rider and Fraber continued their investigation after receiving Schlievert's report. During their second interview with Gokor, she again denied all wrongdoing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 122-31). The investigators also learned that: 1) Modisett claimed to have told JJ's mother that it was her choice whether to pick up JJ immediately, thereby contradicting Gokor's and JJ's mother's statements that daycare management told her that she need not come to First Love right away (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 121); 2) there were cameras inside First Love, but it was unclear whether they were working when JJ fell (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 130); 3) JJ told his mother that he hurt himself because \"he was running and fell\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 134); and 4) Gokor's coworker did, in fact, mop the bathroom floor before completing her shift (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 137).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Knowing all the foregoing, Detective Rider prepared a report for the prosecutor's office that emphasized Schlievert's \"medical opinion that the victim's injuries are non-accidental.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 140).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In March, 2015, a grand jury in the Lucas County Common Pleas Court \"returned a true bill\" that charged Gokor with \"Endangering Children\" under O.R.C. \u00a7 2919.22(E)(2). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 142-43). Gokor alleges on information and belief that either Schlievert testified before the grand jury that JJ's injury was non-accidental or that \"[l]aw enforcement testified ... to the content of\" Schlievert's report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 148).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   According to Gokor, \"the grand jurors' probable cause determination was based upon\" Schlievert's report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 150). Gokor alleges that, absent the report - which was \"fabricated, false, and misleading\" - the grand jury would not have had probable cause to indict her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 152). She voluntarily surrendered and was arrested on April 1, 2015, more than four months after JJ's injury; at her arraignment, Gokor pleaded not guilty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at\n   \u00b6\u00b6 154-58). She made bond the same day as her arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 157-58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   During pretrial proceedings, Gokor's attorney obtained an expert report from radiologist Gregory Shoukimas. Dr. Shoukimas concluded that JJ's injury was accidental and that Schlievert's report was riddled with errors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 162).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Shoukimas opined that \"[s]piral fractures of the femur\" of the kind JJ sustained \"can occur from accidental injury and there is no need to invoke a theory of nonaccidental injury to explain\" such a fracture. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 163). Dr. Schlievert's conclusion that \"this fracture is not compatible with accidental trauma\" was, in Shoukimas's view, \"fallacious\" and \"disregard[ed] ... the recorded interviews between the police, [Gokor], her co-workers, and JJ's mother.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In November, 2015, after defense counsel provided Shoukimas's report to the prosecution, prosecutors dismissed the charges against Gokor without prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 167).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In late 2016, Gokor filed this \u00a7 1983 action against Dr. Schlievert and Lucas County, Ohio. (Doc. 1). She brought two Fourth Amendment claims against Schlievert and alleged that the County was liable for the constitutional violations under\n   <em>\n    Monell v. Dept' of Soc. Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    436 U.S. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). Gokor then filed an amended complaint. (Doc. 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   After Gokor and Lucas County stipulated to a dismissal of the County without prejudice (Docs. 36, 41), Dr. Schlievert moved for judgment on the pleadings. (Doc. 38). Gokor opposed the motion, but withdrew her claim that Schlievert's allegedly false report had caused Gokor to be arrested, and then incarcerated, without probable cause. (Doc. 43 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The only claim that remains is Gokor's allegation that Schlievert set her prosecution in motion with a false report that Gokor was responsible for JJ's broken leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) provides that, \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Both parties agree that Schlievert's Rule 12(c) motion is premature, given that the pleadings are not closed because Schlievert has not filed an answer.\n   <em>\n    Horen v.

(Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 72-75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   As the complaint establishes, Schlievert \"does not maintain a pediatric practice and does not treat pediatric patients outside of the context of child abuse investigations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88). Dr. Schlievert protests that\n   this allegation is impermissibly conclusory, yet it is anything but conclusory. It states a fact about the nature of his practice setting. That factual assertion is one that seems consistent with, and plausible in light of, the complaint's other allegations about Schlievert's extensive involvement with government agencies that investigate child abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Schlievert's examinations occur, then, not because he in his capacity as a physician sees a medical need for them, but, rather, because a State-created and State-controlled framework mandates that he do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   This framework comprises,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the memorandum of understanding, which sets forth \"standards and procedures to be used in handling and coordinating\" child-abuse investigations, and to which police, prosecutors, and Lucas County's child advocacy center - the Abuse Prevention Center, where, in fact, Schlievert's office is located - are signatories (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 61-64, 65-67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   It also comprises the Abuse Prevention Protocol, which assigns to Schlievert's employer, Mercy St. Vincent Medical Center, the responsibility for \"medical evaluations\" of potential victims (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 70-72). The Protocol, of course, designates Dr. Schlievert as the physician responsible for performing the evaluations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 70-71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   When Schlievert conducts these contractually required evaluations, he creates a report summarizing his findings because, again, his contract with Children Services requires him to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75). He creates the reports, moreover, knowing that police and prosecutors will share the reports among themselves and rely on them to make decisions about whom to arrest and what charges to bring. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 82-84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In this respect, then, Schlievert's challenged conduct overlaps entirely with the State's motivations and goals. He functions as a critical player in the State's comprehensive - and entirely understandably comprehensive - efforts to combat child abuse, one on whom other arms of the state - Children Services, police departments, and prosecutors - depend and from whom they take their investigatory and charging cues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As one court has aptly put it, someone like Dr. Schlievert - a private doctor to whom the State has essentially turned over the responsibility for providing a medical basis to support or refute a claim of possible child abuse - is \"truly ... close[ly] entwine[d]\" with the State for purposes of \u00a7 1983's state-action requirement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   [I]t is not merely tautological, but rather a truism, to recognize that a \"state actor\" is someone who participates in \"state action\" in a meaningful way. Take the governmental function of seeking to prevent, or to deal with, child abuse. It would of course be intolerable to permit amateurs - lay personnel - to reach judgments independent of skilled medical evaluations and to make those amateur judgments the basis for separating children from their parents. Instead the expertise of medical professionals necessarily plays a key role - in many ways, the most important role - in evaluating both the effects and the causes of child abuse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   In short, it cannot be disputed that the governmental task in the field of child abuse could not function responsibly\n   without the invaluable input provided by medical professionals. And when those professionals are not themselves governmental employees, it is equally beyond dispute that the interrelationship between those professionals and the purely governmental people involved in the decisionmaking process is truly a close entwinement (the word repeatedly used in\n   <em>\n    Brentwood\n   </em>\n   Academy as meeting the state-actor test). Whether because the recruiting of top people to fulfill the medical professionals' function on a full-time basis would not have been feasible, or for some other reason or congeries of reasons, that is obviously why the Committee contracted for such service from Dr. Glick and the Hospital, rather than hiring staff doctors (who would by definition have been \"state actors\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    Mohil v.

That Schlievert retains discretion in how he performs state action does not mean his conduct is no longer \"fairly attributable to the state.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, and for similar reasons, I do not find\n   <em>\n    Molnar,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794154\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/574/772/#p784\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , on which Schlievert heavily relies, to be controlling or persuasive here. The court in\n   <em>\n    Molnar\n   </em>\n   held that a private forensic examiner who questioned an alleged victim of sexual abuse while police and prosecutors looked on was not a state actor under the nexus test.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794154\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/574/772/#p784\">\n    574 F.Supp.2d at 785-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   This case is different, however. Schlievert did not simply question an abuse victim about his injuries and let the authorities draw their own conclusions; he drew the conclusions, put them in a report (as his contract required), and sent them (as his contract also required) to Children Services and Toledo Police investigators who had previously admitted that Dr. Schlievert's opinion would determine the outcome of their investigation and who subsequently prepared a report for the prosecutor that emphasized Schlievert's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In sum and substance, then, Dr. Schlievert is a state actor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Malicious Prosecution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Having concluded that Dr. Schlievert is a state actor, I turn to the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   To state a Fourth Amendment malicious-prosecution claim, the plaintiff must establish four elements: 1) \"a criminal\n   prosecution was initiated against the plaintiff,\" and \"the defendant made, influenced, or participated in the decision to prosecute\"; 2) there was no probable cause for the prosecution; 3) \"as a consequence of a legal proceeding, the plaintiff suffered a deprivation of liberty apart from the initial seizure; and 4) \"the criminal proceedings must have been resolved in the plaintiff's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Mills v.

Influence and Participation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Schlievert contends that Gokor's complaint contains only \"bald assertions\" as to his alleged participation in or responsibility for the decision to prosecute her (Doc. 38 at 24), but this argument has no merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As discussed,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the complaint alleges that Schlievert is the sole physician to whom the County and Children Services refer suspected child-abuse cases. Gokor also alleges that Children Services relies on him to render a medical opinion in such cases, and that investigators thereafter take their cue from his findings and conclusions. (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 78, 81-82, 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The complaint also alleges that Dr. Schlievert prepares his reports knowing that police and prosecutors have shared, and will continue to share, them among themselves, and that they have relied, and will continue to rely on, his reports when deciding whom to arrest and whom to indict. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 81-82). His contract in fact\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   that he document his findings and \"provide\" that documentation to Children Services caseworkers so that the document can,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"be used as court evidence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   It was precisely this process, the complaint establishes, that played out in Gokor's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Children Services \"referred JJ's case\" to Dr. Schlievert \"for investigation[.]\" (Doc. 30 at \u00b6 78). Investigator Fraber and Detective Rider, meanwhile, suspected Gokor of wrongdoing, but confessed themselves unable to determine - and indeed incapable of determining - whether JJ's injury was accidental or non-accidental. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 99, 104). Only after receiving Schlievert's report, which blamed Gokor - not by name, to be sure, but by obvious implication - for causing the \"non-accidental\" injury, did Rider prepare a report for the prosecutor's office emphasizing Dr. Schlievert's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   These facts, which I assume to be true for purposes of this opinion, establish that Schlievert influenced or participated in the decision to prosecute Gokor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As the Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Mills,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265180\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/473/#p480\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265180\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/473/#p480\">\n    869 F.3d at 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"[i]nvestigators are deemed to have participated in a prosecution where misstatements and falsehoods in [their] investigatory materials ... ultimately influenced [the plaintiff's] continued detention.\" That is what Gokor alleged happened in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Probable Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In most cases, \"the finding of an indictment, fair upon its face, by a properly constituted grand jury, conclusively determines the existence of probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Higgason v.

But the Circuit has recognized an exception to this rule for cases where the defendant who set the plaintiff's prosecution in motion knowingly or recklessly made a false statement.

False Statement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   First, the complaint plausibly alleges that Dr. Schlievert knowingly and/or recklessly made two false statements: \"[t]he history does not adequately account for the injury,\" and \"[t]his injury was nonaccidental. (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 169-87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   According to the complaint, JJ's fracture was consistent with accidental trauma, the fall Gokor described could have caused such a fracture, and nothing in the fracture pattern definitively established that the break was non-accidental. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 113). On top of this, Dr. Schlievert admitted in his answer that he \"knew that femoral fractures have been described in children who fell while running.\" (Doc. 12 at \u00b6 33). Finally, JJ twice stated - once to a hospital worker, and once to his mother - that he hurt himself when he was running and fell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 134).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In reviewing JJ's case, Schlievert was contractually obliged to \"tak[e] necessary steps to ensure that he had access to all documents used to establish the facts of JJ's injuries\" (Doc. 30 at \u00b6 177). But Gokor alleges that Dr. Schlievert failed to do this. In particular, she alleges that Schlievert did not observe either of law enforcement's interviews of Gokor, nor did he consider their interviews of Gokor's coworkers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 92-93, 119, 121, 131).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Perhaps most importantly, Gokor alleges that Schlievert did not review Detective Rider's notes of her interview of JJ's mother, during which interview the mother said that JJ told her \"he was running and fell, and mentioned an ice pack.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 134). Indeed, Dr. Schlievert's report conspicuously fails to mention either of JJ's statements that he slipped and fell while running, let alone provide a plausible medical basis for rejecting a putative victim's repeated accounts of his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   As Gokor correctly points out, her complaint yields at least two plausible inferences. Either Schlievert conducted a thorough review of the records and evidence, much of which suggested that the injury was accidental, and falsely represented that it was \"non-accidental\" or he failed to do his due diligence and, lacking a proper command of the exculpatory facts of the case and in the face of an obvious, non-criminal explanation for JJ's injury, invented an inculpatory account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Materiality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Second, the complaint plausibly alleges that Dr. Schlievert's report was \"material to the ultimate prosecution\" of Gokor.\n   <em>\n    King,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277456\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/568/#p587\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277456\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/568/#p587\">\n    852 F.3d at 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Most simply put, Schlievert's report was the only basis for concluding that JJ's injury was non-accidental, and it was the only basis to conclude that Gokor had abused JJ and caused his injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   at 986-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Lack of Probable Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Finally, the complaint plausibly alleges that, absent Dr. Schlievert's report,\n   there was no probable cause to prosecute Gokor for child endangerment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Prosecutors charged Gokor with child endangerment under O.R.C. \u00a7 2919.22(E)(2), which makes it a second-degree felony to \" 'abuse' a child, thereby causing the child to suffer 'serious physical harm.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v. Cunningham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12550090\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/93/25/#p30\">\n    93 N.E.3d 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30 (Ohio App. 2017). The nature of JJ's injury would seem to satisfy the \"serious physical harm\" requirement, but only Dr. Schlievert's report supported the \"abuse\" element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   To begin, no medical personnel who treated JJ at Toledo Children's Hospital determined that physical abuse\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   JJ's injury. Rather, hospital staff flagged the injury as \"\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   \" non-accidental trauma and referred the matter to Children Services for an investigation. (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 49 (internal emphasis supplied);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 57, 59). JJ himself, moreover, told both a physician's assistant at the hospital and his mother that he broke his leg after he \"slipped and fell.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 55, 134). Even Schlievert agreed that such a fall could account for JJ's injury. (Doc. 12 at \u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Detective Rider and Investigator Fraber investigated the matter, but they dug up very little, if anything, that implicated Gokor in suspected \"abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Gokor consistently denied any wrongdoing. (Doc. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 91, 123). One of Gokor's coworkers told the investigators that she had, in fact, mopped the bathroom floor about an hour before JJ slipped and fell, just as Gokor had said. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 137). JJ's mother corroborated Gokor's statement that it was the manager, not Gokor, who told her that JJ's injury was not serious, and that there was no need for her to come get JJ right away. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 121).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Setting aside Dr. Schlievert's report, this body of evidence, such as it was, formed the sum total of the case against Gokor. Yet there is nothing in it suggesting that Gokor had \"abused\" JJ - i.e., that she had inflicted a non-accidental injury upon JJ - as would be required to have probable cause that she committed the offense of child endangerment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Schlievert's response that probable cause for the endangerment charge existed without his report (Doc. 45 at 17-18) lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   That JJ's treating physicians at Toledo Children's Hospital \"were concerned with a\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   for child abuse\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17) (internal emphasis supplied) does not amount to a reasonable basis to believe that Gokor abused JJ; it amounted to \"mere suspicion.\"\n   <em>\n    Sykes v.

He does not explain how those statements inculpate Gokor, who never said that JJ was able to walk and who disagreed with her superiors' decision to tell JJ's mother that his injury was not urgent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   For all of these reasons, Gokor has plausibly rebutted the presumption of probable cause that her indictment created.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(Doc. 45 at 18-20). To make his point,\n   Schlievert asks a rhetorical question: \"if Dr. Schlievert never identified Plaintiff, and if he did not know who [at First Love] did and did not make the suspicious statements [about JJ's injuries] - and if law enforcement and prosecutors\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   - how is it that Dr. Schlievert caused Plaintiff to be arrested and prosecuted?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Although Dr. Schlievert wasn't looking for an answer to his rhetorical question, Gokor's complaint supplies one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Detective Rider and Investigator Fraber had homed in on a suspect - Gokor, the only adult present at First Love when JJ was injured. But the investigators were admittedly unable to determine if she had \"abused\" JJ within the meaning of the child-endangerment statute, as they did not know whether the fall Gokor described could account for JJ's fractured leg. They therefore turned to Schlievert to answer that question, and he prepared an allegedly fabricated report concluding that JJ's injury was non-accidental.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   By supplying the inculpatory report, and by knowingly and/or recklessly making false statements that necessarily implicated Gokor, the police's only suspect, Dr. Schlievert's conduct was a proximate cause of Gokor's injury. That he did not identify her by name is immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   It is, therefore,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   1.
