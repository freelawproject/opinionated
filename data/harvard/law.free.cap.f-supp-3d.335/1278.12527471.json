The ADA provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). \"The phrase 'public accommodation' is defined in terms of twelve extensive categories, which the legislative history indicates should be construed liberally to afford people with disabilities equal access to the wide variety of establishments available to the nondisabled.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    PGA Tour, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301934\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/661/#p679\">\n    532 U.S. at 676-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301934\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/661/#p679\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It is undisputed that Defendant's physical locations are public accommodations. Defendant argues, however, that its website is not a public accommodation under the ADA. \"Courts are split on whether the ADA limits places of public accommodation to physical spaces.\"\n   <em>\n    Gil v.

Courts in the First, Second, and Seventh Circuits have held that a website may be considered a public accommodation without a connection to a physical place.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267658\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/242/1315/#p1318\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While the Eleventh Circuit has not yet considered this issue, the Court finds that the outcome would be the same under either theory here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Under the nexus test,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a connection between Defendant's website and its physical locations. The website provides goods and services such as \"information concerning [Defendant's] locations it operates [and] information and descriptions of its amenities and services, privileges, advantages, and accommodations,\" and it \"allowed users to find the locations for them to visit.\" (First Am. Compl., Dkt. [13] \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff further alleges that he \"has been deterred from visiting [Defendant's] physical locations that Plaintiff may have located by using\" the website.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Viewing the facts as alleged in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the \"website is heavily integrated with, and in many ways operates as a gateway to, [Defendant's] physical store locations,\" and Plaintiff cannot fully and equally enjoy the goods and services offered by Defendant because of the website's inaccessibility.\n   <em>\n    Gil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267658\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/242/1315/#p1318\">\n    242 F.Supp.3d at 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the ADA applied to a website that allowed customers to locate physical locations and fill prescriptions online). Plaintiff has alleged a nexus between Defendant's website and physical locations, and the ADA therefore applies to his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, Defendant argues that even if the ADA does apply to its website, Plaintiff has failed to allege a violation of the ADA because the Department of Justice has not set forth guidelines or standards for Internet accessibility under the ADA. A violation of the ADA, however, may be based on the language of the statute itself, which bars discrimination \"on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Defendant argues that the alleged deficiencies are not in fact violations of the ADA. Under the standard for a motion to dismiss, the Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately alleged that the deficiencies result in discrimination to the visually-impaired.
