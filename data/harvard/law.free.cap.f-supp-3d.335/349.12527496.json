(Pet. Obj., at ECF 1-4; R &amp; R at ECF 7-8.) In this case, the Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\") between Petitioner and Respondent provides\n   that \"[t]he costs of the arbitration, including the arbitrator's fee shall be borne equally by [Allied] and [Petitioner] the Union.\" (Affidavit of Lydia Sigelakis dated May 25, 2018 (\"Sigelakis Aff.\"), Exhibit (\"Ex.\") 2 (CBA), Dkt. 7-1, Article XIII, Section 4(b) at 36-37, ECF 54-55.) In each of the awards, Arbitrator Roger Maher (the \"Arbitrator\") found, pursuant to the CBA, that \"the parties have agreed to share the cost of the Arbitrator's fee\", and specifically listed and enumerated the amount owed the Arbitrator by each party in the award. (Pet., Ex. A, Dkt. 1-1 at ECF 3 and Ex. B, Dkt. 1-2 at ECF 3.) Petitioner and Respondent each owed $2,000 for the two hearings conducted by the Arbitrator. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The awards stated that the Arbitrator's fee was to be paid by the parties \"directly to the arbitrator.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Respondent subsequently failed to satisfy any of its obligations pursuant to the awards, both to Petitioner and the Arbitrator.

The Petition included,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a specific request that Respondent pay $2,000 as its half of the Arbitrator fees for the two hearings. (Pet. at ECF 4.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Recognizing that courts in this Circuit have granted prejudgment interest at the 9% rate where a petition to confirm an arbitration award was filed right before the expiration of the statute of limitations period,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golden Dev. &amp; Constr. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204523927\">\n    2016 WL 4523927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (awarding 9% prejudgment interest rate where petition was filed nearly a year after arbitration award);\n   <em>\n    Sukhmany Constr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201462235\">\n    2018 WL 1462235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2,\n   <em>\n    report and recommendation adopted\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201459457\">\n    2018 WL 1459457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (awarding 9% prejudgment interest rate where petition was filed nearly 11 months after arbitration award), the Court nonetheless finds that Petitioner's decision not to file the Petition until the limitations period had almost run should not be rewarded by a higher interest rate. To do so would incentivize and encourage parties in straightforward cases such as this one to be dilatory and delay filing so as to maximize the amount of prejudgment interest awarded.\n   <em>\n    Sarhank Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%20324881\">\n    2004 WL 324881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (holding that \"interest rate must not overcompensate the Petitioner\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Accordingly, based on its\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the Court adopts the R &amp; R's recommendation that the federal prejudgment interest rate be applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, the Court adopts the well-considered R &amp; R in its entirety.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ; Fed.

The Court thus grants the Petition to confirm the arbitration awards and awards Petitioner $8,868.24 ($7,947.24 as awarded to Petitioner by the Arbitrator and $921 in fees and costs associated with this Petition). The Court further awards Petitioner prejudgment interest from November 7, 2016, on $7,947.24, to be calculated by the Clerk of Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as post-judgment interest on $8,868.24, also calculated pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
