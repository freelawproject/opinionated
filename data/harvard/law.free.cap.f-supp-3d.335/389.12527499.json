Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last met the insured status requirements of the Act through March 31, 2015. (Dkt. 7 at 70). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since October 23, 2012, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of: depression; antisocial personality disorder ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   impulse control disorder ; impingement syndrome, shoulder; patellofemoral syndrome ; and alcohol substance use disorder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of hip bursitis and fracture of the fifth metacarpal were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 12.04 and 12.06 in reaching his conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71-72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a range of light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 416.967(b), with the additional limitations that Plaintiff only perform:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   work that requires sufficient attention and concentration to understand, remember and follow simple instructions and [Plaintiff] should work primarily alone, with only occasional supervision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72). At step four, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was unable to perform any past relevant work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of collator operator and photocopy machine operation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79-80). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80-81).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The Commissioner's Determination is Supported by Substantial Evidence and Free from Legal Error\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to reverse or, in the alternative, remand this matter to the Commissioner. (Dkt. 12-1 at 29). Plaintiff contends that the ALJ disregarded all of the medical opinions in the record relating to Plaintiff's mental functioning and, in that context, raises several issues, including: (1) the ALJ improperly weighed opinion evidence, including the opinions of Janie-Lynn Selden, LMSW, and Adam Brownfield, Ph.D., a consultative examiner; (2) the ALJ disregarded every opinion in the record, and therefore based the RFC finding on his own interpretation of the medical record; and (3) the RFC does not include certain mental limitations articulated by Ms. Selden and Dr. Brownfield, including Plaintiff's moderate limitation in concentration, persistence, and pace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-29). The Court has considered each of these arguments and, for the reasons discussed below, finds them to be without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The ALJ Properly Evaluated the Opinion Evidence in the Record\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In assessing a disability claim, an ALJ must consider and weigh the various medical opinions of record.

Plaintiff's speech was clear, and his thought processes were coherent and goal directed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 351). His affect varied between anxious and irritated, and his mood varied between dysthymic and irritable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Brownfield noted that Plaintiff's attention and concentration skills were \"impaired due to emotional distress. [Plaintiff] was able to count and do simple calculations, but unable to do the serial 3s correctly. He did not want to try.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff's recent and remote memory skills were intact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Brownfield found that Plaintiff's cognitive functioning was in the \"borderline impaired range,\" and that his \"[g]eneral fund of information was appropriate to experience.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff's insight and judgment were poor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Brownfield ultimately opined that, with regard to Plaintiff's mental functioning, there was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [n]o evidence of limitation in following and understanding simple directions and instructions, performing simple tasks independently, and maintaining a regular schedule. [Plaintiff] is mildly limited in maintaining attention and concentration and learning new tasks.

These difficulties are caused by psychiatric symptoms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 352). The ALJ assigned \"some weight\" to Dr. Brownfield's opinion, \"based on his programmatic expertise and consistency with the record.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76). The ALJ further noted that \"once in mental health treatment on a consistent basis, [Plaintiff] had significant improvements in his ability to control anger and impulses\"; accordingly, Plaintiff's mental condition improved following his examination by Dr. Brownfield. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7 at 77-79 (discussing Ms. Selden's employability assessments completed in March 2014, August 2014, February 2015, July 2015, and September 2015, and functional capacity questionnaires from February 2015 and September 2015) ). Ms. Selden opined with relative consistency that Plaintiff was moderately limited in his capacity to: follow, understand, and remember simple instructions; perform simple and complex tasks independently; and maintain attention and concentration for rote, low stress, or simple tasks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 366, 384, 389, 393, 397).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On August 28, 2014, Ms. Selden opined that Plaintiff could work five hours per week, with the additional limitations that Plaintiff could not work in large crowds, needed breaks to cope with stress, and required supervision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 366-67). The ALJ assigned \"little weight\" to this opinion, because contemporaneous treatment records indicated that Ms. Selden felt that Plaintiff could return to work, but through conversation both she and Plaintiff agreed on the five-hour limitations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 691 (\"Through conversation and explanation of accommodations that can be made [Plaintiff] was able to come to the agreement to test out the DSS work unit assignment for five hours per week\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Similarly, in February 2015, Ms. Selden opined that Plaintiff was moderately limited in all functional areas but had a GAF of 55. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 392-93). She stated that Plaintiff was able to work for five hours per week, and noted that his motivation to seek work had stalled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ assigned \"little weight\" to this opinion, as it was not consistent with Ms. Selden's treatment notes, which indicated that Plaintiff was able to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court has reviewed Ms. Selden's treatment notes and agrees that, despite submission of opinions indicating that Plaintiff could not work, Ms. Selden pushed Plaintiff to seek out work. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 739 (on February 11, 2015, discussing that Plaintiff applied for job as a peer counselor at PROS, staff had encouraged him to apply, but he ultimately\n   was not given the position);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 742 (on March 11, 2015, \"[Plaintiff] notes that despite having been turned down [for] the position as a peer counselor through this agency, he continues to look through other programs for similar positions\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ms. Selden completed a functional capacity questionnaire in February 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 376-81). She noted that Plaintiff's treatment frequency had been reduced to one visit per month, but that he was apprehensive about returning to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 376). Ms. Selden opined that Plaintiff's performance in mental abilities and aptitudes for simple work was precluded for less than ten percent of an eight-hour workday in almost all work areas, with the exception of working in coordination with or proximity to others, accepting criticism from supervisors, and getting along with co-workers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 378-79). Ms. Selden further opined that Plaintiff would be absent from work for more than four days per month and was not able to engage in fulltime employment due to a lack of motivation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 380). The ALJ assigned some weight to Ms. Selden's opinions relating to Plaintiff's mental functioning capacities, based on the treatment relationship and consistency with the record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78). However, the ALJ noted that the conclusion that Plaintiff was unable to work was contrary to Ms. Selden's assessment of Plaintiff's mental functioning capacity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In July 2015, Ms. Selden opined that Plaintiff was able to work for ten hours per week and had normal functioning in his ability to perform simple work and maintain attention and concentration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 395-98). The ALJ assigned \"little weight\" to this opinion, because Ms. Selden's restriction of Plaintiff's work to ten hours was not supported by her treatment notes, which indicated that she had encouraged Plaintiff to seek out employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79). As noted above, Ms. Selden's treatment notes reveal that she encouraged Plaintiff to seek out employment and indicated that Plaintiff was ready to return to the workforce. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 750 (on April 14, 2015, Ms. Selden \"inquired about and engaged in active listening while [Plaintiff] spoke of his efforts to engage in change to improve upon his ability to seek out paid work\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 757 (on May 12, 2015, discussing that Plaintiff fears that his wife will interfere with his ability to keep a job; Ms. Selden acknowledged Plaintiff's fears but \"connected how continuing to do what he's always done limits his ability to see positive change in his life\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 762 (\"within the last three months [Plaintiff] continued to state that he has not accepted the fact that he is ready to work...\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 602 (treatment notes from PROS at Genesee reveal that Plaintiff wanted to be employed as a PROS peer specialist) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In September 2015, Ms. Selden completed another employability assessment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 770-73). Ms. Selden opined that Plaintiff was only moderately limited in most areas of mental functioning, but could not work at all for three months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 772). The ALJ assigned \"little weight\" to this opinion because it conflicted with Ms. Selden's notes, which showed ongoing improvement in Plaintiff's mood, and treatment focused on legal issues with his ex-wife and obtaining housing, rather than addressing mental health-related limitations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 751 (\"[Plaintiff] points to other contributing factors to the reasons why he has not been able to make changes ... including being harassed by his ex wife, not having secure housing\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 757 (\"While meeting [Plaintiff] noted that he continues to feel stressed in regard to fears that his ex wife is going to press false charges against him....\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Ms. Selden also completed another medical source statement in September 2015, which was similar to the assessment she completed in February 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 775-81). Ms. Selden opined that Plaintiff would be precluded from performing a number of tasks up to twenty percent of the time, struggled working with others, would be \"off-task\" thirty percent of the day, and could not engage in full-time employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ assigned \"little weight\" to this opinion, because it conflicted with Ms. Selden's treatment notes, which showed ongoing improvement in terms of Plaintiff's mental functioning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78-79). The ALJ also noted that the limitations included in the September 2015 evaluation were more severe than those included in the February 2015 evaluation, and that the increase in severity also was contrary to Ms. Selden's reports of improvement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court has reviewed the treatment notes from Catholic Family Center authored by Ms. Selden, and finds that the ALJ's assessment of Ms. Selden's opinions is reasonable. As an initial matter, by virtue of her status as a social worker, Ms. Selden's opinions are not entitled to any special weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barco v. Comm'r of Soc.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7 at 76-79). It is clear from the written determination that the ALJ considered Plaintiff's treatment history with Ms. Selden, including the length and frequency of treatment; the evidence supporting Ms. Selden's opinions; and the consistency of Ms. Selden's opinions with her own treatment notes, as well as the record as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Further, it is well-settled that an ALJ may discount an opinion when it is internally inconsistent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilber v.

Sept. 2014) (ALJ may discount the opinion of a treating physician when the opinion is internally inconsistent, inconsistent with other evidence, and inconsistent with the plaintiff's testimony). As noted by the ALJ several times in the written determination, Ms. Selden's opinion that Plaintiff was not able to work, or was able to work only five to ten hours per week, conflicts with her own treatment notes and mental health assessments. For example, Ms. Selden's mental health assessments of Plaintiff reveal only moderate limitations in almost every level of mental functioning. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7 at 366, 378-79, 384, 389, 393, 397). These relatively modest limitations conflict with Ms. Selden's assertion that Plaintiff is unable to work. Further, as noted above, the mental health treatment notes in the record reveal Plaintiff's improvement in handling the limitations\n   caused by his mental impairment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 596, 598). Moreover, despite her stated opinion that Plaintiff is unable to work, Ms. Selden repeatedly encouraged Plaintiff to start working. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 739, 742, 750, 757). In sum, Ms. Selden's opinions that Plaintiff is unable to work are not supported by the evidence in the record and, coupled with the fact that her opinions were not \"medical opinions,\" the ALJ properly afforded them \"little weight.\" Remand on this basis is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The RFC is Supported by Substantial Medical Evidence in the Record\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff also contends that the ALJ improperly assessed the RFC based on his own lay interpretation of the medical record.

The mental RFC finding is adequately supported by the record, and it is clear to the Court how the ALJ arrived at the assessed mental RFC. For example, the portion of the RFC assessment concluding that Plaintiff can perform work that requires sufficient attention and concentration to understand, remember, and follow simple instructions, is supported by the opinion issued by Dr. Brownfleld, who found that Plaintiff had no limitation in following and understanding simple directions and instructions and performing simple tasks independently, and was only mildly limited in maintaining attention and concentration, and learning new tasks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 352). Similarly, Ms. Selden's mental health assessments reveal only moderate limitations in almost every level of mental functioning, including the capacity to follow, understand, and remember simple instructions and directions; performing simple and complex tasks independently; and maintaining attention and concentration for rote tasks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 366, 378-79, 384, 389, 393, 397). In a more recent evaluation from July 2015, Ms. Selden opined that Plaintiff had no limitations in following, understanding, and remembering simple instructions and directions, as well as maintaining attention and concentration for rote tasks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 397).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The portion of the RFC finding that Plaintiff can work primarily alone, with occasional supervision, is also supported by the record. For example, Dr. Brownfield opined that Plaintiff has difficulty \"relating adequately to others,\" and \"may require supervision\" (Dkt. 7 at 352), which supports an RFC that allows Plaintiff to work primarily alone with some supervision. Likewise, Ms. Selden opined that Plaintiff \"cannot work in large crowds\" and \"requires supervision with a person who can collaborate positively.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 367;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 366, 384, 389, 393, 397 (Plaintiff only moderately limited in his ability to perform simple and complex tasks independently);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 378 (Plaintiff less than ten percent precluded from sustaining an ordinary routine without special supervision) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the ALJ's RFC finding \"directly contrasts\" with the opinion evidence in the record. (Dkt. 12-1 at 28). However, when assessing the RFC, the ALJ's conclusion need not \"perfectly correspond with any of the opinions of medical sources cited in his decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Matta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147245\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/508/53/#p56\">\n    508 F.

Simply because the ALJ did not adopt precisely the opinions of Dr. Brown and Ms. Selden does not mean that the RFC assessment is not consistent with their assessment of Plaintiff's capabilities, particularly those relating to Plaintiffs mental functioning. In sum, it is clear to the Court how the ALJ arrived at the assessed RFC. There are several opinions in the record that are consistent with the assessed mental limitations, and the ALJ's deviation from those opinions was adequately described in the written determination.

Likewise, the assessed RFC properly accounts for Plaintiff's limitations in dealing with work-related stress, which appeared to stem from Plaintiff's inability to work well with others and take instruction from authority figures. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 778-80 (Plaintiff \"has a history of lashing out towards authority figures at work, struggles when being told what to do, and is easily agitated\"; Plaintiff has \"anger, irritability, lack of motivation, fear of socialization\"; and Plaintiff \"would be triggered when in a structured setting [with] coworkers and administrative staff\") ). The ALJ's failure to include specifically in the RFC all of the mental limitations assessed by Dr. Brownfield and Ms. Selden does not necessitate remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff further contends that the ALJ failed to account for Plaintiff's moderate limitation in concentration, persistence, and pace, and that his failure to do so \"is in contrast to his previous finding that Plaintiff has moderate difficulties in concentration, persistence and pace.\" (Dkt. 12-1 at 24). Plaintiff points specifically to the ALJ's step three finding that, with regard to the \"paragraph B\" criteria used to assess mental impairments, Plaintiff has \"moderate difficulties\" for concentration, persistence, and or pace. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7 at 72). Plaintiff's argument misses the mark. As noted above, the ALJ limited Plaintiff to performing only \"work that requires sufficient attention and concentration to understand, remember and follow simple instructions[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).
