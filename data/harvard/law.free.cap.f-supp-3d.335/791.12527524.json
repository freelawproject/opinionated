Taxpayers with Canadian revenue claims are not similarly situated to taxpayers without Canadian revenue claims. Moreover, even assuming Retfalvi could satisfy the similarly situated inquiry, any such classification is rationally related to a legitimate government objective. The Treaty (including Article 26A) was enacted to expand trade and investment between the United States and Canada and to \"permit[ ] collection of tax liabilities in Canada in exchange for assisting Canada in collecting tax liabilities in the United States.\" [D.E. 10] 27-28;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   David J.

Preventing the United States from reviewing the validity of a finally determined\n   Canadian revenue claim is rationally related to the objective of working with Canada to collect outstanding tax liabilities. If the United States inquired into the validity of Canadian revenue claims, it would impede collection efforts and frustrate foreign policy and foreign relations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    R.J.

As stated, the Treaty represents an agreement between the United States and Canada to work together to expand trade and investment and to help each other collect outstanding tax liabilities. As part of the Treaty, both countries agreed that they would not assist in collecting outstanding revenue claims for years in which the taxpayer was a citizen of the requested state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.J.

This agreement reflects our government's policy preference against enforcing foreign tax laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 117-18.
