Accordingly, Google satisfies the third element of section 230(c)(1) immunity.

TAC \u00b6\u00b6 587-88. According to Plaintiffs, this claim is not based upon Google's role in providing a publishing platform. Instead, Plaintiffs state this claim is based upon the allegation that Google violated section 2339C(c)\"with regard to material support or resources that\n    <em>\n     other individuals and entities provided to ISIS\n    </em>\n    in violation of \u00a7 2339B.\" Opp'n 8 (emphasis added).

Opp'n 12-13. Once again, this contention does not square up with the allegations supporting the concealment claim. According to the TAC, Plaintiffs seek to hold Google liable based on its operation of YouTube. Plaintiffs allege that even though \"Google's own terms and policies ostensibly bar ISIS and other foreign terrorist organizations ... from using Google ... and Google has publicly claimed that it does not permit ISIS to use Google's Platform and Services ... in practice, Google has nevertheless knowingly provided its Platform and Services to ISIS, its members and affiliates[.]\" TAC \u00b6\u00b6 200-201. Thus, \"by falsely representing that it does not permit ISIS\" to use YouTube \"when in fact\n    <em>\n     it has knowingly continued to provide its Platform, Services and accounts to ISIS\n    </em>\n    , Google has concealed and disguised the nature, location, source, or ownership of material support or resources, knowing that they are used in preparation for, or in carrying out, criminal terrorist activity.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n     at \u00b6\u00b6 201-02\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). Plaintiffs' \"new\" concealment claim does little more than restate the material support claims in a slightly different form. All of those claims are barred by section 230(c)(1) as discussed above. Based on the allegations in the TAC, at its core, Plaintiffs' concealment claim ultimately seeks to hold Google liable for allegedly failing to prevent ISIS and its supporters from using YouTube, and by failing to remove ISIS videos from YouTube. As with claims one through four, the concealment claim \"requires recourse to that content\" to establish any causal connection between Google permitting ISIS to use YouTube and the Paris attack.

Specifically, the TAC does not allege a direct relationship between the \"material support\" that Google allegedly provided to ISIS and the Paris attack. While the TAC includes detailed allegations regarding the alleged use of YouTube by ISIS and its affiliates, the TAC does not allege any facts plausibly connecting the general availability of YouTube with the attack itself.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Plaintiffs assert in their supplemental brief that the TAC alleges the \"extensive use of YouTube by ISIS recruiters to recruit ISIS terrorists in France and Belgium.\" Pls.' Supp. Br. 4 (citing TAC \u00b6\u00b6 311-41). They also argue that the TAC alleges that the \"operational leader of the Paris Attacks, Abdelhami Abaaoud, distributed an ISIS YouTube video of himself recruiting ISIS terrorists, and the suicide bomb-maker of the Paris Attacks, Najim Laachraoui, also distributed links to jihadi YouTube videos.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275261\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/739/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citing TAC \u00b6\u00b6 344-63). However, the actual allegations supporting these claims are far too attenuated and speculative to establish proximate causation between Google's operation of YouTube and the Paris attacks. For example, as to allegations regarding the use of YouTube to recruit terrorists in France and Belgium, the TAC alleges that there were three \"active and successful ISIS recruiting networks in Belgium\": Sharia4Belgium, Resto du Tawhid, and the Zerkani Network. TAC \u00b6 310. Plaintiffs then allege a connection between the Zerkani Network and the Paris Attacks, in that Abaaoud, \"considered the operational leader of the Paris Attack,\" was one of Zerkani's recruits.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 344. Plaintiffs allege that the founders of the three recruiting networks \"used and relied on social media to build and maintain connections with ISIS recruits,\" TAC \u00b6 332, but the TAC alleges that only Sharia4Belgium and Resto du Tawhid \"used YouTube as a primary tool for indoctrination and recruitment to ISIS.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 333-39. The TAC does not actually contain allegations about the Zerkani Network's use of YouTube.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    As to Abaaoud, the TAC alleges only that Abaaoud \"was an active user of social media,\" including YouTube, and that in March 2014, over a year and a half before the Paris attacks, Abaaoud \"posted a link on his Facebook account to an ISIS recruiting video on YouTube in which Abaaoud and other ISIS members in Syria and Iraq appear, describing their life and role in ISIS.\" TAC \u00b6\u00b6 349, 356-58. With respect to Laachraoui, who Plaintiffs allege \"prepared the explosives for the suicide bombs used in the Paris Attack,\" the TAC alleges only that he \"actively followed ISIS social media accounts and posted links to\n    <em>\n     jihadi\n    </em>\n    YouTube videos on his own accounts as well.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 359, 362. These are the only allegations connecting any of the individuals who committed the Paris attack to YouTube. They do not support a finding that Google's provision of the YouTube platform to ISIS \"had any direct relationship with the injuries\" that Plaintiffs suffered.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Fields\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275261\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/739/\">\n     881 F.3d at 749\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Plaintiffs' revenue sharing claims also do not support a finding of proximate causation under the\n    <em>\n     Fields\n    </em>\n    standard. Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that Google shared advertising revenue with ISIS. They argue that \"such support contributed to the Paris attack because even if not used directly, [it] allowed other ISIS funds to be used to support the attack.\" Opp'n 24-25;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    TAC \u00b6 533.

Specifically, the Ninth Circuit held that \"[a]ccepting the fungible nature of material support does not require a court to also\n    hold that\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    reckless contribution to a terrorist group or affiliate, no matter its attenuation, must result in civil liability.

CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the TAC is dismissed. With the exception of Plaintiffs' revenue sharing claims, the claims in the TAC are all premised on the theory that Google permitted ISIS and its supporters to use the YouTube platform to disseminate a terrorist message. Claims five and six simply attempt to repackage this theory under a different name. All of these claims fall within the scope of the CDA's immunity provision and are thus barred. As Plaintiffs have already been given an opportunity to amend the complaint to avoid CDA immunity, all of their claims other than the revenue sharing claims are dismissed with prejudice. Since the court cannot conclude that further amendment of Plaintiffs' revenue sharing claims would be futile, they are granted one final opportunity to amend those claims in a manner consistent with Rule 11. Any amended complaint shall be filed within 14 days of the date of this order. The fourth amended complaint may not contain any claims for relief that the court has already dismissed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    <strong>\n     IT IS SO ORDERED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-117\">\n     Plaintiffs bring claims one and two pursuant to section 2333(d).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-118\">\n     <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20223\">\n      47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223\n     </extracted-citation>\n     prohibits obscene or harassing telephone calls in the District of Columbia or in interstate or foreign communications.\n     <extracted-citation index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20231\">\n      47 U.S.C. \u00a7 231\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , the Child Online Protection Act, prohibits the knowing making of a communications by means of the World Wide Web \"for commercial purposes that is available to any minor and that includes material that is harmful to minors.\"\n     <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20231\">\n      47 U.S.C. \u00a7 231\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (a)(1).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"8\">\n    <p id=\"p-119\">\n     The parties do not dispute that Google is an interactive computer service provider.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"9\">\n    <p id=\"p-120\">\n     Plaintiffs acknowledge this concession by stating that they \"have largely retained the factual allegations and claims from the SAC to preserve them in the event an appeal may be necessary.\" Opp'n 2 n.2.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"10\">\n    <p id=\"p-121\">\n     The district court also held that Twitter was immune from the claims pursuant to section 230, because the plaintiffs' claims sought to treat Twitter as the publisher of ISIS's content.\n     <em>\n      Fields\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275261\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/739/\">\n      881 F.3d at 741\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .
