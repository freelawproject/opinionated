Undisp. Fact \u00b6 1. The policy covered a certain site in Walnut Creek where Essex intended to demolish existing structures and build a new, mixed-use development.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jt. Undisp. Fact \u00b6\u00b6 4-6. As part of this project, Essex had to do some excavation in the site. During excavation, Essex discovered debris within part of the site (the \"Excavated Area\")-more specifically, wood,\n   concrete, glass, metal, tires, and large, buried tree trunks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jt. Undisp. Fact \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Essex had that debris removed. The parties reached a settlement regarding the cost to Essex of removing the debris. The instant case concerns whether, under the insurance policy, Aspen should have paid for other costs incurred by Essex related to the site-in particular, costs incurred in re-designing a new shoring system allegedly necessitated by the debris outside the Excavated Area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Currently pending before the Court is Aspen's motion for summary judgment and Essex's motion for partial summary judgment. Having considered the parties briefs and accompanying submissions, as well as the oral argument of counsel, the Court hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Aspen's motion and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Essex's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As noted above, Essex purchased an insurance policy titled \"Environmental Legal Liability Policy\" from Aspen.

Undisp. Fact \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Prior to demolition and construction, the site consisted of small retail shops, small office buildings, and a paved parking lot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 32-1 (Bain Decl. \u00b6 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also appears that a gas station previously operated at the site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 32-1 (Bain Decl. \u00b6 3). Essex's plan was \"create a mixed residential and commercial use development with underground parking two levels below grade.\" Docket No. 32-1 (Bain Decl. \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As part of the project, excavation was required, and Essex had a temporary shoring system designed for it \"to protect the integrity of the excavation, as well as to stabilize the area outside of excavation.\" Docket No. 32-2 (Berger Decl. \u00b6 3);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Jt. Undisp. Fact \u00b6 6 (stating that Essex had a \"shoring system\" designed for it \"as part of the planned construction and mixed-use development at the Site\"); Docket No. 32-1 (Bain Decl. \u00b6 5) (testifying that ENGEO, the company Essex hired to do a geotechnical report for the site, \"recommended temporary shoring to facilitate construction of the underground parking and development\"). The temporary shoring system \"consisted of retaining walls anchored by 'tie backs' drilled at a downward angle into soil outside the retaining walls.\" Jt. Undisp. Fact \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During excavation, Essex discovered debris buried in the Excavated Area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jt. Undisp. Fact \u00b6 11. \"The debris consisted of wood, concrete, glass, metal, tires, and large, buried tree trunks.\" Jt. Undisp. Fact \u00b6 12. Essex ultimately had that debris removed and, as noted above, the parties reached a settlement regarding the cost of removing the debris from the Excavated Area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The dispute between the parties is related to the area\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   of the Excavated Area. Essex maintains that (1) there is debris outside of the Excavated Area and that (2) the debris outside of the Excavated Area caused certain tie-backs of the shoring system to fail. The tie-backs that failed were anchored into soil outside of the Excavated Area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jt. Undisp. Fact \u00b6 20. According to Aspen, there is no evidence or insufficient evidence of debris outside of the Excavated Area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Jt.

Undisp. Fact \u00b6 18. Instead, Essex has asked Aspen to cover the cost of re-designing the shoring system on the theory that the debris outside of the Excavated Area, where the tie backs were anchored, caused the tie backs to fail, thus necessitating a re-design in the shoring system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Essex has asserted the following claims for relief: declaratory relief, breach of contract, and bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 provides that a \"court shall grant summary judgment [to a moving party] if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The court must look first to the language of the contract in order to ascertain its plain meaning or the meaning a layperson would ordinarily attach to it. In searching for a plain meaning, a court is to interpret the language of an agreement in its \"ordinary and popular sense, unless used by the parties in a\n   technical sense.\" A policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable. Language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole, and in the circumstances of the case, and cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract. Courts will not strain to create an ambiguity where none exists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, if possible, intent is determined solely from the written provisions of the insurance policy. If the policy language is clear and explicit, it governs. However, if this \"plain meaning\" approach fails to resolve the ambiguities, a court is to look at the objectively reasonable expectations of the policy holder. Finally, if the \"reasonable expectations\" approach does not resolve the ambiguity, the ambiguity is to be interpreted against the drafter (the insurer), since that party caused the ambiguities to exist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Perez-Encinas v.

If there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether there is debris in the area outside of the Excavated Area, then that would ordinarily preclude summary judgment in favor of either party. However, neither party is asking the Court to make a determination on summary judgment as to whether there is in fact debris in the area outside the Excavated Area. Rather, Aspen argues that, even assuming there is debris outside of the Excavated Area, debris cannot be a \"pollutant\" under the insurance policy.

It is also consistent with the examples of \"pollutant\" provided in the policy (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , smoke, hazardous substances) and with other policy provisions; in particular, the policy provides that Aspen will pay for \"clean-up cost\" which the policy defines as an expense incurred to,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , address contamination caused by a pollution condition \"to the extent required by\n   <em>\n    environmental\n   </em>\n   law\" or \"as determined reasonable and necessary by an\n   <em>\n    environmental\n   </em>\n   professional.\" Policy at 10 (emphasis added). Since Aspen's liability under the policy is tied to \"environmental\" matters, it is only logical that\n   \"pollutant\" likewise be defined as relating to environmental matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   To the extent Aspen advocates an even more restrictive interpretation of \"pollutant\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , something is a \"pollutant\" only \"if it is described as such in environmental law,\" Def.'s Opp'n at 10-the Court does not agree. First, as just indicated, Aspen's liability is not limited \"to the extent required by environmental law.\" Moreover, while Aspen has cited cases where courts have made reference to environmental law, those cases have not held that something is a pollutant\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   when it is described as such in environmental law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ortega Rock Quarry v.

Moreover, Aspen's attempt to narrow the\n   <em>\n    MacKinnon\n   </em>\n   interpretation of \"pollutant\" is particularly unwarranted given that the instant case involves a coverage clause, not an exclusion clause. Finally, as Essex points out, if Aspen wanted to so limit \"pollutant,\" it could easily have done so; in contrast to the definition of \"clean-up cost\" which expressly references \"environmental law,\" \"pollutant\" makes no such reference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The question is thus whether the kind of debris allegedly found here in the soil is commonly thought of as environmental pollution. Although it is not clear what kind of debris, if any, is actually in the area outside the Excavated Area, for purposes of this order, the Court assumes that the debris is the same kind of debris as that which was found in the Excavated Area-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , wood, concrete, glass, metal, tires, and large, buried tree trunks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Courts have reached varying conclusions as to whether this kind of debris constitutes environmental pollution.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur.

Therefore, the pollution exclusion did not excuse Ranger's duty to defend JV in the underlying lawsuit.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The policy itself does not provide any additional clarity. For example, while it lists some kinds of waste (\"low level radioactive matter or waste\" and medical, infectious or pathological waste or waste materials\") as \"pollutant[s],\" it does not necessarily foreclose other kinds of waste; the definition of \"pollutant\" uses the phrase \"including without limitation.\" Policy at 13. Aspen's invocation of the principle of ejusdem generis is unavailing precisely because \"pollutant\" was defined in this specific way. In contrast, in\n   <em>\n    Guam Industrial Services, Inc. v.

Essex argues that, in the alternative, the cost of the redesign should be considered a \"restoration cost.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Essex's arguments lack merit. For purposes of this decision, the Court assumes that the soil was \"contaminated\" because of the presence of debris in the area outside of Excavated Area. But even with that assumption, the redesigned shoring system neither contained nor neutralized the contaminated soil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To \"contain\" environmental pollution is to restrain or control the pollution or to check or halt its spread.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contain\n   </em>\n   (last visited August 10, 2018) (defining \"contain\" as \"restrain, control\" or \"check, halt\"). The redesigned shoring system did none of those things. The purpose of the redesigned shoring system was not to contain any environmental pollution but rather to provide structural support as part of the construction. While Essex correctly notes that nothing in the policy states that there is coverage only if the\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   purpose is to address environmental pollution, that is immaterial because, here, the purpose of the redesigned shoring system\n   had nothing to do with addressing environmental pollution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, as the Court noted at the hearing, under Essex's reasoning, the foundation ultimately poured would, by the nature of its solid structure, \"contain\" environmental pollution (by keeping it out of the Excavated Area), but one could hardly expect Aspen to cover the cost of the foundation under an environmental policy. In short, the shoring system was not installed to contain contaminated soil; it functioned structurally to keep soil out of the Excavated Area, soil which happened to be contaminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Essex's argument that the redesigned shoring system also \"neutralize[d]\" the environmental pollution fares no better. Neutralize means, in essence, to make ineffective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neutralize (last visited August 10, 2018) (defining \"neutralize\" to \"to counteract the activity or effect of: make ineffective\"). Essex did not neutralize the contamination because Essex left the contamination there; it did not render the contamination any less effective in terms of its impact on the environment. Although the redesign of the shoring system addressed the instability in the soil that was purportedly due to the debris, the revised shoring system neutralized instability, not\n   <em>\n    contamination\n   </em>\n   of the soil. Moreover, as Aspen points out, Essex did not even neutralize the instability because it left the debris there; instead Essex simply found a way to avoid the instability purportedly caused by the debris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To the extent Essex suggests that getting rid of the debris-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , physically removing it-would have been too expensive and a redesign was cheaper,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 32-1 (Bain Decl. \u00b6 17) (testifying that, \"[e]ven if Essex had access and the ability to excavate the debris affecting the tiebacks, that option was impractical based on the amount of time and much greater costs to achieve the same goal of containing and neutralizing the contaminated soil\"), that does not change the Court's analysis. At bottom, Essex incurred costs not because the debris was an environmental pollutant but rather because the debris caused the soil to be structurally less stable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, Essex protests that, at the very least, the cost of the redesign was a \"restoration cost\" under the policy. As noted above,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    [r]estoration cost\n   </strong>\n   means reasonable and necessary expense incurred by the insured with the insurer's prior written consent to repair or replace\n   <strong>\n    damaged real or personal property\n   </strong>\n   , when such damage\n   <strong>\n    occurs during the course\n   </strong>\n   of incurring covered\n   <strong>\n    clean-up cost\n   </strong>\n   , microbial matter prevention cost, emergency response cost or crisis cost, regardless of whether such damage to such real or personal property is caused by a\n   <strong>\n    pollution condition\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Policy at 13 (some bold omitted). However, the redesign cost is not a restoration cost. There is no \"damaged real or personal property.\" Although Essex claims that the \"original shoring system where the tie\n   back system failed\" is the \"damaged real property that needed to be 'repaired or replaced,' \" Pl.'s Opp'n at 15, the original shoring system was not damaged; rather, it was simply ineffective. Also, to be covered as a restoration cost, any damage to property must have occurred \"during the course of incurring covered clean-up cost\"; Essex has failed to show any such occurrence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 12 (arguing that \"Essex cannot identify any clean-up that damaged the tie backs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Aspen's motion for summary judgment. Even if debris constitutes a \"pollutant\" under the policy, debatable proposition, Aspen is entitled to summary judgment because, as a matter of law, the cost of redesigning the temporary shoring system is not a \"clean-up cost\" under the policy.
