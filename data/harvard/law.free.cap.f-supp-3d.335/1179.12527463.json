Drozd, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter came before the court for hearing on plaintiffs' unopposed motion for approval of a settlement under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") on March 6, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 58.) Attorney Paul Bird appeared on behalf of plaintiffs and attorney Arthur Hartinger appeared on behalf of defendants. Following the hearing, the court ordered plaintiffs to submit supplemental briefing addressing a number\n   of issues. (Doc. No. 62.) Plaintiffs timely filed this supplemental briefing on April 4, 2018. (Doc. No. 63.) For the reasons discussed below, the court denies plaintiffs' motion for approval of the proposed settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The complaint in this action was filed on July 28, 2016, alleging that defendants had violated the FLSA by under-paying municipal employees' overtime when the employees accepted cash in lieu of health care benefits, following the holding in\n   <em>\n    Flores v. City of San Gabriel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321912\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/890/\">\n    824 F.3d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2016). (Doc. No. 2.) A scheduling order was entered on November 1, 2016, setting a deadline for non-expert discovery to be completed by June 9, 2017 and expert discovery to be completed by September 20, 2017. (Doc. No. 32.) Prior to the passing of the discovery deadline, the parties stipulated to conditional certification of the action on February 23, 2017. (Doc. No. 37.) No substantive motion practice took place. A magistrate judge of this court held two separate settlement conferences in this action, one on October 2, 2017 (Doc. No. 47) and one on October 23, 2017 (Doc. No. 48). A settlement was reached following the second such conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This proposed settlement essentially encompasses three theories of liability plaintiffs have alleged against defendant. The first follows\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   directly, and alleges that any cash payments made to plaintiffs in lieu of healthcare benefits must be included in the calculation of overtime wages (the \"cash-in-lieu\" theory). (Doc. No. 63 at 5-6.) The second theory is an expansion of the holding in\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   , and seeks to have the total payments for healthcare benefits made by defendant on behalf of plaintiffs included in the calculation of overtime, regardless of whether they were paid as cash directly to plaintiffs or were in the form of healthcare benefits secured for plaintiffs (the \"total benefits plan\" theory). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.) Finally, plaintiffs seek to settle what they denote as their \"canine claim,\" which concerns alleged underpayment of the defendant's canine police officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The settlement agreement proposes a total payment of $375,000. (Doc. No. 58-3 at 3.) This total amount is designated to the following categories: $195,000 in damages to plaintiffs for both\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   theories of liability; $25,000 in damages for the canine claim; $5,000 total as incentive payments, awarding $2,500 each to plaintiffs Kerzich and Wertz; and $150,000 in attorneys' fees and costs to plaintiffs' counsel. (Doc. No. 58 at 16; Doc. No. 58-3 at 3-4.) Plaintiffs also request that a further 20 percent of the damages amounts and incentive payments be paid to plaintiffs' counsel as additional attorneys' fees. (Doc. No. 58-3 at 3-4.) Thus, counsel seeks an ultimate award of $195,000 in attorneys' fees and costs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 63 at 9.) The total award to be paid to the members of the collective on behalf of whom this case was brought is therefore $180,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The FLSA establishes federal minimum-wage, maximum-hour, and overtime guarantees that cannot be modified by contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Genesis Healthcare Corp. v.

(Doc. No. 58 at 20.) Were the court to accept the figures provided by counsel, the lodestar amount here would be $181,851. Lodestar amounts are presumed to be reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Camacho v.

In this case, the $150,000 designated as attorneys' fees by the proposed settlement is close to, albeit slightly beneath, the lodestar amount according to the parties. Of course, it is not unreasonable or improper for a party to agree to a moderate reduction in attorneys' fees in settlement of a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Staton v.

Had counsel here sought only $150,000 in attorneys' fees, this amount might have been considered reasonable, although the court would still have concerns about the discounting of the value of the claims discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   However, as noted, plaintiffs' counsel also seek an additional percentage of the damages award as attorneys' fees. In particular, the settlement agreement calls for plaintiffs' attorneys to receive an additional 20 percent of the damages portion of the judgment, divided on a per-share basis among all the class members. (Doc. No. 58-3 at \u00b6 4.) Thus, under the proposed settlement agreement plaintiffs' counsel would receive an additional 20 percent of the $225,000 awarded to the class-comprised of $195,000 for the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   claims, $25,000 for the canine claim, and $2,500 in incentive payments to each of the named plaintiffs-or another $45,000 in attorneys' fees. In short, plaintiffs seek approval of a settlement that will award $195,000 of the $375,000 settlement, or 52 percent of the total settlement, to plaintiffs' counsel. The court simply cannot condone a fee award\n   of this size-which would be more than double the Ninth Circuit benchmark for cases awarding attorneys' fees from a common fund,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vizcaino v.

Below, the court addresses each of counsels' arguments in support of the attorneys' fees under the proposed settlement, none of which the court finds to be persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   According to plaintiffs' counsel, \"[n]either the FLSA nor any case law prohibits an FLSA-plaintiff from signing a private fee agreement with her counsel to pay contingency fees from any damages she receives, as Plaintiffs have done here.\" (Doc. No. 63 at 9.) This may be the case. As a general matter, courts are rarely called upon to determine whether the private fee agreements attorneys strike with their clients are reasonable. Nonetheless, plaintiffs may not settle this case without court approval and the amount of attorneys' fees to be awarded is clearly one of the issues the court must consider when it is called upon to approve the fairness and reasonableness of a settlement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Trout v.

A dollar-for-dollar offset arrangement, like the one in\n   <em>\n    Venegas\n   </em>\n   , ensures that counsel will receive up to, but not more than, the total contingency amount to which the parties have agreed. In contrast, the payment structure contemplated here is essentially a contingency bonus.

(Doc. No. 58-3 at \u00b6 4.) Because the settlement agreement specifies a certain percent of attorneys' fees to be awarded, the court cannot simply reduce the award. Instead, the court must reject this settlement agreement as structured, because the award of attorneys' fees contemplated is excessive and renders the settlement unfair. The motion to approve the settlement\n   agreement will therefore be denied without prejudice to the parties renegotiating their agreement and resubmitting it for approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Having concluded that the proposed settlement must be rejected as drafted, the court need not definitively reach any further conclusions about the substantive fairness of the settlement at this point. However, because it seems likely the parties will seek to renegotiate the settlement agreement, the court provides the following further guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs' cash-in-lieu claim is premised on the Ninth Circuit's 2016 decision in\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   . Neither party disputes that cash payments made in lieu of healthcare benefits must be included in the overtime rate paid to the members of this collective action, and that pursuant to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   , defendants are liable for this amount of damages. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 58 at 9.) Nevertheless, despite the lack of a dispute on this point, plaintiffs' counsel still agreed to discount the value of the cash-in-lieu claims by 25 percent as part of the settlement of this action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 58 at 17; Doc. No. 58-4.) No satisfactory explanation has been provided to the court regarding why these claims-for which both liability and damages are certain and undisputed-has nevertheless been substantially discounted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Selk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328444\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/159/1164/#p1172\">\n    159 F.Supp.3d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If there is no question that the FLSA entitles plaintiffs to the compensation they seek, then a court will not approve a settlement because to do so would allow the employer to avoid the full cost of complying with the statute.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs' counsel also failed to include liquidated damages in their estimation of the value of the cash-in-lieu claim in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 63 at 5-6.)

(Doc. No. 58 at 9.) However, the court observes that, in\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   itself, the Ninth Circuit imposed liquidated damages, finding the defendant had not acted in good faith.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321912\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/890/\">\n    824 F.3d at 897, 905-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, the Ninth Circuit held that neither evidence that the city complied with other obligations under the FLSA nor evidence that it generally paid overtime at a rate more generous than required by law was sufficient to show the defendant had acted in good faith.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321912\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/890/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321912\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/890/\">\n    at 905-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit also found that, in order to meet the \"heavy burden\" of establishing a good faith defense, the employer must present evidence that it took \"the steps necessary to ensure [its] [ ] practices complied with [FLSA],\" and \"show that it actively endeavored to ensure such compliance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321912\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/890/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321912\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/890/\">\n    at 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Alvarez v.

This strongly suggests that, while some discounting of liquidated damages might be warranted in light of the settlement, completely excluding liquidated damages from the calculation\n   of potential damages here is most likely inappropriate. The argument that the law was not sufficiently settled prior to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   is not sufficient to entirely exclude the possibility of recovering liquidated damages, since such damages were awarded in\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, the total amount of damages suffered by the collective action members with respect to the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   claim is represented to be $103,107.17,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   exclusive of liquidated damages. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 58-4; Doc. No. 63 at 5-6.) Since liquidated damages are presumptively awardable, the appropriate starting point from which the court would consider the fairness of the settlement is therefore $206,214.34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Additionally, it appears that plaintiffs' counsel accepted a 75 percent discounting of damages recoverable on the total benefits plan theory. A greater discounting is certainly more reasonable on this claim since it is more novel. Similarly, a more significant discounting of liquidated damages is also appropriate here, since the more novel the claim is, the more likely a good faith defense is to succeed. Nevertheless, plaintiffs' counsel once again has omitted liquidated damages in their entirety from the calculation of the value of the claim. No representation has been made that liquidated damages were definitely not recoverable on this claim. Instead, plaintiffs' counsel explained that this claim was discounted by 75 percent, given that success on it was less likely. (Doc. No. 58 at 17; Doc. No. 58-4; Doc. No. 63 at 6-7.) Excluding liquidated damages entirely had the effect of halving the plaintiffs' recovery\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to counsel's discounting. No explanation has been provided to the court as to why the decision to discount plaintiffs' claim to this extent was reasonable or how it is consistent with the representations made to this court about the value of the claims presented. Considering that double damages are the norm under the FLSA (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237844\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/1249/#p1259\">\n    745 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1259 ;\n   <em>\n    Alvarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9103757\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/894/#p910\">\n    339 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   910 ;\n   <em>\n    Local 246 Util.

Counsel has provided no reason why liquidated damages were entirely excluded from these calculations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Taking the full value of the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   claims in this case as calculated by plaintiffs' counsel and adding to it liquidated damages, the total potential recovery appears to be $664,433.26. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 58-4.) According to the discounting plaintiffs' counsel represents was appropriate-a 25 percent discount of the cash-in-lieu claim and a 75 percent discount of the total benefits theory claim-the value of the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   claims in this case would therefore appear to be $320,769.07. However, the proposed settlement provides only for the payment of $195,000 in damages for these\n   claims, which is approximately 60 percent of their already-discounted value. In the court's view, counsel has not yet provided a satisfactory explanation why these claims were discounted by an additional 40 percent beyond what counsel considered to be a reasonable approximation of the value of the claims. While the court must reject the settlement as proposed due to the structuring of attorneys' fees as discussed above, the parties should bear in mind the court's comments if they attempt to seek court approval of any future proposed settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For the reasons given above, plaintiffs' motion for approval of this FLSA settlement (Doc. No. 58) is denied without prejudice to the parties attempting to settle this action in a manner that remedies the deficiencies identified above. The case is referred back to the assigned magistrate judge for further scheduling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    In the supplemental briefing, counsel provided itemized billing statements for their time expended on this case.

A cursory review the billing records submitted suggests some reduction in the time expended by counsel might be appropriate, since certain billed items appear duplicative or unnecessary, or are too vaguely described to allow any meaningful review. However, given the more significant problems with the proposed settlement discussed above, the court will not address particular billing entries at this juncture.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The court observes that hourly rates counsel provides-between $245 and $350 per hour-are on the high end of those typically approved in the Fresno division of the Eastern District of California, but within reason.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Dakota Med., Inc. v.

Plaintiffs' counsel, Jason Jasmine, has declared that 102 current and former employees have opted-in to this case. (Doc. No. 58-2 at \u00b6 8.)
