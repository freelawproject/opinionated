Martin Clark, with some exceptions. On July 25, 2016, during the time when the so-called \"ban\" was in place, Plaintiff asked his friends, Wendy Inzerillo and Denise Freeman, to file some papers on his behalf while he waited outside the courthouse. Both went into the clerk's office and, according to their sworn affidavits, while Freeman returned to the car to have Plaintiff sign a paper, Inzerillo overheard several Patrick County Sheriff's deputies speaking about Plaintiff. (Wendy Inzerillo Decl. \u00b6 6, May 30, 2018 [ECF No. 48-2].) According to Inzerillo, one deputy said, \"Brian [meaning Plaintiff] doesn't know what we have in store for him,\" while another commented that he couldn't \"wait to see his face when we take him down.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.) Inzerillo affirms in her declaration that Defendant Rob Coleman (\"Coleman\") was one of the officers involved in the conversation, but does not specify whether he was a speaker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) According the Inzerillo, a clerk in the courthouse alerted the deputies that Inzerillo was \"with him,\" meaning Clark, and the deputies ended their conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Inzerillo overheard the conversation among the deputies, Plaintiff and his sister, Beth Richardson, left the courthouse in her car. (Brian Clark Aff. \u00b6 6, May 30, 2018 [ECF No. 48-1].) As they were leaving, Plaintiff saw several deputies \"rush\" to their patrol cars. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While riding in the car with Richardson a short time later, Coleman effectuated a traffic stop on her car. According to Coleman, he saw Plaintiff make a \"gesture\" that \"concerned\" him, so he pulled the car over. (Robert Coleman Decl. \u00b6 7, May 14, 2018 [ECF No. 40-3].) Plaintiff categorically denies that he made any obscene, inappropriate, or concerning gesture to Coleman or anyone else. (Clark Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Plaintiff, after stopping the vehicle, Coleman approached the passenger side of the car; no officer approached the driver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17.) Coleman asked for Plaintiff's identification, which Plaintiff provided, and Coleman asked Plaintiff why he \"had 'gigged' him (or why [Clark] had given [Coleman] the finger).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Coleman returned to his car and, for twenty minutes, Clark and Richardson were detained. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While he was waiting to be released by Coleman, Clark avers that six additional police vehicles arrived on the scene: one state police vehicle, four sheriff's office vehicles, and a Black Dodge Charger driven by Defendant Sheriff Dan Smith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) A short time later, a seventh vehicle (the fifth sheriff's office vehicle) arrived on the scene. A Deputy Sheriff emerged from the car with a \"no trespass notice\" that he served on Clark. Plaintiff was then told he was free to go. Coleman does not assert that he was aware of the existence of the \"no trespass notice\" prior to the stop, but did state that it is standard procedure to ask for identification and run any individual stopped by the sheriff's department for outstanding warrants or process. In so doing, Coleman learned of the outstanding process to be served on Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff filed suit in this Court on July 10, 2017, against Defendants Rob Coleman, Geri Hazelwood, Sheriff Dan Smith, and Officer Does. [ECF No. 1.] He filed an Amended Complaint on April 5, 2018, substituting Deputy Ronnie Williams Jr., Deputy Dustin Dillon, Investigator Tyler Wilson, and Deputy Shawn Keffer for Officer Does. [ECF No. 33.] Sheriff Smith filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on May 16, 2018 [ECF No. 37], and Rob Coleman and Geri Hazelwood followed suit the next day [ECF Nos. 39, 41]. The motions were fully briefed by the parties, and I heard oral argument on the motions on July 12, 2018. After having reviewed the evidence and arguments of the parties, as well as the relevant law, the matter is now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Obviously, he is correct.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Blankenship v.

Va. 1996) (\"The Virginia Constitution creates five state officers which are charged with performing quintessential functions of state government: Commonwealth's Attorney, Treasurer, Commissioner of Revenue, Sheriff, and Clerk of the Court ... [T]hese officers are ... state actors and ... are entitled to immunity pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment.\").

I assume that Count II, which asserts a claim for \"Brief, Malicious Deprivation of Liberty Under Color of State Law,\" makes its claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \" Section 1983 of Title 42 creates a cause of action against any person who, acting under color of state law, abridges a right arising under the Constitution of the laws of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Cooper v.

In order to maintain a prima facie case under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must present facts showing that he was (1) deprived of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States, and that (2) the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\n   <em>\n    American Mfrs.

Even if such a conversation did occur, the record is devoid of its content. Likewise, there is no allegation, let alone factual support to show, that Smith was involved in the stop or played any role in Plaintiff's detention. As such, Plaintiff is unable to offer any proof that Smith deprived\n   him of any constitutional rights under color of state law, and thus has failed to adduce evidence to show that \"the alleged deprivation was committed by\" Smith.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313176\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/463/#p471\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Smith is also entitled to summary judgment on Count III, which asserts a claim for First Amendment retaliation. A plaintiff seeking to recover for First Amendment retaliation must show that \"(1) [he] engaged in protected First Amendment activity, (2) the defendants took some action that adversely affected [his] First Amendment rights, and (3) there was a causal relationship between [his] protected activity and the defendants' conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Constantine v.

Although not a case from this circuit, Duran was decided nearly twenty years ago and accurately states the law.
