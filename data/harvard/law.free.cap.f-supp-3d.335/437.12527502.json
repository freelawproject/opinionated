(Dkt. 1). This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Presently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Dkt. 7; Dkt. 12).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 135-38). In its order, the Appeals Council instructed the ALJ to do the following on remand: (1) obtain evidence from a medical expert to clarify the nature and severity of Plaintiff's impairments through December 31, 2006, the date Plaintiff was last insured for DIB purposes;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) further evaluate Plaintiff's mental impairments in accordance with the special technique described in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .1520a ; (3) give further consideration to Plaintiff's maximum residual functional capacity; and (4) obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational expert.

Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last met the insured status requirements of the Act on December 31, 2006, her \"date last insured.\" (Dkt. 6 at 20). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity from March 7, 2003, the alleged onset date, through the date last insured. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that, through the date last insured, Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of obesity, discogenic lumbar spine, and lumbar radiculopathy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff had the non-severe impairments of sleep apnea, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, and depression. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that, through the date last insured, Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 1.02 and 1.04 in reaching his conclusion, as well as considering the effect of Plaintiff's obesity as required by Social Security Ruling (\"SSR\") 02-1p. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that from the alleged onset date through the date last insured, Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform \"light work\" as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   cannot lift more than ten pounds, can sit for two hours in an eight hour day, can stand or walk for six hours in an eight hour day, has occasional limitations in the ability to bend, climb, stoop, squat, kneel, balance, and crawl, has occasional limitations in pulling with the upper extremities, has occasional limitations in the ability to reach in all directions, cannot work in areas with unprotected heights, cannot work around heavy, moving or dangerous machinery, cannot climb ropes, ladders or scaffolds and cannot work in areas with exposure to cold or dampness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, through the date last insured, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could have performed, including the representative occupations of usher, ticket taker, marker, and mail clerk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28). Accordingly, the ALJ found that, through the date last insured, Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

The Listings \"describe[ ] for each of the major body systems impairments that [the SSA] consider[s] to be severe enough to prevent an individual from doing any gainful activity, regardless of his or her age, education, or work experience.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.925\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

However, \"where the evidence on the issue of whether a claimant meets or equals the listing requirements is equipoise and 'credibility determinations and inference drawing is required of the ALJ' to form his conclusion at step 3, the ALJ must explain his reasoning.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1175601\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/675/464/#p469\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1175601\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/675/464/#p469\">\n    675 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   469 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In this case, Plaintiff argues that the ALJ's conclusion at step three that Plaintiff's spinal impairment did not meet or equal Listing 1.04A was unsupported by substantial evidence. The Court disagrees and finds that the ALJ fully and adequately explained his rationale at step three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At step three, the ALJ initially noted that medical expert Dr. Donald Goldman had testified that Plaintiff's orthopedic impairments equaled Listings 1.00(B)(2)(b), 1.02, and 1.04A in combination. (Dkt. 6 at 22). The ALJ explained that he gave little weight to this opinion by Dr. Goldman because (1) it was internally inconsistent, (2) it was not consistent with the requirements of the Listings, and (3) Dr. Goldman referenced treatment that occurred several years after Plaintiff's date last insured in reaching his conclusions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ further explained that Plaintiff's impairments did not meet or equal the requirements of Listings 1.02 or 1.04A because there was no evidence that Plaintiff had suffered any atrophy associated with muscle weakness or sensory or reflex loss, that Plaintiff lacked the ability to ambulate effectively or independently, or that Plaintiff was unable to sustain and complete normal activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ further noted that the reports of knee pain in the record were from 2007 and 2008, after Plaintiff's date last insured. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court finds no error in the ALJ's step three analysis. With respect to the ALJ's consideration of Dr. Goldman's testimony, \"[t]he ALJ has discretion in determining the amount of weight to give to various medical opinions and can determine to afford little weight to an opinion if it is inconsistent with the record as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Losquadro v.

Sept. 21, 2012). In this case, as the ALJ correctly noted, Dr. Goldman's testimony was internally inconsistent. Dr. Goldman testified that Plaintiff's impairments satisfied the requirements of Listing 1.04A, yet he also testified that there was \"no evidence\" of any impairment in range of motion, atrophy, deep-tendon reflex changes, weakness, or parasthesias.

Plaintiff testified that, during the relevant time period, her weight affected her ability to balance while walking and caused her to fall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68). Plaintiff also testified at the July 24, 2013, hearing that her weight caused her difficulty in using stairs, fitting into small places, sitting in chairs comfortably, walking, and engaging in \"general\n   activity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 85-86). With respect to whether Plaintiff's obesity was \"a significant factor\" in her impairments, Dr. Goldman testified that there were no specific findings to support that conclusion and that her claims in that regard were \"subjective ...

At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff's obesity was a severe impairment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20). At step three, the ALJ \"considered the effects of [Plaintiff's] obesity on [the considered] impairments as required by Social Security Ruling 02-1p\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22), but ultimately concluded, for the reasons set forth above, that Plaintiff's impairments did not meet or equal a Listing (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23). Then, in formulating his RFC assessment, the ALJ discussed and considered the medical evidence of record regarding Plaintiff's weight and its impact on her functioning, as well as Plaintiff's testimony regarding the impacts of her obesity.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). Moreover, because Plaintiff \"points to nothing in the record demonstrating that her obesity caused limitations in excess of those provided in the RFC, she has not met her burden of proof with respect to obesity-related limitations, nor established that any purported error in evaluating obesity harmed her in any way.\"\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

(Dkt. 7-1 at 6-8). The Court finds this argument without merit, for the reasons that follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In assessing the severity of mental impairments, the Commissioner's regulations require the ALJ to apply \"a 'special technique' at the second and third steps of the five-step framework.\"\n   <em>\n    Kohler v.

As the Second Circuit has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   This technique requires the reviewing authority to determine first whether the claimant has a medically determinable mental impairment.

The ALJ first found that Plaintiff had the medically determinable mental impairment of depression during the relevant time period. (Dkt. 6 at 21). The ALJ then considered each of the four functional areas and determined that: (1) Plaintiff had only mild limitations in her activities of daily living; (2) Plaintiff had only mild limitations in social functioning; (3) Plaintiff had no limitations in concentration, persistence, or pace; and (4) Plaintiff had experienced no episodes of decompensation of extended duration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Plaintiff's mental impairments were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any error in the ALJ's application of the special technique so as to warrant remand. Plaintiff argues the ALJ did not \"give proper weight\" to the first functional area (activities of daily living). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7-1 at 8-10). To the contrary, the ALJ's conclusion that Plaintiff had only mild limitations in this regard was well-supported by the evidence of record. As the ALJ noted, Plaintiff received significant psychiatric treatment in October 2000, several years before her alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 6 at 15). However, during the relevant time period, Plaintiff sought no treatment from a mental health professional and made only occasional complaints of depression to her primary care physician while consistently showing normal mood and affect. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 533, 541, 546, 855, 857). On the one occasion where her depression temporarily worsened, Plaintiff's doctor increased her antidepressant dosage, and she quickly improved. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 543, 540-41). Plaintiff testified that her medication was effective in treating her depression. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As the ALJ further noted, Plaintiff testified that during the relevant time period, she was able to do some cooking and cleaning, engage in scrapbooking, shop, go to church, visit friends, and drive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96-97).

(Dkt. 701 at 10-11). This argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With respect to VE Shader's testimony, as Defendant points out, the ALJ's decision arising from the July 24, 2013, hearing was vacated by the Appeals Council, in part because of deficiencies in consideration of the VE's testimony. The ALJ then held a second hearing, at which VE Pearson testified, and issued the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   decision in question in this case. VE Shader's testimony simply played no role in the determination that is currently before the Court.

In particular, the ALJ appropriately determined that Plaintiff was capable of performing a limited range of light work. As the ALJ explained, imaging studies of Plaintiff's spine during the relevant time period showed only mild to moderate degenerative changes that were inconsistent with the disabling limitations claimed by Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 6 at 24-25 (referring to\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 419, 745, 969, 1050) ).

For example, Plaintiff reported to her physicians in December 2005 that physical therapy was \"working wonders,\" that she had noted a 75% improvement in her symptoms, and that she continued to improve.

The ALJ also considered Plaintiff's statements regarding her pain and limitations, which he found partially credible. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26). Taking into account all of this information, the ALJ concluded that Plaintiff was capable of a limited range of light work, explaining that this conclusion was supported by \"the objective medical evidence showing only mild degenerative changes, [Plaintiff's] treatment history showing that with conservative treatment of physical therapy her back pain improved significantly, [Plaintiff's] admitted daily activities of daily living during the period and the lack of significant opinion evidence supporting disability.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   It is the function of an ALJ to \"weigh all of the evidence available to make an RFC finding that [is] consistent with the record as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Matta v.
