Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Schwein, a fifty-one year old woman, was hired by the Riverview Board as a teacher in 2001. Schwein is certified to teach elementary education, all subjects K-5, and all subjects K-8 in a self-contained classroom, as well as early childhood education. Schwein's position with RCSD is part of a bargaining unit represented by the Riverview Education Association, MEA/NEA (hereinafter \"Association\"). Schwein taught Kindergarten during her time with RCSD. Schwein entered an individual employment contract with RCSD and the Riverview Board on August 14,\n   2001. After her four year probationary period, Schwein was granted tenure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Riverview Community School District's rubric for evaluating teachers sets forth categories for which teachers are given individual numeric scores. The numeric scores are then totaled and combined with additional scores for \"average student attendance,\" \"personal growth rating,\" \"classroom observation rating,\" and \"student assessment data.\" The combined score ranges from 0-100, which is divided into the following designations: a score from 0-69 is considered \"Ineffective;\" a score form 70-79 is considered \"Minimally Effective;\" a score from 80-89 is considered \"Effective;\" and 90-100 is considered \"Highly Effective.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Schwein obtained scores that were \"Effective\" (or \"satisfactory\" under the prior RCSD evaluation system) or higher for every RCSD evaluation she received for teaching her Kindergarten class. Schwein alleges that \"Effective\" was the highest designation achieved within RCSD because the Superintendent instructed the Principals in RCSD to not give \"Highly Effective\" ratings. Schwein received an \"Effective\" performance evaluation from RCSD at the end of the 2014-2015 school year, with an individual score of 86.7 for teaching her Kindergarten class. Schwein alleges that there were several teachers employed by the Riverview Board who were given lower numeric evaluation scores than her, and several of those teachers taught in positions that Schwein is certified to hold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 1, 2015, RCSD Superintendent Russell Pickell (\"Pickell\") sent Schwein a letter informing her that she would be laid off effective that day due to \"the District's budget, staff performance, and the needs of its students.\" Schwein alleges that only one of the teachers that received a lower evaluation than Schwein was also laid off. The teachers that were not laid off continued to be actively employed by the Riverview Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On or about August 6, 2015, Pickell and the members of the Riverview Board were notified by teacher Susan Mesler (\"Mesler\") that she would be on leave from the District until at least January 2016. Schwein is certified to teach the full-time teaching position Mesler held. Schwein was not recalled to teach Mesler's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 1, 2015, Pickell sent Schwein an email entitled \"Part Time position,\" in which he offered to recall her to a \"part time specials schedule\" for the elementary schools. The part time position equated to a seventy-percent Kindergarten teaching position. Pickell also offered Schwein \"the RTI slots,\" or Response to Intervention, which was to equate to a thirty percent position. The RTI work would be paid at \"the para[professional] hourly rate.\" That would have been a significant reduction in Schwein's salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pickell stated that the position was offered only until Mesler returned from leave, at which time \"we would reevaluate district needs and you would most likely be back on lay-off.\" Schwein responded to Pickell on September 2, 2015, asking questions about the positions, and requesting twenty-four hours to consider whether to accept the position. Pickell responded on the next morning, stating \"I don't have 24 hours to give you,\" and requested that Schwein give him an answer by 9:00 a.m. on September 3, 2015. Schwein declined the position. The position that was offered to Schwein was filled by a new teacher on September 9, 2015. Neither Pickell nor the Riverview Board offered to recall Schwein into any other positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 3, 2015, Schwein exercised her right pursuant to the Bullard-Plawecki Employee Right to Know Act,\n   MCL 423.505 and placed a rebuttal letter regarding a previously-issued disciplinary letter in her personnel RCSD employee file. The letter was emailed to Pickell. Within a week of Schwein's submission of her rebuttal letter, on or before November 3, 2015, Pickell terminated Schwein's access to RCSD's email system, or caused her access to be terminated. The email system is the venue through which employees are notified of open positions within RCSD. When reminded of the fact that an employee on layoff status needed access to their email for this and other reasons, Pickell stated that the Association could provide Schwein with information regarding open positions within RCSD. On December 18, 2015, the Association filed a grievance over the termination of Schwein's access to RCSD email. In response to the grievance, Pickell emailed the Association leadership Merriam-Webster's definition of \"employee.\" Later, it was determined that Mesler would not return from her leave. Schwein was not offered Mesler's full-time teaching position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Prior to the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year, RCSD posted a vacant elementary technology position within RCSD that Schwein was certified to teach. The Association Grievance Chair, Aaron Robinson (\"Robinson\"), contacted Pickell to discuss the Association's position that the elementary technology teaching position should be given Schwein, who was still on layoff status. Pickell responded by stating that Schwein would not be recalled to the position, but that she could apply for the position. Pickell noted that he believed that Schwein might not be qualified for the position because it involved technology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   There was also a vacant 3rd grade teaching position that could have been filled by Schwein, but the Pickell did not inform the Association about that position. Schwein applied for the vacant elementary technology teaching position. Schwein was never informed about the vacant 3rd grade teaching position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the interview for the elementary technology teaching position, Pickell, who did not sit in on Schwein's interview, told Robinson that he believed Schwein had been \"coached\" for the interview. Schwein was not placed in either of the two vacant positions. The Riverview Board hired a first year teacher to fill the elementary technology teaching position, and hired a female teacher who had never worked within RCSD to fill the 3rd grade teaching position. Schwein alleges that the woman is the sister of one of the RCSD administrators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On or about September 30, 2016, Pickell attempted to have the Association sign a \"Memo of Understanding\" which states, \"Jennifer Schwein has no rights to recall with the Riverview Community School District in regards to Michigan law and the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\" The \"memo\" lays out eight (8) bullet points of training Schwein would be required to take under the contract, and then states: \"Upon completion of the named Professional Development, Jennifer Schwein will be eligible for placement in a district position within her certification.\" The \"memo\" also sets out additional requirements that Schwein would need to meet upon being placed in a teaching position, and concludes that \"[f]ailure to comply with any of the conditions outlined in this agreement will result in termination of employment.\" The \"Memo of Understanding\" was not signed by the Association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In or around June 2017, RCSD posted a vacant early elementary teacher position Schwein was certified to teach. On July 10, 2017, the Association informed Pickell that Schwein should be recalled to the position. Pickell responded on July 10, 2017, refusing to recall Schwein to the position. Pickell\n   did, however, invite Schwein to interview for any of the openings within RCSD. Schwein applied and was interviewed for the position, but was not offered the position. Schwein alleges that she had not received feedback from the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Schwein continues to apply and interview for positions within RCSD. In September 2017, Schwein applied and interviewed for a fifth grade position at Forest Elementary School. Schwein was not offered the position. Also in fall of 2017, there was a third grade vacancy at Memorial Elementary School within RCSD. Schwein alleges that the position vacancy was never posted. Schwein was not offered the position. Schwein alleges that the position was offered to former paraprofessional Vanessa Rosecrans. To date, Schwein remains on layoff status with the Riverview Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 2011, the Michigan Legislature amended the Revised School Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20380.1\">\n    Mich.

Comp. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 380.1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 380.1249. These statutes were part of a package of laws that changed the way in which school boards and school districts made personnel decisions that resulted in teacher layoffs. Prior to 2011, layoffs and recall were proper subjects of collective bargaining, so the collective bargaining agreements controlled. Under the amendments, teacher layoff and recall are no longer subject to collective bargaining but must be based instead on teacher effectiveness. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20380.1248\">\n    Mich. Comp.

Comp. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 380.1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) &amp; 380.1249(4). The Michigan legislature also amended the TTA in 2011. Prior to 2011 amendments to the statute, layoff and recall were also governed by the TTA, which stated a minimum number of years that a school district must keep a tenured teacher on the list of teachers eligible for recall.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%2038.105\">\n    Mich.

Schwein argues that the TTA also governed layoff and recall rights,\n   <em>\n    Baumgartner\n   </em>\n   did not state that the TTA never governed teacher layoff and recall, and Schwein is not arguing that she had a contract right concerning layoff, only that her contract right is to \"continuous employment.\" (Doc # 21, Pg. 25)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court agrees with Schwein. First, the issue in\n   <em>\n    Baumgartner\n   </em>\n   was whether the State Tenure Commission had jurisdiction over questions related to layoff and recall, not whether the TTA governed teacher layoff and recall. Second,\n   <em>\n    Baumgartner\n   </em>\n   is not relevant to determining whether Schwein's right to continuous employment has been impaired by Defendants' reliance on the state policies in question. Third, even if teacher layoff and recall were governed solely by the CBA, as the Michigan AG would have it, several articles in the CBA, including Article XVI, Section 5 entitled \"Dismissals,\" state that the policies prescribed in the agreement shall be followed \"in accordance with\" the TTA. (see Doc # 17-2, art. XVI) The teacher personnel decisions were governed by the CBA and the TTA prior to 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Michigan AG is correct in asserting that constitutional prohibitions against impairing contract obligations do not prevent state legislatures from setting the legal parameters for future contracts.

In support of this position, the Michigan AG highlights three provisions to the TTA (\u00a7\u00a7 38.83, 38.92, and 38.172) that specifically refer to teacher contracts and agreements with local school boards. In addition, the Michigan AG notes that the title of the TTA states that it is \"AN ACT ... to regulate discharges or demotions....\" Mich. Comp. Laws. Ch. 38, Act 4 Note. The Michigan AG contends that the aforementioned provisions and language within TTA indicates that the\n   statute was meant to regulate teachers' contracts with local school boards. In response, Schwein argues that teacher contracts are regulated by separate statutes, such as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20380.1231\">\n    Mich.

While Schwein is correct that the Indiana teacher tenure statute and the Michigan TTA are substantially similar in many respects, Schwein's argument is unpersuasive for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The holding in\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   is partially reliant upon the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Indiana ex rel.

In\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the 1927 Indiana Teachers' Tenure Act contained language that indicated the Indiana Legislature intended to create contractually binding relationships with teachers employed by local school districts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6137957\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/95/#p104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6137957\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/95/#p104\">\n    at 105-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6137957\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/95/#p104\">\n    58 S.Ct. 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
