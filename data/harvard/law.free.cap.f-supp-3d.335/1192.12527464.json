Following oral argument, the matter was taken under submission. For the reasons given below, the court will grant plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and will deny in part and grant in part defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of this case are essentially undisputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs own and operate Valley Bowl, a bowling center located at 12829 Highway 145, Madera, California. (Doc. No. 35-1 at 1.) On June 3, 2016, two roof trusses that helped support the roof of Valley Bowl (Truss Line 2 and Truss Line 5) failed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) These truss failures caused the building ceiling, overhead monitors, and disco ball to drop approximately six to ten inches, and also caused ceiling tiles and a layer of insulation to fall to the tabletops and counters below. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) As a result of the truss failures, the ceiling fell to a height lower than it was originally constructed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, the truss failures caused damages to at least one of Valley Bowl's exterior walls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) A general contractor named Tom Powers and Madera County Building Inspector Harry Hinton inspected the damage to Valley Bowl on the same day the trusses failed, June 3, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Madera County immediately ordered the business closed for public safety reasons until the necessary repairs could be completed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) Plaintiffs hired Powers to shore up the roof support system and prevent a complete collapse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Following Powers' direction, the plaintiffs installed temporary braces that same day in order to prevent a complete collapse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Powers performed interim repairs between late June 2016 and July 2016 to shore up the building's roof. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Following the shoring by Powers, plaintiffs were able to re-open the bowling alley to the public. (Doc. No. 37 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs had a commercial insurance policy with defendant in place on June 3, 2016. (Doc. No. 35-1 at 5.) The policy affords coverage for all direct physical losses unless excluded or limited. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While damages caused by collapse are typically excluded from coverage, plaintiffs purchased additional coverage specifically to provide protection in the event of collapse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) The relevant part of the \"Additional Coverage - Collapse\" provision reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Additional Coverage - Collapse\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The coverage provided under this Additional Coverage, Collapse, applies only to an abrupt collapse as described and limited in D.1. through D.7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1.

We will pay for direct physical loss or damage to Covered Property, caused by abrupt collapse of a building or any part of a building that is insured under this Coverage Form or that contains Covered Property insured under this Coverage Form, if such collapse is caused by one or more of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a.

No. 35-1 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs submitted their insurance claim on June 3, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant retained structural engineer Mike Jundt to investigate the causes of the structural damage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) On June 17, 2016, Jundt concluded Truss Line 2 failed \"as the result of a hidden anomaly present in the natural occurring wood member material and the degradation of the wood fibers due to the daily and seasonal cycling of temperature and humidity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Jundt concluded, meanwhile, that Truss Line 5 failed \"as a result of the combination of a defective method of construction and the degradation of the wood fibers due to the daily and seasonal cycling of temperature and humidity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, Jundt concluded that the most likely reason for Truss Line 5's failure was the method of construction used to create the steel side plate connection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Doc. No. 37 at 30-31.) According to Jundt, welding side plates to connect bolts to the wooden beams is a common practice in the construction industry but it creates a connection that is \"unable to adapt to the changing geometry of a large wood timber truss exposed to gravity loads over it[ ]s anticipated life.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.) Additionally, Jundt concluded that plaintiffs' efforts to shore up the trusses prevented further failures in the roof trusses which could have led to complete collapse with little further warning. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In a letter dated June 13, 2016, defendant's third party claims administrator advised plaintiffs that it had assigned Jundt to investigate the loss, but noted that \"since the roof did not collapse the additional coverage under your policy for collapse does not apply.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.) Over the next several months, defendant continued to investigate the causes of the truss failures, communicating this to plaintiffs in July and August 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-54, 57.) Nevertheless, in an August 16, 2016 letter to the plaintiffs, defendant reiterated its position that the additional coverage did not apply because the roof did not collapse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.) Defendant retained attorney John Feeley, on August 25, 2016 to provide a coverage analysis for plaintiffs' claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58.) Attorney Feeley wrote a letter to defendant on September 9, 2016, noting that \"to the extent wear and tear, deterioration, or cracking/shrinking/expansion, were causes of the loss, such causes are excluded by the 'wear and tear,' 'cracking, shrinking or expansion' and 'deterioration' exclusions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60.) Feeley also advised defendant that the \"hidden or latent defect,\" the \"repeated seepage,\" and the \"weather conditions\" exclusion should apply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61, 66.) Feeley's letter also concluded that the policy's collapse coverage did not apply in this instance because the roof had not collapsed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant denied the insurance claim on September 14, 2016, citing exclusions for \"wear and tear,\" \"deterioration,\" \"hidden or latent defect,\" \"any quality in property that causes it to damage or destroy itself,\" \"settling, cracking, shrinking or expansion,\" \"seepage or leakage of water,\" and \"weather conditions.\" (Doc. No. 35-1 at 8-9.) The defendant also asserted that because the ceiling and roof of the property \"had not fallen down ... there has been no 'collapse,' \" because the building was still standing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Therefore, defendant asserted that the \"collapse\" coverage did not apply at all.

(Doc. No. 18 at 17-22.) Further, defendant maintains that because there is no coverage, plaintiffs' claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing fails as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) Even were there to be a triable issue of fact on the issue of coverage under the insurance policy, defendant maintains that it is entitled to summary judgment in its favor on plaintiffs' claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the genuine dispute rule and given its' advice of counsel defense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24.) In moving for summary judgment in their favor, plaintiffs assert that under the undisputed facts the building sustained an\n   \"abrupt collapse\" within the meaning of the insurance contract. (Doc. No. 24 at 12-16.) According to plaintiffs, the contract covers damages related to a partial collapse and not merely circumstances where a building has collapsed completely and fallen to the ground.

The phrase used in the insurance contract at issue here is \"abrupt collapse,\" which the contract defines as \"an abrupt falling down or caving in of a building or any part of a building with the result that the building or part of the building cannot be occupied for its intended purpose.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

As the California Court of Appeals has noted in one relatively recent case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   There is a split of authorities over the scope of collapse coverage when the policies leave the term \"collapse\" undefined. \"Insurance companies reacted by defining 'collapse' and elaborating the provisions in an attempt to make the scope of coverage clearer. This effort has met with limited success, as courts continue to grapple with disputes regarding the nature and scope of coverage. Consequently, the split in authority continues. One line of case law holds that 'collapse' requires a complete falling down or flattening to rubble before the loss becomes insured. The other lines of cases (which has been termed the 'modern' and 'majority' view) holds that the building need not entirely or even partially fall down in order for damage to rise to the level of a collapse. Rather, the property is deemed to have collapsed if the damage materially impairs the basic structure or substantial integrity of the building.\" (5 New Appleman on Insurance Law (Library ed. 2015) \u00a7 45.06[1], pp. 45-34 to 45-35, fns. omitted (New Appleman); see 10A Couch on Insurance (3d ed. 2005)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00a7 148:54, pp. 148-93 to 148-96 (rel. 12/98).)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   As here, insurance companies have inserted \"ever more explicit language in attempts to narrow the scope of [collapse] coverage.\" (5 New Appleman,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 45.06[2][b], p. 45-41.) \"For the most part, courts have found such provisions to be unambiguous and enforced them to exclude damage to a building unless and until some part of the building has actually fallen down or been reduced to rubble.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 45-41.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Grebow v.

This insurance contract defines \"abrupt collapse\" as being an \"abrupt falling down or caving in of a building or any part of a building with the result that the building or part of the building cannot be occupied for its intended purpose.\" (Doc. No. 33 at 206.) It further provides that this coverage does not extend to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   a. A building or any part of a building that is in danger of falling down or caving in; b. A part of a building that is standing, even if it has separated from another part of the building; or c. A building that is standing or any part of a building that is standing, even if it shows evidence of cracking, bulging, sagging, bending, leaning, settling, shrinkage or expansion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The court concludes that the language of this policy is ambiguous because there is more than one reasonable interpretation of its intended meaning. One reasonable meaning of \"caving in\" is defendant's understanding: that the building has completely collapsed to the ground. The policy does attempt to differentiate between a building that has suffered an \"abrupt collapse\" and one that is standing. This suggests-even though, as explained below, it does not unambiguously require-that the building or part of the building must collapse completely to the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   However, in common parlance, a building can \"cav[e] in ... with the result that the building ... cannot be occupied for its intended purpose\" (Doc. No. 33 at 206) by having its roof or ceiling fall an appreciable distance, even if the building as a whole has not completely collapsed to the ground. Nothing in the policy unambiguously informs the insured that the building or a part thereof must fall completely to the ground to be covered. The term used by the contract is \"abrupt collapse,\" which highlights the\n   <em>\n    manner\n   </em>\n   in which the collapse must occur to warrant coverage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ass'n of Unit Owners of Nestani v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3820098\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/670/1156/#p1163\">\n    670 F.Supp.2d 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1163 (D. Or. 2009) (noting a policy covering \"sudden\" collapse has a \"temporal element\"). The contract does not use the term \"complete collapse,\" which would more readily refer to the\n   <em>\n    degree\n   </em>\n   of collapse. The fact that coverage applies to the \"abrupt\" collapse of either \"a building\" or \"any part of a building\" strongly suggests the policy was intended to cover a partial collapse of parts of the building, so long as it occurred abruptly, not only total or complete collapse. Moreover, specifying that the collapse must render the building or part of the building so that it \"cannot be occupied for its intended purpose\" would be unnecessary and redundant if the policy required the building or part of the building to have collapsed to the ground. A building or part of a building that has collapsed to the ground cannot be occupied at all for any purpose, let alone for its intended purpose, and contracts are usually interpreted to avoid redundancy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    ACL Techs., Inc. v.

A layperson would reasonably interpret this policy to provide coverage for partial collapses of parts of a building that render the building unusable, even if the building or that particular part had not fallen completely to the ground. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 33 at 206) (stating that an \"abrupt collapse\" occurs when \"any part of a building\" has \"fall[en] down\" or \"cav[ed] in\" and \"the building or part of the building cannot be occupied for its intended purpose\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   It is undisputed here that the overhead monitors, the disco ball, and the entire ceiling of the building fell six to ten inches. (Doc. No. 35-1 at 2.) It is also undisputed that ceiling tiles and insulation fell to the tabletops and counters below. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These events constitute \"any part of a building\" that has \"fall[en] down.\" Finally, it is undisputed that the business was closed by the County of Madera for public safety reasons until repairs could be completed and thus neither the building nor any part of it could be occupied for its intended purpose. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) Therefore, there is no genuine dispute of material fact about whether a part of the building fell down and whether the building could be occupied for its intended purpose. Because the policy language is interpreted in favor of the insured, these facts are sufficient to establish coverage. Similarly, interpreting the policy in favor of the insured, the language of the policy stating coverage does not extend to parts of the building that are standing \"even if it shows evidence of cracking, bulging, sagging, bending, leaning, settling, shrinkage or expansion\" can be reasonably read as intending to exclude coverage for any regular maintenance costs, not as requiring a complete collapse for coverage to exist.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stamm Theatres, Inc. v.

To the extent the policy excludes coverage for buildings that are \"standing,\" the failure to define that term combined with the definition of \"abrupt collapse\" creates an ambiguity that must be resolved against defendant here.

As a close corollary of that principle, it has been said that an insurer denying or delaying the payment of policy benefits due to the existence of a genuine dispute with its insured as to the existence of coverage liability or the amount of the insured's coverage claim is not liable in bad faith even though it might be liable for breach of contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   The genuine dispute rule does not relieve an insurer from its obligation to thoroughly and fairly investigate, process and evaluate the insured's claim. A genuine dispute exists only where the insurer's position is maintained in good faith and on reasonable grounds. Nor does the rule alter the standards for deciding and reviewing motions for summary judgment. The genuine issue rule in the context of bad faith claims allows a trial court to grant summary judgment when it is undisputed or indisputable that the basis for the insurer's denial of benefits was reasonable-for example, where even under the plaintiff's version of the facts there is a genuine issue as to the insurer's liability under California law. On the other hand, an insurer is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law where, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a jury could conclude that the insurer acted unreasonably. Thus, an insurer is entitled to summary judgment based on a genuine dispute over coverage or the value of the insured's claim only where the summary judgment record demonstrates the absence of triable issues as to whether the disputed position upon which the insurer denied the claim was reached reasonably and in good faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673019\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/42/713/#p720\">\n    42 Cal. 4th at 723-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20746\">\n    68 Cal.Rptr.3d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=171%20P.3d%201082\">\n    171 P.3d 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotations omitted).

As discussed above, the language of the insurance contract at issue is ambiguous and susceptible of differing but reasonable interpretations. One such reasonable interpretation is that the collapse provision required the building to completely collapse to the ground, as evidenced by the language excluding coverage for structures that remain standing. It is undisputed here that the building did not completely collapse to the ground which, under defendant's interpretation, would mean there was no coverage under the policy. While plaintiffs contend that defendant formed this view at the outset of the claims process prior to conducting any investigation (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 37 at 42, 56), that is irrelevant, even if true. It is undisputed that the building did not fall to the ground, and nothing about the investigation would or could have impacted a coverage decision based on defendant's interpretation of the policy. While defendant's interpretation ultimately proved to be incorrect\n   in this court's view, given the ambiguity of the contract and the manner in which California law requires such an ambiguity to be construed, this does not make the initial coverage decision unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chateau Chamberay Homeowners Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Cal.%20App.%204th%20335\">\n    90 Cal.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 37.) Upon review, however, it is clear the facts themselves are not disputed. Rather, plaintiffs dispute the legal significance to be attributed to those facts. The court will therefore rely on the facts as undisputed as to the specific fact expressed. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Doc. No. 37 at 11-13) (statement of undisputed fact notes that structural engineer Michael Jundt prepared a report and recounts what the report said, but plaintiffs dispute the significance and accuracy of Jundt's report). The court understands plaintiffs to be disputing the significance of these facts and the conclusions that can reasonably be drawn therefrom, and bears that in mind throughout its analysis of the pending motions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Plaintiffs also claim that coverage is triggered by how the trusses failed and that the exclusions cited by defendant in denying coverage do not apply. (Doc. No. 24 at 16-19.) In neither its opposition to plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment nor its own motion for summary judgment does defendant argue that any exclusions apply to coverage under the collapse provision. Indeed, defendant notes in its own motion that, while certain exclusions barred coverage under the main policy, it understands plaintiffs' complaint to be predicated solely on the additional coverage provision for collapse. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 18 at 7 n.1.) It therefore appears to the court that any exclusions present in the policy do not pertain to the issue of coverage under the policy's additional collapse provision. Accordingly, the court will not discuss these exclusions further.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The parties cite several cases from courts around the country interpreting collapse provisions, some of which found coverage and some which found no coverage. Since the court's task here is to make a reasonable determination of how the California Supreme Court would likely interpret the specific provision in\n    <em>\n     this\n    </em>\n    insurance policy,\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Med.

No. 35-1 at 7.) The parties do not dispute that the structural engineer who evaluated the building concluded that the failure in Truss Line 2 was \"the result of a hidden anomaly present in the natural occurring wood member material and the degradation of the wood fibers due to the daily and seasonal cycling of temperature and humidity,\" while the failure in Truss Line 5 was \"a result of the combination of a defective method of construction and the degradation of the wood fibers due to the daily and seasonal cycling of temperature and humidity.\" (Doc. No. 35-1 at 8.) These appear to fit within the contractual list of causes, and defendants have not argued or suggested otherwise.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
