Underhill, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Nearly 40 years ago, a screenplay was written about Camp Crystal Lake. The film created from the screenplay went on to significant commercial success. Lurking below that peaceful surface, however, was the Copyright Act's termination right, waiting for just the right moment, when it would emerge and wreak havoc on the rights to the screenplay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a case about copyright ownership in the screenplay to the original\n   <em>\n    Friday the 13th\n   </em>\n   film. The Copyright Act, which went into effect in 1978, only a year before the screenplay was written, provided authors with a new and important benefit-the ability to terminate grants of their copyright interests and reclaim their copyrights, beginning thirty-five years after\n   they first transferred their rights. The termination right was established to permit authors to access the long tail of proceeds from a successful work that they could not initially have anticipated when they conveyed away their rights. The important exception to the Copyright Act's termination right is that the copyright in \"works made for hire\" by an employee, and, in limited circumstances, an independent contractor, cannot be clawed back. The termination right cannot apply in such cases because the hiring party is itself considered the initial author of the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant in this declaratory judgment action is Victor Miller (\"Miller\"), the credited screenwriter of the original\n   <em>\n    Friday the 13th\n   </em>\n   screenplay. In 1979, Miller was contacted by his friend, Sean Cunningham (\"Cunningham\"), an already successful producer, to collaborate on a horror film project-with Miller as the screenwriter and Cunningham as the producer. The duo's process was informal, meeting at each other's homes and at coffee shops in the southern Connecticut area. But the deal was also papered over, and Miller, a Writer's Guild of America (\"WGA\") member, was officially hired to write the screenplay for the film pursuant to a short form-agreement by the Manny Company (\"Manny\"), an entity formed by Cunningham that was a party to the WGA collective bargaining agreement. The agreement between Miller and Manny was silent regarding authorship of the screenplay (as that term is used in the Copyright Act) but Miller plainly relinquished any control over the exploitation of the screenplay to Cunningham and Manny. Cunningham and Manny eventually sold their interest in the film, and the runaway hit earned Manny's successors in interest significant profits. Now, more than three decades later, Miller has timely filed and served notices purporting to terminate any permission he granted to Manny and its successors to exploit his work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Manny and Manny's latest successor-in-interest, Horror Inc. (\"Horror\") have brought the present action seeking a declaration that Miller prepared the screenplay as a work for hire, and thus never held authorship rights in the work and cannot terminate Horror's ongoing exploitation of the copyright.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Miller has counterclaimed seeking a declaration of the validity of his termination of Horror's and Manny's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Understanding the context of this case requires understanding what is not in dispute. This is not a case where the parties signed a written agreement that expressly provided that Miller's work was being commissioned as a work made for hire. Such a writing is one of two paths to work-for-hire status, and writings of that type are the norm in the motion picture industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Horror's and Manny's remaining path to work-for-hire status for Miller lies in the argument that Miller produced the work as Manny's employee, within the scope of his employment. Perhaps concerned by the implications of Miller's casual relationship with Cunningham, however, Horror and Manny do not focus on the traditional agency-law analysis mandated by the Supreme Court for determining employee status under the Copyright Act. Horror and Manny propose a sort of \"no further inquiry\" rule of employee status resulting from Miller's hiring, as a WGA member by a signatory to the WGA collective bargaining agreement. Unfortunately for Horror\n   and Manny, the Supreme Court's agency-law analysis does not allow any exceptions for union members, and under the proper agency analysis Miller was not Manny's employee. Accordingly, the screenplay written by Miller was not a work-for-hire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Victor Miller is a professional writer of novels, screenplays and teleplays, and has been a member of the Writers Guild of America, East, Inc.

Cunningham is a producer, director, and writer of feature films, who began producing and directing films in 1970. [Declaration of Sean S. Cunningham (\"Cunningham Decl.\"), Doc. No. 43-4, at \u00b6 2.] Cunningham's involvement in filmmaking is primarily coordinated through Sean S. Cunningham Films, Ltd. (\"SSCF\"), of which Cunningham is a principal. [Cunningham Decl., Doc. No. 43-4, at \u00b6 2; Pls.' Facts, Doc. No. 43-2, at \u00b6 1.] In 1976, Miller and Cunningham, who were already close friends [Def.'s Facts, Doc.

In order to develop\n   <em>\n    Manny's Orphans\n   </em>\n   , Cunningham and his company, SSCF, formed The Manny Company (\"Manny\"), a Connecticut Limited Partnership, with Cunningham and SSCF as its general partners. [Def.'s Facts, Doc. No. 45-3, at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.] In order to engage Miller to work on\n   <em>\n    Manny's Orphans\n   </em>\n   , Miller was hired by Manny, which had become a signatory to the then-operative collective bargaining agreement between the WGA and signatory industry employers, the 1977 WGA Theatrical and Television Basic Agreement (the \"Minimum Basic Agreement\" or \"MBA\"). [Pls.' Facts, Doc. No. 43-2, at \u00b6 11.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On each film, the nature of Miller's and Cunningham's working relationship remained the same: while Miller was writing the screenplay, he and Cunningham would meet at each other's homes, Cunningham's home office, a local diner, or over the phone, in order to exchange ideas.

No. 45-3, at \u00b6 6.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Miller agreed to work on the project, and, at some point in time over the course of working alone and with Cunningham on a story and script, Miller entered into a \"Writer's Flat Deal Contract\" (the \"Contract\") with Manny.

B, Cunningham Decl., Doc. No. 43-6] The form allows the parties to check various boxes to designate whether the work product called for in the agreement will include a \"Treatment\", \"Original Treatment\", \"Story\", \"First draft screenplay\", \"Final draft screenplay\", or \"Rewrite of screenplay\", and only the boxes for \"First draft screenplay\" and \"Final draft screenplay\" are checked. [Ex. B, Cunningham Decl.,\n   Doc. No. 43-6.] The form also includes a section in which the parties can identify pre-existing materials on which the agreed-upon work product will be based (\"based upon (describe form of material &amp; title) ___________ written by ___________\"). [Ex. B, Cunningham Decl., Doc. No. 43-6.] In the Contract, the \"Writer\" represents that he is a member in good standing of the Writers Guild of America, and the Contract provides that, \"[s]hould any of the terms hereof be less advantageous to the Writer than the minimums provided in [the] MBA, then the terms of the MBA shall supersede such terms\" and that, in the event the Contract fails \"to provide for the Writer the benefits which are provided by the MBA, then such benefits for the Writer provided by the terms of the MBA are deemed incorporated herein.\" [Ex. B, Cunningham Decl., Doc. No. 43-6.] The form agreement provides a fillable blank where the total lump sum payable to the \"Writer\" can be filled in, and the total sum of $9,282 was filled in. [Ex. B, Cunningham Decl., Doc. No. 43-6.] The form agreement also includes a series of fillable blanks where the total lump sum payment designated for the \"Writer\" can be subdivided into component amounts payable for delivery of a treatment, first draft screenplay, final draft screenplay, etc., and only the blanks designating amounts payable for a first draft screenplay and final draft screenplay are filled in (calling for payments of $5,569 and $3,713, respectively). [Ex. B, Cunningham Decl., Doc. No. 43-6.] Finally, the Contract provides that, following completion of any deliverable by the Writer, the Company has three days to call for changes to such deliverable, after which, such deliverable shall be deemed approved.

[Def.'s Facts, Doc.

[Pls.' Facts, Doc. No. 43-2, at \u00b6 49; Miller Decl., Doc. No. 45-1, at \u00b6 15; Cunningham Supp. Decl., Doc. No. 47-1, at \u00b6 12.] Among the ideas Cunningham contributed were the suggestion that the killings that occur in the movie should be \"personal\" (and that guns are \"impersonal\" ways to kill in movies), that the killer should remain masked at all times, and that a major character should be killed early on. [Miller Dep., Doc. No. 43-16, at 89:15-90:11, 189:23-190:17.].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Miller wrote the treatment and screenplay on his own typewriter, using his own typewriter ribbon and paper.

No. 51-3, at \u00b6 51; Miller Decl., Doc. No. 45-1, at \u00b6 15.] Miller usually did his writing in the morning because he was a \"morning person\" [Miller Decl., Doc. No. 45-1, at \u00b6 17], and not because Cunningham would dictate Miller's specific work hours [Miller Decl., Doc. No. 45-1, at \u00b6 17; Pls.' Opp. Br., Doc. No. 47, at 26-27]. Miller was responsible, however, for conforming his completion of screenplay drafts to the demands of the film's broader production schedule. [Pls.' Obj. to Def.'s Facts, Doc. No. 47-2, at \u00b6 15; Cunningham Supp. Decl., Doc.

No. 47-2, at \u00b6 20.] Cunningham, and later on, even an eventual investor, Phil Scuderi (\"Scuderi\") did suggest revisions and additions for Miller to make to the screenplay, and occasionally required revisions and additions over Miller's objections. [Pls.' Obj. to Def.'s Facts, Doc. No. 47-2, at \u00b6 20; Cunningham Decl., Doc. No. 43-4, at \u00b6 29; Cunningham Supp. Decl., Doc.

[Compl., Doc. No. 1.] Plaintiffs also seek an alternative declaration, in the event that any of Miller's termination notices are deemed valid, limiting the elements of the screenplay to which the termination applies to only those creative elements in the screenplay that can be identified as having been created by Miller. Plaintiffs have also brought a series of state law claims against Miller, all of which rely on the alleged illegitimacy of Miller's termination notices. [Compl., Doc. No. 1.] On November 17, 2016, Miller filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration that the screenplay was not prepared as a work for hire, and thus a determination that at least one of his three termination notices is valid. [Counterclaim, Doc. No. 37.] Cross-motions for summary judgment regarding the work for hire claims and the legitimacy and effect of Miller's termination notices followed.

Conversely, Miller seeks, in both his complaint and motion for summary judgment, a declaration that his writing of the screenplay did not constitute a work made for hire, and thus that he is entitled to recover the United States copyright in the screenplay.

Accordingly, following my determination that the screenplay was not a work made for hire, I must examine whether Miller can be excluded from authorship status on any other grounds, whether Miller was the sole author of his contributions to the screenplay, whether Miller shared joint authorship of the screenplay, and whether any portions of the screenplay can be carved out from Miller's termination right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Screenplay Was Not a Work Made for Hire\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plainly, the best outcome for Horror and Manny would be if Miller were determined to have made his writing contributions to the screenplay while working for hire for Manny.

N, Haye Decl., Doc. No. 43-19,] It is interesting to note that, although Horror and Manny claim that Sean Cunningham used as the template for the Contract \"the standard WGA short form complete screenplay agreement issued by the WGA at the time\", Cunningham Decl., Doc. No. 43-4, at \u00b6 17, the comparable screenwriter's short-form contract now in use by the WGA does expressly designate that any writing covered by the contract is work made for hire, Writer's Theatrical Short-Form Contract, at \u00b6 24,\n   <em>\n    https://www.wgaeast.org/wp-content/uploads/typo3/user_upload/writers_theatrical_short-form_contract.pdf\n   </em>\n   (\"Writer acknowledges that all results ... of Writer's services ... are being specially ordered by Producer for use as part of a Motion Picture and shall be considered a 'work made for hire' for Producer ... in accordance with Sections 101 and 201 of ... the U.S. Copyright Act.\"). Intriguingly, although Miller\n   entered into the Contract with Manny in 1979, and the Copyright Act became effective in 1978, a type-written notation in the bottom left-hand corner of each page of the Contract (\"3/77\") suggests that the form Cunningham used for the Contract was last updated in 1977. [Ex. B, Cunningham Decl., Doc. No. 43-6.] In any event, whether or not motivated by the failure of the Contract to expressly designate the screenplay as a work for hire, Horror and Manny have conceded that they are not pursuing a work for hire theory under section 101(2). [Pls.' Opp. Br., Doc. No. 47, at 11 n.7.] The screenplay will thus be considered a work made for hire only if Miller's contributions to the screenplay were made as Manny's \"employee\", within the scope of his employment, pursuant to section 101(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Miller did not prepare the Screenplay as Manny's employee within the scope of his employment\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Horror and Manny argue that Miller was necessarily an employee of Manny, and not an independent contractor, because Miller, a WGA member, was hired by Manny, a WGA collective bargaining agreement signatory company, pursuant to a contract controlled by the WGA's collective bargaining agreement with signatory companies. [Pls.' Br., Doc. No. 43-1, at 26-30.] That is, of course, not the traditional test mandated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   for determining whether a hired party is an employee or independent contractor according to the definition of \"work made for hire\" contained in section 101(1) of the Copyright Act. The established\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   test relies on the general common law of agency, and not labor law, and sets out a series of non-exhaustive factors to be used in determining whether a work was prepared by an employee agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p737\">\n    490 U.S. at 751-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p737\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Horror and Manny reject the applicability of the\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   factors to the present case, arguing that, because the Copyright Act's definition of \"employee\" is identical to the definition used in the National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\") and because labor law requires that Miller be considered Manny's employee, Miller must also be considered Manny's employee for the purposes of the Copyright Act. The multi-factor test set out in\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   , so goes their argument, is only designed to be used when an individual's employment status is otherwise \"unclear.\" [Pls.'

That argument is less grounded in case law and seemingly relies instead on an appeal to common sense notions of the many terms of art that are at issue. Horror and Manny assert, without any citations, but bolstered by the occasional use of italicization and/or bolding, that union membership and any engagement to provide services pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     is the antithesis of independent contractor status.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" [Pls.' Br., Doc. No. 43-1, at 28-29 (emphases in original).] Horror and Manny appeal to an apparently lay sensibility:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   By definition, an independent contractor is independent-he is free to negotiate\n   the terms of his engagement and is not mandated by law to adhere to the minimum terms and conditions of any collective bargaining agreement; he is free to accept terms and conditions of employment that are\n   <em>\n    less favorable\n   </em>\n   , or which substantially vary, from the terms mandated by the collective bargaining agreement. For this fundamental reason, a person cannot be engaged by a union signatory employer under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement and, at the same time, maintain that he is an \"independent contractor\" who is free to negotiate the minimum terms and conditions of his engagement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   [Pls.' Br., Doc. No. 43-1, at 29 (emphasis in original).] Aside from offering scant justification for departing from the more thoroughly supported\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   analysis, the argument amounts to no more than an unsupported bit of wordplay that is both circular and generally unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As a preliminary matter, absent any basis in statute or precedent, the argument that the relevant measure of an independent contractor's independence is his ability to depart from the terms of a collective bargaining agreement seems grounded in nothing other than Horror's and Manny's optimistic assertion that that is the case. And while Horror and Manny claim that the definitional hallmark of an independent contractor is the independence to depart above or below the minimum terms and conditions of any collective bargaining agreement, the threshold measurement of independence could just as easily be the more limited independence to depart only above the minimum terms of a collective bargaining agreement, as the parties did here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The novel \"independent contractors are independent\" standard also in no way distinguishes independent contractors from employees, the ultimate goal of any such analysis. A non-unionized convenience store clerk, for example, who would otherwise pass the usual tests for employee status, would have to be deemed an independent contractor under such an analysis, because he is free to negotiate whatever terms of employment he can wheedle out of the convenience store owner. To the extent Horror's and Manny's argument is that the \"independent contractors are independent\" standard for assigning employee status should only be used to isolate the lack of independence that results from union restrictions where the hired party would otherwise be considered an independent contractor, it is circular to suggest that the proposed standard can provide its own justification for applying only in such circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In sum, neither of the two arguments presented by Horror and Manny convince me that labor law requires that I conclude that Miller was Manny's employee. Indeed, applying the analysis mandated by\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   , Miller was an independent contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   b. Under the\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   agency law analysis, Miller wrote the screenplay as an independent contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Having decided that labor law provides no authority for skirting the analysis mandated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   for determining a hired party's status as employee or independent contractor under the Copyright Act, I now turn to the agency law analysis mandated by the\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   Court.

No. 45, at 22], and the impression of a collegial, non-hierarchical working dynamic is bolstered by Cunningham's and Miller's status as old friends, and their casual habit of meeting at each other's homes to generate and discuss ideas. Taking the record facts in the light most favorable to Horror and Manny, it is clear that Cunningham was able to exert at least some control over Miller's writing. Cunningham provided Miller with guidance on some of the basic ideas and elements of a horror movie, including that killings should be personal, that guns were too impersonal, and that a main character should be killed off early. Cunningham also \"retained final authority over what went into, or stayed out of, the Screenplay\", and occasionally insisted that Miller make changes to the screenplay despite the fact that Miller opposed such changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Still, few of the examples of Cunningham's control adduced by Horror and Manny rise above the level of the sort of big picture approval authority and general suggestions that do not weigh heavily in favor of a right to control. Cunningham's suggestion that killings be \"personal\", or that a killing occur early in the story, are unprotectable ideas, rather than protectable expressions of such ideas,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and, to the extent Cunningham was explaining to Miller that those elements should be included because\n   they are horror movie staples, then such elements were also unprotectable\n   <em>\n    scenes a faire, see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoehling v. Universal City Studios, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1380528\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/618/972/#p979\">\n    618 F.2d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 979 (2d Cir. 1980). Similarly, Cunningham's account that he and Miller shared the task of coming up with the setting of a summer camp for the screenplay neither reveals control over the details of Miller's expression, as opposed to approval of general ideas, nor evidences a clear relationship of control, as opposed to cooperation. [Cunningham Decl., Doc. No. 43-4, at \u00b6 10.] Horror's and Manny's most specific example of control being exerted over Miller's work is the statement that Miller was required to include a scene where Jason comes back to life at the end of the movie, but even that example describes an instruction to include a general idea, and does not provide evidence that Miller's expression of that idea was controlled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no evidence that Cunningham controlled the details of Miller's work, or supervised Miller's daily activities. Cunningham was only sometimes present while Miller worked, and much of Miller's writing occurred at his own home. Although Miller and Cunningham met frequently at each other's residences, Cunningham's own description of such meetings as being for the purpose of \"develop[ing] scenes and discuss[ing] ideas\" does not suggest close or direct control. [Cunningham Decl., Doc. No. 43-4, at \u00b6 12.] In fact, Cunningham contrasts his ultimate \"final authority\" with the more quotidian interactions between himself and Miller where they \"collaborated closely\". [Cunningham Decl., Doc. No. 43-4, at \u00b6 13.] The closest Cunningham comes to describing occasional detailed control over Miller's activities is his statement that he \"[s]ometimes ... stood over [Miller's] shoulder\" while Miller wrote, but Cunningham does not describe any behavior that suggests that he exercised control over Miller's expression during those bouts of supervision, stating only that on those occasions he would \"mak[e] suggestions and contributions\". [Cunningham Supp. Decl., Doc. No. 47-1, at \u00b6 12.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In sum, although Cunningham possessed ultimate approval authority over Miller's output, that fact is consistent with a hiring party's role in both independent contractor and employment relationships.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2 Patry on Copyright \u00a7 5:54. The simple fact that Cunningham provided direction or supervision is also not dispositive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p737\">\n    490 U.S. at 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p737\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the record points to frequent interaction between Cunningham and Miller, there is little in the record to suggest that such interactions frequently consisted of Cunningham exercising close\n   control over Miller's work, and there is nothing in the record that suggests Cunningham controlled the details of Miller's creative expression or otherwise directed the performance of Miller's daily activities. Despite a lack of detailed control over Miller's expression or confining control over Miller's work habits, however, Cunningham's discussions with Miller and approval authority did broadly affect the aesthetic content of the screenplay. Viewing the record most favorably to Cunningham, the right to control factor thus points no more than slightly towards employment status in this case, and is not dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    The skill required for Miller's work\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Horror and Manny concede that \"screenwriting is a skilled profession and that Miller is a skilled screenwriter.\" Pls.'

And, as noted above, even if the statement regarding \"all sums due Miller\" in the 1987 settlement could, in light of the record, reasonably be interpreted as referring to traditional employee benefits, the fact that such a statement was made, years after Miller's work on the screenplay, does not address whether, at the time of Miller's employment, Manny actually provided any such benefits.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ulloa,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9287525\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/303/409/#p415\">\n    303 F.Supp.2d at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[B]ecause the tax treatment of the Plaintiff largely occurred after litigation was threatened, it provides little, if any, persuasive evidence of the parties' contemporaneous belief of an employment relationship.\").

[Pls.' Opp. Br., Doc.

The powers Horror and Manny point to-Manny's ability to require Miller to modify the screenplay to Cunningham's liking, or to require Miller to continue working on the screenplay until it was completed- thus do not represent an ability to assign additional projects to Miller, and instead suggest (unsurprisingly) that Manny could require Miller to actually complete the single screenplay project to Cunningham's satisfaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519638\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/969/1547/#p1551\">\n    969 F.2d at 1551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Although the district court considered Accent's right to require Marco to reshoot unsatisfactory images, this right was merely a right to final approval, which differs from the right to assign more work.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Viewing the satisfactory completion of the screenplay as the project for which Miller was hired, nothing in Miller's agreement with Manny suggests an ability to assign additional projects to Miller.

[Pls.' Opp. Br., Doc. No. 47, at 25.] In making that argument, Horror and Manny fail to acknowledge that the applicable collective bargaining agreement contemplates both circumstances in which a writer would agree to work on a project-by-project basis and circumstances in which a writer would agree to work for a fixed period of time. [\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. N, Haye Decl., Doc.

Moreover, setting aside any possible reliance on the already rejected labor law argument that work pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement by itself determines employee status, Horror and Manny do not explain why the simple application of the MBA to a working condition that would ordinarily suggest independent contractor status should preclude the traditional agency law analysis of that condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   At best, Horror and Manny rely on the overlap of that argument with a more complicated argument they articulate in rejecting application of the ordinary agency analysis to other\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   factors-that the considerations traditionally applicable to a factor are irrelevant where an applicable agreement not only contemplated the working conditions relevant to that factor,\n   but also provided that such working conditions could not be used against the hiring party to establish independent contractor status. For example, in arguing that I should not credit Miller's ability to work from home using his own tools, Horror and Manny point to language in the MBA that provides that \"[w]here the writer utilizes an office in his home in connection with an employment agreement with the Company, such utilization shall be deemed at the request of and for the convenience of the employer.\" [Pls.'

Horror's and Manny's alternative framing could lead to absurd outcomes: for example, if a homeowner hires a house painter once every ten years to spend a day painting the homeowner's garage door, then what is important to the agency law analysis is that each engagement lasted only one day, and not that, after three painting engagements, the parties will have done business for thirty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Miller worked on the screenplay project for approximately two months-\"a relatively short period of time\".\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p737\">\n    490 U.S. at 752-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p737\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Miller's primary work on the screenplay-the writing of the screenplay-was done using his own typewriter and paper, although he used Cunningham's photocopier and copy paper and relied on Cunningham's secretary to re-type a draft of the screenplay. Similarly, Miller generally wrote at home and at his own pace (writing in the morning because he was a \"morning person\"), but he would also meet frequently with Cunningham, often at his friend Cunningham's house and the schedule for such meetings was necessarily controlled by Cunningham's availability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Horror and Manny argue that Miller \"was not at his leisure to complete the [s]creenplay on his own schedule\" and that instead, Cunningham and the MBA \"set the deadlines for completion of Miller's writing services and deadlines to complete specific writing tasks\". [Pls.' Opp. Br., Doc. No. 47, at 27.] Their argument mostly misstates the nature of the relevant factor, however. The existence of an external deadline for delivery of a completed project can hardly be inconsistent with independent contractor status.\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p737\">\n    490 U.S. at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p737\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Apart from the deadline for completing the sculpture, Reid had absolute freedom to decide when and how long to work.\"). Aside from Miller's early \"assignment\" to come up with a setting for the screenplay [Cunningham Supp. Decl., Doc. No. 47-1, at \u00b6 6], there is no evidence of other individual assignments\n   that could have controlled the pace of Miller's writing. And even if I were to assume that Cunningham assigned other tasks to Miller with sufficient regularity to affect Miller's general budgeting of his time, that would not be sufficient to outweigh the importance of Miller's daily control over the times at which he worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Horror and Manny further propose that, to the extent Miller did supply his own tools and work from home, the ordinary agency law analysis of those factors should be subverted, because the MBA contained language stating that such activity \"shall be deemed at the request of and for the convenience of the employer.\" [Pls.' Opp. Br., Doc. No. 47, at 21 (quoting Ex. N, Haye Decl., Doc.

The Supreme Court noted that section 101(2) only extended work-for-hire status to works by independent contractors in a limited set of circumstances and cautioned that hiring parties should not be allowed to circumvent section 101(2)'s limitations and benefit from work-for-hire doctrine outside of traditional employment relationships merely by re-defining the section 101(1) analysis to cover their hiring relationship.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p737\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p737\">\n    at 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p737\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting an interpretation of section 101(1) reliant on a hiring party's actual control because that interpretation \"leaves the door open for hiring parties, who have failed to get a full assignment of copyright rights from independent contractors falling outside the [ section 101 ](2) guidelines, to unilaterally obtain work-made-for-hire rights [under section 101(1) ] ... as long as they directed or supervised the work, a standard that is hard not to meet when one is a hiring party\"). Allowing a hiring party to avoid a ruling of independent contractor status under the\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   factors by virtue of a contract declaring the relevant factors unavailing would hijack the agency-law analysis and allow potentially all works by independent contractors to be deemed works by employees under section 101(1), despite Congress's clear goal to limit the types of works by independent contractors subject to work-for-hire status. Indeed, permitting a hiring party to obtain an agreement disclaiming the viability of certain\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   factors would be no different than permitting enforcement of an agreement simply declaring that a work is for hire despite falling outside of the ordinary scope of sections 101(1) or 101(2) -the latter ploy having already been rejected by the Second Circuit.\n   <em>\n    Marvel Characters, Inc. v.

Accordingly, even though the MBA declares that a writer's working from home shall be deemed \"at the request of and for the convenience of the employer\", those magic words cannot erase the agency-law consequences of Miller's work from home, using mainly his own tools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Miller frequently worked from home and his primary tool was his own typewriter. Miller also generally controlled the hours at which he worked. He did, however, use some of Cunningham's tools, often met with Cunningham at Cunningham's house, and saw the pace of his work impinged on by tasks of Cunningham's invention.

Miller spent his time writing for the low-budget project by himself and met casually with Cunningham to discuss ideas. There is no indication that Miller sought to hire any assistants. Accordingly, this factor simply does not yield much insight into Miller's relationship with Manny, and is accorded no weight in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   ix.\n   <em>\n    Manny's status as a business in the regular pursuit of filmmaking\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Although the question whether Manny was a business is a factor that \"will always have very little weight in this analysis\",\n   <em>\n    Aymes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516160\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/857/#p861\">\n    980 F.2d at 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Manny was clearly a business, and this factor accordingly weighs in favor of employee status. Manny was also formed for the purpose of filmmaking, and thus Miller's hiring was part of Manny's regular business, so this related factor also weighs in favor of employee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Having already determined that the\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   factors deemed most important in\n   <em>\n    Aymes\n   </em>\n   weigh clearly in favor of independent contractor status, analysis of the remaining factors yields mixed results and certainly provides no justification for reversing that assessment. Miller performed skilled work, received no employee benefits, was not treated as an employee for tax purposes, and his engagement did not provide Manny the right to assign additional projects. The weight of those factors alone might be enough to determine Miller's status, but other factors also bolster Miller's independent contractor status. Miller was paid in lump sums based on his completion of the screenplay, and worked on the screenplay for Manny for only a short period of time. Miller mainly used his own tools, and frequently worked from home at his own pace. Although Cunningham did not tightly control the manner and means of Miller's work, even if he did somewhat control Miller's work, that factor, together with the fact that Manny was in the business of filmmaking cannot overcome the significance and effect of the other factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Because Miller was an independent contractor, the screenplay cannot qualify as a work for hire under section 101(1). Nor does the screenplay qualify as a work for hire under section 101(2). Accordingly, Miller did not prepare the screenplay as a work for hire, and Miller must be considered the author of his work on the screenplay in whom initial ownership of the copyright in the screenplay vested.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, unless Horror and Manny can otherwise claim authorship rights in the screenplay, any rights they have to the copyright in the screenplay must originally derive via grant from Miller, which Miller has terminated pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Miller is the sole author of the screenplay\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   There is no dispute in this case that Miller made significant contributions to the screenplay.

No. 43-4, at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28], and have asked me to determine the extent of Miller's authorship of the screenplay [Pls. Br. at 38-39].

The district court in\n   <em>\n    Lindsay\n   </em>\n   held that, where an individual \"exercised such a high degree of control\" over a documentary film, including by \"identifying specific camera angles and shooting sequences\", providing \"detailed instructions for positioning and utilizing the light towers\", and actually \"direct[ing] the filming ... such that the final product duplicates his conceptions and visions of what the film should look like\", such individual, and not the third-party who physically held the camera, may be considered the author of the work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. In the present case, however, although Cunningham sometimes stood over Miller's shoulder while Miller wrote and frequently discussed ideas with Miller, Miller was frequently left to his own devices to write alone. There is thus no reasonable possibility that Miller served as no more than a conduit for Cunningham's creative expression. There is, in fact, insufficient evidence that Cunningham's contributions to the screenplay were ever specific enough to constitute protectable expression rather than unprotectable ideas. Cunningham's behavior therefore cannot rise to the level of detailed control seen in\n   <em>\n    Lindsay\n   </em>\n   and Cunningham is not entitled to claim exclusive authorship of the screenplay in place of Miller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Although Miller is entitled to authorship credit for the screenplay, Horror's and Manny's claims of Cunningham's and Scuderi's contributions might be interpreted as an argument of joint authorship of the screenplay with Miller, based on their respective contributions. The Copyright Act defines a \"joint work\" as \"a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the Second Circuit, the standard for joint authorship requires the joint-authorship proponent to establish \"that each of the putative co-authors (1) made independently copyrightable contributions to the work; and (2) fully intended to be co-authors.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomson v.

Although, as pointed out above, there is insufficient evidence of independently copyrightable contributions by Cunningham or Scuderi, even more fatal to any claim of joint authorship by Cunningham or Scuderi is the lack of sufficient evidence of intent among the parties to be co-authors. The requirement of co-authorship intent is a mutual-intent requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358771\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/195/#p200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358771\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/195/#p200\">\n    at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The inquiry into intent is \"not strictly subjective\", and requires a \"nuanced inquiry\" into objective indicia of authorship intent, including decision-making authority over the creative work, billing credit for the work, and the\n   nature of written agreements with third parties related to the work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 201-04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In this case, although Cunningham did retain approval authority over the screenplay, that is not surprising because the screenplay was a distinct work commissioned for his production company. The decision-making authority factor is thus not particularly helpful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The billing factor is, on the other hand, strongly reflective of a lack of co-authorship intent. Miller was provided with sole credit for writing the screenplay, in all official documentation, including in copies of the treatment and screenplay that Cunningham concedes he assembled himself. Cunningham's position of authority here likewise suggests that he was capable of challenging or modifying Miller's exclusive billing to the extent that billing was not reflective of reality. Finally, the transfer-of-rights agreement by which Manny conveyed its rights in\n   <em>\n    Friday the 13th\n   </em>\n   to Georgetown is also highly indicative of a lack of co-authorship intent. That agreement, signed by Cunningham as Manny's representative, described Miller as the only \"writer\" and \"author\" of the screenplay. [Ex. H, Cunningham Decl., Doc. No. 43-12. at 1.] The foregoing factors demonstrate a lack of intent by Miller to share joint authorship with Cunningham (and vice-versa), and also demonstrate a lack of intent to share joint authorship with Scuderi, whose participation in the screenwriting process was even less involved. Thus, neither Cunningham nor Scuderi qualify as joint authors of the screenplay with Miller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Acknowledging that Miller is entitled to authorship credit for his writing of the screenplay and that neither Cunningham nor Scuderi are joint authors with Miller does not end the inquiry regarding Cunningham's or Scuderi's authorship rights in some portion of the screenplay. It remains at least theoretically possible that, apart from Miller's general authorship of the screenplay, Cunningham or Scuderi might retain their own individual authorship rights over their specific contributions to the screenplay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358771\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/195/#p200\">\n    147 F.3d at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, Horror and Manny request exactly that type of apportionment of authorship among the various parties. [Pls. Br. at 38-39.] The Second Circuit has not yet decided \"whether a person who makes a non-\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   copyrightable contribution but cannot meet the mutual intent requirement of co-authorship, retains ... any rights and interests in his or her own contribution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358771\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/195/#p200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358771\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/195/#p200\">\n    at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Apr. 23, 2009), I need not explore the problem further in this case. As a preliminary matter, there is insufficient evidence that Cunningham or Scuderi made independently copyrightable contributions.

Cunningham and Scuderi were thus both thoroughly on notice from an early stage that their claims of copyrightable writing contributions to the screenplay had been repudiated. The Copyright Act's statute of limitations thus prevents them from claiming partial authorship in response to the long-acknowledged sole writer's attempt to exercise his potential termination rights. Accordingly, even if Horror and Manny had presented sufficient evidence of Cunningham's or Scuderi's joint authorship or independent authorship of copyrightable portions of the screenplay, their authorship claims would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The case for application of the three-year statute of limitations to Miller's attempt to exercise his statutory termination rights, on the other hand, is not strong. Horror and Manny have failed to present sufficient evidence of the statute of limitations' internal triggering requirement of an \"express repudiation\" of Miller's authorship. Horror and Manny have adduced only two sets of circumstances that could even possibly constitute repudiations of Miller's authorship: First, Miller's receipt of a copy of the draft screenplay with a cover page on which, adjacent to wording crediting Miller as the screenwriter, Cunningham had included a copyright notice in the name of Sean S. Cunningham Films, Ltd.; second, Georgetown's recording of a copyright registration for the completed film, in which Georgetown is described as the author of the film as a work for hire, Miller is credited as the writer of the screenplay, and the screenplay is listed as original material in which the author claims copyright.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The copyright notice in the name of Sean S. Cunningham Films, Ltd. cannot qualify as an express repudiation of Miller's authorship. First, a copyright notice is not an indication of authorship, but rather, an indication of ownership-a distinct concept.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20401\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaiman v.

The copyright notice in this case is particularly incapable of evidencing an express repudiation of Miller's authorship, because Miller, despite his possession of initial authorship rights, did indeed transfer some rights in the copyright to Manny in tandem with his hiring, and Cunningham's\n   subsequent affixation of an indicia of ownership to the screenplay thus is entirely consistent with Miller's authorship. Also consistent with Miller's authorship is Miller's receipt of writer's credit on the cover. Second, even if the copyright notice could be interpreted as an express repudiation of Miller's authorship, it would have been a repudiation of Miller's authorship by Sean S. Cunningham Films, Ltd.-not by Manny. Horror and Manny have not pursued any argument that Sean S. Cunningham Films, Ltd. was Miller's employer and thus the legitimate author of the screenplay under a work-for-hire analysis. Express repudiation of ownership triggers the statute of limitations for claims by a plaintiff against the same party whose authorship claim constituted the repudiation.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kwan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4094753\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/224/#p228\">\n    634 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   226-29 ;\n   <em>\n    Merchant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7623862\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/51/#p56\">\n    92 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   56 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mahan v.

App'x 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 331 (2d Cir. 2016). Horror and Manny therefore cannot hide behind Sean S. Cunningham Films' plainly incorrect claim of ownership in order to argue that Miller is generally precluded from exercising his authorship rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Georgetown's registration of a copyright for the completed film also does not qualify as an express repudiation of Miller's authorship capable of running the pertinent statute of limitations. As a preliminary matter, although the registration did include an authorship claim by Georgetown as employer for hire, the claim was again patently incorrect and untraceable to Manny's and Horror's current claim. Georgetown only obtained rights in the screenplay in May of 1980, long after Miller had already completed the screenplay he had been hired by Manny to deliver, and thus long after Manny would have become the original\n   <em>\n    author\n   </em>\n   under Horror's and Manny's work-for-hire theory-a status it could not transfer to Georgetown-with Manny presumably subsequently transferring copyright\n   <em>\n    ownership\n   </em>\n   to Georgetown. Horror's and Manny's claim in this case that Manny was the author of Miller's work for hire on the screenplay is thus itself inconsistent with Georgetown's misguided authorship claim in the copyright registration. Georgetown's registration of itself as the author of a work for hire therefore cannot serve as a repudiation of Miller's claim of authorship against Manny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Moreover, even if Georgetown's claim in the registration could be related to Manny's current authorship claim, \"the mere act of registering an adverse claim in the Copyright office [is] not an effective repudiation\" of authorship rights.\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

And because neither Cunningham nor Scuderi can claim joint-authorship with Miller, the valid exercise of Miller's termination rights caused the copyright in the screenplay to revert to Miller.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The Effect of Miller's Termination Notices\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Horror and Manny have attacked the effectiveness of Miller's termination notices for failing to identify any express grant of rights sought to be terminated, failing to be properly served on current rights holders, and for failing to seek the termination of rights in the initial treatment. None of those arguments succeed in preventing the effective termination of Horror's and Manny's rights in the screenplay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Because Miller authored the screenplay, to the extent Horror and its predecessors engaged in an authorized use of the copyright in the screenplay, such authority must have derived, in the first instance, from Miller.

To the extent Miller authored the screenplay, he was the initial owner of its copyright.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). If Manny (and then Horror) held any rights in the copyright, they must therefore have derived from Miller. It would be absurd to suggest that, by failing to use express language in providing that right to Manny, Miller conveyed rights that are immune from the termination right, leaving Miller unable to ever reacquire control over his work. The termination right was designed to allow authors to reclaim their copyrights regardless of the nature of any earlier contractual language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marvel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11426616\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/310/280/#p291\">\n    310 F.3d at 290-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And despite Horror's and Manny's implication, section 203 does not require any express language of transfer. In keeping with its purpose, the language of section 203 sweeps broadly, applying the termination right to any \"exclusive or non-exclusive grant of a transfer or license of copyright\".\n   <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

In other words, the conditions necessary to create a grant of a non-exclusive license, which is subject to section 203's termination right, are a perfect fit with the facts of this case: Manny requested that Miller create the screenplay, Miller wrote the screenplay and delivered it to Manny, and Miller did so intending\n   that Manny use the screenplay in the\n   <em>\n    Friday the 13th\n   </em>\n   film.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    I.A.E., Inc. v.

Thus, to the extent no more express grant of rights could be identified, the conditions of this case satisfy the requirements of a nonexclusive implied license. And, where a nonexclusive license stems from a hiring relationship between two parties, absent any other relevant arrangements, the hiring agreement between the parties is the natural source of the license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foad Consulting Grp., Inc. v.

Thus, to the extent Horror and Manny have any rights in the copyright, which originally vested in Miller, they must have come via a transfer from Miller, or from a nonexclusive license from Miller. In either event the circumstances of Miller's grant are covered by section 203, and Miller's Contract is the appropriate locus of such conveyance and accordingly the appropriate document for Miller to point to in terminating his grant. Section 203 intends to allow authors to terminate all categories of grants of their copyrights, and Miller will not be precluded from doing so based on the specific wording of his Contract.\n   <em>\n    Marvel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11426616\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/310/280/#p291\">\n    310 F.3d at 290-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The admonition in\n   <em>\n    Marvel\n   </em>\n   that writers cannot waive their termination right by contract applies to invalidate Horror's and Manny's second argument-that Miller's inability to identify express language of transfer itself demonstrates that Miller never held any rights to convey (and later terminate) because he was working for hire. The foregoing discussion has already invalidated Horror's and Manny's premise, because a terminable grant can exist absent specific language of transfer, and thus a lack of specific language is not itself evidence of work-for-hire status, nor a replacement for the\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   analysis. Moreover, once the\n   <em>\n    CCNV\n   </em>\n   analysis has determined that Miller was not an employee and thus did not create a work for hire as Manny's employee, the content of any agreement between Manny and Miller cannot alter that fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11426616\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/310/280/#p291\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11426616\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/310/280/#p291\">\n    at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Horror and Manny point out that Horror, the current grantee of the copyright in the screenplay, was not named in the First Termination Notice.

Cal. 2009) (finding harmless error in the omission from a termination notice of distinct individual comic strips, which were nonetheless deemed included in the notice). No party in receipt of Miller's termination notices, which referred to all prior drafts and iterations of the work, could reasonably have believed that Miller sought to terminate only the copyrights in the completed screenplays, and not in the preliminary treatments. Moreover, Horror and Manny have argued that Miller's writing of the treatment was accounted for in the Contract, and that, although the Contract only allocated payments to Miller for two screenplay drafts, Miller was nonetheless compensated for his work on the preliminary treatments. Having previously subsumed the treatments within the screenplay, Horror and Manny cannot now seek to avoid the pertinent consequences of that connection. Miller's valid Second Termination Notice effectively terminated Horror's rights to any copyrightable content first fixed in the treatment along with the rights to the copyrightable content first fixed in the complete screenplay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Miller's Second Termination Notice effectively reclaimed sole ownership of the copyright in the screenplay, effective July 1, 2018. Because Miller was the sole author of the screenplay to the original\n   <em>\n    Friday the 13th\n   </em>\n   film, his reacquired copyright will extend to all copyrightable content in the screenplay (excluding the single scene involving a motorcycle police officer discussed earlier, which does not affect Miller's sole authorship of, and now, copyright ownership in, the remainder of the screenplay). There is therefore no further need to engage in the examination requested by Horror and Manny to itemize the authorship of each individual creative element of the screenplay. Miller, as sole author of all but one scene has reclaimed ownership in a copyright spanning all copyrightable elements in all but the excluded scene. I also decline to analyze the extent to which Miller can claim copyright in the monstrous \"Jason\" figure present in sequels to the original film. Horror may very well be able to argue that the Jason character present in later films is distinct from the Jason character briefly present in the first film, and Horror or other participants may be able to stake a claim to have added sufficient independently copyrightable material to Jason in the sequels to hold independent copyright in the adult Jason character. That question is not properly before the court in this case, however. Miller's termination notices apply only to the copyright in the screenplay for the first film, and did not purport to terminate a separate copyright in the adult Jason character present in later films. Adjudication of the status of any copyright in the adult Jason character will have to await a ripe dispute with respect to that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   I hold that Miller did not prepare the screenplay as a work for hire and that Miller's Second Termination Notice validly terminated Horror's rights to the copyright in the screenplay to\n   <em>\n    Friday the 13th\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Horror's and Manny's remaining state law claims all depend on Miller having written the screenplay as a work for hire, and can therefore be dismissed as a matter of law. I therefore GRANT Miller's motion for summary judgment [Doc. Nos. 45-46], and DENY Horror's and Manny's motion for partial summary judgment [Doc. No. 43]. Miller is declared the sole owner of the copyright in the screenplay to\n   <em>\n    Friday the 13th\n   </em>\n   , effective as of the effective date of his second termination notice. Miller's motion for consideration of extra evidence [Doc. No. 70] is DENIED as moot.

In light of the subject matter of the 1980s disputes it is not even reasonable to construe the foregoing statement as indicating a willingness by Miller and the WGA to accept the proffered settlement amount\n    <em>\n     in lieu of\n    </em>\n    pension or health benefits that were owing, as opposed to mere satisfaction of all of the sequel and residual payments at issue. And even if such an interpretation were reasonable, that type of settlement agreement would not alter the evidenced lack of actual pension or health benefit payments, which is the relevant inquiry here, in assessing the nature of the working relationship between Miller and Manny. In fact, plaintiffs appear to actually acknowledge the fact that the 1980s disputes did not bear on pension or health care benefits when they make the contradictory argument that the lack of any distinct lawsuits brought by Miller or the WGA related to pension plan benefits demonstrates that Manny had always separately made the required pension contributions.

No. 47, at 20.] Although courts have looked to the hiring party's\n    <em>\n     lack\n    </em>\n    of skill to suggest that the hired party was hired precisely because of their skill,\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Langman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11666803\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/106/#p111\">\n     160 F.3d at 113\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , that argument should not be confused with a suggestion that a hiring party's own skill somehow subverts the agency law analysis examination of the hired party's skill. Miller is plainly a skilled writer, and Miller's skill weighs in favor of independent contractor status.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Thomson\n    </em>\n    , the nature of the joint-authorship claim was reversed from the situation presented here, with the undisputed primary author of the work in that case standing as the authority figure over the party attempting a joint-authorship claim.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11666803\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/106/#p111\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11666803\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/106/#p111\">\n     at 197\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Most importantly, IMDB.com was plainly not an active website within the three-year limitations period following Miller's receipt of sole credit in 1979 (to say nothing of the generally questionable probative value of publicly editable websites).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    Horror and Manny also point to a statement by Miller in a 2003 interview that Cunningham and Scuderi \"were the owners of this thing\". [Pls. Br. at 38 (citing Ex. L, Haye Decl., Doc. No. 43-17, at 21).] Horror and Manny have actually at multiple junctures emphasized Miller's past statements in interviews, or Miller's past behavior, as indicating his colloquial understanding that Cunningham and/or Manny \"owned\" the film (and presumably, by extension the screenplay-although that extension is itself not legally accurate). Those arguments are specious. There is no dispute in this case that Manny and its successors have, for the last few decades,\n    <em>\n     owned\n    </em>\n    some rights in the screenplay. The question this case presents is whether such copyright interests vested initially in Miller, as the original author of the screenplay, with Manny obtaining from Miller either a transfer of ownership of the screenplay's copyright or a license thereto, or whether such copyright interests in the screenplay vested initially in Manny, as the original work for hire author of the screenplay prepared by Miller as Manny's employee. In the former scenario, Miller would be able to terminate his earlier transfer of the copyright interests to Manny and its successors pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n     17 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Because both scenarios are consistent with Miller's prior acknowledgment of Manny's and related parties' ownership interests, Miller's generic statements acknowledging mere ownership interests are not sufficiently probative of any fact at issue in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    In taking this position, the Second Circuit has sided with sister circuits and that have declined to treat copyright registrations as express repudiations of authorship.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Brownstein v.

[Miller Decl., Doc. No. 45-1, at \u00b6 26.] The practical consequences of that fact are limited, however. Cunningham and Scuderi are barred by the statute of limitations from claiming any authorship of the screenplay, which would include claims of authorship of the motorcycle policeman scene. And even if one or both of them could claim authorship of that scene, they would not be able to claim joint-authorship of the entire screenplay, as opposed to distinct and isolated authorship of only that scene.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Thomson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358771\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/195/#p200\">\n     147 F.3d at 206\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (acknowledging, but not deciding the possibility that where elements of joint-authorship are not satisfied, a party might still claim authorship of their own contributions). Still, it cannot strictly be said that Miller wrote the entire screenplay. Because there is no valid claim of joint-authorship, however, Miller's lack of authorship of the one motorcycle policeman scene will not preclude Miller from terminating his copyright in those parts of the screenplay he did author. Miller's validly exercised termination right will thus actually result in the reversion to Miller of a copyright in the entire screenplay other than the one motorcycle policeman scene. For convenience, I will continue to refer to Miller in this decision as the sole author of the screenplay.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    The Copyright Act defines a \"transfer of copyright ownership\" as \"an assignment, mortgage, exclusive license, or any other conveyance, alienation, or hypothecation of a copyright or of any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright, whether or not it is limited in time or place of effect, but not including a nonexclusive license\".\n    <extracted-citation index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
