INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This insurance coverage dispute arises from the Governo Law Firm's (\"GLF\") lawsuit against several former GLF attorneys and a competing law firm those attorneys established (the \"Underlying Lawsuit\"). Faced with counterclaims in its suit against its former attorneys and their new firm, GLF filed this action against its professional insurance provider, Allied World Insurance Company (\"Allied World\"), to cover the costs of defense. GLF and Allied World now dispute whether the counterclaims are covered by the GLF's Allied World insurance policy (the \"Policy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant has moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (the \"Motion to Dismiss\"). The defendant asserts that the counterclaim does not allege a claim that falls under the policy's coverage and that certain policy exclusionary provisions would preclude coverage in any event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons explained in this Memorandum, the Motion to Dismiss is being denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   GLF specializes in asbestos and toxic tort litigation. GLF was founded by its current Managing Partner, David M. Governo, in 2001. In the summer of 2016, a group of partners of GLF attempted to purchase GLF and its assets from Governo. Governo refused that request. This group of partners (the \"departing attorneys\") then left GLF to start a competing firm, CMBG3 Law LLC (\"CMBG3\"). According to GLF, the departing attorneys unlawfully took with them certain GLF proprietary databases, in addition to GLF firm data, laptops, and iPads. GLF maintains that the departing attorneys took this material to use in setting up CMBG3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After unsuccessfully demanding the return of the property, GLF filed the Underlying Lawsuit in the Suffolk County Superior Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verified Complaint and Jury Demand,\n   <em>\n    Governo Law Firm LLC v. CMBG3 Law LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , in Complaint, Ex. 2 (Docket No. 1-4, at 14-41) (Underlying Lawsuit Complaint). GLF named as defendants CMBG3, as well as the departing attorneys, Jeniffer A.P Carson, Bryna Rosen Misiura, Kendra Ann Bergeron, David A. Goldman, Brendan J. Gaughan,\n   and John P. Gardella. GLF alleges conversion, misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of loyalty, tortious interference with contractual and advantageous relations, civil conspiracy, and unfair and deceptive trade practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response to the complaint, the departing attorneys and CMBG3 asserted a counterclaim against GLF and a third-party complaint against Governo individually.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counterclaim and Third-Party Complaint in Underlying Lawsuit, in Complaint, Ex. 1 (Docket No. 1-3, 17-31) (Counterclaim and Third-Party Complaint). There are three Counts in the counterclaim: (1) a request for declaratory judgment, regarding the data, information, and materials allegedly taken by the departing attorneys; (2) a claim that GLF and Governo intentionally interfered with the departing attorneys' and CMBG3's contractual and/or advantageous business relationships with clients when GLF refused to reasonably cooperate concerning notification to clients as the departing attorneys were establishing their new law firm, provided unfair notice to clients of the departure, and failed to transfer and release full client file materials; and (3) an ERISA violation based on GLF's alleged failure to provide the departing attorneys benefits owed, and excluding them from management and information during their employment, in particular regarding the firm's defined benefit plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counterclaim and Third Party Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 74-94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   GLF and Governo filed this case against Allied World for the costs of defense. The insurance policy at issue in this case is an LPL Assure Lawyers Professional Liability Insurance Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LPL Assure Lawyers Professional Liability Insurance Policy, in Complaint, Ex. 2 (Docket No. 1-4, at 74-106) (the \"Allied World-GLF Policy\"). GLF is designated as the Named Insured, and the Policy's effective period was from March 15, 2016 to March 15, 2017. The Policy is written on a \"claims made\" basis. As stated in the Insuring Agreement, Allied World has \"the right and duty to defend any Claim seeking Damages that are covered by this Policy and made against the Insured ....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Allied World-GLF Policy, Section I. The Insuring Agreement further states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Insurer will pay on behalf of an Insured ... all amounts in excess of the Retention shown in the Declarations, that an Insured becomes legally obligated to pay as Damages and Claim Expenses because of a Claim arising out any of the following Wrongful Acts by an Insured first made during the Policy Period or any Extended Reporting Period:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Governo and GLF filed this case against Allied World Insurance Company in the Superior Court for Middlesex County, Massachusetts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, Ex. 2 (Docket No. 1-4, at 4-13) (Pl.'s Compl.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   According to the complaint, Allied World must provide defense coverage to GLF because the Counterclaim and Third-Party Complaint contain \"Claim[s] seeking Damages that are covered by this Policy and made against an Insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. GLF asserts that Allied World wrongfully refused to provide such defense upon demand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 34, &amp; 38. The complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) a Declaratory Judgment regarding Allied World's obligations under the Policy; and (2) Breach of Contract under the Policy for damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32-40. Allied World timely removed the case to this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal (Docket No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Allied World filed the Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The defendant asserts four grounds for dismissal: (1) coverage under the policy is unavailable because the policy only covers \"Wrongful Acts,\" including \"Legal Services Wrongful Acts,\" and the acts involved in the Underlying Lawsuit do not qualify as \"Legal Services;\" (2) coverage is precluded by Exclusion A (2), which excludes from coverage claims \"brought by or on behalf of, or in the name or right of, any Insured,\" arguing that the departing attorneys are within the definition of \"Insured\"; (3) coverage for Count III is precluded by Exclusion (A)(3), which excludes claims for violations of ERISA; (4) coverage for the Declaratory Judgment Count (Count I) is excluded because the Policy's definition of \"Claim\" excepts declaratory judgments from coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs filed an Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss. Allied World filed a Reply, and the plaintiffs filed a Sur-reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   IV.

The conduct alleged in the counterclaim is of two types. First, the departing attorneys allege that GLF withheld payment of wages and benefits, and also did not disclose the existence of a benefit plan even though the departing attorneys were likely eligible to participate in that plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counterclaim and Third Party Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 56-49. The second set of activities consists of GLF's alleged refusal to release client file materials and property of transferred clients when those clients followed the departing attorneys to CMBG3 Law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-72. The alleged acts concerning wages and benefits are not \"reasonably susceptible\" to an interpretation that triggers Policy coverage because they are properly characterized as business decisions, and with regard to benefits, are subject to the exclusions for ERISA matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reliance Nat'l Ins.

However, the court finds that the alleged conduct concerning client matters is susceptible to an interpretation that triggers coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   More specifically, it is reasonably possible that the allegations in the counterclaim state a claim within the Policy's coverage for \"Legal Services Wrongful Acts\" because the duties to properly notify clients regarding an attorney's departure and transfer client files implicate the specialized knowledge and skill of lawyers. The professional rules and ethical duties associated with an attorney's obligations to former clients and the termination of client representation attest to how these activities involve understandings and intellectual proficiencies unique to the legal profession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mass R. Prof. C. 1.9 (\"Duties to Former Clients\"); Rule 1.16 (\"Declining or Terminating Representation\"). For example,\n   Rule 1.16(e) of the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct defines what constitutes a \"client file,\" describing the nature of client property that must be returned upon the termination of legal representation. This duty, which is designed to protect a lawyer's client, is specific to the legal profession. In addition, in some instances, it is likely that a lawyers' professional knowledge and expertise would be required to determine properly what client materials must be released. Indeed, the counterclaim itself asserts that GLF was obligated to transfer \"other information and data necessary and required for the purpose of ongoing legal representation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counterclaim and Third Party Complaint, at \u00b6\u00b6 58 &amp; 65. It is more than possible that discerning the particular information and data \"necessary\" \"for the purpose of ongoing legal representation\" involves a legal assessment by a lawyer, or at least specialized knowledge held by those who practice law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Similarly, the act of notifying clients regarding the departure of attorneys from the firm requires conduct and skill particular to the legal profession. The Supreme Judicial Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Meehan v. Shaughnessy\n   </em>\n   that notifying a law firm's client of the departure of attorneys from the firm implicates an \"ethical standard ... that any notice [must] explain to a client that he or she has the right to decide who will continue the representation.\" See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"484718\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/404/419/#p437\">\n    404 Mass. 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 437,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=535%20N.E.2d%201255\">\n    535 N.E.2d 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989).

Although in\n   <em>\n    Clermont\n   </em>\n   the court acknowledged that the plaintiffs sought insurance protection for three distinct claims (pirating cases, failing to apprise the law firm of the status of his\n   work, and settling cases without paying any portion of the fee to the firm), the court determined that the relief sought was \"at its core\" for the alleged violation of the fee sharing arrangement \"which is part of the billing function of a lawyer ... not a professional service.\"\n   <em>\n    Clermont,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837547\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/778/133/\">\n    778 F.Supp.2d at 140-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, the allegations against GLF are not properly characterized as business-like \"at [their] core.\" While the departing attorneys' allegations concerning wages and benefits counts may properly be characterized as involving business decisions, the allegations regarding refusal to transfer client property and improper client notification concern distinct facts and are of equal weight. Indeed, Count II incorporates both sets of allegations, focusing especially on the allegations concerning the notification of and interference with clients who chose to transfer legal matters to the departing attorneys.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counterclaim and Third Party Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 80-82;\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    UTICA Mut.

Furthermore, the\n   <em>\n    Clermont\n   </em>\n   court did not address the ethical obligations unique to the legal profession that are implicated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court recognizes that GLF's management of the termination and transition of client relationships has a business component. However, this does not preclude coverage. In\n   <em>\n    Utica Mutual Insurance\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit acknowledged that the activities out of which allegedly covered claim arose may have qualified as both professional services and improper business practices, holding that they were nevertheless covered under the insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4255848\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/36/#p41\">\n    820 F.3d at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the First Circuit observed, \"some professional decisions also affect business practices,\" such that \"these two categories [are not] mutually exclusive.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4255848\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/36/#p41\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreover, it is significant that the Policy in this case uses the term \"arising out ... of\" to define the relationship between a covered claim and the \"Legal Services Wrongful Act.\" In\n   <em>\n    Medical Records Associates v. American Empire Surplus Lines Insurance Company,\n   </em>\n   the First Circuit discussed the difference between policies that cover harms that \"aris[e] out of\" acts or omissions in the rendering of professional services, as opposed to those that occur \"by reason of\" acts or omissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219691\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/512/#p516\">\n    142 F.3d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 516, n.4 (1st Cir. 1998). As the First Circuit wrote, [t]he latter [by reason of language] arguably requires a determination that the harm alleged was due to the manner in which professional services were provided; the former [arising out of language] appears to require only a connection between the challenged conduct and the insured's provision of professional\n   services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Utica Mut.

In effect, \"arising out of\" creates a lower burden for the insured seeking to demonstrate that a claim is covered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, GLF's allegedly improper client notification and delay in transferring of client files may qualify as harms \"due to the manner in which [legal] services were provided.\" In any event, they are reasonably interpreted as being connected, and causally related, to the provision of legal services. Proper client notification of attorney departure and release of client files are essential to a law firm's maintenance of client relationships, and they play an important role in a law firm's compliance with its professional and ethical responsibilities. As explained earlier, in some instances, they could require a lawyer's professional legal judgment to perform. Therefore, contrary to the defendant's assertion, these activities are not mere \"forerunners\" to the provision of legal services, but rather qualify as \"Legal Services\" for Policy purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The Policy Coverage Exclusions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The defendant asserts that even if this court were to find that the counterclaim arose out of the provision of legal services, various exclusionary provisions contained in the Policy apply. However, the defendant's contention regarding how coverage is precluded by the exclusions is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    The Declaratory Judgment and ERISA Exclusions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   According to the defendant, Counts I and III of the Counterclaim and Third Party Complaint are precluded due to exclusions in the Policy for declaratory judgment and ERISA claims. Although the defendant is correct that the ERISA and Declaratory Judgment claims are not independently covered by the Policy due to the exclusions, Allied World nevertheless has an obligation to provide defense for them in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Massachusetts recognizes the \"complete defense\" rule for insurance policy coverage. Under this rule, so long as an insurance policy covers one count alleged against the insured, the insurer is obligated to defend on all counts of the complaint, even if the other counts would not be independently covered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GMAC Mortg., LLC v.

Accordingly, GLF need only establish that one of the claims alleged in the counterclaim triggers coverage for this court to find that Allied World is obligated to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Count III of the Counterclaim, concerning a violation or ERISA, is precluded by Exclusion A(3) of the Policy, which provides that the Policy does not cover any claim \"for any actual or alleged violation by an Insured of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ....\" See Allied World-GLF Policy, at Section IV.A.3. Similarly, Count I of the counterclaim does not fall under the Policy because the Policy's definition of Claim \"does not include ... any proceeding that seeks injunctive, declaratory, equitable or non-pecuniary relief or remedies of any type.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9496288\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/54/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Section III.C. Plaintiffs do not contest the applicability of these provisions. However, as explained earlier, plaintiffs have demonstrated for present purposes that Count II of the counterclaim is subject to an interpretation that triggers Policy coverage. Accordingly, the application of the ERISA and declaratory judgment exclusions is not material to whether there is a duty to defend in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Exclusion A(2); Claims Between \"Insureds\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In its Motion to Dismiss, the defendant relies on two exclusionary provisions\n   that, if applicable, would preclude coverage of all Counts in the counterclaim, even if the court holds that one of the counterclaims involve the performance of legal services. First, Exclusion A(2) precludes coverage for any Claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    brought by or on behalf of, or in the name or right of, any Insured\n   </em>\n   ; provided, however, that this Exclusion A.2 shall not apply to any Claim which arises out of Legal Services rendered by one Insured to another where an attorney-client relationship exists between such Insureds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9496288\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/54/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Section IV.A.2 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In relevant part, the term \"Insured\" under the Policy is defined in Section III.N of the Policy as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   3. any lawyer or professional corporation listed in the Application, on the day the Policy Period incepts until such time as the lawyer or professional corporation ceases to be a member of the Named Insured subject to paragraph 5. below, but only in the performance of or failure to perform Legal Services on behalf of the Named Insured; ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   5. any lawyer or professional corporation who is a former partner, officer, director, stockholder or shareholder or employee of the Named Insured or Predecessor Firm but only in the performance of or failure to perform Legal Services on behalf of the Named Insured or Predecessor Firm;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9496288\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/54/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Section III.N.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The defendant focuses on sub-section 5, asserting that because departing attorneys qualify as \"former partners\" of GLF, they are defined as \"Insured,\" and accordingly a claim by a departing attorney against the Named Insured is not covered by the Policy. The plaintiffs, however, focus on sub-section 3's language that excludes from the definition of Insured those lawyers who have \"cease[d] to be a member of the Named Insured.\" According to the plaintiffs, because the purported Legal Services Wrongful Acts occurred after the attorneys' departure, those individuals fall under the \"cease[d] to be a member\" provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The court finds that the departing attorneys are not \"Insureds\" under sub-section 3 or 5. In sub-section 5, a former partner or employee is only an \"Insured\" regarding \"the performance or failure to perform Legal Services\n   <em>\n    on behalf of the firm\n   </em>\n   .\" Therefore, for the purpose of sub-section 5, a former partner or employee of the law firm is an \"Insured\" only if he or she is sued for acts or omission that allegedly occurred while he or she was at the firm. The departing attorneys are not \"Insureds\" for the purpose of this case because they are being sued primarily, if not exclusively, for actions taken after they have left GLF. Nor are the departing attorneys \"Insureds\" as defined in sub-section 3, which provides that coverage for their conduct ended when they left the firm and \"cease[d] to be members of the Named Insured.\" Moreover, the departing partners have not be sued for alleged conduct \"on behalf of the firm,\" GLF. This too takes them out of the definition of \"Insured\" in sub-sections 3 and 5. Therefore, the departing attorneys are not \"Insureds,\" and the Underlying Lawsuit is not a case between two \"Insureds.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Exclusion B(8): Conversion and Misappropriation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Exclusion B(8) of the Policy excludes from coverage claims for \"the loss of value of any asset in the Insured's care, custody, or control,\n   <em>\n    misappropriation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    con\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    version\n   </em>\n   , embezzlement ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9496288\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/54/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Section IV.B.8 (emphasis added).
