S. Ellis, III, United States District Judge\n  At issue in this First and Fourth Amendment suit is plaintiffs motion to compel defendants to respond to discovery requests regarding defendant National Security Agency's (\"NSA\") Upstream surveillance program. Specifically, plaintiff served 84 discovery requests on defendants in an effort to establish that at least one of plaintiff's communications has b intercepted, copied, and reviewed by defendants. Defendants have objected to 53 of these requests on the basis of the common law state secrets privilege and other statutory privileges, arguing that the information plaintiff seeks, if disclosed, reasonably could be expected to result in exceptionally grave damage to U.S. national security. Plaintiff now moves for an order compelling defendants to produce any information responsive to plaintiff's requests, contending that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\")\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  displaces the common law state secrets privilege and establishes procedures for the\n  <em>\n   ex parte\n  </em>\n  and\n  <em>\n   in camera\n  </em>\n  review of sensitive national security information. These issues have been fully briefed and argued and are now ripe for disposition.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  <strong>\n   I.\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  A brief summary of the statutory framework pertinent to defendants' electronic surveillance efforts provides context necessary for resolution of the question presented in this case. In 1978, Congress enacted FISA in response to growing concerns about the Executive Branch's use of electronic surveillance. Specifically, Congress sought through FISA to accommodate U.S. national security interests in obtaining intelligence about foreign powers while also providing meaningful checks on the Executive Branch's ability to conduct that surveillance. In this respect, FISA created a \"secure framework by which the Executive Branch may conduct legitimate electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes within the context of this Nation's commitment to privacy and individual rights.\" S. Rep. No. 604, pt. 1, 95th Cong. 1st Sess. 15 (1977), reprinted in U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, pp. 3904, 3916.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  A central component of this framework is the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\"). FISC, a tribunal composed of eleven federal district judges designated by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, is charged with the review of applications for electronic surveillance.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201803\">\n   50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1803\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (a). FISA provides that, with limited exceptions, the Executive Branch cannot conduct surveillance of a foreign power or its agents absent prior FISC authorization. To obtain FISC authorization for electronic surveillance, the Attorney General must personally approve an application for surveillance, which must (i) comport with FISA's procedural requirements and (ii) establish probable cause to believe that the target of electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power and that each of the facilities at which electronic surveillance is directed is being used, or is about to be used, by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.\n  <em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201803\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </em>\n  \u00a7 1805\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201801\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FISA also establishes rules governing the use of information obtained through electronic surveillance.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201801\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1806.

Two such checks come by way of criminal sanctions and a civil cause of action. Specifically, FISA imposes criminal penalties on any person who intentionally \"engages in electronic surveillance under color of law except as authorized by [FISA]\" or \"discloses or uses information obtained under color of law by electronic surveillance, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through electronic surveillance not authorized by [FISA.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201801\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1809(a)(l)-(2).

Plaintiff Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California, operates several \"wiki\"-based projects and provides the contents of those projects to individuals around the world free of charge. Defendant National Security\n   Agency/Central Security Service (\"NSA\") is the U.S. government agency responsible for conducting the surveillance at issue in this case. Defendant Office of the Director of National Intelligence (\"ODNI\") is the agency responsible for directing the activities of the U.S. intelligence community, including the NSA, and defendant Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") is one of the government agencies responsible for overseeing electronic surveillance. Several individual defendants are also named in their official capacities, including the Director of the NSA and the Chief of the Central Security Service, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Attorney General of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 22, 2015, plaintiff, along with eight other organizations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed the Amended Complaint in this suit, challenging the legality of defendants' Upstream surveillance program pursuant to \u00a7 702 of the FAA. The Amended Complaint alleges that this program violates (i) the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), (ii) the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, (iii) the First Amendment to the Constitution, and (iv) Article III of the Constitution. The Amended Complaint seeks (i) a declaration that Upstream surveillance violates the APA and the Constitution and (ii) an injunction permanently enjoining defendants from continuing Upstream surveillance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 6, 2015, defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P., arguing that none of the plaintiff organizations plausibly alleged that they were injured by the interception, copying and review of online communications via the Upstream surveillance program and thus plaintiffs lacked Article III standing to contest the legality of the program. Subsequently, on October 23, 2015, an Order and a Memorandum Opinion issued, concluding that the allegations in the Amended Complaint were too speculative to establish Article III standing and granting defendants' motion to dismiss as to all plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wikimedia Found., et al., v. Nat'l Sec. Agency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261961\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/143/344/#p356\">\n    143 F.Supp.3d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 356-57 (D.

Thereafter, plaintiffs appealed and the Fourth Circuit issued an opinion affirming in part, vacating in part, and remanding the case to the district court for further consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wikimedia Found., et al., v.

Agency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276507\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/193/\">\n    857 F.3d 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2017). Specifically, the Fourth Circuit concluded that although the eight other organizations had failed to allege injuries sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article III standing, Wikimedia Foundation had alleged facts \"sufficient to make plausible the conclusion that the NSA is intercepting, copying, and reviewing at least some of Wikimedia's communications.\"\n   <em>\n    Wikimedia Found, et al.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276507\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/193/\">\n    857 F.3d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Shortly after the Fourth Circuit remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings, the parties submitted briefs on how to proceed in the case. Defendants indicated their intent to continue to challenge plaintiff's Article III standing and argued that any discovery should be bifurcated to allow for resolution of the standing question prior to resolution of the merits. Plaintiff opposed defendants' proposed discovery plan, contending that the jurisdictional facts at issue here are so intertwined with the merits as to require simultaneous discovery and summary\n   judgment briefing on both questions. On October 3, 2017, an Order issued, directing the parties to conduct a limited five-month period of jurisdictional discovery prior to full discovery on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wikimedia Found. v. Nat'l Sec. Agency\n   </em>\n   , 1:15-cv-662 (D. Md. Oct. 3, 2017) (Order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties then proceeded to engage in the limited discovery as directed. Plaintiff served 84 requests for admission, interrogatories, and requests for production on defendants, seeking what plaintiff describes as three broad categories of information: (i) direct evidence that Wikimedia has been surveilled, (ii) definition of key terms used in describing Upstream surveillance to the public, and (iii) evidence concerning the scope and breadth of Upstream surveillance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants responded to several of these discovery requests by producing 500 pages of unclassified documents, but objected to 53 of plaintiff's requests on the basis of privilege. In particular, defendants asserted that the information sought by plaintiff was protected by the common law state secrets privilege and other statutory privileges regarding the protection of national security information. In this respect, defendants submitted the unclassified declaration of Daniel Coats, the Director of National Intelligence, formally invoking the state secrets privilege on the basis of his personal consideration of the risks associated with disclosure of the information plaintiff seeks. Defendants also submitted a classified declaration of George C. Barnes, the Deputy Director of the NSA, providing additional detail concerning the harm to national security that would be caused by disclosure of the information contained in plaintiffs discovery requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Subsequently, on March 26, 2018, plaintiff filed the Motion to Compel at issue here pursuant to Rule 37(a)(3), Fed. R. Civ. P. Plaintiff contends that where, as here, a party moves to discover material relating to electronic surveillance, the court must follow FISA's \u00a7 1806(f) procedures and conduct an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the materials relating to electronic surveillance. Plaintiff argues that these procedures apply despite defendants' assertion of state secrets privilege because in enacting FISA, Congress intended to displace the common law state secrets privilege. And even assuming the state secrets privilege was not displaced by FISA, plaintiff argues that the privilege does not bar disclosure of the information at issue here given the amount of information concerning Upstream surveillance already in the public record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants oppose plaintiff's motion, arguing (i) that \u00a7 1806(f) does not apply where, as here, plaintiff has not yet established that it is the target of electronic surveillance and (ii) that even assuming \u00a7 1806(f) does apply here, there is no clear statement indicating Congress's intent to displace the common law state secrets privilege through enactment of FISA. Finally, defendants contend that the government's assessment of the national security risks associated with disclosure of the information concerning plaintiff's discovery requests is entitled to deference and that plaintiff's arguments to the contrary are baseless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A threshold question that must be addressed is whether the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review procedures established in \u00a7 1806(f) apply where, as here, a plaintiff is seeking classified discovery to establish that the plaintiff's communications were\n   unlawfully seized and searched. Analysis of this question properly begins with the terms of that statute. Section 1806(f) provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Whenever a court or other authority is notified pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) of this section, or whenever a motion is made pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, or whenever any motion or request is made by an aggrieved person pursuant to any other statute or rule of the United States ... to discover or obtain applications or orders or other materials relating to electronic surveillance ... the United States district court ... shall, notwithstanding any other law, if the Attorney General files an affidavit under oath that disclosure or an adversary hearing would harm the national security of the United States, review in camera and ex parte the application, order, and such other materials relating to the surveillance as may be necessary to determine whether the surveillance of the aggrieved person was lawfully authorized and conducted. In making this determination, the court may disclose to the aggrieved person, under appropriate security procedures and protective orders, portions of the application, order, or other materials relating to the surveillance only where such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201806\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f).

The government has not noticed its intent to use or disclose information obtained through electronic surveillance, and plaintiff has not filed a motion to suppress any such information. Accordingly, the only possible \u00a7 1806(f) situation applicable here is (iii), the third circumstance that may trigger \u00a7 1806(f). But importantly, \u00a7 1806(f) provides that this third situation applies only when the motion or request at issue \"is made by an\n   <em>\n    aggrieved person\n   </em>\n   [,]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   namely \"a person who is the target of an electronic surveillance or any other person whose communications or activities were subject to electronic surveillance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this regard, the text of \u00a7 1806(f) makes clear that a party's status as an \"aggrieved person,\" or the subject of surveillance, is a precondition to the application of \u00a7 1806(f)'s procedures; unless and until a party has adduced evidence that it has been the subject of electronic surveillance, a party's motion cannot trigger \u00a7 1806(f)'s\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This interpretation of the text is confirmed by the nature of \u00a7 1806(f)'s procedures once invoked. Specifically,\n   \u00a7 1806(f)'s procedures require courts to engage in\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of orders or other materials relating to surveillance to determine whether the surveillance at issue \"was lawfully authorized and conducted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201806\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1806(f). A determination that surveillance was lawfully authorized and conducted cannot occur unless a determination has previously been made that the surveillance at issue did, in fact, occur. Put differently, it is impossible to determine the lawfulness of surveillance if no surveillance has actually occurred. Thus, the text of \u00a7 1806(f) points persuasively to the conclusion that Congress intended \u00a7 1806(f) procedures to apply only after it became clear from the factual record that the movant was the subject of electronic surveillance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Had Congress instead intended \u00a7 1806(f) to be a vehicle for parties to determine whether they were the target of electronic surveillance, one would expect to see language requiring courts to review materials relating to electronic surveillance to determine whether \"electronic surveillance occurred,\" or requiring the government to affirm or deny the existence of any surveillance. Indeed, Congress has used precisely this language elsewhere in the U.S. Code.

Section 1806's heading-use of information-suggests that Congress did not intend \u00a7 1806(f) to apply in situations where, as here, it is yet unclear whether electronic surveillance even occurred. Rather, the heading suggests that Congress intended the provisions of \u00a7 1806 to apply where evidence already establishes the fact of surveillance, and the central dispute is instead how, and whether, information obtained via that electronic surveillance can be used or disclosed in a proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, as the Supreme Court has recognized, \"[i]t is axiomatic that statutes in derogation of the common law should be narrowly construed[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Badaracco v.

In this case, as plaintiff notes, \u00a7 1806(f) seems on its face to conflict with traditional principles of common law, namely the common law state secrets privilege. Specifically, the mandatory\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review procedures established in \u00a7 1806(f), in situations in which these procedures apply, likely displace the common law process whereby courts review the government's assertion of the state secrets privilege to avoid disclosure of information potentially harmful to national security. Given this, traditional principles of statutory interpretation counsel that FISA must be narrowly construed so as to avoid excessive displacement inconsistent with Congress's intent. To interpret the text of \u00a7 1806(f) broadly, as plaintiff here suggests, to encompass not just motions raised by parties who have adduced evidence that they are \"aggrieved persons,\" but also motions by parties who simply allege that they are \"aggrieved persons,\" would do precisely this, namely displace the common law to an extent neither contemplated nor intended by Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In an attempt to avoid this conclusion, plaintiff contends that the allegations contained in the complaint are sufficient to establish that plaintiff is an \"aggrieved person\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1806(f). Specifically, defendant cites to the Fourth Circuit's determination that plaintiff's complaint alleges sufficient facts \"to make plausible the conclusion that the NSA is intercepting, copying, and reviewing at least some of [plaintiff's] communications\" and contends that this plausibility determination is sufficient standing alone to require invocation of \u00a7 1806(f)'s procedures.\n   <em>\n    Wikimedia Found., et al.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276507\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/193/\">\n    857 F.3d at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the Fourth Circuit concluded that plaintiff had sufficiently alleged injury-in-fact for the purposes of surviving a motion to dismiss; the Fourth Circuit never considered the requisite showing of \"aggrieved person\" status to trigger the earlier procedures outlined in \u00a7 1806(f).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276507\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/193/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276507\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/193/\">\n    at 207-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In denying the motion to dismiss, the D.C.

In this respect, the D.C.

Circuit contemplated the conclusion reached here, namely that in order to trigger \u00a7 1806(f) procedures, a plaintiff must first adduce evidence sufficient at least to create a genuine dispute as to whether the plaintiff has been the target of electronic surveillance in the past or whether electronic surveillance is ongoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that to require a plaintiff to adduce evidence of surveillance to demonstrate his or her \"aggrieved person\" status would necessarily mean that a plaintiff could not do so unless the government affirmatively acknowledges the fact of surveillance. And to require the government affirmatively to acknowledge the fact of surveillance prior to invocation of \u00a7 1806(f) procedures, plaintiffs contend, would be inconsistent with other provisions in the statute, namely the civil cause of action established in \u00a7 1810.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This argument fails to persuade because it mischaracterizes both (i) the requirements for establishing \"aggrieved person\" status and (ii) the nature of the civil remedy established in \u00a7 1810. To begin with, affirmative government acknowledgement of surveillance of a specific target is not the only means by which a plaintiff can establish evidence of his or her \"aggrieved person\" status. Indeed, courts have recognized that plaintiffs can \"rely on many non-classified materials, including present and future public disclosures of the government or [telecommunications providers] on the alleged NSA programs\" to establish that they have been the target of electronic surveillance.\n   <em>\n    Hepting v. AT&amp;T Corp., et al.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3426127\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/439/974/#p998\">\n    439 F.Supp.2d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 998 (N.D. Cal. 2006). Thus, to require a plaintiff to adduce evidence of surveillance to demonstrate his or her \"aggrieved person\" status does not necessarily require that the government affirmatively acknowledge the fact of surveillance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   And even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that affirmative government acknowledgment was the only means by which a plaintiff could prove his or her \"aggrieved person\" status, this requirement would not be inconsistent with the remedy established in \u00a7 1810. That section provides a civil remedy to \"[a]n aggrieved person ... who has been subjected to an electronic surveillance or about whom information obtained by electronic surveillance of such person has been disclosed or used in violation of section 1809.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201810\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This argument is unpersuasive; courts have made clear that \u00a7 1810 is not actually a remedy against the government because \u00a7 1810 does not contain an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al-Haramain Islamic Found., Inc. v.

Notably, although both \u00a7 1806(f) and \u00a7 3504 use the term \"aggrieved,\" \u00a7 1806(f), unlike \u00a7 3504, incorporates a statutory definition of an \"aggrieved person,\" which specifies that an \"aggrieved person\" is \"a person who is the target of an electronic surveillance\" or \"whose communications or activities were subject to surveillance[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201801\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k). As such, while a party can claim to be aggrieved for the purposes of \u00a7 3504 through a \"mere assertion\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   that unlawful surveillance has occurred, \u00a7 1806(f) requires that the person has actually been a target of electronic surveillance or has been subject to surveillance before that individual can trigger the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review procedures outlined in \u00a7 1806(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Moreover, the reasoning in support of the low burden in the \u00a7 3504 context does not apply here. Specifically, in analyzing \u00a7 3504, courts have reasoned that the government's obligation to affirm or deny the occurrence of unlawful surveillance is triggered by the mere assertion of unlawful wiretapping because \"requiring the government to affirm or deny the existence of illegal surveillance of witnesses imposes\n   only a minimal additional burden upon the government.\"\n   <em>\n    Vielguth\n   </em>\n   , 502 F.2d at 1259 n.4 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Evans\n   </em>\n   , 452 F.2d at 1247 ). But this reasoning is inapplicable here because \u00a7 1806(f) requires much more than a simple affirmation or denial by the government. Section 1806(f) procedures, once triggered, require the court to review\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   all of the relevant materials relating to electronic surveillance-in this case, potentially 10,000 pages of documents-to determine the lawfulness of the surveillance. The reasoning justifying the low burden in \u00a7 3504 is thus inapplicable here where a much higher burden is associated with the applicable procedures. Given that the\n   <em>\n    In re NSA Telecommunications Records Litigation\n   </em>\n   court, in interpreting the requirements of \u00a7 1806(f), relied on a standard imported from\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203504\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which, for the reasons described above, is inapplicable here, plaintiff's reliance on\n   <em>\n    In Re NSA Telecommunications Records Litigation\n   </em>\n   is unpersuasive and does not alter the conclusion reached here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In sum, when interpreted in light of traditional principles of statutory interpretation, the text of \u00a7 1806(f) makes clear that \u00a7 1806(f) procedures do not apply where, as here, the plaintiff has merely plausibly alleged that it has been the target of surveillance and has not yet adduced evidence establishing this fact of surveillance. Accordingly, it is not appropriate at this time to engage in\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the materials responsive to plaintiff's interrogatories or to those plaintiff describes in its motion to compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Given that \u00a7 1806(f) procedures do not apply here, it is unnecessary to consider the question whether \u00a7 1806(f) displaces the state secrets privilege in situations in which \u00a7 1806(f) does apply.

To begin with, the procedural requirements for invocation of the state secrets privilege have been satisfied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants, the NSA, ODNI, and the DOJ, are U.S. government agencies and thus can properly claim the state secrets privilege. The claim of privilege was lodged by Daniel Coats (\"Coats\"), the Director of National Intelligence (\"DNI\"), who is the head of the U.S. Intelligence Community and in this regard, is tasked with the protection of intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Coats Decl. \u00b6 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Coats invoked the privilege formally after personally considering the nature of plaintiffs discovery requests and determining that disclosure of the information requested reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage, and at the very least, serious damage, to U.S. national security.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Coats Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 16, 24, 28, 32, 35, 39, 43. Accordingly, it is clear that defendants have satisfied the procedural requirements for invocation of the state secrets privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The government has similarly satisfied its burden with respect to the second step of the state secrets privilege analysis as careful review of the public Coats declaration and the classified Barnes declaration reveals that \"there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose ... matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged.\"\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372534\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/1/#p10\">\n    345 U.S. at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372534\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/1/#p10\">\n    73 S.Ct. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, through public and classified declarations defendants have identified seven categories of information covered by plaintiff's discovery requests, including: (i) entities subject to Upstream surveillance activities, (ii) operational details of the Upstream collection process, (iii) locations at which Upstream surveillance is conducted, (iv) categories of Internet-based communications subject to Upstream surveillance activities, (v) the scope and scale on which Upstream surveillance is or has been conducted, (vi) NSA's cryptanalytic capabilities, and (vii) additional categories in contained\n   in FISC opinions and submissions. Moreover, defendants have provided detailed descriptions, in more than 60 pages of classified declarations, explaining that disclosure of these categories of information would undermine ongoing intelligence operations, deprive the NSA of existing intelligence methods, and significantly, provide foreign adversaries with the tools necessary both to evade U.S. intelligence operations and to conduct their own operations against the United States and its allies. In sum, it is clear that there is a reasonable, and indeed likely, danger that disclosure of this information will expose matters which should not be divulged in the interest of national security, and as such, this information falls squarely within the ambit of the state secrets privilege.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abilt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277390\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/305/#p310\">\n    848 F.3d at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that \"[t]here is little doubt that there is a reasonable danger that if information ... regarding ... the sources and methods used by the CIA [and] the targets of CIA intelligence collection and operations ... were revealed, that disclosure would threaten the national security of the United States\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In an attempt to avoid this conclusion, plaintiff contends that to acknowledge the fact that plaintiff has been subject to surveillance would not, in fact, threaten national security. This argument plainly fails because courts have concluded that where, as here, the information sought to be disclosed involves the identity of parties whose communications have been acquired, this information is properly privileged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al-Haramain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047469\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/507/1190/#p1203\">\n    507 F.3d at 1203-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the fact of a plaintiff's surveillance by the NSA was covered by the state secrets privilege);\n   <em>\n    Halkin v.

Although this proposition may appear to have some force, courts have consistently recognized that \"judicial intuition\" about a proposition such as this \"is no substitute for documented risks and threats posed by the potential disclosure of national security information.\"\n   <em>\n    Al-Haramain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047469\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/507/1190/#p1203\">\n    507 F.3d at 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And defendants have thoroughly documented those risks in the classified declaration here, explaining that to reveal the fact of surveillance of an organization such as plaintiff, even considering plaintiff's voluminous online communications, would provide insight into the structure and operations of the Upstream surveillance program and in so doing, undermine the effectiveness of this intelligence method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, plaintiff argues that there cannot be a reasonable danger of undermining national security because much of the information plaintiff seeks is already contained in publicly-accessible documents. But importantly, the information disclosed in these public documents is plainly different\n   from the information that plaintiff seeks. For example, plaintiff's requests for admissions 13 through 15 ask defendants to admit that the NSA is conducting Upstream surveillance via \"multiple INTERNET BACKBONE CIRCUITS,\" \"multiple international Internet link[s],\" and \"multiple INTERNET BACKBONE 'chokepoints.' \" Plaintiff contends that these facts have already been acknowledged by the NSA, as reflected in the PCLOB Report and certain unclassified portions of FISC opinions. Specifically, plaintiff contends that the PCLOB report's reference to \"circuits\" suggests the NSA is conducting surveillance on more than one circuit. To be sure, the PCLOB report does use the term \"circuits,\" but it does not do so to refer to the number of sites the NSA is monitoring. Instead, the PCLOB report uses the term \"circuits\" in the context of defining the \"Internet backbone.\" Specifically, the PCLOB report explains that the \"Internet backbone\" consists of \"circuits that are used to facilitate Internet communications[.]\" PCLOB Rep. at 36. Similarly, the redacted FISC Opinion cited by plaintiff does not, as plaintiff contends, confirm that the NSA is monitoring multiple international Internet links; instead, the redacted October 3, 2011 FISC Opinion states that \"the government readily concedes that NSA will acquire a wholly domestic 'about' communication if the transaction containing the communication is routed through an international Internet link being monitored by the NSA....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%2010945618\">\n    2011 WL 10945618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 (FISC Oct. 3, 2011). Nothing in this statement confirms that the NSA is monitoring multiple internet links.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, plaintiff's argument fails because although the government has declassified certain information about the Upstream surveillance program, the government has not yet released the precise information at issue here. Accordingly, this information is still properly subject to the state secrets privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In sum, a careful review of defendants' public and classified declarations reveals (i) that defendants have satisfied the procedural requirements necessary to invoke the state secrets privilege and (ii) that the information sought to be protected qualifies as privileged under the state secrets doctrine. Given that defendants have satisfied the requirements of the state secrets privilege, \"the claim of privilege will be accepted without requiring further disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    Abilt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277390\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/305/#p310\">\n    848 F.3d at 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372534\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/1/#p10\">\n    345 U.S. at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372534\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/1/#p10\">\n    73 S.Ct. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).
