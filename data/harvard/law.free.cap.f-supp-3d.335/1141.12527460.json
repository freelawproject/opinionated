Compl. \u00b6 18, Latz Aff. Ex. 1. Osorio worked as a buffet table attendant from 1999 until his termination. Am. Compl. \u00b6 2. On November 28, 2009, Osorio was injured while on duty when a full can of soda fell several stories in the hotel's atrium and hit him on the head.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Osorio filed a worker's compensation claim, which The Northland Inn contested.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Osorio alleges that after he filed his worker's compensation claim, his supervisors\n   treated him unfairly, berated him publicly, refused to accommodate his medical restrictions, and questioned his need to attend medical appointments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Osorio and The Northland Inn ultimately settled the worker's compensation claim on April 18, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Osorio alleges that when he returned to work the next day, the human resources director told him that he had to resign his position in order to receive his paycheck and ongoing medical insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Osorio contacted his worker's compensation attorney, who resolved the issue, at least temporarily.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Osorio continued to work at The Northland Inn under difficult circumstances until his termination on June 6, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 9, 2018, Osorio commenced this lawsuit in Hennepin County District Court by serving defendant Minneapolis Hotel Acquisition Group, LLC (MHAG).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Latz Aff. Ex. 2. The original complaint identifies MHAG as doing business as \"Minneapolis Marriott Northwest, a Delaware corporation, successor corporation to Benchmark Hospitality and StepStone Hospitality dba as The Northland Inn/Marriott Northland Inn/Minneapolis Marriott Northwest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. In that complaint, Osorio alleged that MHAG unlawfully discharged him in retaliation for filing his worker's compensation claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 11, 2018, counsel for MHAG told Osorio's counsel that, although MHAG currently owned The Northland Inn, the previous owner, StepStone Hospitality, Inc., retained all liabilities incurred before the acquisition and therefore would likely be the proper defendant in this matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Latz Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. On May 25, 2018, counsel for MHAG provided Osorio with the name and address of StepStone's registered agent in Minnesota as well as the contact information for its counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 6 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Counsel for Osorio then sent an email to StepStone's counsel asking StepStone to, among other things, waive any statute of limitations defense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Counsel for StepStone responded on May 29, 2018, noting that StepStone had not yet been served with a complaint and stating that it would respond to a lawsuit in due course after such service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Osorio served StepStone with the amended complaint on June 8, 2018. Latz Aff. Ex. 5. Defendants removed to this court on June 27, 2018, and StepStone now moves to dismiss Osorio's claim against it as untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The parties also agree that the limitations period commences on the date of the adverse employment action. Here, the limitations period commenced on June 6, 2012, the date of Osorio's termination, and therefore expired on June 6, 2018. There is no dispute that Osorio's claim against MHAG is timely, because he served the original complaint on April 8, 2018. But StepStone was not served with the amended complaint until June 8, 2018, two days after the limitations period expired. According to StepStone, any claim against it is time barred. Osorio responds that the amended complaint relates back to the date of the original complaint, thus rendering his claim against StepStone timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   An amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted, if the claim arises out the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out in the original complaint and if, within the ninety-day period provided by Rule 4(m) for serving the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [1] received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [2] knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party's identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Osorio argues that he has satisfied Rule 15(c)(1)(C) because he mistakenly failed to include StepStone as a party in the initial pleading because he was confused about which entity retained liability relating to his injury. He also argues that StepStone was aware that it would have been sued\n   absent a mistake within the ninety-day service period set forth in Rule 4(m) and the limitations period. StepStone responds that Osorio has not adequately established that he made a \"mistake\" within the meaning of Rule 15(c). StepStone does not contest, however, that it had knowledge of a potential action against it within Rule 4(m)'s service period, nor does it argue that it will be prejudiced in defending the case on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although the court is troubled by Osorio's failure to amend his complaint to include StepStone as a defendant within the limitations period,\n   <em>\n    Krupski v.

Osorio initially sued MHAG apparently mistakenly believing that MHAG had acquired The Northland Inn's liabilities from StepStone. Osorio even included StepStone in the caption indicating that MHAG was a \"successor corporation\" to StepStone. Thus, although Osorio was aware of StepStone's existence when he served the original complaint, he clearly did not understand the relationship between MHAG and StepStone and therefore did not deliberately decide to sue MHAG instead of StepStone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, Osorio made a \"mistake concerning the proper party.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).
