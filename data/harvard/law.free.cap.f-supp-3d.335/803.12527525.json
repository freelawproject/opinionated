Michelle Childs, United States District Judge <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"806\" href=\"#p806\" id=\"p806\">*806</a>This matter is before the court for review of the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation (\"Report\") filed on July 23, 2018 (ECF No. 197). The Report addresses Plaintiff Lishu Yin's (\"Yin\") Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 144) and Defendant Columbia International University's (\"CIU\") Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 159). The Report recommends that the court deny Yin's Motion, but grant CIU's Motion, because Yin's suit against CIU is barred by the ministerial exception to employment discrimination statutes. (ECF No. 197 at 2, 15.) For the reasons stated herein, the court <strong>ACCEPTS IN PART</strong> the Report, <strong>DENIES</strong> Yin's Motion for Summary Judgment, and <strong>GRANTS</strong> CIU's Motion for Summary Judgment.</p><p id=\"p-9\"><strong>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</strong></p><p id=\"p-10\"><strong>1. <em>Factual History</em></strong></p><p id=\"p-11\">CIU is located in Columbia, South Carolina, and offers undergraduate, graduate, post-graduate, and advanced programs. (ECF No. 160-1 at 1, 5.) Founded in 1923, CIU is a \"multi-denominational Christian institution of higher education dedicated to preparing world Christians to serve God with excellence.\" (<em>Id.</em> at 5.) In addition to being a nonprofit, educational institution (ECF No. 144-1 at 2), CIU identifies as a ministry. (ECF No. 159-2 at 4; ECF No. 159-3 at 11; ECF No. 160 at 5.) CIU trains \"Christians for global missions, full-time vocational Christian ministry in a variety of strategic professions, and marketplace ministry.\" (ECF No. 160-1 at 5.) CIU's first class was only seven students, but the institution now includes over 1,200 students. (<em>Id.</em> ) The purpose of CIU is to educate people \"from a biblical worldview to impact the nations with the message of Christ.\" (<em>Id.</em> ) In order to achieve this purpose, all of CIU's programs \"emphasize spiritual development, biblical training, and ministry skills development.\" (<em>Id.</em> ) CIU's motto is: \"To know Him and to make Him known.\" (<em>Id.</em> )</p><p id=\"p-12\">CIU requires all employees, including faculty, \"to live, teach, and promote a life of godly choices and Christian growth....\" (ECF No. 159-3 at 11.) The faculty at CIU are \"all part of the effort to prepare Christians for service in ministries that support the establishment of healthy, reproducing churches at home and abroad.\" (<em>Id.</em> ) While teaching at CIU, faculty members are required to \"accept the faculty role as a ministry in the biblical sense and should never consider it a 'mere job.' \" (ECF No. 159-5 at 40.) A faculty member at CIU is freely committed to CIU's Statement of Faith, Employee Handbook, and Educational Philosophy &amp; Responsibilities Guide. (<em>Id.</em> at 45.) For example, CIU's Educational Philosophy &amp; Responsibilities Guide (\"Educational Guide\") says the following:</p><p id=\"p-13\">Since the teacher has been called to CIU by God, there should be a full-time commitment to this ministry. Though some regulation to meet other priorities is appropriate, the faculty role is not compatible with a \"40-hour week\" mentality. On the other hand, one should not over extend by assuming responsibility not of God's plan.</p><p id=\"p-14\">(<em>Id.</em> at 40.) According to CIU, such a commitment is an expression, and not an abridgment, on academic freedom. (<em>Id.</em> at <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"807\" href=\"#p807\" id=\"p807\">*807</a>45.) In the classroom, faculty members are expected to express and model CIU's beliefs and minister to students about the Gospel. (ECF No. 159-2 at 8.) For example, the Educational Guide also states:</p><p id=\"p-15\">In pursuing educational objectives, the teacher is involved in a discipling ministry. Although much of the faculty member's time is scheduled around the classroom, impact on students involves a variety of contacts and relationships. In addition, in teamwork with other faculty and staff members the teacher models and communicates the life of the body of Christ. Designed to implement this concept, specific responsibilities noted constitute the teacher's integrated ministry.... Attendance at all united and school chapels, as well as at all scheduled Prayer Day activities, is a community responsibility. Occasionally, faculty members also may be requested to participate in chapel programs or in other Ministry events.</p><p id=\"p-16\">(<em>Id.</em> at 168.) Additionally, faculty members at CIU are required to sign Affirmation Statements, which assign numerous religious tasks for faculty to complete. (ECF No. 151-10.) Lastly, CIU regularly evaluates faculty in regard to their adherence to CIU's mission, Doctrinal Statement, Core Values, Lifestyle Policies, and Philosophy of Human Resources (ECF No. 151 at 3-7). (<em>Id.</em> )</p><p id=\"p-17\">CIU considers a job applicant's Christian life, training, and calling as a condition of employment. (ECF No. 159-2 at 9; ECF No. 162-11 at 5-6.) On July 1, 2008, CIU advertised the faculty position of TEFL-ESL,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which was described as \"facilitating student growth in biblical knowledge, spiritual maturity, ministry orientation, and the professional skills necessary for service in a variety of cultural contexts.\" (ECF No. 162-16 at 1.) The TEFL-ESL instructor was \"called upon to embody and to implement CIU's purpose and mission....\" (<em>Id.</em> ) On March 10, 2008, Yin submitted an application for this position and provided the name of her church, pastor, and personal testimony regarding Christianity. (ECF No. 151-5 at 6; ECF No. 159-2 at 9.) According to CIU officials, Yin's representations were \"important, if not essential,\" in the decision to hire her. (ECF No. 159-2 at 10.) Moreover, CIU officials state that Yin's education from Oral Roberts University, a Christian college, encouraged them to hire her because it showed that she had a \"Christian education orientation\" and had \"received Christian training.\" (ECF No. 162-11 at 9.) On May 19, 2008, Yin received a formal confirmation of her appointment to CIU. (ECF No. 151-7 at 1.)</p><p id=\"p-18\">Yin was employed as a full-time faculty member at CIU from July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2014. (ECF No. 1 at 4.) While at CIU, Yin taught courses in TEFL, and in 2011, she became the Director of the TESOL Program in 2011. (<em>Id.</em> at 8, 10.) Yin holds three degrees: (1) a doctorate degree from Mississippi State University; (2) a master's degree from Oral Roberts University; and (3) a bachelor's degree from Guizhou University. (ECF No. 1-2 at 1.)</p><p id=\"p-19\">As part of Yin's academic responsibilities at CIU, she taught an array of courses, including but not limited to, TEFL and TESOL. (ECF Nos. 162-3, 162-4, 162-5, 162-6, 162-7, 162-8.) Each course had a distinct objective, but some of the objectives included: (1) \"explor[ing] strategies for teaching multicultural and multilingual <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"808\" href=\"#p808\" id=\"p808\">*808</a>ESOL learners in K-12 settings; (2) \"develop[ing][ ] ... personal qualities necessary for [an] effective English language teaching ministry; (3) \"discuss[ing] the implications of second language acquisition theories to the language classroom; (4) \"present[ing] a rationale for using English language teaching as ministry\"; and (5) \"develop[ing][ ] ... excellence in personal academic standards.\" (ECF No. 162-3 at 1; No. 162-6 at 3; ECF No. 162-8 at 1.) In addition to teaching her courses, Yin was also responsible for \"supervising practicum and internships,\" \"preparing course syllabi,\" and \"helping students explore career and life goals.\" (ECF No. 151-8 at 1.) She was expected to participate in various institutional activities, including chapel and prayer-day programs, annual faculty workshops, and other faculty meetings. (<em>Id.</em> at 2.) As a faculty member, Yin was tasked with helping CIU to prepare students for ministry roles. (ECF No. 162-11 at 12.)</p><p id=\"p-20\">During the course of her tenure at CIU, Yin required her students to pray together over the course of the semester, integrated biblical materials into her courses, and prepared students for ministry roles. (ECF No. 152 at 10-11; ECF No. 159-2 at 15; ECF No. 162-11 at 11-12.) Yin was also spiritually active outside of her classroom, but still within the CIU community. (ECF No. 162-11 at 10-12; ECF No. 152 at 15.) For instance, Yin led the Advisor/Advisee Chapels at CIU and determined the content of those meetings. (ECF No. 162-11 at 11.) In that role, Yin facilitated forty-five minute meetings in which participants engaged in prayer, worship, and religious teaching. (ECF No. 152 at 15.)</p><p id=\"p-21\">As a member of the CIU faculty, Yin was evaluated by her superiors. (ECF No. 159-2 at 14-15.) In 2009, she received a satisfactory rating and was \"well-rated\" by her students. (ECF No. 162-11 at 12.) In 2012, she was given an overall rating between exceptional and commendable. (ECF No. 151-11 at 4-5.) Her 2012 evaluation stated the following:</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-22\">Lishu Yin not only has a great passion for the area of TESOL, but also desires to bring all education students to a level of excellence.... She is a spiritually minded educator who is learning more about framing her teaching with biblical integration. Dr. Yin continues to see God's providential hand at work. She is a great asset spiritually and academically to the College of Education.</p><p id=\"p-23\">(<em>Id.</em> at 4.) Yin also performed a self-evaluation form in 2012. (ECF No. 151-12 at 1.) As a practitioner, she stated that she provided guidelines for every assignment, met with students individually, and incorporated technology into her teaching. (<em>Id.</em> at 2.) As an authentic professional, she opined that she incorporated CIU's institutional goals into every class, encouraged students to \"follow the Lord's calling and live out the faith,\" and required her students to form prayer groups. (<em>Id.</em> at 3-4.)</p><p id=\"p-24\">In January 2014, CIU faced financial difficulties. (ECF No. 152 at 17.) As a result of those difficulties and not because of how Yin taught her classes, CIU decided to terminate Yin's contract. (<em>Id.</em> at 17.) Subsequently, on May 18, 2015, and at the request of Yin, the South Carolina Human Affairs Commission was unable to conclude a violation under state law. (ECF No. 1-1 at 1-3.) On June 26, 2015, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission adopted the findings of the South Carolina Human Affairs Commissioner and issued a Notice of Right to Sue to Yin, allowing her ninety days (90) to file a suit against CUI in federal court. (ECF No. 1-1 at 4-5.)</p><p id=\"p-25\"><strong>2. <em>Procedural History</em></strong></p><p id=\"p-26\">Yin, proceeding <em>pro se</em> , filed her Complaint in this court on September 11, 2015. (ECF No. 1.) Yin alleges that CIU violated <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"809\" href=\"#p809\" id=\"p809\">*809</a>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a), 2000e-3(a), by discriminating and retaliating against her on the basis of race, sex, and national origin. (<em>Id.</em> at 4, 36.) Additionally, Yin maintains that CIU violated the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29 U.S.C. 206(d), and committed defamation under state law. (<em>Id.</em> at 36.)</p><p id=\"p-27\">On November 9, 2015, CIU filed a Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and/or to Strike pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f). (ECF No. 20.) On April 11, 2016, the Magistrate Judge issued a Report granting CIU's Motion to Dismiss Yin's defamation claim and denying CIU's Motion to Dismiss Yin's federal claims and its Motion to Strike Yin's allegedly untimely allegations. (ECF No. 40.) On September 26, 2016, after proper objections were filed by Yin and CIU to the Magistrate Judge's Report (ECF Nos. 43, 44), this court entered an order adopting the Magistrate Judge's Report. (ECF No. 66.)</p><p id=\"p-28\">On October 24, 2016, CIU filed its Motion for Certification of an Issue for Interlocutory Appeal under <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292</extracted-citation>(b) or, in the Alternative, Motion to Reconsider under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), stating that Yin was a minister, barring her federal claims under the ministerial exception. (ECF No. 71.) On November 10, 2016, Yin filed a Response in Opposition to CIU's Motion for Certification of an Issue for Interlocutory Appeal or, in the Alternative, Motion to Reconsider, denying, among other things, that she is a \"minister,\" thus limiting the applicability of the ministerial exception. (ECF No. 84.) CIU replied to Yin's response in opposition, reaffirming the facts and law that were present in its original Motion (ECF Nos. 71, 71-1). (ECF No. 95.) On July 20 and July 28, 2017, CIU filed Supplemental Authorities in Support of its Motion for Reconsideration. (ECF Nos. 110, 114.) On July 25 and August 1, 2017, Yin filed Memoranda in Opposition. (ECF Nos. 111, 115.) On September 28, 2017, the court denied CIU's Motion for Certification of an Issue for Interlocutory Appeal and denied CIU's Motion to Reconsider under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). (ECF No. 66.)</p><p id=\"p-29\">After additional discovery pursuant to a scheduling order (ECF No. 126), Yin filed her Motion for Summary Judgment on February 28, 2018, and argued that she was not a minister for purposes of the ministerial exception. (ECF No. 144.) CIU filed its Motion for Summary Judgment on March 27, 2018, and maintained that Yin was a minister for purposes of the ministerial exception. (ECF No. 159.) The Magistrate Judge issued a Report on July 23, 2018. (ECF No. 197.) On the basis of the ministerial exception, the Report recommends dismissing Yin's Motion and granting CIU's Motion. (<em>Id.</em> at 16.) Yin filed her Objection to the Report on August 20, 2018, arguing that the ministerial exception does not apply to her case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (ECF No.</p><p id=\"p-30\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"810\" href=\"#p810\" id=\"p810\">*810</a>207.) CIU replied in opposition to Yin's Objection on September 25, 2018. (ECF No. 220.) CIU contends that the ministerial exception bars Yin's suit and that the court should dismiss the case with prejudice. (ECF No. 159-1 at 35.)</p><p id=\"p-31\"><strong>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</strong></p><p id=\"p-32\">The Magistrate Judge's Report is made in accordance with <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636</extracted-citation>(b)(1) and Local Civil Rule 73.02 for the District of South Carolina. The Magistrate Judge only makes a recommendation to this court, and the recommendation has no presumptive weight. <em>See</em> <em>Mathews v.

Therefore, Yin's formal title is secular in nature and does not necessarily have a religious connotation. <em>See</em> <em>Richardson</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267635\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/242/1132/#p1145\">242 F.Supp.3d at 1145</extracted-citation> (finding that an assistant professor of exercise science was a secular title and not in favor of applying the ministerial exception). Indeed, a college professor, one teaching a secular subject, is unlike a kosher supervisor, music teacher at a religious institution, or non-ordained associate in pastoral care. <em>See</em> <em>Shaliehsabou</em> , 363 F.3d at 309 ; <em>Roman Catholic Diocese</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11513754\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/213/795/\">213 F.3d at </extracted-citation>803 ; <em>Rayburn</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306810\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/772/1164/\">772 F.2d at 1168</extracted-citation>. Yin even identifies her job title as an \"academic professor.\" (ECF No. 144 at 3.) Thus, the formal title cuts in Yin's favor and against applying the ministerial exception.</p><p id=\"p-50\">In regard to the substance reflected in Yin's title, her position \"facilitate[d] student growth in biblical knowledge, spiritual maturity, ministry orientation, and the professional skills necessary for service in a variety of cultural contexts.\" (ECF No. 162-16 at 1.) Additionally, the TEFL-ESL instructor was \"called upon to embody and to implement CIU's purpose and mission\" (ECF No. 162-16 at 1), which necessarily included training Christians for ministry and educating students <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"816\" href=\"#p816\" id=\"p816\">*816</a>from a biblical worldview in order to spread the message of Christ (ECF No. 160-1 at 5). Substantively, the TEFL-ESL position suggests that Yin was expected \"to live, teach, and promote a life of godly choices and Christian growth\" like every other faculty member at CIU. (ECF No. 159-3 at 11.) Although CIU states that Yin's Christian education at Oral Roberts was an important consideration in its decision to hire her (ECF No. 162-11 at 9), that fact is of minimal value because Yin did not obtain a theological degree from Oral Roberts and she possessed secular degrees from other non-religious institutions. (<em>See</em> ECF No. 1-2 at 1.) A court must objectively examine the substance reflected in an employee's title and is not required to give complete deference to a religious institution's subjective reasons for hiring an employee. <em>See</em> <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">565 U.S. at 191-92</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">132 S.Ct. 694</extracted-citation>. <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> did not give such deference to the religious institution when evaluating the substance of a religious title, and this factor seemed to turn Perich's \"significant degree of religious training.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Nevertheless, even though Yin does not have formal training in religion or theology, her position has substantive religious duties reflected within the title as indicated by the job description. <em>See</em> <em>Fratello</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275802\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/190/\">863 F.3d at 207-08</extracted-citation> (finding that the substance reflected in the title of a parochial school's principal, even though the principal did not have formal training in religion, weighed in favor of applying the ministerial exception). Therefore, this factor is in favor of applying the ministerial exception.</p><p id=\"p-51\">The court must next consider Yin's use of her title. <em>See</em> <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">565 U.S. at 192</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">132 S.Ct. 694</extracted-citation>. In <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> , the Supreme Court was persuaded that Perich \"held herself out as a minister of the Church\" by accepting a formal call to religious service, claiming a special housing allowance in the exercise of ministry, and indicating her ministerial status on forms relating to her termination. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\"> at 191-92</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">132 S.Ct. 694</extracted-citation>. In the instant case, there is no indication that Yin held herself out as a minister because, unlike Perich in <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> , she did not claim a special housing allowance as a minister, nor are there any documents indicating that she considered herself to be a minister. (ECF Nos. 1, 207.) Although Yin was required to be part of \"a ministry in a biblical sense\" (ECF No. 159-5 at 40) and engaged in activities relating to the Christian faith (ECF No. 152 at 10-11, 15; ECF No. 159-2 at 15; ECF No. 162-11 at 11-12), nothing indicates that <em>she understood</em> that she would be considered a religious leader or minister at CIU. <em>See</em> <em>Richardson</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267635\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/242/1132/#p1145\">242 F.Supp.3d at 1145</extracted-citation> (\"[A]lthough there is ample evidence that plaintiff held herself out as a <em>Christian</em> , there is no evidence that she held herself out as a <em>minister.</em> \"). <em>But see</em> <em>Fratello</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275802\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/190/\">863 F.3d at 208</extracted-citation> (holding that a principal of a parochial school \"understood that she would be perceived as a religious leader\"). Therefore, this factor counsels against applying the ministerial exception to Yin's case.</p><p id=\"p-52\">Lastly, the court must consider the functions performed by Yin at CIU. <em>See</em> <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">565 U.S. at 192</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">132 S.Ct. 694</extracted-citation>. In <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> , this factor was in favor of the ministerial exception's application because Perich was charged with \"conveying the Church's message and carrying out its mission.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Specifically, she was \"charged ... with 'lead[ing] others toward Christian maturity' and \"teach[ing] faithfully the Word of God, the Sacred Scriptures, in its truth and purity and as set forth in all the symbolical books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> (citation omitted). Additionally, \"she took her students to school-wide chapel service, and ... took her turn leading it, choosing the <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"817\" href=\"#p817\" id=\"p817\">*817</a>liturgy, selecting the hymns, and deliver a short message based on verses from the Bible.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> The court finds that the Supreme Court's analysis in <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> is extremely applicable to the instant case. Under these specific facts, Yin required her students to pray together over the course of the semester, integrated biblical materials into her courses, and prepared students for ministry roles. (ECF No. 152 at 10-11; ECF No. 159-2 at 15; ECF No. 162-11 at 11-12.) While at CIU, Yin led the Advisor/Advisee Chapels and determined the content of those meetings. (ECF No. 162-11 at 11.) She also regularly encouraged students to \"follow the Lord's calling and live out the faith.\" (ECF No. 151-12 at 3.) Thus, this factor, which the court weighs heavily, is in favor of applying the ministerial exception.</p><p id=\"p-53\">On the one hand, two of the <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> factors weigh in favor of applying the ministerial exception and are in CIU's favor, the substance of Yin's title and the religious functions performed by Yin. On the other hand, two of the factors weigh against the ministerial exception and are in Yin's favor, Yin's formal title and her use of that title. However, according to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, \"even referring to them as 'factors' denotes the kind of formulaic inquiry that the Supreme Court has rejected\" and it is appropriate to consider the factors holistically. <em>Grussgott</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515987\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/655/\">882 F.3d at 661-62</extracted-citation> (reasoning that <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> imposes a totality of the circumstances test when considering all of the facts and factors of a case). <em>See also</em> <em>Cannata</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638086\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/169/\">700 F.3d at 177</extracted-citation> (\"[T]he Hosanna-Tabor Court eschewed a 'rigid formula' and the application of a bright-line test in ministerial exception cases.\" (citation omitted) ). In this case, Yin required her students to pray, prayed with her students, led students during Advisor/Advisee Chapels, integrated biblical materials into her courses, and prepared students for ministry roles (ECF No. 152 at 10-11; ECF No. 159-2 at 15; ECF No. 162-11 at 11-12). <em>But see</em> <em>Richardson</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267635\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/242/1132/#p1145\">242 F.Supp.3d at 1145</extracted-citation> (declining to find that a professor of exercise science qualified as a minister under the ministerial exception when, among other facts, \"she was charged with no religious duties such as taking students to chapel or leading them in prayer\"). Moreover, Yin believed that God brought her to CIU and even led a group during a university-wide Prayer Day. (ECF No. 152 at 10, 16.) While this is an extremely close case, it seems that Yin's position was \"important to the spiritual and pastoral mission of the church.\" <em>Rayburn</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306810\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/772/1164/\">772 F.2d at 1169</extracted-citation>. Most importantly, based upon the description of the job position, it seems that Yin had notice of possible \"ministry responsibilities,\" and she decided to knowingly undertake those responsibilities during her tenure at CIU. (ECF No. 151-8 at 2; ECF No. 162-11 at 11.) As such, in accordance with the <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> factors and under these specific circumstances, the court concludes that Yin is a minister under the ministerial exception.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-54\">The ministerial exception does not require \"a rigid formula for deciding when an employee qualifies as a minister.\"</p><p id=\"p-55\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"818\" href=\"#p818\" id=\"p818\">*818</a><em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">565 U.S. at 190</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">132 S.Ct. 694</extracted-citation>. Consequently, the court declines to hold that every professor at CIU qualifies as a minister. <em>See</em> <em>Fratello</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275802\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/190/\">863 F.3d at 206</extracted-citation> (\"[W]e do not accept the defendants' argument that all parochial-school principals should be presumed ministers within the meaning of the exception.... [A]ny such categorical presumption runs counter to the teaching of <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> .... In each case, therefore, we must assess the <em>specific circumstances</em> of employment.\" (emphasis added) ). Indeed, there may be professors at CIU that perform few, if any, religious functions. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275802\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/190/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Notwithstanding that consideration, the court will address those issues on a case-by-case basis. <em>See</em> <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">565 U.S. at 196</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">132 S.Ct. 694</extracted-citation> (\"There will be time enough to address the applicability of the exception to other circumstances if and when they arise.\"). Until that time arrives, the court concludes that Yin, and only Yin, qualifies as a minister under the ministerial exception.</p><p id=\"p-56\"><strong>IV. CONCLUSION</strong></p><p id=\"p-57\">After a thorough review of Yin's Objection (ECF No. 207) and the Magistrate Judge's Report (ECF No. 197), the court <strong>ACCEPTS IN PART</strong> the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation (ECF No. 197), <strong>DENIES</strong> Yin's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 144), and <strong>GRANTS</strong> Columbia International University's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 159).

(<em>Id.</em> )</p><p id=\"p-62\">In her Objection, Yin included additional exhibits that were not before the Magistrate Judge.

(ECF No. 197 at 9, 16.) The Report states that: \"The circumstances considered by the Court in <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> included the employee's title, the employer's and employee's representations of the employee's title and duties to the public, the employee's level of training and education in the ministry, and whether the employee's job duties reflected a role in conveying the religious institution's message and carrying out its mission.\" (<em>Id.</em> at 9.) <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> certainly considered these circumstances, however, it places them within an explicit framework consisting of (1) an employee's formal title given to him or her by a religious institution; (2) the substance reflected in the title; (3) an employee's use of the title; and (4) the functions performed by the employee for the religious institution. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">565 U.S. at 192</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">132 S.Ct. 694</extracted-citation>. Even though the Report arrives at the correct conclusion, it attempts to expand the scope of the <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> factors. (<em>See</em> ECF No. 197 at 15.) Staying true to <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> , this case is much closer than the Report seems to suggest.</p><p id=\"p-68\">The Fourth Circuit has yet to address whether its primary duties test under <em>Roman Catholic Diocese</em> has survived <em>Hosanna-Tabor</em> . In <em>Roman Catholic Diocese</em> , the Fourth Circuit reiterated that the \"[t]he general rule is that 'if the employee's primary duties consist of teaching, spreading the faith, church governance, supervision of a religious order, or supervision or participation in religious ritual and worship, he or she should be considered clergy.' \" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11513754\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/213/795/\">213 F.3d at 801</extracted-citation> (quoting <em>Rayburn</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306810\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/772/1164/\">772 F.2d at </extracted-citation>1169 ).
