A statute which authorizes township officers to issue bonds only when an election \u201c may have already been held, and a <em>majority of the legal voters of the township </em>were in favor\u201d thereof, does not authorize the issue of bonds when <em>less </em>than a \u201c majority'of the legal voters\u201d were in favor thereof, although there were \u201ca majority of all the legal voters <em>voting at such </em>election.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-6\">If bonds are issuec\". in such case they are issued without authority of law, and are void even in the hands of a <em>bond fide </em>holder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-7\">The act of February 28th, 1867, confers power on incorporated townships in two classes of cases. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-8\">In one, the power is given to be exercised <em>after </em>the question \u201c has been submitted to the legal voters of the township,\u201d ahd when \u201cit shall appear that a majority of all the legal voters of such township, <em>voting at such </em>election,\u201d have voted therefor, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-9\">In the other class \u2014 the class provided for by the proviso\u2014 no future vote is to be had, but townships are authorized to issue bonds only in cases \u201cwhere elections.may <em>have already been held </em>(without authority of law before the statute was passed), and (only in those cases when) <em>a majority of the legal voters of any township were in favor of </em>a subscription.\u201d This class is <em>sui generis.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-10\">The bonds now in controversy recite that they were issued under this statute, \u201c and in accordance with the vote of the electors of said township, at the special election, held August 14th, 1866, in accordance with said act.\u201d This, of course,.was <em>prior to the date of the act, </em>and the bonds now in controversy belong to the second class.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-11\">The charge held that a <em>majority of those voting, </em>though those voting were a minority of the legal voters of the township, was sufficient if <em>they </em>voted in favor of bonds to authorize their issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>This <em>we </em>deny, and insist that <em>a majority of all the legal voters of the township </em>was requisite, because:</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-5\">1. The <em>language </em>of the <em>proviso </em>to section fourteen, of the act of February 28th, 1867, upon every principle of interpretation clearly so requires. There is no room, therefore, for .constru etion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-6\">2. There is a <em>manifest, reason </em>why the legislature would, in this class of cases, require a majority of all the voters, since the vote, when had, was unauthorized, and voters had no motive to attend and indicate their wishes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-7\">3. The language employed as to elections <em>to be held </em>after the statute was passed, when contrasted w.ith that as to <em>past elections, </em>clearly indicates that the legislature intended in one class,,as the- statute says', to require only \u201ca majority of all the legal voters voting <em>q,t </em>such election,\u201d while in the other, as the statute declares, <em>f\u2018 </em>a majority of (all) the legal voters of the township\u201d is requisites</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-8\">Notf can the opening language of the fourteenth section apply to the cas\u00e9 provided for by the proviso to the thirteenth, and cure an omission to comply with <em>its </em>directions in the case fpr which <em>it </em>provides. It refers, of course, to that part of the section prior to the proviso. Otherwise we have two contradictory enactments for the same ease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-9\">4. Where a legislative act confers authority on a municipal corporation-to issue negotiable bonds\u2019only ifl cases where a <em>past fact exists, </em>a false recital of the existence of such fact in bonds issued neither estops the corporation-from denying it, nor raises a presumption of its existence, even in favor of an innocent holder of such bonds, nor excuses him from the duty of ascertaining if such fact exists.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-10\">The false recital of <em>such </em>fact cannot make applicable and operative a legislative act otherwise inapplicable and inope? rative. The charge to th\u00e9 jury as mad\u00e9 in the court below goes much further than to assume that if a majority of those voting at an election voted in favor of bonds, then bonds issued would be valid in the hands of an innocent holder. The charge was given on evidence tending to show that no vote was taken on the question of issuing the bonds now in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>controversy, and certainly none on the 14th of August, 1866, the date recited in the bonds. Yet the charge was that \u201c The recitals in the bonds estop the defendant from denying the fact of a valid \u00e9leetion as against a <em>bond fide </em>holder of the' bonds or coupons attached thereto.\u201d The effect of this is that if a <em>minority </em>vote of all the electors of the township, or if <em>no vote at all </em>-was had, bonds issued reciting a vote are valid in the hands of a <em>bond fide </em>holder. But this, as has been shown, cannot be so, if the want o'f a vote, or the want of the requisite majority vote, goes to the .question of power to issue the bonds, as it does in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-5\">There is not much difficulty in distinguishing between negotiable securities executed <em>ultra vires, </em>aiid those issued within the power of municipal corporations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-6\">The cases on this subject fall within two classes:</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-7\">One class is where a power is given to a corporation <em>in prcesenti, </em>but the power is to be exercised \u201c on certain con\u2022ditions,\u201d as .it is said in <em>Knox County </em>v. <em>Aspinwall;</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or as it is elsewhere expressed,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> where there are \u201c qualifications coupled with the grant of power.\u201d THere is a large class of such cases,' but they relate to the question of the <em>regularity of </em>the exercise of power, and of votes taken, &amp;c. Here it has been held by some courts, and denied by others, that when bonds are issued reciting the pi\u2019oper vote, or even without the recital, but when a vote has in fact been had, that <em>bond fide </em>purchasers of bonds have- a right to presume that the corporation has <em>regularly </em>complied with- \u201c the conditions,\u201d because this is a fact within their peculiar knowledge, and on grounds of justice the corporation is estopped from denying it, and upon the principle that they may not take advantage of their own wrong. But in this class \u201cthe conditions\u201d to be performed are all <em>subsequent </em>to the grant of power, mere qualifications coupled with the grant, and none of them hold that where the power is by law made dependent on a vote of electors, and no vote, or only a minority vote, is had, that a recital in the bonds can supply the want of power to issue them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>But' there is another class of cases where there is a total absence of any power to issue bonds by a municipal corporation. One of these is where a power is given only <em>when a past fact happens to exist, </em>as the foundation of the power. If there be no foundation on which the power can rest, it cannot exist. Here there are no-\u201c certain conditions\u201d which accompany the power to be performed. Here there are no \u201c qualifications coupled <em>v\u00f1th </em>the grant of power,\u201d for no power has ever been granted, and none ever existed under. \u201c any circumstances,\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> because as the power is only to be given in case a certain past fact exist, the non-existence of the fact carries with it the non-existence of the power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-5\">Now, in this class of cases, the fact on which the power depends is not \u201c peculiarly within the knowledge of the corporation,\u201d and there can be no <em>estoppel, </em>and in such case there is no presumption that officers have <em>regularly </em>performed any duty, because it is not a question of official duty <em>to be performed, </em>but a question of the existence of a past fact, which, in the case now under consideration, was a voluntary, unofficial, unauthorized act. Such facts can be as readily ascertained by bondholders as by corporate authorities. There is no question in such case either as to the directory character of the provisions of the statut\u00e9, for the essential fact on which the power depends for its existence is past, not <em>in </em>futuro, and is vital to the power itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-6\">The case now under consideration falls within this class.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-7\">In <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Town of </em>Sterling,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> it was held that where a town had issued negotiable bonds, which could only be issued when the written assent of two-thirds of the resident persons taxed in: the town had been obtained and filed in'the county clerk\u2019s- office, the bonds issued without such assent were invalid; and that the purchaser of them could not rely upon the recital in the bonds that such assent had been obtained : and Cooley in his Constitutional Limitations, in commenting On this and other, cases, says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-8\">\u201c The doctrine in the case of <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Town of Sterling </em>appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>to us to be sound, and that wherever a want of power exists a purchaser of the securities is chargeable with notice of it, <em>if the defect is disclosed by the corporate </em>records, or as in that case by other records where the power is required to be shown.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-5\">5. A statute which attempts to create a municipal debt where none existed before, as by attempting to validate void bonds, is unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-6\">This principle, and the application of it to this case, are perhaps sufficiently shown in what has already been said.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-7\">The cur\u00e1tive act of February 25th, 1869, in fact cannot be construed as applicable\u2019 to the bonds now in controversy. Its preamble relates more especially to the omission to \u201c keep a full and perfect record of electors,\u201d and \u201c to file with the county clerk 'certificates as required by section1 fifteen of\u201d the act of-February 28th, 1867. It enacts that if <em>such </em>informality and neglect may have occurred they shall not invalidate bonds. But if it can apply to the <em>proviso </em>of section fifteen of the act of 1867, aud the duty of town clerks to file certificates of votes had prior to the act, so far as it attempts to give validity to what was invalid before, it is an attempt by legislative act to create a debt.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-8\">6. Bonds issued by municipal authorities-reciting a vote on the 14th of August, cannot be sustained on a vote taken on the 4th of August, when the law under which they are issued requires a vote of electors to authorize their issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-9\">There is evidence tending ,to show that a vote was had August 4th, but no\u2019 evidence tending to show\u2019 there was auy vote August 14th. There was no vote August 14th. Now if the vote taken August 4th authorized any bonds to be issued, it is fair to presume they were issued. On that hypothesis the power existed, and could be used to issue bonds reciting a vote of that .date. Nothing in the record shows bonds were not so issued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-10\">7.

It is error for the judge in charging a jury in the trial of an issue of fact, to assume the existence of a disputed material fact in issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-10\">The record shows that one of the disputed questions of fact on the trial iu the Circuit Court was whether an election was held- in August, 1866, yet the judge charged the jury that \u201c the election held in August, 1866, as detailed in the evidence, was validated by the act of February 28th, 1867,\u201d &amp;c. This charge <em>assumes </em>a controverted fact, and instructs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>the jury accordingly.

But independently of the impossibility of the supervisors knowing otherwise than by the election who all the legal voters were, it is to be observed,.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-7\">I. That the counsel, in point of fact, would completely change the order of the provision as found in the act. They transfer the proviso of the thirteenth section from that section where it occurs, and apply it .to the fourteenth section following, as though it read, -</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-8\">\u201cThe supervisor shall subscribe if it shall appear that a ma:: jority of the legal voters voting at such election have voted for subscription, <em>provided </em>that where elections may. have already been held and a majority of the legal voters of any township were in favor of a subscription to said railroad, then and in that ease no other election need be had.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-9\">By what authority ,do counsel thus treat an act of the legislature ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-10\">JI. That the phrase \u201c a majority of the legal voters of any township,\u201d as used in the thirteenth section, is no broader than the- phrase \u201c a majority of all the legal voters of such townships voting at such election,\u201d used infection fourteen, but\u2019the latter expression only states more fully what the former, implies. This appears in various -ways.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-11\">1st. It is apparent from the provisions of section- fifteen of the act which required the' town clerks to file with the county clerks \u201c certificates of the votes of their towns.\u201d If a majority of all the voters residing iu the townships were necessary, whether voting or not, the certificate of votes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>cast at the election would be valueless without some provision for ascertaining the number of actual legal voters in the township.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-5\">2d. Phraseology, almost identical with that of this statute, occurs in section five, article seven, of the constitution of the State of Illinois, which forbids the removal of a county seat \u201c until the point to which it is proposed to be removed shall be fixed by law, and a <em>majority of the voters of the county </em>shall have voted in favor of its removal to such point;\u201d,yet the Supreme Court of Illinois, in construing this section tind\" the phrase \u201cvoters of the county,\u201d held</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-6\">\u201c That the voters of the county referred to were <em>the voters who should vote at the election authorized by it. </em>\"We hold, therefore, that a majority of the'legal votes cast at this election is sufficient to determine the question of a relocation of the county seat.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-7\">Similar language is used in section six of the same article of the constitution of the State of Illinois, which, in <em>People </em>v. Garner,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> received a similar construction from the Supreme Court of the State. The same construction has been given by the Supreme Court of Tennessee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-8\">\u201c A majority of the voters of the county,\u201d says the court in <em>Louisville and Nashville Railroad </em>v. <em>County Court of Davidson County,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c means a majority of those who actually vote.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-9\">It equally prevails in Missouri. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayor of St. Joseph,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an act of the legislature required a proposition to create a city debt to be submitted \u201c to a vote of the qualified voters of said city,\u201d and two-thirds of such qualified voters to sanction the same, and an election had been held at which three hundred and thirty-six votes were for and fifty-eight against the-proposition; but the mayor declined to sign the bond, because he was in doubt whether the matter was to be determined by two-thirds of all the votes polled at the special election called to vote on the question, or by two-thirds of all the voters resident in the city absolutely, whether vo^og <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>or not. ' The court ordered a peremptory mandamus, and in the opinion said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b665-5\">\u201cWe think it was sufficient that two-thirds of all the qualified voters who' voted at the special election authorized for the express purpose of determining that question on public notice duly given, voted in favor of the proposition. This was the mode provided by law for ascertaining the sense of the qualified voters of the city upon that question. There would appear to be no other- practicable way in which the matter could be determined.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b665-6\">These decisions, and none contrary can be found, overthrow the main defence interposed to the collection of the bonds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b665-7\">III. The fact as to whether an election had been held, and a majority of the voters were in'favor of subscription, wms by the fourteenth section to be passed upon and decided by the supervisor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b665-8\">\u201cIf it shall appear,\u201d says that section. Appear to whom? Evidently to the officer or officers upon whom the statute imposed the duty of subscribing for the stock and executing the bonds. If it appeared to the supervisor of the township that an election had been held, and a majority of the legal votei-3 were in favor of subscription to the railroad, then he had to act on behalf of the town. Some one had to decide when it had become his duty, and no one else \u2014 no other officer \u2014 was authorized to determine this for him. The supervisor not being authorized or required to execute -the bonds until it should \u201cappear\u201d-that a majority had voted for subscription, it was proper that he should find and recite in the bond the fact that must appear to him before he could legally act. Such finding and recital on the bond of his conclusion would conclude the township for which he was authorized to act, as well as himself, as to whether the required majoi-ity had voted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b665-9\">In <em>Commissioners </em>v.

The instruction presents the proposition that the recitals in the bond protect the <em>bond fide </em>holder for value, against irregularities or erroneous conclusions of the officers in regard to the election held, which might impeach the bonds in the hands of parties, with \u2022notice. Whether the word \u201cvalid\u201d intends this qualification or not, the authorities fully sustain the instruction.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>VII. The objection that the election was held on the 4th, instead of the 14th, as recited in the bond, seems sufficiently answered by referring to the law. It was immaterial on what day the election was held, and it was not necessary to state it in the bond.

Regulations are also enacted for taking the sense of the legal voters upon such a proposition, which provide that the clerk of the town or township, upon the presentation to him of a petition stating the amount proposed to be subscribed, signed by at least ten citizens who are legal voters and taxpayers therein, \u25a0shall post up notices in at least three public places in the municipality, not less than thirty days before the day of holding such election, notifying the legal voters thereof to meet at the usual place of holding elections, or some other convenient place named in the notice, for the purpose of voting for or agaiust such subscription. Prior to the passage of that act, however, an election was .held in that.township to determine whether the municipality would subscribe $25,000 to the capital stock of that railroad company, and the proofs show that a majority of all the legal voters of the township voting at the election voted for the subscription\u2014 sixty-two votes being cast in favor of the subscription and seventeen against the proposition. Pursuant to the vote at that election the supervisor of the township subscribed, in the name of the municipality, $25,000 to the capital stock of that railroad company, and executed, in the name of the township, the bonds held by the plaintiff, bearing interest at ten per cent, per annum, payable in ten years from date, which bonds were signed by the party issuing the same as such supervisor, and were attested by the clerk of the township</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Objection is made to the preliminary proceedings because the election approving the subscription was held before the act was passed giving such authority to such municipalities, but two answers are made to that objection, either of which is decisive:</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">1. By the act conferring that authority it. is provided that where elections may have already been held, and a majority of the legal voters of the township were in favor of a subscription to said railroad, then and in that case no other flection need be had, and the amount so voted for shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>subscribed as in the act is provided; and the provision is that such elections are legal and valid as if the acj; had been in force at the time thereof, and that all the provisions had been fulfilled.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">2. Because the legislature passed a subsequent act declaring such subscriptions legal and obligatory. Some of the township officers, it seems, failed to keep a full and perfect-record of elections called and held to authorize such subT scriptions, and that the clerks of the townships failed in some instances to file the necessary certificate with the county clerk, as required by the fifteenth section of the prior act. Omissions and defects of the kind becoming known, the legislature, on the 25th of February, 1869, enacted that where such informalities and neglect may have occurred and bonds have been issued, or may hereafter be issued, to aid in the construction of said railroad, that no such neglect or omission shall in any way invalidate or impair the collection of said bonds, principal- or interest, as they may respectively fall due, and that all assessments that are now made for the paymeut of the principal or interest are hereby legalized, and the township collectors and county treasurers are hereby authorized and empowered to enforce the collection and payment of said tax as is now provided by law for the collection of all other taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Bonds to the amount of the subscription were accordingly issued, bearing dale October 1st, 1867, signed by the supervisor and countersigned by the clerk, and each bond contains the recital that it is issued under and by virtue of the aforesaid law of the State, entitled an act to amend the articles of association of the said railroad company, and to extend the powers of and confer a charter upon the same, and in accordance with the vote of the electors of said township at the special election held August 14th, 1866, pursuant to said act, and pledges the faith of the township for the payment of the said principal sum and interest as stipulated in the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Evidence was introduced by the defendants showing that there is no record of the supposed election, when it is alleged that the question of the proposed subscription was submitted to the legal voters of the township, and that no such certificate as that required by the act conferring the authority to subscribe for the stock of the said company is on file in the office of the count/ clerk, but the plaintiff proved that the alleged meeting was notified,, called, and held, and that sixty-two .votes were given in favor of the subscription and seventeen against it, as announced at the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Two instructions were given by the court to the jury, to which the defendants excepted: (1.) That the' election held as described in the evidence was validated by the act of the 28th of February, 1867, so as to authorize the defendants to subscribe for the stock of the railroad company and to issue the bonds in question, and that the bonds having been issued for the stock subscribed, are binding on the defendants in the hands of a <em>bond fide </em>holder. (2.) That the recitals in the bonds estop the defendants from denying the fact of a valid election as against a <em>bond fide </em>holder of the bonds or coupons thereto annexed.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Under the instructions of the court the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff\u2019, and the court rendered judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Repeated decisions of the State courts have' established the rule that the legislature has the constitutional right to authorize municipal corporations to subscribe for the stock of a railroad company, and to issue their bonds to aid in the construction of .such an intended improvement; that the supervisors of the municipality have the power, in case such a subscription is authorized, to Subscribe for the stock of the railroad company, and to call an election to ascertain the will of the legal voters in that behalf.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2022 Such corporations are created by the legislature aud they derive all their powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>from the source of their creation, and those powers are. at all times subject to the control of the legislature. Every where the construction and repair of highways within theii limits are regarded as among the usual purposes of their creation, and the expenses of accomplishing those objects are among their usual and ordinary burdens. Railways also, as matter of usage founded on experience, are so far considered by the courts as in the nature of improved highways and as indispensable to the public intertest and the successful pursuit, even of local business, that the legislature may authorize the towns and counties of a State through which the railway passes, to borrow money, issue their bonds, subscribe for the stock of the company, or purchase the same to aid the railway company in constructing or completing such a public improvement. Legislation of the kind may be prohibited by a State constitution, but it is settled everywhere that such an act is not in contravention of any implied limitation of the power of a State-to pass laws to promote the usual purposes of municipal corporations.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Argument to show that defective subscriptions of the kind may in all cases be ratified where the legislature could have originally conferred the power is certainly unnecessary, as the question is authoritatively settled by the decisions of the Supreme Court of the State, and of this court, in repeated instances.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AO10\">Suppose that is so, still it is insisted by the defendants that the election held to ascertain whether' the legal voters of the township would authorize the subscription, was irregular and a nullity: (1.) Because a majority of the legal voters of the township did not vote at the meeting notified and held for that purpose. (2.) Because the meeting was notified and held before the act was passed providing for such an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Responsive to the first objection, it is insisted by theqfiaintiff that the legislature in adoptiug the phrase \u201c a majority of the legal voters .of the township,\u201d intended to require only a majority of the legal voters of the township voting at the election notified and held to ascertain whether the 'proposition to subscribe for the stock-of the company should be adopted or rejected, and the court is of the opinion that such is the true meaning of the enactment, as the question would necessarily be determined by a count of ballots.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Tested by these considerations, it is clear that an election was held within the meaning of the act of the legislature, and that a majority of the legal voters of the township did vote in favor of the subscription, as the proofs show that a meeting was called and held, and that the majority of the legal voters voting at the meeting, voted in favor of the proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Sufficient has already been remarked to show that the second objection cannot avail the defendants, as the same act provided to the effect that if the election had already been held and a majority of the legal voters had voted in favor of the subscription, no other election need be held, and that the amount so voted shall be subscribed, as provided in the same act. Mistakes and irregularities are of frequent occurrence in municipal elections, and the State legislatures have often had occasion to pass laws to obviate such difficulties. Such laws, when they do not impair any contract or injuriously affect the rights of third persons, are never regarded as objectionable, and certainly are within the competency of the legislative authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Even if the legislature may by a subsequent ac.t validate -and confirm previous acts of a municipal corporation otherwise invalid, still the defendants insist that a prior legislative act will not have any such effect, which cannot be admitted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>as it woul.d be competent for tbe legislature to authorize a municipal corporation to make such a subscription without requiring any such preliminary election.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Concede, however, that a prior act is insufficient to' dispense with the preliminary election, still the concession cannot benefit the defendants, as it is clear that the subsequent act entirely obviates all the mistakes and irregularities iu the prior proceedings, as it provides that where such in-formalities and neglect may have occurred, and bonds have been issued, or may hereafter be issued, to aid in the construction o\u00a3 said railroad, no such neglect or omission on the part of township officers shall in any way invalidate or impair the collection of said bonds, principal or interest, as they may respectively fall due.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2020Authorities to support that proposition are hardly necessary, but another answer may be given to the objection quite as satisfactory as either of the others, which is that the fourteenth section of the act makes it th\u00e9 duty of the supervisor who executed the bonds .to determine the question whether an election was held, and whether a majority of the. votes cast were in favor of the subscription, and inasmuch as he passed upon that question and subscribed for the stock and subsequently executed and delivered th\u00e9 bonds, it is clearly too late to question their validity where it appears, as iu this case, that they are in the hands of an innocent holder.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\"><em>Knox County </em>v. <em>Aspinwall.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Non compliance with one of the conditions was clearly shown in that case, as the notices of the election as required by law had not been given in any form, but the decision was that the question, as to the sufficiency of the notice and the ascertainment of the fact whether the majority of the votes had been cast-in favor of the subscription was necessarily left to the inquiry and judgment of the county board, as no other tribunal was provided for the purpose, and the court held that after the authority-had been executed, the bonds issued, and they had passed into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the hands of innocent holder\u00e1, it was too late, even in a direct proceeding, to call the power in question, and that it was beyond all d\u00f3ubt too late to call the power .in question to the prejudice of a <em>bond fide </em>bolder of the bonds in a collateral way, which is attempted to be done in the .case before the court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Exactly the same principles were applied in the' case of <em>Royal British Bank </em>v. <em>Turquand.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em>i </em>in which the opinion was given by the chief justice. He said the bond sued upon in the ease is allowed to be under the seal of the company and to be their deed, consequently a <em>primd facie </em>case is made for the plaintiff, as the defendants having executed the bond have no defence under the plea of <em>non \u00e9st factum, </em>and consequently the onus is cast upon them of showing that the bond is unlawful and void. No illegality appears on the face of the bond or condition, which shows that the-plea, in order that it may be supported, must allege facts to establish illegality, but the plea makes no charge of fraud against the plajntiff and states no facts from which fraud may be inferred. Want of authority to execute the bond, it was conceded, would be'an answer to the action, but it was denied that a mere excess of authority by the directors would have that effect, unless it appeared that the plaintiff\" had knowledge of that fact, as the presumption would be, from what appeared on the face of the bond, that\u2019it was issued by lawful authority, and the court held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, as he had advanced his money in good faith for the use of the company, giving credit to the representations of the directors that they had authority to execute the instrument; Dissatisfied with the judgment the defendant brought \u00e1 writ of error in the Exchequer Chamber, where the case was reargued, but the Court of Errors unanimously affirmed the judgment.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Viewed in any reasonable light the court is of the opinion that the plaintiff\" is an innocent holder for value, and that the loss, even if the supervisor failed in his duty to his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>stituents, cannot be cast upon the <em>bond fide </em>creditors of the township.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Judgment appirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b675-5\">Mr. Justice MILLER and Mr. Justice FIELD did not sit\u2019 in this case. \u2022</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\"> 2 Private Laws (1867), 761.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\"> 2 Private Laws (1867), 762.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\"> Prettyman <em>v. </em>Supervisors, 19 Illinois, 406; Robertson <em>v. </em>Rockford, 21 Id. 451; Perkins <em>v. </em>Lewis, 24 Id. 208; Johnson <em>v. </em>Stark, Ib. 85; Keithsburg <em>v. </em>Frick, 34 Id. 405; Commissioners <em>v. </em>Nichols, 14 Ohio State, 260.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b671-7\"> Rogers v.
