By direction of Dickinson, this agent took the proceeds, and with them bought a draft of the Planters\u2019 Bank of Tennessee, at Nashville, on the Bank of Virginia, at Richmond; the former bank crediting the latter with the amount. The draft was in this form :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-11\">$5224.25.

Accordingly, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>arriving, December 6th, 'at Kanawha, he handed the draft and other papers connected with his agency to Dickinson\u2019s son, also named William Dickinson, who, by a will that the father-had left in a bank, at Lynchburg, Virginia, was appointed executor of the father\u2019s estate. .These were times of the rebellion, and Lynchburg, Nashville, and Richmond were all within the Confederate- lines, having at tire time and' for some time afterwards communication with\u2019 each other, while Kanawha, being in.West Virginia, was within the lines of the Federal government, and had no intercourse, with any of them. Dickinson, the son and executor,-was quite desirous to get the money on his draft, but being reputed to be a \u201c Union man,\u201d could not with safety go to Lynchb.urg, to get his father\u2019s will, or to Richmond, between which and Kanawha, from 1862 till' the surrender of the rebel army in 1865, there was no lawful intercourse. He, however, indorsed the check with his own name, identical with that of his father, and by that means sought to negotiate it through a Virginia bank. It being lpio'wn, however, at the bank to which he applied, that the \u201cWilliam Dickinson\u201d named as payee,'was the father and. not the son, and the will not having been yet proved, no negotiation of the draft could be made. Dickinson, the son, then, March, 1864, applied to the Federal headquarters for a pass to get th rough the Union hues, but was refused.; nor could-be get any pass till February, ,1865, when getting papers.from the headquarters of both armies, and having got the\" will and had it proved, he'went to Richmdrid.in the latter part of May, 1865, which the evidence went to show was as soon as he could get there, and indorsing his draft properly, presented it for payment. Payment was refused, the bank having recently become insolvent. He then had the draft protested by a notary, and directed the notary to give notice of the dishonor to the Planters\u2019 Bank of Tennessee at Nashville, and that the holder would look to that bank for payment. A notice to the Planters\u2019 Bank of Tennessee was accordingly deposited by the notary in the post-office; but that it was directed to the Planters\u2019 Bank of Tennessee at <em>Nashville, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Tennessee, was not so clearly shown. The cashier of that bank testified that he received no notice. It was not denied that the Bank of Virginia, at Richmond, had funds during all this time of the Planters\u2019 Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-5\">Dickinson, as executor of his father\u2019s estate, now brought <em>assumpsit </em>in the court below, against the Planters\u2019 Bank of Tennessee. The <em>narr </em>contained two\u2019 counts; the first special on the draft; and the second for money had and received. The bank pleaded the general issue, and on the trial relied apparently in part on the non-intercourse act of July 18th, 1861 (chapter 8), and the President\u2019s proclamation of August 16th of the same year. The parties having taken depositions on both sides, \u201cfiled,\u201d as appeared by a recital in the judgment in the case, \u201c a stipulation in writing with the clerk of that court, waiving a jury, and the cause came on to be tried and determined by the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">An act of March 3d, 1865, thus enacts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-7\">\u201cSection 4.

They were in these words.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-9\">OPINION.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-10\">The court, after hearing the testimony and argument of counsel on\u2019both sides, is of opinion, and doth declare that the bank check drawn by the Planters\u2019 Bank of Tennessee on the Bank of Virginia, at Richmond on the 14th of November,-1861, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>so drawn by the request' of -the agent of William Dickinson, the plaintiff\u2019s testator, and in pursuance of the instructions of said William in his lifetime; that the said contract was not an illegal transaction according to the provisions of the non-intercourse act of July 13th, 1861 (chapter 3)', and the proclamation of the President of the 16th of August, 1861, as it was drawn at Nashville on Richmond; both of which were'in the lines of tbe Confederate or rebel government, and no agreement existing that it was to ,b\u00a9 sent beyond those lines, where intercourse was prohibited; that at the time when said check was drawn, and for several weeks afterwards, there was regular communication by mail and railroad between Richmond and Nashville, and the Planters\u2019Bank drew checks from time to time, until the latter part of February, 1862, for considerable sums of money, which were paid by said bank at Richmond, and .that at the time of drawing the check of the 14th November, 1861, and during the ryhole period of the civil war, and afterwards, the Planters\u2019 Bank had funds in the said Bank of Virginia, at Richmond, and that said bank is now indebted to the Planters\u2019 Bank of Tennessee in \u00e1 large sum of money, and that said Bank of Virginia is insolvent. It further appeared to the court that, on the day of the drawing of the cheek by the Planters\u2019 Bank specified in the declaration, a credit was given on their books to the said 'Bank of Virginia, for the amount of said check-so drawn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\">This court, is of opinion, and doth declare that this check, when executed and delivered to the agent of William Dickinson, was an absolute appropriation of so much money in the Bank of Virginia to the holder of the check, to remain there until called for, and could not, therefore, be afterwards withdrawn by the drawers. If the holder of the check chose to transmit the same to the country with which intercourse was prohibited, and by the casualties of war or other accidents, it was rendered difficult or impossible to present the check for payment, and the bank on which it was drawn became insolvent, the drawer of. the check having the funds in the Virginia bank would not be responsible for the loss by such insolvency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">This court is also of opinion that there is not sufficient evidence of a notice to the defendant of the demand and protest of the cheek, which protest was made on the 30th of May, 1865. The cashier of tbe bank received no notice, as he states in his testimony, and it is not proved that the notice was directed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Nashville, the place of business of the defendant, but only to the Planters\u2019 Bank of Tennessee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel' excepted to'the opinion and rulings of the court, discharging the defendant from responsibility upon the draft sued on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">The plaintiff further requested the court to find and so decide, that William Dickinson, the owner of this draft, having died in Virginia, on the 15th day o.f November, 1861, the day after the draft was made and delivered to his agent Cre\u00e1sey, that it made no difference and could not change the responsibility of the party by its being on the 6th of.December, afterwards carried to Kanawha, the late residence of William Dickinson. Because if it had been retained in Tennessee and sent directly to Richmond, it could not have been presented and paid only to the legal representative of William Dickinson, deceased.

Because, under the circumstances-, appearing in the record, in the depositions of the witnesses, if the <em>jury </em>be-' lieved the evidence \u2014 and it was for them to pass upon it\u2014 it was impossible for the plaintiff to have' presented the check for payment sooner than he did. \u2018 Now the rule of. law-in such cases is, that demand is ,to be made within a reasonable time, and that what is a reasonable time is for the jury, to be decided upon a consideration of all the circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-9\">II. That the judge erred in deciding that if the demand was in tim\u00e9, notice of- non-payment was not properly given to the defendant, because the notary\u2019s letter containing the protest, was not directed to. Nashville, but only to the Planters\u2019 Bank of Tennessee. Because\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-10\">1st. If the evidence proved only that the notary\u2019s letter was directed to the bank generally, and not to Nashville, under the circumstances the jury might have inferred that it reached Nashville in due course.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-11\">s2d. Because in fact there was evidence in the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>of tb,e plaintiff and of Johnson, \u00bfhat the notary\u2019s-letter was directed to the defendant at Nashville.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-5\"><em>Mr. Conway </em>Robinson, <em>contra:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-6\">The trial must be taken to have been under the-act of the 3d of March, 1865, and- the finding of the court upon the facts being general, its finding has the same effect as the verdict of. a jury. When there are no rulings <em>in the progress of the trial, </em>which can be reviewed, the finding of the court stands like a verdict; and the judgment on the finding stands like the judgment on a verdict. There being <em>\u201c in the progress of the trial,\u201d </em>no rulings of the court \u2014 none \u201c <em>excepted to at1 the time,\u201d </em>\u2014 none shown to be erroneous, the judgment on a general finding, like the judgment on a general verdict, must be affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2020Such is the case here.

The suit was an action to recover the amount of a check dated November 14th, 1861,'drawn by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>the defandants in error upon the Bank of Virginia, at Richmond, and payable to the order of the plaintiff\u2019s testator. To the declaration the defendants pleaded the general issue, and the parties, by written stipulation filed with the clerk of the court, waived a jury. It is true that no such stipulation has been sent up with the record, but in the judgment it is recited that such .a one was made and filed. We must, thei\u2019efore, hold that the issue was tried by the court under the act of March 3d, 1865, ivhieh gives to the finding of the court upon the facts (which finding may be either general or special), the same effect as the verdict of a-jury. It is, however, only when the finding is special, that the^review of this court cau extend -to- the determination of the sufficiency of the facts found to support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Here the record as returned contains what is stated to have been all the evidence in the cause, but the court has not found what the evidence proves, nor any ultimate facts except that stated\u2019in the judgment,' \u201c that the defendant did not assume and promise as the plaintiff in declaring has alleged.\u201d Some facts indeed are stated in the opinion of the court, that seem to have accompanied tile judgment, tat they are not stated as a special finding. They are rather advanced as reasons why the judge came to the conclusion that the alleged promise of the defendants had not'been proved. It is impossible to regard anything that appears in this case as equivalent to a special verdict. Plainly to a recovery by the plaintiff it was indispensable that the check drawn iu favor of his testator had been presented for payment iu a reasonable time, or that there had been a sufficient excuse for non-presentation, and that notice of its dishonor had been given duly to the drawers. These were questions of fact submitted for determination to the court. But' it nowhere appears in the finding, when, if ever, the check was presented, or if presentation was delayed what circumstances caused the delay, or whether the delay was reasonable or unreasonable. Nor is it found what notice, if any, was given to the defendants of the dishonor of the check. So far as anything appears, it is in the opinion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the court, which was that \u201c there was no sufficient notice of the demand and protest of the check, which protest was made on the 30th of May, 1865.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We cannot, therefore, inquire whether the evidence as detailed by the witnesses was sufficient, under the circumstances, to justify a finding that the presentation and demand were made in a reasonable time, ar whether it might have been inferred that-notice of non-payment was duly given. But though the finding was general, any rulings of the court in the progress of the trial, if excepted to at the time and duly presented by bills of exceptions, may be reviewed by us. This is provided by the act of 1865. Manifestly, however, the rulings thus subject to review are decisions of law,, not findings of fact. Some requests appear to have been submitted to the court to find certain facts, which were refused. They are no more the subject of exception and review than would be a request to a jury to find in a particular manner, and a refusal\u2019 by the jury so to find. One request also was that the court should decide that the plaintiff* had a right to recover under the- second count of the declaration, for money had and received. This also was refused, and so far as we can see, very properly. The record presents nothing which would have justified such a decision. There is nothing else in the case that requires notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
