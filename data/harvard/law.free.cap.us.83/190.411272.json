If the claimant desires that the property should remain in the same possession as wh\u00e9n the levy was made, he may execute \u201c a forthcoming bond,\u201d and thereupon the property remains in such possession at the risk of'the claimant. This is the statute remedy to try in such case the right of property, and is termed <em>an inter-pleader.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\">This statute-being in force, the First National Bank at -Alexandria, Virginia, obtained a judgment iu the State Circuit. Court for'the county of Alexandria, against Abijah Thomas for $4700, with interest and costs. Upon this judgment an execution issued and was levied upon some cotton at Alexandria. Certain'persons,\"to wit, Alexander and John Turnbull, <em>citizens of the State of Maryland, </em>with' Alexander Beach, <em>a citizen of the Stat\u00e9 of New York, </em>trading together as Turnbull &amp; Co., asserted a claim as owners of the property thus levied on, ai'id, thereupon, the sheriff, before proceeding further under his levy, .demanded of the plaintiff in the execution an indemnifying bond, which demand was complied with. Turnbull &amp; Co., then caused to be executed both a suspending and forthcoming bond, thereby preventing a sale of the property levied on. Under authority of the-statute, the Circuit Court of Alexandria, in which the judgment was rendered, upon the petition of Turnbull &amp; Co., as claimants of the property, entered an order, directing an issue to be tried by a jury, to determine the right to the property thus levied on, and'in such order adjudged that Turnbull &amp; Co. should be plaintiffs on the trial of the issue.- Before any further action, however, was taken under this order, Turn-bull &amp; Co. filed a petition to. said court, praying for'a removal of the suit to the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Virginia. This petitiou was filed in virtue of the act of Congress of Mar\u00f3n 2d, 1867, which enacts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">\u201c That .where a <em>suit </em>is now pending or may hereafter be brought, in any State court in which there is a controversy between- a citizen of the State in which the' <em>suit </em>is brought and a citizen of another State, and the matter in dispute exceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>8500, exclusive of costs, such citizen of another State, whether \u25a0he be plaintiff or defendant, may [on compliance with certain conditions prescribed] file a-petition in such State court for the removal of the <em>suit </em>into the next Circuit Court of the United States, to be held in the district where the suit is pending,- and offer good and sufficient surety for his entering in such court on. the first day of its session copies of all process, pleadings; depositions, testimony, and other proceedings in said suit, . . . and it shall be,.thereupon, the duty of the State court to accept the. surety, and proceed no further in <em>the-suit. </em>And the said copies, being entered as4 aforegaid in such court of the United States, the <em>suit </em>shall the\u00f1-, proceed <em>in the same manner as if it had been brought thereby original process\u2019\u2019</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">The application to the State court was refused, and Turnr Dull &amp; .Co. thereupon petitioned the judge of the District Court at chambers for a mandamus to compel the removal. This being granted, the case was brought into the Circuit Court and there docketed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\">Upon the calling of the case there, a motion-was made by the counsel for the bank to dismiss the same for want of jurisdiction, which motion was overruled, and thereupon, a written stipulation was signed by the counsel of the respective parties providing that a jury should be waived, and the \u2022cause submitted to the decision and judgment of the court. Upon a full hearing of the ease under such submission, the court decided, that the property in controversy was not liable to the execution' of the bank, and gave judgment in favor of Turnbull &amp; Co., with costs. To that judgment a writ of error was sued out from this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-8\">The record did not show that any process .had been issued or declaration filed against,the bank; or that the bank had pleaded, demurred, or otherwise answered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-9\">On the calling of the case here, after the judges had looked at the record, the Chief Justice signified to the counsel that the court was not satisfied that the case had; been one for removal under the; act of March '2d, 1867, to the. Circuit Court, and directed them to speak to that point.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AmP\">\n<em>Mr. II. 0. Glaughton, for the plaintiff in error,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIq\">argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>this was so, and that the Circuit, Court below, ought not to have received it, but to have left it with the County Court of Alexandria. The statutes, he argued, authorized the transfer of nothing but \u201c a -suit;\u201d and in <em>West </em>v. <em>Aurora City,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this court, had decided that the only' sort of suit removable from a State court to the Federal court, was a suit regularly commenced by process served upon the defendant. - There was nothing of- that sort here. What was transferred was, in fact, not \u201ca suit,\u201d bufan -incident to a suit, a collateral question springing out of it. That a proceeding incidental to another suit is not a \u201csuit\u201d within the spirit of the act, was settled by this court in <em>Gwin </em>v. <em>Breedlove,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> Huff </em>v. <em>Hutchinson,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Howe.</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-5\">\n<em>Mr. F.

Marshall, C. J.-, in answer to this question, speaking for the court, says of the word <em>suit :</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-7\">\u201cThe term is certainly a very comprehensive one, and is understood to apply to any proceeding in a court of justice by which an individual pursues that remedy in a court of justice' whifch the law affords him. T-he modes of proceeding may be various, but if the right is litigated between parties in a court of justice, the proceeding by which the decision is sought, is a suit.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-8\">In <em>Holmes </em>v.

A-writ of fieri facias was issued to the .sheriff of that county,-and was levied upon certain personal property to satisfy the judgment.' Turnbull &amp; Co. claimed' the property as theirs. The plaintiff\u2019 gave'the sheriff an indemnifying bond aiid required him to sell. ' To prevent this Turnbull &amp; Co-, gave' him a suspending bond, and', in order to have the property retained in the possession of Thomas', also a forthcoming bond. Turnbull &amp; Co. thereupon applied to the Circuit Court of the county for leave to intervene in the original, suit, and to order an issue to try the right of property. The prayer'of the petition was granted, and an order Was made that a jury should be sworn to try the-issue whether the property levied upon belonged'to Turnbull &amp; Co., or to Thomas, and that Turnbujl &amp; Co. should be regarded as the plaintiffs in the proceeding. Without availing themselves of this order Turnbull &amp; Coi thereupon applied to fhe Circuit Court for the. county for.an order to remove the cause, under the act of Congress of 1867,..to- the Circuit Court of the United States for that district. This was .refused, and they thereupon petitioned the judge of the District Court of the United States, sitting at chambers, for a writ of mandamus directed to the Cir.cuit'Court for the county. The writ was allowed aud-issued, and the cause was removed according to the prayer of the petitioners. In the Circuit Court of the United States the bank moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. The motion was overruled. The parties thereupon '.waived- a jury and submitted the cause to the court. The court found, for Turnbull &amp; Co., and gave judgment in their favor. rlhe bank took a bill of exceptions, setting forth all the evidence, aud excepting to the judgment given.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Upon examining the record we find'there was no process issued against the bank, no declaration filed by Turnbull &amp;' Co., and no plea or other Written response by the bank. The record is a blank as to these things.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">It.may well be doubted whether so informal a proceeding as that presented by this record is a \u201c <em>suit \u201d </em>within the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ing of the act of Congress under which the right of removal was claimed and allowed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Bn.t, as we do not propose to \u2022place our judgment on that ground, it is not necessary to consider the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Conceding it to be a suit, and not essentially a motion, we thiuk it was merely auxiliary7 to the original action, a graft upon it, and not an independent and separate litigation. A judgment had been recovered in the original suit, final process was levied upon the property in question to satisfy it, the property was claimed by Turnbull &amp; Co., and this proceeding, authorized by the laws of Virginia, was, resorted to to settle the question whether the property ought to he so applied. The contest could not have arisen but for the judgment and execution, and the satisfaction of the former would at once have extinguished the controversy between the parties. The proceeding was necessarily instituted in the court where the judgment was rendered, and whence the execution issued. No other court, according to the statute, could have taken jurisdiction. It was provided to enable the court to determine whether its process had, as was claimed, been misapplied, and what right and justice required should be done touching the property in the hands of its'officer. It was intended to enable the court, the plaintiff in the original action, and the claimant, to reach the final and proper result by a process at once speedy, informal, and inexpensive. That it was only auxiliary and incidental to the original- suit is, we think, too clear to require discussion. Ve shall content ourselves with referring to some of the leading authorities which bear upon the subject.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The judgment of the.court below is reversed, and the cause will be remanded to that court with directions to enter a judgment of reversal, and then to remit the case to the Circuit Court for the county of Alexandria, whence it came.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\"> West v.
