The coupons as they came due were detached from their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>respective bonds, but not being paid, that company sued the county of Otoe in the court below.

B. Scofield, for the county:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b679-7\">1. By the constitution of Nebraska all power not delegated to the legislature remains with the. people. For defraying <em>extraordinary </em>expenses, the State-may contract a debt not exceeding $50,000. Building a railroad is not an extraordinary occasion; nor was the limit here observed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b679-8\">'2. The constitution of Nebraska ordains that \u201cthe property of no person shall be taken-for public use without just compensation.\u201d Now' persons may be properly taxed for the public benefit; that is to say,.for the benefit of all. Private property, indeed, is then taken, but a compensation is received. When, however, their property is taken for the benefit of a <em>private corporation, </em>as in this case, it is taken without compensation. Certainly the property taken here by tax is, in view of the purpose to which it is' applied, taken without any due process of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b679-9\">3. But if the preceding propositions were questionable, it seems unquestionable that no legislature can take one man\u2019s property to-make a-present of it \u2014 to give it by way of donation \u2014 to another man, or to a private corporation, which is but an aggregation of men. This has been judicially de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>cided by respectable courts,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Still less, if possible, can the legislature delegate to the small political divisions which exist under the names 'of counties, townships, cities, boroughs, &amp;c., a power of this dangerous kind. The objects for which-these small political divisions are brought into existence are quite different.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b680-4\">4. Finally, and above all, the railroad to be aided is wholly outside, not only of the county of Otoe, but of the State of Nebraska. It is a foreign corporation; No benefits local and. peculiar arise to the county of Otoe from this railroad. The people of the county have no right to use it, except as all people everywhere have; that- is to say, on paying for its use. Even the advantages set up as a justification for the tax are of a speculative kind.-</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b680-5\">\n<em>Mr, J. M. Woolworth, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b680-9\"> Whiting <em>v. </em>Sheboygan Railway Company, 9 American law Register, 156 ; Sweet <em>v. </em>Hurlburt, 51 Barbour, 318.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b680-6\">Mr. Justice STRONG</author>\n<p id=\"AuP\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The first question upon which'the judges'of the Circuit Court divided, was whether the act of the legislature of Nebraska, approved February 15th, 1869, authorizing .the county bf.Otoe to issue bonds in aid of a railroad outside of- the State, conflicts with the constitution of that State.</p>\n<p id=\"Amz\">. Unless we close our eyes to what has again and again been decided by this court, and by the highest courts of \u2018most of the States, it would be difficult to discover any sufficient reason for holding that this act was transgressive of the power vested by the constitution of the State in the legislature. That the legislative power of the State has been conferred generally upon the legislature is not denied, and that all such power may be exercised by that body, except so far as it is expressly withheld, is a proposition which admits of no doubt. It is true that, in construing the Federal Constitution, Congress must be held to have only those powers which are granted expressly-or by necessary implication, but the opposite rule is the one to be applied to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>construction of a State constitution. The legislature of a State may exercise all powers which are properly legislative, unless they are forbidden by the State or-National Constitution. This is \u00e1 principle that lias never been called in ques* tion.. Ifj then, the act we are considering was legislative in its character, it is incumbent upon those who deny its validity to show some prohibition in the constitution of the State against such legislation. And that it was an exercise of legislative power is not difficult to maintain. No one questions that the establishment aud maintenance of highways, and the opening facilities for access to markets, are 'within the province of every State legislature upon which has been conferred general legislative power. These things are necessarily done by law. The State may establish highways or avenues to markets by its own direct action, or it may empower or direct one of its municipal divisions to establish them, or to assist in their construction. Indeed, it has been by such action that most of the highways of the country have come into existence. They owe their being either to some general enactment of a State legislature or to some law that authorized a municipal division of the State to construct and maintain them at its own expense. They are the 'creatures of law, whether they are common county or township roads, or turnpikes, or canals, or railways. And that authority given to a municipal corporation to aid in the construction of a turnpike, canal, or railroad is a legitimate exercise of legislative power, unless the power be expressly denied, is not only plain in reason, but it is established by a number and weight o? authorities beyond what can be. adduced in support of almost any other legal proposition. The highest courts of the States have affirmed it in nearly a hundred decisions, and this court has asserted the .same, doctrine nearly a score of times.. It is no longer open to debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Then what is there in the constitution of the State of Ne-bi\u2019aska which denies this power to the legislature ? There is no direct or express prohibition. General legislative power is vested in the legislature. None was reserved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>the people of the State.. There are, however, certain restriction's that may be noticed. The constitution declares that \u201c the property of no person shall be taken for public use without just compensation,\u201d and it is earnestly contended that this prohibits the legislature from passing any laws in aid of the construction of a railroad that may result in the imposition of taxes. It is said that the act of February.15th, 1869, is taking private property for a public use without compensation. It would be a sufficient answer to this to say that a similar provision is found in the constitution of almost every State, tlife legislature of which has been held authorized to legalize municipal subscriptions in aid of railroad companies. It has' never been held to prohibit such legislation as ive are now considering. But the clause prohibiting taking private property for public use without just compensation has no reference- to taxation. If it has, then all taxation is forbidden, for \u201cjust compensation\u201d means pecuniary recompense to the person whose property is taken equivalent in value to the property.' If- a county is authorized to build a court-house or a jail,-and to impose taxes-to defray the cost, private property is as truly, taken for public use without Compensation as it is. when the county is authorized to build a railroad or \u00e1 turnpike, o.r to aid in the construction and to levy taxes for'the expenditure. \u25a0 But it is taken in neither case in the constitutional sense. The restriction is upon the right of eminent domain, not upon the right of taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">We find nothing else iu-the constitution of the State that can with any reason be claimed to restrain the pow.er of the legislature to authorize municipal aid to. railroads, or other highways. \u2022 There is a clause that declares \u201c the credit of the. State shall never be given to, or bound, in aid of any individual association or corporation,\u201d and another that ordains that the debts of the State shall never, in the aggregate,'exceed $50,000, but -these refer only to State action and State liability.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>In view, therefore, of the organic law of the.State, and of the decisions which have been made in regard to other sim-' ilar constitutional provisions, both in the highest courts of' the States and in this court, we think it \u2019cannot he doubted the legislature of Nebraska had authority to authorize its municipal divisions to incur indebtedness and to impose taxation in aid of railroad companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">It is urged, however, against the validity of the act now under consideration that it authorized a donation of the county bonds to the railroad company, and it is insisted that if even the legislature could empower the county to subscribe to the stock of such a corporation, it could not constitutionally authorize a donation. Yet there is no solid ground of distinction -between a subscription to stock and an appropriation of money or credit. Both are for the purpose of aiding in the construction of the road; both are aimed at the same object, securing a public advantage, obtaining a highway or. an avenue to the markets of the country; both may be equally burdensome to the taxpayers of the county. The stock subscribed for may be worthless, and known' to be so. That the legislature of the State might have granted aid directly to any railroad company by actual donation of money 'from its treasury will not be controverted. No one questions that in the absence of some constitutional inhibition the power of a State to appropriate its money, however raised, is limited only bythe sense of justice and by the sound discretion of its legislature. ' If the power to tax be unrestricted, the power to appropriate the taxes is necessarily equally so. Accordingly nothing has been more common in the State and Federal governments than appropriations of public money raised by taxation to objects, in regard to which no legal liability has existed. State legislatures have made donations for numerous purposes, wherever, in their judgment, the public well-being required them, and the right to make such gifts has never been seriously questioned. As has been said, the security agaiust abuse of power by a legislature in this direction is found in the wisdom and sense of propriety of its membeVs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>.and in their responsibility to their constituents. But if a State can directly levy taxes.to make donations to improve- . ment companies, or to other objects which, in the judgment of it's legislature, it may be well to aid, it will be found difficult to maintain that it may not confer upon its municipal divisions power to do the same thing. Counties, cities, and towns exist only for the convenient administration of th\u00e9 government. Such organizations. \u00e1re instruments of the State, created to carry out its will. When they are authorized or directed to levy a--tax, or to. appropriate its proceeds, the State through them is doing indirectly what it might do directly. It is true the burden of the duty may thus rest . Upon only a single political division, but the legislature has undoubted power to apportion a public burden- among all the taxpayers of the State, or among those of a particular section. In its judgment, those of a single section may reap the principal benefit from a proposed-expenditure, as' from tke construction of a road, a Bridge, an almshouse, or a hospital. It is not unjust, therefore, that they should alone bear the burden. This subject has been so often discussed, ' and the principles we have asserted have been so thoroughly vindicated, that it seems to be needless t\u00f3 say more, or even to refer at large to the decisions. A few only are cited.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\u25a0 One other objection to the constitutionality of the act is urged. It is that it authorized aid to a railroad beyond the limits of the county, and 'outside the State. There is nothing in this objection. It was for the legislature to determine whether the object to be aided was one in which the people of the State had an interest, and it is very obvious that the interests of the people of Otoe County may have been more involved in the construction of a. road giving them a connection with an eastern market than they could be in the construction of any road wholly within the county. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>But that the objection has no weight in ay be seen in <em>Gelpcke </em>v. <em>Dubuque </em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and in <em>Walker </em>v. Cincinnati.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the act of the legis]ature of February 15th, 1869, is not in conflict with.the constitution of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The second question upon which the Circuit Court divided was \u201cwhether the county commissioners of Otoe County could, under the act of February 15th&gt; 1869, lawfully issue the bonds fiom which the coupons in suit were detached, without the proposition to vote the bonds for the purpose indicated, and also a tax to pay the same being or having been submitted ;o a vote of the people of the county, as provided by the act of- the Territorial legislature of Nebraska, passed January 1st, 1861.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">This question we answer in the affirmative. If the legislature had power to authorize the county officers to extend aid on behalf of the county or State to a railroad company, as we have seen it had, very plainly it could prescribe the mode in which such aid might be extended, as well as the terms and conditions of the extension, and it needed no assistance from a popular vote of. the municipality. Such a vote could not have enlarged legislative power. But the act of 1869 was an unconditional bestowal of authority upon the county commissioners to issue the bonds to the railroad'company. It required no precedent action of the voters of the county. It assumed that their assent had been obtained. That prior to 1869 the sanction of approval by a local popular vote had been required for municipal aid to railroad companies, or improvement companies, is quite -immaterial. The requisition was but the act of an annual legislature which-any subsequent legislature could abrogate or annul.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">It must, therefore, be certified to the Circuit Court, first, that the act of February 15th, 1869, is not unconstitutional; and, <em>seeond, </em>that the county commissioners of Otoe County could -lawfully issue the bonds from which the coupons in suit were detached, without any submission to a vote of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>people of tbe county of the,proposition to approve the bonds, or a tax for the payment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Certoted accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b686-7\">The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice MILLER-, and Mr. Justice DAVIS dissented from the opinion in this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-5\"> Patterson <em>v. </em>Board of Supervisors of Yuba, 13 California, 175.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\"> Blanding <em>v. </em>Burr, 13 California, 343; The Town of Guilford <em>v. </em>The Supervisors of Chenango County, 3 Kernan, 149; Stuart <em>v. </em>Supervisors, 30 Iowa, 9; Augusta Bank <em>v. </em>Augusta, 49 Maine, 507; Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Smith, a case decided by the Supreme Court of Illinois and not reported.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b685-8\"> 1 Wallace, 175.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b685-9\"> 21 Ohio, 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
