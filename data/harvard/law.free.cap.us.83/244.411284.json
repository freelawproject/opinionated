The court granted the injunction, and from this, its action, the county officers appealed. The question was whether (as Pegues, the complainant, contended) the act of December 19th, 1855, \u201cto amend the charter of the Northeastern Railroad Company,\u201d &amp;c., and exempting its property frpiu taxation, formed a <em>'part of its charter </em>when, on the 17th of December, 1868, the privileges granted to <em>that </em>company were conferred on the Cheraw and Darlington company; or whether (as the State of South Carolina contended) the privileges thus conferred were limited to those granted to the Northeastern company by its original charter or act of incorporation, passed in 1851, by which no exemption from taxation was conferred.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-5\">\n<em>Mr. D.

Chamberlain, for the State officers, appellants,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASL\">contended that an exemption from taxation was never to be implied; that nothing less than a clear intention on the part of the legislature \u2014 an intention expressed in terms which admit no other reasonable construction \u2014 would suffice to sustain a privilege so valuable and so far-reaching; that as was shown by the words \u2014 \u201c an act to amend the <em>charter </em>of the Northeastern Company\u201d \u2014 in the amendatory act of 1855, it was the act of 1851 incorporating the company which constituted its <em>charter; </em>and t-hat when the act of 1863 gave to the Cheraw and Darlington Railroad all the powers, rights, and privileges granted by the <em>charier </em>of the Northeastern Railroad Company, it gave it only the powers, rights, and privileges granted by that act of 1851.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-6\">In addition to this, that the original grant of powers, rights, and privileges made to the Cheraw and Darlington road, by the section 5 of the act of December 19th, 1849, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>charter that road, was \u201cfor the purpose of <em>organizing and forming </em>that company,\u201d and that when this act was amended by substituting the new words contained in the amendatory act of the 17th of December, 1863, granting other privileges \u2014the road not yet being so much as. undertaken \u2014 the original purpose \u201c of organizing and forming the company\u201d still remained; and that it was a construction such as, in regard to a law exempting property from taxation, was not to be made, that would extend the interpretation so much further, as the complainant sought to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-5\">The learned counsel also contended that-if this view were not sound', and if the property of the Cheraw and Darlington Railroad were by the act of 1863' exempted, yet the right to repeal or amend any previously existing exemption from taxation was inherent and inextinguishable in the State; that the power of taxation was one of the highest and most vitally necessary powers of sovereignty, and that if one legislature could take it from all subsequent legislatures, government could not go on.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-6\">\n<em>Mr. T.

A more important or more comprehensive privilege than a perpetual immunity from taxation can scarcely be imagined. It con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>tains the essential idea of a peculiar benefit or advantage, .of a special exemptiou'from a burden falling upon others.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">There is nothing in the terms of the statute of 1868 to indicate that the legislature intended to limit the privileges conferred upon the Cheraw Company to those granted to the Northeastern Company by its original act of incorporation, and to exclude the important privileges contained in the amending act. The charter of the Northeastern Company, as it existed in 1863, was based upon the two acts of the legislature, passed in 1851 and 1855, respectively. Tire first act was entitled an \u201cact to incorporate\u201d the Northeastern Compauy. The- latter act was entitled \u201c an act to amend the charter of the Northeastern Company.\u201d A charter, in the sense here used, is an instrument or authority from the sovereign power, bestowing rights or privileges; as it is briefly expressed, it is an act of incorporation. Such was the obvious understanding of the word by the legislature of South Carolina. The first.act was expressed as creating the incorporation of the compauy; the second, using a synonymous expression, purported to amend its charter. The words charter and act of incorporation were used convertibly. \u25a0Whether it be said that the rights and privileges conferred upon the Northeastern, as they stood in 1863, existed in its charter or were derived from its incorporation amounts to the same thing. We have no doubt that all of them were intended to be granted to the Cheraw Companj' by the act of that year. The charter or incorporation of 1851 had been amended in 1855, and by an act which purported in its title not to create an original authority, but by amending the original charter to bestow additional powers upon the company. After the passage of the amended act, the Northeastern was, in law, as if it had originally been chartered, with all the rights, powers, and privileges conferred upon it by the act of 1855. Such was the legal effect of the amendment; and such, no doubt, was the understanding of its effect by the legislature of South Caroliua, when, in 1863, they conferred all its powers and privileges upon the Cheraw Company. The case show's that from 1849 to 1863 no suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ficient inducements had been found to procur\u00e9 the building of the Cheraw road. Wo are not advised what other powers and privileges were then and there conferred upon it in addition to the exemption we are considering. But this exemption was conferred; an exemption that must have been understood by the least reflecting person as being of immense value to all concerned in'the road. The road was soon afterwards built, and has since then been and now is in operation. These -facts serve -to show \u2014 first, that there was, in this instance, the consideration that at any time exists for the granting by the legislature of such privilege to aid the acceptance of the same and the building of the road; and, secondly, 'the intention of the legislature, by omitting a reference to the original aetof incorporation, to grant all the powers and privileges that had been at any time conferred upon the Northeastern Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Another question is raised, to wit: That a legislature does not possess the power to grant to a corporation a perpetual immunity from taxation. It is said that the power of taxation is among the highest powers of a sovereign State; that its exercise is a political necessity, without which the State must cease to exist, and that it is not competent for one legislature, by binding its successors, to compass the death of the State. It is too late to raise this question in this court. It has been held that the legislature has the power to bind the State in relinquishing its power to tax a corporation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2020\u2021It has been held that such a provision in the charter of an incorporation constitutes a contract which the State may not subsequently impair. <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> These doctrines have been reiterated and reaffirmed so recently as the year 1871, in an opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Davis in the case of <em>The Wilmington Railroad </em>v. <em>Reid.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>They must be considered as settled in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-9\"> Jefferson Bank <em>v. </em>Skelly, 1 Black, 436.'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b257-10\"> Providence Bank <em>v. </em>Billings, 4 Peters, 514; Dartmouth College <em>v. </em>Woodward, 4 Wheaton, 518; The Binghamton Bridge, 3 Wallace, 51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b257-11\"> 13 Wallace, 264.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
