It stipulated for the payment of that sum to the legal representatives of the assured, in the event of his death, from injuries effected through violent and accidental means; provided that the death was caused by an accident while the assured was \u201c travelling by public or private conveyance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIa\">After purchasing the ticket, the insured proceeded by steamboat to a village about eight miles from his1 residence, and from that village he <em>walked </em>home. &gt; While on his way he received, injuries by violence, from the effects\u2019of which he died soon afterwards, and within the time limited by the policy. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-12\">.The question was whether, when he received the injuries, he was \u201c travelling by public or private conveyance.\u201d The court below held that he was not; and this holding was the error complained of.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\n<em>Mr. George Gray, for the plaintiff in error:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-5\">In <em>Northrup </em>v. <em>The Railway Passengers\u2019 Assurance Company</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the contract- was against accident \u201c while travelling by public or private conveyance,\u201d <em>provided for the transportation of its passengers. </em>Yet the company was held liable though the death was caused while the party was <em>walking </em>from a steamboat landing to a railway station, a distance of seventy rods. This case regards the walking as part of the original journey in the public or private conveyance, and wisely; for few persons on a long journey are all the time in the rail-carriages. The case does but carry out the injunction given by Cockburn, C. J., in <em>Trew </em>v. <em>Railway Passengers\u2019 Assurance </em>Company:<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-6\">. \u201c We ought not to give to these policies a construction which will defeat the protection of the assured in a large class of eases.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-7\">But, independently of this. The words \u201c private conveyance,\u201d reasonably, and <em>ex vi termini, </em>include the case of a person pursuing a journey, or travelling, by means of his own personal powers of locomotion; his limbs with their muscles .and tendons, bones and joints \u2014 the primitive universal \u201cprivate'conveyance\u201d of man. \u201cConveyance\u201d is the instrument or means of carrying or transferring anything from place to place. It is derived from <em>con </em>(with, by, along); and <em>via </em>(the way).<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> It is used in this sense in the Scriptures, where .it is said that the Saviour had \u201c <em>conveyed himself </em>away.\u201d<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> So in po'etry,</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-8\">\u201c Love cannot, like the wind, itself <em>convey \u25a0 </em>To fill two sails, though.both are spread one way.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-9\">\n<em>Howard.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-10\">And so in ordinary language and in everyday life. Should a court direct its officer to \u201c <em>convey </em>the prisoner to jail,\u201d no one will doubt that the prisoner\u2019s walking to the place des<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>ignated would be a literal and'exact compliance with the order. If one were to say to an intruder, \u201c <em>Convey </em>yourself away,\u201d the speaker would have no- idea but that the party should walk off; nor would the party himself expect that anything else was meant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-6\">\n<em>Mr. H.

What was' the understanding of the parties, or, rather, what understanding must naturally have been derived from the language used? It seems to us th.at walking would not naturally be presented to the mind as a means of public or private conveyance. Public conveyance naturajly suggests a vessel or vehicle employed in the general conveyance of passengers. Private conveyance suggests a vehicle belonging to a private individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">If this was the sense in which the language was understood by the parties, the deceased was not, when injured, travelling, within the terms of the policy. There is nothing to show that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">Judgment aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
