Upon this judgment an execution was issued in 1858, which, on. the 1st of DecembQr of that year, was returned \u201c <em>nulla bona.\u201d </em>On the 29th of' January, 1868, that is to say, about ten years after the execution had been thus returned unsatisfied, they brought'the present suit. It was a bill in chancery against one Smith and some twenty-seven other defendants, and, alleging the insolvency of the company, it sought to subject to the payment of the judgment, rights which, it alleged, the compauy had against the said defendants. It averred that the defendants, on the 22d of August, 1853, under the general railroad laws of Indiana, organized the above-named railroad company and subscribed to its capital stock, severally, amounts\u2019 which they had never paid, and the object of the bill was to compel the payment of the <em>debts </em>thus incurred, and the application of the payments to the satisfaction of the complainants\u2019 judgmeut. The facts were these:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-8\">On the 22d of August., 1853, under the general railroad laws of the State, the defendants, with others, united informing articles of association for the incorporation of the New Albany and Sandusky Railroad Compauy, and severally subscribed to its capital stock in sums varying from $1000 to $5000. [The railroad laws referred to allow, it may be added, no organization of a road until at least $50,000, or $1000;for every mile of the proposed road, shall have been established.] The articles of association contained the following stipulation :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-9\">\u201cProvided, however, and it is hereby understood, that if the city of New Albany, in its corporate capacity, shall hereafter take stock in this corporation to the amount of $50,000 or upwards, inasmuch as the present subscribers being residents of, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>and owning property in said city, will then be under the necessity of contributing still further to the corporation by way of taxation, unless a portion of the present subscription is taken off their hands, the said city shall accept; ih part of the amount to be subscribed in its corporate capacity, at its par value, a transfer of any amount of stock now subscribed for by each individual over and above the amount of six shares, or $300, which each such individual may desire or request shall be so transferred.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-6\">There were fifty-five original subscribers, aud the aggregate amount of the. subscriptions was $148,750.. With such a subscription, aud under such articles of association, the subscribers became a corporate body. .After their incorporation the city of New Albany subscribed $400,000 to the capital stock of the company.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This subscription was'made on the 19th of November, 1853, and on the 31st o.f December next following, the directors of the company adopted an order,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-7\">\u201c That the original subscribers to the articles .of association be permitted, in accordance with the stipulations- contained in the articles, to transfer any amount of the stock so originally subscribed by them over and above the amount of, six shares, or $300, to the city of New Albany; said city having made a subscription to the stock of said .company to the amount of $50,000 and upwards, and that the stock-thus transferred be merged, in the subscription already made by said city, so that the stock of said city, under her present subscription, with the stock so-transferred, shall not exceed $400,000 as subscribed by her.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-8\">The directora of the company, who made this order, were themselves subscribers, like the defendants, for more than six shares, or sums above $300.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-9\">So far, there was no controversy respecting the facts. And there was also an \u201cagreement of record\u201d \u2014 a document certified by the clerk of the court below, with the bill; auswers, depositions, &amp;c., as part of the full, <em>true, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>complete copy' and transcript of the record and proceedings in the. case \u2014 that the defendants transferred to the city of New Albany.all the stock subscribed byr them in excessmf $300 for each, in compliance with the stipulation contained in the original articles of association; that the transfers were made before the 1st day of July, 1854; that none of these original subscribers were ever charged on the books of the railroad company with any greater amount of stock than $300; that the amount of stock charged against each (viz., $300) had been fully paid long before the filing of this bill, and when called by the company, and that such payments had been accepted by the company as full satisfaction of.the respective subscriptions.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-6\">The question was, whether the defendants were debtors to the railroad company, for any excess of their subscriptions above $300.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-7\">The court below was of opinion that they were not, and. dismissed the bill against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-8\">The complainants appealed. .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-9\">\n<em>Messrs. Burke, Porter, and Harrison, for the appellants :</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-10\"><em>\u25a0 </em>The defendants confessedly subscribed large sums to the stock of the- road, and so organized it. By the laws of Indiana it could not have been otherwise organized. Having organized it and given it the power to incur debts, arid it having incurred them, these pei\u2019sons \u2014 the solid and solvent subscribers \u2014 the men on the faith of whose subscriptions creditors have given money and done work \u2014 all at once and suddenly vanish from the scene.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-11\">Now are they released?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-12\">The directors certainly had no power to release them as against the creditors of the compauy. This is certain. The argument then will be that the subscribers have made a transfer of their stock to the city, and that the city having assumed their subscription, they ar\u00e9 discharged! But the record shows no copy-of any transfer. What is said by the clerk under.the head of \u201cagreement of record\u201d constitute\u00bb no part of the record at law. That this court cannot notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>such a paper was decided in <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Cockerell,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in <em>Suydam </em>v.

What power indeed, supposing a transfer to have been attempted to be made \u2014 wbat power had the city in its corporate capacity to accept it ? So far as appears it had none.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-7\">Then again. The act of the directors releasing the defendants was void, not only on general principles, but also because they were all personally interested in having such an order of release, and in fact all availed themselves of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-8\">The whole operation is void. It is an attempt upon ;the part of the directors to allow a'cancellation of so much stock, a nominal transfer to the'city, but a real blotting out of so-much stock; a transfer that would relieve the directors and their fellows, but that ivould not increase the stock of the transferee. Whatever name may be given such, a transaction, its substance and effect, if. permitted, would be to reduce the capital of the company and its means of paying its debts and carrying out the objects of the corporation-to the extent of the amount so transferred. The directors have no authority to thus dispose of the effects of the corporation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-9\">\n<em>Mr. M. C.

If they ar\u00e9, the, complainants have an equitable right to subject those debts to the payment of the judgment they have against the railroad company. And it must also be conceded that if the company has, in fraud of its creditors, released subscribers to its stock from the payment of their subscriptions, the release is inoperative to protect those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>subscribers against claims' of the creditors. Under the law of the State, all railroad companies are required to have a subscription to their capital stock not less than $1000 for every mile of their proposed roads before they may exercise corporate powers. This requirement is intended as a protection to the public, and to the creditors of the companies. And it is clear that the directors of a company, organized under the law, have no power to destroy it, to give away its' funds, or deprive it of any means which it possesses to accomplish the purposes for which it was incorporated. The stock subscribed is the capital of the company, its means for performing its duty to the commonwealth, aud to those who deal with it. Accordingly, it has been settled by very numerous decisions that the directors of a company are incompetent to.release au original subscriber to its. capital stock, or to make any arrangement with him by which the company, its creditors, or the State shall lose any of the benefit-of his subscription. Every such arrangement is regarded in equity, not merely as <em>ultra </em>vires, but as a fraud upon the other stockholders, upon the public, and upon the creditors of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">It is upon these principles that the appellants in this case rely, aud the question is whether they are applicable to the facts as found.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">That the subscriptions made by the appellees to the articles of association'for the incorporation of the company were, according to their terms, not absolute engagements to pay for a greater amount of stock than $300 for each subscriber is undeniable. They were engagements to pay for the number of shares subscribed, only on the contingency that the city of New Albany should not afterwards take stock in the corporation to the amount of $50,000 or upwards, or, if such stock should be taken, on the contingency that they failed to transfer \u00e1 part of their subscriptions to the city. Such was the letter and the spirit of the contract entered into by each subscriber. Whether the law permitted it to have such a legal effect we will presently consider. But that such was its meaning, independently of any rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>of legal policy, is very plain. It is the vei\u2019y language of the articles of association. When, therefore, the directors of the company, on the 31st of December, 1853, ordered that the original subscribers to the articles, in accordance with the stipulation contained therein, be permitted to transfer any amount of the- stock (exceeding six shares) subscribed' by them .to the city of New Albany (that city having made a subscription exceeding $50,000), and ordered that the' stock thus transferred be merged in the stock subscribed by the city, the order was ho more than allowing the eoutract to be performed as made. It was no release of any rights which the company had; no abandonment of any resources of the corporation. It was no more than the subscribers, in view of the provisions of their contract, had aright to demand. Unless the contract must be held to have been an absolute undertaking, that each subscriber would himself pay for all the stock subscribed by him, it was fully \u2022performed by the payment of $300 and' the transfer of the. excess to ..the city to be\u2019merged in its larger subscription.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">, It must, however, be conceded that conditions attached to subscriptions for the..stock of. a railroad company made&lt;\u2022 before itsl incorporation- have, in many' cases, been held tb be void, a'nd the subscriptions have been treated as absolute; The' question respecting their validity has most frequently arisen when the condition has been that the- proposed ro\u00e1d ' should be located in a specified manner, or over a-.defined line. But other conditions have been held invalid, and have been disregarded by the courts. The reasons for such a ruling are obvious, and they commend themselves to universal approval. \u2019 When a company is incorporated under general laws, as theNew Albany and Sandusky Railroad Company was, and the law prescribes that a certain amount of stock'shall be subscribed before corporate powers shall be exercised, if subscriptions, obtained before\u2019 the organization was effected, may be subsequently rendered unavailable by conditions attached to them, the substantial requirements of the laws are defeated. The purpose of such a requisition is, that the t\u00e9tate may be assured of the - successful prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>tion of the work, and that creditors of the company may have, to the extent at le\u00e1st of the required subscription, the means of obtaining satisfaction of their claims. The grant of the franchise is, therefore, made dependent upon securing a specified amount of capital. If the subscriptions to the stock can be clogged with such conditions as to render it impossible to -collect the fund which'the State required to be provided before it would assent to the grant of corporate powers, a charter might be obtained without any available capital. Conditions attached to subscriptions, which, if valid, lessen the capital of the company, thus depriving the State of the security it exacted that the- railroad would be built, and diminishing the means intended for the protection of creditors, are therefore a fraud upon the grantor of the franchise, and upon those whomay become creditors of' the corporation. They are also a fraud upon, unconditional stockholders, who subscribed to the stock in the.-faith that: capital sufficient would be obtained to complete the projected work, andwho may be compelled to pay their subscriptions, though the enterprise has failed, and their whole investment has been lost; \u25a0 It is for these reasons that such conditions are denied any effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">But the reasons of the rule are totally\u00bb inapplicable to the present case. The appellees are not asking to diminish the capital of the company by force of any condition attached to their subscriptions. The action of the board of directors permitting a transfer to the city of New Albany of all the stock originally subscribed, in excess of six shares by each subscriber, according to the. stipulations of the articles of association, was not a release of any stock subscription,.nor was it. an attempt to lessen the means of the company to build its road and pay its creditors. We cannot, while recognizing the rule.as a sound one, overlook the peculiar facts of this case.. Under the articles of association the original subscribers undertook, not that they would respectively pay, at all events, for all.the shares mentioned in their several subscriptions, but, in substance and effect, that such a number of shared should be paid for, either by themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>or by the city of New Albany, if it became a subscriber. There was no condition by which the'number'of shares subscribed an'd made available could ever be reduced. Had the city taken no. stock they would have been liable for all the shares taken by them. It is impossible to see in this any fraud upon the State or upon the creditors of the company. They have all the security in those subscriptions which they would have had there been no right to transfer to the city reserved. The capital stock is all that it was represented to be when the company became, incorporated. The only .change is, that a part of it is pledged, by the city of New Albany, instead of by these appellees. No capital has been lost by the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">If, then, the reason of the rule invoked by the appellants has no applicability to the facts of this case,'the rule itself fails, there is no condition to be stricken from the subscription, and there is no ground for holding the appellees liable beyond the plain letter and spirit of their contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">It is insisted, however, on behalf of the appellants that there never was any-tra'nsfer by these appellees to the city of the excess above six shares for each, of the stock mentioned in their subscriptions, and it is denied that we can consider the admission of such a transfer, which appears in the record, as any proof of ifs having been made. It is-said that the alleged admission is an unauthorized certificate of the clerk, which constitutes no part of the record, and we are referred to <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Cockerell.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But that ease does not support the appellants. It was an action at common law, in which it was said \u201c in eases at common law, the course of the court has been uniform, not to consider any papef as part of the record which is not made so by the pleadings, or by-some opinion of the court referring to it. . . . The unauthorized. certificate of the clerk that any document was read, or any evidence given to the jury, cannot make that document or that evidence a part of the record, so as to bring it to the cognizance of this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>All the other cases cited were suits at law in which, of course, the\" evidence could not come upon the record except in the regular manner. A elerk\u2019s certificate could not bring it there. But this is a bill in equity. In. such a case no bill of exceptions is necessary to. bring upon the record the proofs and admissions of the parties.' There is the same reason for regarding the admission which appears- in this record a paid of the record, as there is for considering any one of the depositions. It would be very extraordinary, if parties to a proceeding in equity may not, at tfie hearing, make an admission of facts, upon which the inferior court \u2022 may act, and which maybe considered on appeal'to this' court. And it would be still more extraordinary, if appellants, under whose'direction,a record'in chancery has been made up* and who have filed it h\u00e9re without-objeetion, should be permitted to assert for the first time on the argument that the clerk had certified improperly as. a part of the record, an. admission at the hearing below, which was never made, or which, if made, we are not at liberty to regard. It is not denied that the admission of record, certified by the clerk, was agreed to by the parties, that it was induced to writing, and entered upon the record, nor is it deuied that it was considered by the court below as evidence in the cause, and considered without objection. We must, therefore, hold that it is. to be .treated as a part of the record now, and if so,, it establishes fully the transfer of the stock to the city before July 1st, 1854; that hone of the appellees were ever charged' with it on the books of the company, and that the transfer was made with the assent of. the corporation, cdnstituting with the payment-made for the six shares not transferred, full satisfaction of the indebtedness of the appellee's, and accepted as such. It is true there appears to have been no written transfer. None was. necessary. The appellees had received no certificates. They were not on the books as stockholders for more thau six shares each, and from the beginning it was understood and agreed that for all liability beyond that, the city, if it subscribed, was to step into their place. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"AEC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>It is next denied that the city accepted the transfer. To this it may be answered that the acceptance is implied iu~ the admission of record. There could have been no transfer without the assent of both, parties. More than this. The other evidence tends strongly to show that the mayor and' some members of the'couneils of the city knew of the transfers and assented to them, and the city never dissented from the arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"Alo\">It is true that a mere assignment of his share by a subscriber does not relieve him from liability until the assignee is substituted in his place. But here the substitution was ree\u00f3gnized by the company. The stock was not charged to the appellees on the books, and after the lapse of niue years it is too- late to affirm that- the transfer was not accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Again, it is argued that th,e directors of the company were, personally interested as original subscribers, and therefore that their order of .December Bl.st, 1853, permitting the transfer was illegal. But if, as we have endeavored to show, the original'subscriptions were valid as made, if the stipulation in the articles of association was not prohibited by the law, it needed no such order of the board of directors to validate\u2019 the substitution of the city for the original subscribers. It matters not then that the directors were interested. Equity would have enjoined' them against interference to prevent a transfer, with all its stipulated consequences. The substitution of the city was a matter over which they had no discretionary power.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">There is, then, we think, nothing, either in law or in the facts, that can justify our holding that the appellees were indebted to the company on their subscriptions when thia bill was filed ; \u2022 nothing to impeach the validity of the arrangement provided for in the articles of- association, and carried 'out afterwards with the assent of the company, by which they were-discharged from alL liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">This is sufficient- for the case, and if it were, hot it would be a grave inquiry, W\u2019hether the laches of the appellants has hot been such that they cannot now invoke equitable relief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Their judgment was recovered in 1857, and the return of <em>nulla bona </em>to their execution was made in December, 1858. Before that time the company had become insolvent, and some five years before that time the arrangement had been consummated which they now assail as a fraud upon the creditors; It is incredible that they did not know of the arrangement. The articles of association were on record open to their inspection. Those articles exhibited in prospect precisely what was done. No one could have seen them without having it suggested that the original subscribers had not at first intended to pay for all the stock mentioned in their subscription, and that it was intended the city should take part of the stock off their hands. The .company\u2019s books, which they might have seen, would have told them the appellees had paid for only six shares. This was quite sufficient to make inquiry a duty. And had inquiry been made there was not the least difficulty in ascertaining the facts. Yet the present suit was delayed until 1868.- True, the appellants\u2019 bill alleges the indebtedness of the appellees by force of their contracts. It does not charge a fraud. \u25a0 But it is plain that unless the arrangement by which the subscriptions were merged in that of the city was a fraud upon them their bill must fail. The court must set-aside that arrangement or they cannot recover. And the burden is upon them to establish the fraud. Had their bill been framed to set aside the arrangement because of fraud, it must have been held to have been filed too late.. The statute of limitations bars actions for fraud in Indiana after six years, and equity acts or'refuses to act in analogy to the statute. Can a party evade the statute or escape in equity from the rule that th.e analogy of the statute will be followed by changing the form of his bill? We think not\u00bb We think a court of equity will not be moved to set aside a fraudulent transaction at the suit of one who has been quiescent during a period longer than that fixed by the statute of limitations, after he had knowledge of the fraud, or after he was put upon inquiry with the means of knowledge accessible to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>But wg pursue this branch of the case no further. We have already said.enough to show that, in our opinion, there was no error in the decree of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\"> 5 Peters, 248.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
