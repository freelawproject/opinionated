The errors in the refusals to charge, and in the charge, as already set forth' in the five bills of exceptions and the foregoing statement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-9\"><em>Mr. W. M. </em>Eoarts, <em>for the plaintiff in error:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-10\">I. It is not necessary to argue, or adduce authorities for, the proposition that\u2019 iuterest is the only damages for the simple non-payment of money according to duty, or to implied or express contract. That the allowance of $5000 as damages, over and above the insurance-moneys, <em>and interest </em>on them, was error, on the face of the record, and without any reference to any possible evidence or ruling at the trial, and that, for this error, the judgment below must be reversed, is indisputable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-11\">II. As to the second ground for a new trial for error apparent upon the record, to wit: the breach of warranty, in the use of the West India port of Matanzas, and the wreck by a hurricane in that port, the only question seems t\u00f3 be as to the consequence of the absence from the record of any evidence bearing upon the point of this resort to the pert of.Mat\u00e1uzas being voluntary or under stress from perils injured against. But, on the face of the contract, a breach of its warranty arises by the resort to this West India port, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>the wreck from peril there supervening. The affirmative proof to defeat this consequence of this apparent breach of warranty is wholly wanting. Presumptively, no such prdof was offered at the trial. It is not allowable for the plaintiff, in error to incumber the record by <em>ail the evidence at the trial </em>upon the motive and to the end of showing that no such proof was given. The defendant in error should have pro-, cured the presence of such evidence^if any was given at the trial, by the appropriate applications in the Court below or in this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-5\">III. The errors exhibited on the bills of exception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-6\">1st. The instruction asked for and refused, aud made the occasion of the first bill of exceptions, was proper to be given, and the refusal to give it was error. The court put its refusal to give this instruction upon the siugle ground \u201cthat it was in pj-oof that an abandonment had been made, and accepted without fraud, and under aud in. accordance with the advice of the defendants.\u201d But this was in issue on the, pleadings and proofs, and was the'very thing to be passed upon by the jury. The court refused a proper instruction, on a question of law, by usurpation of the province of the jury, on a question of fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-7\">2d. The same observations, in substance, apply to the second bill. A proper instruction, as matter of law, is refused upon an assumption of a conclusion of fact, whieh belonged to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-8\">3d. The error under the third bill is of the same character as that under the first; the observations made upon that are applicable to this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-9\">4th. The instruction asked for and, refused was clearly proper, and the exception in the fourth bill was well taken. The evidence had been taken upon this extraneous transaction, aud for-the purpose; of affecting the verdict of the jury, which it was well calculated to do. The court was rightly, called upon to exclude'this consideration from affecting the mind of the jury, unless it was, in law, a proper subject for their .consideration in this case. It. manifestly was not proper, as an element in the jury\u2019s conclusions in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>5th. The passage in the charge of the judge which is made the subject of the fifth bill, as an abstract and general proposition, may be unobjectionable. But, indisputably, the only \u201c actual total loss by storms and disaster of the sea,\u201d was by the hurricane in the port of Matanzas,and this naked charge, applied to this state of facts, was equivalent to a peremptory charge that, without regard to the antecedent history of th'e voyage, or to the warranties of the policies, the plaintiffs had a right to recover for a total loss under both policies. But this depends upon the question whether the total wreck by the hurricane, in the port of Matanzas, was covered or not by the policies, as an origiual and independent cause of loss. And this depended upon the previous history of the voyage, and could only be disposed of by the verdict of the jury, under proper instructions from the court, covering these anterior considerations.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-5\"><em>Mr. T. J. </em>Durant, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b392-6\">Mr. Justice CLIFFORD</author>\n<p id=\"AgEj\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Due application was made by the plaintiff to the corporation defendants for\u2018a policy of insurance upon the brig Sicilia, of which he was the owner, and on the 11th of July, 1870, he effected with the defendants such a contract, for the period of one year, lost or not lost, the brig then lying in the port of New Orleans, whereby the defendants insured the vessel against the perils of the-seas and other risks of her intended voyages, as more fully appears in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">It also appears that the plaintiff, five days later, having freighted the brig with cotton for Helsingfors, in the Gulf of Finland, also effected insurance, with the defendants, upon her freight list for $5700, payable to his own order in gold, as shown by the certificate filed in the case, which represents and takes the place of a policy as fully as if the property was covered by such an instrument, issued direct to the holder of the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Well appointed and in good order and condition,, the brig, on the 20th of the same month, left her port of departure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>laden with a valuable cargo of cotton and properly officered and manned, but was subsequently compelled,\u2019by perils of the seas and unavoidable accidents, to put into the port Of. Matanzas, Cuba, in distress and disabled, for the security of the property concerned and the preservation of the lives of those on board [?], that being disabled and in want of repairs she remained in that harbor for that purpose, and that while there, and before her repairs were completed, she was driven ashore by a hurricane, and in spite of every exertion which could be made to save her, was wrecked, and, with her cargo, was entirely lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Payment of the sums insured being refused, the plaintiff instituted the present suit to recover the amount, claiming also $15,000 in addition thereto, as damages for the. delay in fulfilling the cojntract. Testimony was taken, and the parties-went to trial; and the jury, under the instructions of the court, returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants excepted and sued out the present writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">By the terms .of the policy, the brig was valued at $10,000, but the risk taken by the defendants on the vessel was only $7000, as appears by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Exceptions wrnre taken by the defendants to the refusal of the court-to instruct the jury, as' requested, aud to the instructions given by the court to the jury, and they also assign for error the finding by the jury, of $5000 damages, and the allowance of the same in the judgment of the court, and also, of the allowance in the judgment of the loss under the. policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">These allowances are specified in the verdict, substantially as follows : That the plaintiff shall recover the sum of $7000 under his policy on the vessel, the sum of $5700, gold-coin, under his policy on the freight list, with interest, as prayed in his petition, and the further sum of $5000 damages, with interest at the rate of five per cent, from the date of judicial demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">- Judgment was rendered for the plaintiff, as follows: By reason of the verdict it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the plaintiff do have aud recover the sum of $7000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>under his policy-on the brig, the sum, of $5700, gold coin, under his policy on the freight list, together with five per cent..interest on said two sums from September 29th, 1870, till paid'; and the further sum of $5000 damages, with five per cent, interest from the 14th of December, the day of judicial demand, till paid, and costs of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Errors apparent in other parts of the record may be reexamined, as well as those which are shown in the bill or bills of exceptions, and it is too plain for argument-that the verdict and judgment are-a part of the record. Whenever the error is apparent in the record the-rule is that it is open to re-examination, whether it-be made to appear by bill of exceptions or in any other manner; and it is everywhere admitted that a writ of error will lie when a party is aggrieved by an error in the foundation, proceedings, judgment, or execution of a suit in a court of record.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">'Damages were claimed by the plaintiff in this case for alleged loss on accouut of the failure of the defendants to make payments as stipulated in the policy, and it appears by the verdict that the jury awarded to the plaintiff* $5000 on that account, in addition to lawful interest. Apart from that, it. also appears that the court, in computing the judgment, allowed the sanie sum for the same claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Interest is-allowable as damages in such a case from the time the payments were due, or from demand made, where the defendant refuses to account or make payment, but the plaintiff* cannot recover special damages for the detention of money due to lfim beyond what the law allows as interest.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Where a principal sum is to be paid at a specific time, the law implies an agreement to make gopd the loss arising from a default by the payment of lawful interest.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Tested by these considerations, it is quite clear that thd act of the jury in allowing the plaintiff $5000 for the detention of the money due under the policies, in addition to 'awful interest, and the act of the Circuit Court in including that amount in the judgment, were erroneous; and inasmuch astbe error is apparent both in the verdict and in tlie judgment, it is equally clear that it is a matter which ',s re-examinable in this court on a writ of error; and, having come-to that conclusion, the only remaining inquiry in this- connection is what disposition shall be made of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Errors of the kind, it is insisted by the defendants; nec-. essarily require that a new <em>venire </em>shall be ordered, but the act of Congress to further the administration of justice<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> provides that the appellate court may affirm, modify, or reverse the judgment, decree, or order brought before it for review, or may direct such judgment, decree, or order to be rendered, or such further proceedings to be Lad by the inferior court as the'justice of the ease may require; and in view of that provision the court is not inclined to adopt the course suggested by the defendants, as it would lead to unnecessary delay and expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Verdicts, it is said, are either general or special, and that if there is error in a case where the verdict is general it can only be corrected by a new trial, and it must be admitted that the rule as suggested finds much countenance in the text-books; nor will it be necessary to depart from that rule in the present case. Strictly speaking, a special verdict is where the jury find the facts of the case and refer the deeis-ion of the cause to the court, with ..a conditional conclusion, that if the court is of the opinion, upon the whole matter as found, that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, then the jury find for the plaintiff; but if otherwise, then they find for the defendant.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">' Examples of special verdicts less formal, however, may be found, and the usual course is to sustain such verdicts if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>they contain all the facts necessary to a proper judgment between the parties in respect to the matter in controversy. Courts algo, in the trial of issues of fact, often propound questions to a jury, and the rule is well settled that such a special, finding, even when it is inconsistent with, the general verdict, shall, control in determining what judgment shall be rendered in the case.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Undoubtedly a special verdict is erroneous if it does not find all. the facts essential to the rendering of the judgment; but if it contain all the facts required' for that purpose the better opinion is that the'court of original jurisdiction may render such judgment as the facts found require, and if they err, and the error is apparent in the record, that such error may be re-examined on writ of error in this court.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Confirmation of this view as the correct one is-also derived from the act of Congress<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> which permits parties to waive a jury, and submit the issues of fact, in civil cases, to the court, as the provision in that act'is that the finding may be general or special, and that it shall have the same effect as the verdict of a jury. Special findings, under that provision, never have a conditional conclusion, and yet the review extends, by the express'words of the act, to the determination of the sufficiency of the facts found to support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">All the facts are found in this case, and they are all apparent in the record, and inasmuch as the question to be .determined is what judgment ought to be rendered on those facts, the court is of the opinion that it is' not necessary to order a new <em>venire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u25a0 Five bills of exceptions were tendered and allowed, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>(1.) Because the court refused to instruct the jury that if they found that the plaintiff abandoned the voyage when he had no right to make the abandonment under the policy, then the plaintiff cannot recover for the insurance on the' freight list; but the bill o\u201cf exceptions states that the court refused to- give the charge because it was in.proof that an abandonment had been made and accepted without fraud and-in accordance with the advice of the defendants, which is all that need be said on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">(2.) Because the court refused to charge the jury that an abandonment made by the plaintiff\u2019 through error and accepted through error by the defendants, whether conditionally or unconditionally, is null aud void, if not warranted \u00e1t the time, under the policy of insurance; but the bill of exceptions states that the court refused so to instruct the. jury because no evidence had been given to show error by either party, which is certainly a good reason for declining to give the instruction.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">(3.) Be\u2019cause the court refused to instruct the jury substantially as iu the first request, aud which was declined for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">(4.) Because the court refused to instruct the jury as requested in respect to a policy of reinsurance executed by the defendants on the cargo of the brig; but the record contains no sufficient information that such an instruction was material to the issues between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">(5.) Because the court instructed the jury that, independent of the abandonment, if they believed there was an actual total los's, by storm and disaster of the sea, the plaintiff had a.right to l\u2019eeover.
