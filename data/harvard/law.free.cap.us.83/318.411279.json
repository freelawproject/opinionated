Detroit to Buffalo, by lake, in steamboats, which instructions were' embodied in a bill of lading sent with the wool. Although there were several lines of transportation from Detroit \u2019eastward by which the wool could have been sent, there was only one transportation line propelled by steam on the lakes-, and this line was, and had been for some time, unable, in their regular course of business, to receive and transport the freight which had accumulated in large quantities at the railroad^ depot in Detroit. This\" accumulation of freight there, and the limited ability of the line of ptopehers to receive and transport it, were well known to the officers of the road, but neither the consignor, consignee, nor the station-master at Jackson, were informed on this subject. The wool was carried over the road to the depot in Detroit, aud remained there for a period of six days, when it was destroyed by an accidental fire, not the result of any negligence on the company\u2019s part. During all the time the wool was in the depot it was <em>ready to be delivered </em>for further transportation to the carrier upon the route indicated..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-7\">In consequence of the loss the manufacturing company sued the railroad company. The.charter of the company, which was pleaded and offered in evidence, contained a section thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-8\">\u201c The said company may charge and collect a reasonable sum for storage upon all property which shall have been transported by them upon delivery thereof at any of their depots, .and which' shall have remained at any of their depots more than four days; <em>Provided, </em>that elsewhere than at their Detroit depot, the consignee shall have been notified if known, either personally hr by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>notice left at his place of business or residence, or by notice sent by mail, of the receipt of such property at least four days before any storage shall bo charged, and at the Detroit depot such notice shall be given twenty-four hours (Sundays excepted) before any storage shall be charged; but such storage may be charged after the expiration of said twenty-four hours upon goods not taken away; Provided, that in all cases the said company shall be responsible for goods .on deposit in any of their depots <em>awaiting </em>delivery, as warehousemen, and not as common carriers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-4\">. The controversy, of cours\u00e9, was as to the nature of the bailment when the fire took place. If the railroad company \u25a0were to be considered as warehousemen at the time the wool was burned, they were not liable in the action, as the fire which caused rts destruction was not the result of any negligence on their part. If, on the contrary, their duty as carriers had not ceased at the time of the accident, and there were no circumstances connected with th&lt;- transaction which lessened the rigor of the rule applicable to that employment, they were responsible; carriers being substantially insurers of the property intrusted to their care.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\">The court was asked by 'the railroad company to charge the jury that its liability was the limited one of a warehouseman, importing only ordinary care. The court refused so fo charge,- and, on the contrary, charged that the railroad company were liable for the wool as'common carriers, during its transportation, from Jackson to Detroit, and after its arrival there, for such reasonable'time as, according to their usual course of business, under the- actuarcircumstances in which they held the wool, would enable them to deliver it to the next carrier in the line, but that the manufacturing company took the risk of the. next carrier line not being ready and willing to take said wool, and \u00a1Submitted it to the jury to say whether under all the circumstances-of the case in evidence before them, such reasonable time had elapsed before the occurrence of the fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-6\">The jury, under the instructions of the court, found that the railroad company were chargeable as- carriers, and this writ of error was prosecuted to reverse.that decision.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>Mr. F. </em>Chamberlin, <em>fbr the plaintiff in error :</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-5\">1. The railroad company was not liable even by the severe rule of the common law, and independently of the proviso in their charter, and of the notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-6\">The law on the subject is thus stated by Judge Story, in his work on bailments:. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-7\">\u201c If a carrier between A. and B. receives goods to be carried from A. to B., and thence forwarded,' b}7 a distinct conveyance to C., as soon as be arrives with the goods at B. and deposits them in his warehouse there, his responsibility as <em>carrier </em>ceases, for that is the termination of his duty <em>as such.. He then becomes as to the goods a mere warehouseman, </em>undertaking for-their further transportation.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-8\">\u25a0 The language'of the same book in another place is equally pertinent and significant:<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-9\">\u201c When the goods have arrived at the place of their fixed destination arid are there deposited in the carrier\u2019s warehouse, to await the convenience of the owner in sending for them, <em>or for the purpose of being forwarded by some other carrier </em>to another place, then his duty as carrier ends on the arrival of the goods at his (the carrier\u2019s) warehouse, and his duty as. warehouseman commences.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-10\">There is no difference which is of substance to the manufacturing company between goods to be delivered to the owner at their final destination and goods deliverable to the owner or his agent for further carriage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-11\">The controlling fact is, that the plaintiff\u2019s duty <em>of carriage </em>is completed, and the goods are stored for the convenience \u25a0of the owner. \u25a0 The office of the plaintiffs is in both cases the same, the carriage is the same, and the delivery to the person entitled to receive them is the same in the one case .'as in the other. If the goods are to go farther, by an independent line, the next carrier stands in place of the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>or consignee, so far as the first carrier is concerned, and as soon as the function of carriage proper is performed, thatis, in this case, as soon as we place them in the depot \u201c ready to be delivered\u201d over,.they are <em>\u201c </em>awaiting delivery.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-4\">There was indeed, in this case, no offer to deliver, as owing to their limited means of transportation, by the line of propellers, any such offer would have beeu a useless act. <em>Lex nemi rem eogit ad vana.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-5\">If it be said that the railroad company knew of this inability of the line of-propellers aud should have not taken this wool, the answer is that as common carriers, having, themselves, ample means of carriage, the railroad company could not have declined to receive any goods to be carried so far as. their line extended; that is to say, to Detroit. They were bound to take the wool to that point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-6\">2. But if liable by the rules of the old common law, still by the very terms of the railroad company\u2019s charter, the company, while the wool should be in deposit in a depot \u201caioait<em>ing </em>delivery,\u201d was not to be responsible as common carriers, but only as warehousemen. Now, this case is that- while the wool was in the depot <em>u ready to be delivered,\u201d </em>&amp;c., it was destroyed. This brings matters within the terms of' the proviso, unless we raise a distinction \u2014 one which has no foundation in reason \u2014 between a case in which the goods are at the final terminus of their carriage, and this in which they were to be delivered to another carrier, selected by the defendant in error, for further carriage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-7\">3. Independently of this, there was. a notice, in plain terms, to the consignor, and this was the condition of the contract, that all goods aud merchandise would be at the risk- of the owners thereof, while in the company\u2019s warehouses, except such loss or injury as might arise Irom the negligence of .the agents of the company. Now, the receipt without dissent by a consignor of a bill of lading, by which the carrier stipulates against liability for loss by fire, discharges the carrier from liability for such loss.not caused by his own negligence. And in an action against the carrier, evidence is not admissible, in the absence of fraud, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>show that the consignor did not read the terms of the bill of lading.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-5\">Since the.case of <em>York Compy. </em>v. <em>Central Railroad </em>Co.,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> in this court,It can no longer be doubted that the common-law \u2022liability of a carrier for the safe carriage of goods <em>may </em>be \u2022limited .and qualified by special contract with the owner, provided that such special contract do not attempt to cover losses by negligence or misconduct.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Arc\"><em>Mr. A.

Different views have been entertained by different jurists of what the carrier is required to do when the transit is ended in order to terminate his liability, but thei\u2019e is not'this difference of opinion in relation to the rule which is applicable while the property is in process of transportation from the place of its receipt to the place of its destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">In such cases it is the duty of the carrier, in the.absence of any special contract, to carry safely to the end of his line aud to deliver to the next carrier in the route beyond. This rule of liability is adopted generally by the courts in this country, although in England, at the present time, and in some of the States of the Union, the disposition is to treat the obligation of the carrier who first receives the goods as continuing throughout the entire route. It is unfortunate for the interests of commerce that there is any diversity of opinion on such a subject, especially in this country, but the rule that holds the carrier only liable to the extent of his own route, and for the safe storage and delivery to the next carrier, is in itself so just and reasonable that we do not hesitate to give it our sanction. Public policy, however, requires that the rule should be enforced, aud will not allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>tbe carrier to escape responsibility on storing the goods at the end of his route, without delivery or an attempt to deliver to the connecting carrier. If there be a necessity for storage it will be considered a mere accessory- to the transportation, and not as changing the nature of the bailment. It is very clear that the simple deposit of the goods by the carrier in his depot, unaccompanied by any act indicating an intention to renounce the obligation of a carrier, will not change or modify even his .liability. It maybe that circumstances may arise after the goods have reached the depot which would justify the carrier in warehousing them, but if he had reasonable grounds to anticipate the occurrence of these adverse circumstances when he received the goods, he cannot by storing them change his relation towards them,</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">- Testing the case in hand by these well-settled principles, it is apparent that the plaintiff's in error are not relieved of their proper responsibility, unless through the provisions of their charter, or by the terms of the receipt which was given when they received the wool. They neither delivered nor offered to deliver the wool to the propeller company. Nor did they do any act manifesting- an intention to divest themselves of the character of carrier and assume that of forwarder.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">It is insisted that the' offer to deliver would have been a useless act, because of the inability of the line \u00f3f propellers, with their means of transportation, to receive and transport the freight which had already accumulated at the Michigan Central depot for shipment by lake. One answer to this proposition is, that the company had no right to assume, in discharge of its obligation to this defendant, that an offer to deliver this particular shipment would have been met by a refusal to'receive. ' Apart from this, how can the company set up, by way of defence, this limited ability of the propeller line when the officers of the road knew of it at the time the contract of carriage was entered into, and the other party to fhe contract had no information' on.the subject?</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">It is said, in reply to this objection, that the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>could not have refused to receive the wool,-having ample means pf carriage, although it knew the line beyond Detroit selected by the shipper was. not at the time in a situation to receive and transport it. It is true the company were obliged to carry for all persons, without favor, in the regular course' -of business,,but this obligation did not dispense with a-corresponding 'obligation ou its part to inform the shipper of any unavoidable circumstances existing at the termination of its owu route in the way of a prompt delivery to the carrier next in line. This is especially so when, as in this case, there were other lines of transportation from Detroit eastward by which the wool, without delay, could have been forwarded to its place of destination.. Had the shipper at Jhckson been informed, at the time, of the serious hindrances at Detroit, to the speedy transit of goods by- the lake, it is fair to infer, as a reasonable man, be would have given a different direction to his property. Common fairness requires that at least he-should have been told of the condition of things there, and thus left free to choose, if he saw fit, another mode of conveyance. If this had been done there would be some plausibility in the position that six days was an unreasonable time to require the railroad company to hold the wool as a common carrier for delivery. But under the circumstances of this case the company had no right to expect an earlier period for delivery, and cannot, therefore, complain of the response of the jury to the inquiry ou this subject submitted to them by the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">It is earnestly argued that the plaintiffs in error are relieved from liability under a provision contained in one section of their charter,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> if not by the rules of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">But it is quite clear, on reading the whole section, that it refers to property which has reached its final destination, and is there awaiting delivery to its owner. If so, how can the proviso in question be made to apply to another and distinct class of property? To perform.this office it must act independently of the rest of the section, and enlarge, rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>than limit, the Operation of it. This it cannot clo, unless words are used which leave no doubt the legislature intended such an effect to be given to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">It is argued, however, that there is no difference between goods to be delivered to the owner at their final destination and goods deliverable to the owner, or his agent, for further, carriage. That in both cases, as'soon as they are \u201c ready to be delivered\u201d over, they are \u201cawaiting delivery.\u201d This position, although plausible, is not sound. There is a clear distinction, in our opinion, between property in a situation to be delivered over to the consignee ou demand,' and property on its way to a distant point to be taken thence by a connecting carrier. In the former case it may be said to be awaiting delivery; in the latter, to be awaiting transportation. And this distinction is recoguized by the Supreme Court of Michigan in the case of the present plaintiffs in error against Hale.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2020The court in speaking on this subject say, \u201c that goods are on deposit in the depots of the company, either awaiting transportation or awaiting delivery, and that the section (now under consideration) has reference only to goods which have been transported and placed in the company\u2019s depots for delivery to the consignee.\u201d To the same effect' is a recent decision of the Court of Appeals of New York,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark>fin a suit brought to recover for the loss of goods by the same fire that consumed the wool in this case, and which were marked for conveyance by the same line of propellers on Lake Erie.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">It is insisted, however, by the plaintiffs in error, if they are not relieved from liability as carriers by the provisions of their charter, that the receipt taken by the consignor, without dissent, at the time the wool was received, discharges them. The position is, that the unsigned notice printed on the back of the receipt is a part of it, and that, taken together, they amount to a contract binding on the defendants in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>This notice is general, and not confined, as in the section of the charter we have considered, to goods on deposit in the depots of the company awaiting delivery. It is a distinct announcement that all goods ail'd merchandise are at the risk of the owners thereof while in the company\u2019s warehouses, except for such loss or injury as may arise from the negligence of the agents of the company. The notice was, doubtless, intended to secure immunity for all losses not caused by negligence or misconduct during the time the property remained in the depots of the company, whether for transportation on their own line, or beyond, or for delivery to consignees. And such will'be its effect if the party'taking the receipt for his property is concluded by it. The'question is, therefore, presented for decision whether such a notice is effectual to accomplish the purpose for which it was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Whether a carrier when charged upon' his common-law responsibility can discharge himself from it by special contract, assented to by the owner, is not an open question in this court since the cases of <em>The New Jersey Steam Navigation Company </em>v. <em>The Merchants\u2019 Bank,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>York Company </em>v. <em>Central </em>Railroad.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> In both\u2019these cases the right of the carrier to restrict or diminish hi's general liability by special contract, which does not cover losses by negligence or misconduct, received the sanctiou of this court. In the former case the effect of a general notice by the carrier seeking to extinguish his peculiar liability was also considered, and although the remarks of the judge on the point were not necessary to the decision of the case, they furnish a correct exposition of the law on this much-controverted subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In speaking of the right of the carrier to restrict his'obligatiou by a special agreement,.the judge said: \u201cIt' by no means follows that this can be done by an act of his own. The carrier is in the exercise of a sort of public office, from which he should not be permitted to exonerate himself without the assent of the parties concerned. And this is not to be implied or inferred from a general notice to the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>limiting his obligation, which mat', or may not, be assented to. Tie is bound to receive and carry all the goods offered for transportation, subject to all the i-esponsibilities incident to\u2019his employment, and is liable to an action in case of refusal. If any implication is to be indulged from the delivery of the goods under the general notice, it is as strong that the owner intend\u00e9d to insist upon his rights and the duties of the carrier, as it is that he asseuted to their qualification. The burden of proof lies on the carrier, and nothing short of an express stipulation by parol or in writing should be permitted to discharge him from duties which the law has annexed to his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">These considerations against the relaxation of the common-law responsibility by public advertisements, apply with equal force to notices having the same object, attached to receipts-given by carriers on taking the property of those who employ them into their possession for transportation. Both are attempts to obtain, by indirection, exemption from burdens impiosed in. the interests of trade upon this particular business. It is not only agaiust the policy of the law, but a serious'injury to commerce to allow the carrier to say that the shipper of merchandise assents to the terms proposed in a notice, whether it be general to the public or special to a particular person, merely because he does not expressly dissent from them. If the parties were on an equality in their 'dealings with each other there might be some show of reason for assuming acquiescence from silence, but in the nature of the case this equality does not exist, and, therefore,.every intendment should.be madein.favor of the shipper when he takes a receipt for his property, with restrictive conditions annexed, and says nothing, that he intends to relympou the law for the security, of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"A_l\">It can readily be seen, if the carrier can reduce his liability in the way proposed, he can transact business on any terms he chooses to prescribe. The shipper, as a general thing, is not in a condition to contend with, him as to terms, nor to wait the result of an action at law in case of refusal to carry unconditionally. Indeed such an action is seldom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>resorted to, on account of the inability of the shipper to delay sending bis goods forward. The law, in conceding to carriers the ability to obtain any reasonable qualification of Iheir responsibility by express contract, has gone as far in this direction as public policy will allow. To .relax still further the strict rules of common law applicable to them, by presuming acquiescence in-the conditions on which they propose to carry freight when they have no right to impose them, would, in our opinion, work great harm to the business cornmunitjn</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The wreight of authority is against the validity of the kind of notices we have been considering.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2020And many of the courts that have upheld them have done so with reluctance, but felt themselves bound by previous decisions. Still they have been continued, and this persistence has provoked legislation in Michigan, where this contract of carriage was made, and the plaintiffs in error have their existence. By an act of the legislature passed after the loss in this case occurred, it is declared \u201cthat no railroad company shall be permitted to change or limit its common-law liability as a common carrier by any contract or in any other manner, except by a written contract, none of which shall be printed, which shall be signed by the owner or shipper of the goods to be carried.\u201d<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">It is fair to infer that this kind of legislation will not be. confined to Michigan, if carriers continue to claim exemption from common-law liability through the medium of notices like the one presented in defence of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">These views dispose of this case, and it is not necessary to notice particularly the instructions which the court below gave to the jury. If the court erred at all it was in charging more favorably for the plaintiffs in error than the facts of the case warranted!</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-6\"> See the section, <em>supra, </em>pp. 320-321. \u2014 Rep.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-6\"> 6 Michigan, 243.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\"> Mills <em>v. </em>Michigan Central Railroad Co., 45 New York, 626.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\"> 6 Howard,! 344.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b336-8\"> 3 Wallace, 107.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-10\"> See 2 Parsons on Contracts, 238, note N, 5tb edition ; and the A merican note to Coggs <em>v. </em>Bernard, 1 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 7th American edition; Redfield Law of Railways, p. 369; McMillan <em>v. </em>M.
