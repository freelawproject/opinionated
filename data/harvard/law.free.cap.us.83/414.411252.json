C. Huckabee and three other persons, formed under the general, laws of Alabadla a corporation called \u201cThe Bibb County Iron Company;\u201d Huckabee being president, and the other corporators, directors; and, with' him, the. only stockholders. , As tbe name of the corporation indicates,-its object was the working in iron; its. particular hpachinery being such as made it capable of manufacturing cannon, and other munitions of war. \u2019'Rolling-mills were erected, and lands, slaves, and mules bought. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>When the company had thus got fairly going, the rebel government sent one of its officers to Huckabee, the presi-' dent, requiring him and the corporation to make a contract with the Confederacy, to deliver iron to it at a uniform \u00bfrice named. \u00a3The iron had been furnished at the price named, for some time before this, but no formal contract to furnish it uniformly at that price existed.] Huckabee refused to make any such contract. Finally, being sent for'again by the agents of the rebel government, he was told that the agreement under which the iron was then furnished was not a Contract, and that he must make a <em>contract. </em>He then consulted with.his stockholders, and the result was that the company refused to make any contract. - He was then sent for a third time, and told that the company must either contract on government terms, or lease the works, or sell them to. the\u2019 Confederate States, and that otherwise the works would .be impressed. The company resolved, after some weeks consideration, to sell. The influences which operated on' the owners, according to the statement of Huckabee, the presi-. dent, were these:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-4\">\u201cWe owed a large amount of money, about $300,000, and our debts were increasing. We knew tbatdf we <em>.contracted </em>we could not pay our debts and get back our capital. To <em>lea$e </em>would have been ruinous; arid as we had been informed that if we did not either contract, lease, or sell, the works would be impressed, we regarded'it best to sell. I cannot say that there could not have been other reasons influencing the minds of other corporators than'myself to join in the resolution authorizing the sale.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-5\">It appeared that during most of the time that the iron company had been in operation, a guard from the rebel army had been in control of it, so far as to see that it sent no iron away except to the rebel authorities. And moreover that the rebel powers possessed an almost despotic power over the whole body of skilful laborers in the region.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\">The sale was made, and a deed executed under the corporate seal <em>and </em>the hands of the president and all the other corporators, three in number, September 13fch, 1863. The' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>consideration was $600,000, Confederate money, which was' duly paid, and after a discharge of the corporate debts., divided among the stockholders; the persons who had executed the deed; Confederate money was at this time worth one-fourteeuth of the same amount in Federal money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-4\">The deed recited that at a meeting of all the stockholders, held on September 9th, 1863, it was .resolved unanimously that the president be authorized, for the sum of $600,000, to sell to the Confederate States all lands, negroes, mules, \u2022&amp;e., and to execute deeds of <em>warranty; </em>and that the party of the ^second part agreed to pay. the said sum for the said property, provided the <em>said stockholders united in the conveyance. </em>The deed contained full covenants of warranty. More than a month subsequently to its date, to wit, on the 25th November, 1863, it was acknowledged before the probate judge,, as having been \u201c <em>executed voluntarily on the day of Us date.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">The Confederate government from that time managed the works, .casting great quantities of cannon, shell, shot, and other-implements of war, which were used to maintain the rebellion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">-\u25a0 In March, 1865, the property was captured by the government army. It remained for a short time under the military forces, and was then taken possession of by the Treasury Department as captured and abandoned property, and the rebel confederacy having become now extinct, on the 3d of February', 1866-, after public notice, wTas sold for. $45,000 to Francis Lyon, for himself and others, by the Commissioner of the Bureau-of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned-Lands, under the authority of the President and Secretary of the Treasury. Prior to the sale Lyon went to Huckabee and asked him if the title was good. He said, he believed it was; And declined a suggestion of Lyon to take part in the contemplated purchase (which he said he would like to do),because he had not the money at the time. The sale having been made the money was paid, and a deed executed. The sale was confirmed by act of Congress, approved December 15th, 1866, which \u201c released and confirmed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Raid Lyon any-interest which, the United States , had in the land described.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-4\">Prior to all this, that is to say,' on the 1st of October, 1865, the Distript Attorney of the United Stat\u00e9s, describing himself as \u201c prosecuting for the United States and an informer,\u201d bad exhibited an information in the District Court for the Middle District of Alabama (in which the property was), against it (describing it),- \u201c said to belong to the late so-palled -Confederate State's of America,\u201d find praying process to enforce the seizure, condemnation, and confiscatibn of the .same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">This proceeding was made under the act of August 6th, 1861, whieh enacts that if during the-then existing rebellion,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOnq\">\u201cAny,person or persons . . . shall purchase, or acquire, sell, or give any property . . . with intent to use or employ the same, or suffer the same to be used and employed in aiding, abetting, or promoting such insurrection or resistance to the laws, or aD_y person or persons engaged therein, or if any person or persons being the owner or.owners of any such property, shall knowingly'use or employ, or consent to the use or employment of the same as aforesaid, all such property is hereby declared .to be. lawful subject of prize and capture wherever found; and it shall be the duty of the President of the United States to cause the same to be seized, confiscated, and condemned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-8\">\u201c The Attorney-General or any district attorney of the United States in which said property may at the time be, may institute the proceedings of condemnation, and in such case they shall be wholly for the benefit of the United States; or any person may file an information with such\u2019- attorney, in which case the proceedings shall be for the use of <em>such informer and the United States in equal iparts.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-9\">\u25a0 Things stood in this, way-from October 1st, 1865, .when this information was. filed, till the 30th vof May, 1866, when Lyon and his co-purchasers were in possession. On that' day, Huckabee aud his co-corporators in the old Bibb County Iron Company appeared as claimants of the property-aghinst whieh the information had been filed, asserting that <em>they </em>and no other persons were \u201cthe true and legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>owners\u201d of it, and that the property had not been knowingly used and employed with the .consent of the owners in aiding, abetting, and promoting the rebellion, but, on the contrary thereof, that the said property was built with the money and labor of them,-the said respondents, and for their sole use, and was never <em>voluntarily </em>employed iu the way alleged. They set up also that they had all been pardoned for alhparticipation in the rebellion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-4\">On the 24th-of October, 1866, the Assistant Attorney-General -of the United States wrote from Washington to the District Attorney iu Alabama to <em>dismiss </em>the proceedings in confiscation instituted by him, the property having been sold to Mr. Lyon by the Commissioner of the Freedman\u2019s Bureau, \u201c unless Mr. Lyon should prefer <em>that, for the purpose of securing and perfecting the </em>title, he should desire them to be continued for his own use and benefit; and in <em>that1 case the proceedings will be carried, on in the name of the United Stales, at-the cost and charges of'Mr. Lyon.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">Soon after this, that is to say, on the 26th of November, 1866, and obviously with a view of carrying out the suggestion of securing and perfecting the title in Lyon, Lyon and his .co-purchasers came forward, and were made defendants. They set out the original ownership of \u201cThe Bibb County Iron Company,\u201d the sale by it to the Confederate States, with the full knowledge of the purpose to which the property was to be applied, the capture, iu March, 1865, of the property by the Federal army, and the subsequent sale and conveyance, by authority of the United States, to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">An amended information was also filed, setting out pretty -much what was in the original one, but setting out in addition the <em>capture of the property by the forces of the United States, and the sale and. conveyance by the government to Lyon and his \u00a1Co purchasers, the act of Congress, confirming it, all fully and in form, </em>but still asking process of seizure, condemnation, and\u2019 \u2022confiscation as before.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">Lyon answered this amended information, setting out the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>history down to his deed, a copy of the deed, and a copy of the act of Congress confirming his title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-4\">.Huckabee and his co-corporators also answered this amended libel, setting up that \u201c the so-called Confederate States were not a legal government, but existed by mere force and compulsion, and that it therefore never had any capacity under the laws' of the United States 'or under the law of nations to acquire the title to landssetting up also that the deed given was executed under duress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">In this state of things the case came on for hearing, when the District Court dismissed the' libel and amended libel, and made a decree vesting the property in Huckabee and his ancient co-corporators or their assigns. From that decree the United States and Lyon and his co-purchasers appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-6\">\n<em>Mr. J. T. Morgan, in support of the decree beloio:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-7\">I. <em>The libel and amended libel were both rightly dismissed.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-8\">1. As to the amended libel. This .is no more than an effort to procure a confiscation under the statutes,of the property <em>in confirmation of the title of Mr. Lyon. </em>The original libel was by the United States and <em>an </em>informer. The amended one <em>is in reality </em>by the United States, Lyon and his co-purchasers (in the interest of him and them) against Huckabee and the original owners. The amended answer of Lyou. is but a form, au admission of and.support to the main parts of the amended libel. But the Confiscation Statutes are,war measures, and the use of their great powers and of their extraordinary process for any purpose which concerns only private interests is wholly anomalous and improper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-9\">2. As to the original libel. The amended libel shows an act of Congress approved 15th of December, 1866, by which title is declared to be in the United States and to be granted to Lyon. It destroys the case made in the original libel. No ground of confiscation by the government such as the original libel sets up can therefore exist.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-10\">3. Admitting, for argument\u2019s sake, that the process prescribed in the Confiscation Acts, could be us\u00e9d by private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>persons in the anomalous way attempted by. Mr. Lyon, still on his own .showing he and his co-purchasers (who are, in fact, complainants against Huckabee and his co-corporators) have a perfectly good title. They allege a valid sale to the Confederate government, the capture of the property by the United States, the extinction of the Confederate government, and a sale to them by the United States confirmed by 'Congress. <em>They </em>do not allege any claim by anybody, or any cloud on their title. They seek to confiscate a title w'hich, according to their own showing, has no existence whatever. If they have the perfectly good title that they allege they have, then for any disturbance to their rights they'have, of course, a full, adequate, and complete remedy at law. The fact that they may <em>really </em>feel, or even know, that they have not a good title, and are seeking through the extraordinary process of a confiscation to get one, does not alter the case, so far as this proceeding is concerned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-4\">II. <em>The relief given to Huckabee and'the original corporators was rightly granted.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-5\">\u25a01. The power of the Confederate States to acquire title to lands must depend on their being a government. No legal authority for their existence can be found. \u201c Confederate States\u201d was the name merely for certain people engaged in rebellion, a rebellion opposed by. law as well as by arms throughout the United States.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-6\">The deed therefore which was made by Huckabee and his associates passed no title to the Confederate States. There .was no- grantee; no person or legal entity to receive. The consideration was-illegal. It v\u2019as made for an illegal purpose. It conveyed lands and other property for the express purpose of assisting the military operations of the States in rebellion. It was made by' persons engaged in rebellion, contrary to the statutes of the United States prohibiting conveyances of property by s.uch persons, and the United States government, if it had the power, nefer waived this violation of law, and confirmed the title, nor did it do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>any act that could be so construed until after the surrender, and after it had proceeded in court to confiscate and condemn the lands so conveyed, setting up, in its proceeding, the making of such conveyance as the ground of forfeiture.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-4\">Congress has never admitted that the government of the United States acquired title to lands from or through the. Confederate States, either by capture, succession, or treaty. Such an admission necessarily implies that the Confederate States had enough of legal corporate capacity to hold a\u2019title' to lauds; and this fact conceded^ it must have had soveT reignty, for it did not pretend to hold lands otherwise than as a sovereign power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-5\">2. The deed was made by duress. ' It was made under such constraint as left the grantors without that freedom of choice ..and will that is essential in every contract. The owners made all the resistance they could make when they refused to contract. If they contracted, they could not pay their debts and get their capital back. If they leased they were \u201c ruined.\u201d Nothing remained but to sell or be impressed. A rebel guard was in possession of the works. They sold. Did they not sell under duress ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-6\">The American eases, including the leading one of <em>Foshay </em>v. Fergurson,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2020strongly support the doctrine that there is no sound distinction between eases of threat or mischief to property, or to the person or good name, \u201cbecause consent is of the essence of the coutract, and where there is compulsion there is no consent,\u201d and there is compulsion when one\u2019s person or property is seriously threatened with mischief, or where \u201c a man\u2019s necessities may be. so great as not-to admit of. the ordinary process of la.w, to afford hina relief. \u201d<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b429-7\">\n<em>Mr. P. Phillips, contra (for the plaintiff in error):</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amt\">Conceding that Mr. Lyon could not try the validity of this title in the way in which he sought to do it, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the libel and amended libel .were properly dismissed, how did the court, after all, pass upon the title and award the property to. the counter-claimants? If the court had no jurisdiction it ought to have dismissed the whole .case ; the libel, amended libel, and all the claims, leaving all parties just where they were originally. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-4\">\u25a0 For its deciding on the conflicting titles,\u2019its deer-ge \u2018must certainly be reversed, and the course we speak of pursued.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOl\">It is hoped, however, that the court may find fit opportunity in reversing this decree, to express its opinion on the title set up by Huckabee and others, and so give quiet to the title which the government has\u2019 conveyed to Lyon and hjs associates; and in this hope, and in reply to what has been said as to the merits of the title, we have to say:</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-5\">The facts stated do not make duress any definition of that word as given by this court in eases* *\u2021which both say the same thing, and only iterate old law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-6\">The case of <em>Foshay </em>v. <em>Fergurson.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em>i </em>relied on by the other side, and which carries this doctrine to its greatest length, 'is no support for the present case. The judge there says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-7\">\u201cI do not intend to say that a man can avoid his bond on thp ground that it was procured by an illegal <em>distress on Ms goods; </em>but I entertain no doubt that h contract procured by threats and fears of battery, or the <em>destruction </em>of property, may be avoided on the ground of duress.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-8\">In this case there was no <em>destruction </em>threatened, but only <em>impressment, </em>which may be likened-to a distress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-9\">But if'duress in fact existed this would not make the conveyance void, but voidable only, aud a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser for valuable consideration, without notice, would hold the estate against the original grantor.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-10\">And in such a transaction, if the party.'on whom the duress has .been practiced stands by and allows the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>to purchase, this will bar his right of recovery. Much less will he be permitted to recover when on inquiry made by the intended purchaser he advises him that his title is good.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-4\">.And if a party seeks to set aside his conveyance rather than to affirm it, he can only do so by a restoration of the consideration received for it.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-5\">Suppose the deed from the corporation could be avoided, for duress, this could only be done by the <em>corporation itself. </em>The corporation may and must appear by its constitutional organs or curators.

Service was made and the present defendants appeared and claimed to be the true and lawful owners of the property, and they deny in separate and distinct articles in the answer every material allegation of the information. Apart from that they also allege that they have severally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>received special pardon and full amnesty from the President for all past offences connected with the late war of the rebellion, and that they respectively have fully complied, with all the terms and conditions of the several pardons, and therefore that the property should be restored to them as the rightful owners.-</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Prior to the rebellion the'property iu question was owned by a corporation known as the Bibb County Iron Company, and it appears that the present plaintiffs, at this stage of the litigation, entered their appearance iu the suit, and being admitted to become parties and make claim, they alleged that the propert}7 belongs to them as the joint owners of the same; that the original owners sold the property to the late Confederate States for the sum of six hundred thousand dollars and then and there received payment\u2019in full for the same, and executed to the grantees a title-deed of the premises with full covenants of warranty, and that the purchasers took full possession of the property with all the appurtenances appertaining to the same; and they also aver that the grantors were fully advised of the objects and purposes for which the property was purchased, which were to furnish the grantees with iron to be used iu manufacturing arms and munitions of war to be used in prosecuting the rebellion, and 'that the same was held, used, occupied, and enjoyed by the grantees as the undisputed owners until the same was captured by our military forces, having been used throughout that period as the efficient means of furnishing iron for arms, cannon-balls, and shells; that the property was subsequently captured from the Confederate States by our. military forces and was put up and sold at public auction by the Assistant Commissioner of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, who was authorized and lawfully empowered to sell and convey the same in that manner, and that the plaintiff claimants, or one of them, in behalf of himself and the others, became the purchasers for the sum of forty-five thousand dollars, that being the highest and best bid made for the same, and that the said commissioner, being thereto duly authorized by the President and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Secretary of the Treasury* conveyed the property to the plaintiff claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Beyond doubt those allegations were entirely inconsistent with the theory of the original information, as they show' that the property, at the time the information was filed, was vested iu the grantees of the United States, by virtue of a deed duly executed, and given for a valuable consideration paid by the purchasers, who, it is admitted, have never committed any such acts of forfeiture as those charged in the information. Allegations of the kind, however, 'are no.t sufficient without proof to oust the jurisdiction, of the court. But the district attorney subsequently filed an amended information, and he also alleges that the property was captured from the Confederate States, and that the same was seized by order of the President, and that it was, by his order and that of the Secretary of the. Treasury, sold to the highest bidder as captured property belonging to the United States, and that the same was purchased* as aforesaid, by'the plaintiff claimants for the sum stated in the claim of the grantees. Such an averment in the information is sufficient proof of-the fact, as against the prosecutor, especially as he confirms the allegation by referring to the act of Congress, which provides that any interest which the United States have in the lands described in the deed . be and the same is hereby released aud confirmed to the said, gran tees.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Absolute condemnation of the property, to the United States was claimed in the first pleading, but the district attorney substantially admits, in the amended information, that no such decree can be entered, as he avers that the property is liable to condemnation, in confirmation -of the title of the grantees under the United States, which would be a proceeding wholly without precedent in the jurisprudence of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">K\u00e9sponsive to that, the present-defendants filed an amended answer excepting to the amended information y because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>appears that the United States have no longer any interest in the prosecution, as they have released their right in the property to the other claimants, and because the jurisdiction of the court is ousted as relates to the property sought to be condemned.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">It also appears that C. C. Huckabee, one of the present defendants., filed a separate answer, in which he alleges that he is the sole owner of a certain described portion of the lands mentioned in the information; and he also avers that the deed1 conveying the same to the' Confederate States; which he and his associates gave, was executed under duress, and in obedience to'the commands of ah unlawful power, which neither he nor they could resist, and that the. deed is void on that account; and he denies that the lands - were ever captured by our military forces, or that the lands were ever seized under any warrant of seizure, as alleged in the information. Hearing was had upon the merits before-the court,-the parties having waived a jury and filed a stipulation to that effect. Witnesses were exaipined and other proofs were introduced, and the court entered a decree dismissing both the original and the amended informations.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Such a decree is usually regarded as exhausting the jurisdiction of the court, except in maritime cases, where there is a fund in the registry of the court to be restored to the rightful owner, but' the court in this case proceeded to adjudge and decree that the claim of C. C. Huckabee, one of the defendants, be allowed and sustained to certain rights and privileges therein mentioned, including all the timber on a described portion of the lands, and the right of cutting and transporting the same, and that the title to the said described lands be adjudged to be in the said claimant, and that the marshal restore the possession of the said lands to the said claimant, and that the claim of all the defendants be sustained and allowed to another described portion of-the lands in controversy, including also the-right to the timber for certain purposes, and tq-the iron-ore in certain described localities; and it was also adjudged and decreed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>present plaintiffs, except the United States, should pay the costs of the suit. Exceptions were taken by the present plaintiffs to the rulings of the court and to the decree, and they sued out the present writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Evidence of the most satisfactory character, consisting of the deed signed by the corporation and by the several defendants, who owned all of the stock of the contpany, was introduced by the United States to. show that the lands and improvements in question were conveyed by the original owners to the Confederate States, and that the purchasers paid to the;grantors the agreed consideration of six hundred thousand dollars, and it appeared that they entered into full possession of the premise's and used and employed the lands and improvements for the purposes alleged in the amended information. Equally satisfactory evidence was also introduced by the United States to show that the entire property-was captured by our military forces during the Avar of the rebellion, and that the whole premises were sold under the orders of the President, as alleged, and that the same were conveyed by the commissioner who conducted the sale for the consideration of forty-five thousand dollars to the plaintiff' claimants, or to one of them, for his benefit and that of his associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Subsequent to the capture by our military forces, the possession of the lands and improvements was continued in the United .States;'until the sale and conveyance by the said commissioner to the present grantees, on the third of February, 1866, at which time they received possession of-the premises from the commissioner, and have continued in possession of the same to the present time, under an absolute deed from the commissioner, couveying to the grantees all the right, title, and interest which the United States had in the property at the time of the sale and conveyance, which conveyance has since been confirmed by an act of Congress.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AI2\">Four principal grounds are assumed by the present de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>fendants in support of the decree dismissing the informations, and the supplemental decree grautiug affirmative relief to the present defendants: (.1.) That private persons, other than'mere informers, cannot join'with the United States in prosecuting an information for the confiscation of property, nor can the United States prosecute such a suit for the mere purpose of confirming the title &lt;?f a third party: (2.) That the jurisdiction of the cofirt was ousted by the sale and conveyance of the property to the grantees in the deed from the said commissioner, it also appearing that the conveyance was subsequently confirmed by an act of Congress. (3.) Th\u00e1t the property was not subject to capture by our military forces, as the deed from the origin\u00e1l owners to the Confederate States was void, having been executed by the owners-of the property under duress. (4.) That if the grantees under the United States have a good title, .then the court below' had no jurisdiction of the case, as they have, if disturbed in their possession, a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Enough appears in the-act of Congress forbidding the owners of property to use and employ it -or to suffer, it to be used and employed for such a purpose, with their consent, .to show that the first objection is well taken, as it is made the duty of the President to cause the same to be seized, confiscated, and condemned, and the provision is that the proceedings for condemnation may be instituted by the attorney-general or by the district attorney of the proper district, and that the. proceedings instituted by those officers-\u2018.\u2018shall be wholly for the benefit of the United States;\u201d nor is the force of the objection in any degree obviated by the fact that the same section of the act provides that any person may file an information with one of those officers, and that, in that state of the case, \u201c the proceedings shall be for the use of such informer and the United States in equal parts,\u201d .as it is clear that the latter. clause of the section affords no support to the theory that private \u2019persons, other than an informer, may join with the United States in prosecuting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>such an information, or that the United States may prose-\u2019 cute such a suit for the mere purpose of confirming the title of a third party.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Informations of the kind should propound in distinct articles the causes of forfeiture, and. should aver that the same are contrary to the form of the statute in such . case \u2022 made and provided, and the rule is that inasmuch as the information is in the nature of a criminal proceeding, the allegations must conform strictly to the statute upon which it is founded, which is sufficient to show that the theory of the amended information cannot be sustained.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">2. Property owned by the United States certainly is not subject to confiscation under the information in this case, and inasmuch as it appears that the property was seized, sold, and conveyed by the order of the President, as alleged in the amended information, and that the conveyance so made has. been confirmed by an act of Congress, the second objection must also be sustained, as it must be assumed, in view of what is alleged in the information and fully proved, that the property at the time of the sale and conveyance belonged to the United States.:</p>\n<p id=\"Aaem\">3. Duress, it must be admitted, is .a good defence to a deed, or any other written obligation, if it be proved that the instrument was procured by such means* nor is it necessary to show, in order to establish such a defence, that actual violence was used, because consent is the very essence of a contract, and if there be compulsion there is no binding consent, and it is well settled that moral compulsion, such as that produced by threats to take life or to inflict great bodily harm, as well as that produced by imprisonment, is sufficient in legal contemplation to destroy free agency, without which there can be no contract, because in that state of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>there is no consent.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2020\u2021\u00a7Unlawful duressiis a good defence to a contract if it includes such degree of Constraint or danger, either actually inflicted or threatened and impending, as is sufficient in severity or apprehension to overcome the mind, and will of a person of ordinary firmness.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Decided-cases may be found which deny that contracts procured by menace of a mere battery to the person, or of trespass to lands, or loss of goods, .can be avoided on that account; as such threats it is said are not of a nature to overcome.the will of a firm and prudent man; but many other de\u00bf%ions\u2019 of high authority adopt a more liberal rule, and hold that contracts procured by threats of battery to the person, or of destruction of property, may be avoided by proof of such facts, because, in such a .case, t.h\u00e9re is nothing but-the form of a-contract without the substance.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> Positive menace of battery to the person,\u2019or of trespass to lands, or of destruction of goods, may undoubtedly be, in many cases, sufficient to \u2022\u00a1overcome the mind and will of a person entirely competent, .in all other respects, to contract, and it- is clear that a contract made under such circumstances, is as utterly without the voluntary cousent of the party menaced, as if. he were induced to sign it by actual violence; nor is the\u201d\" reason assigned for the-more stringent rule; that he should rely upon the law for redress, satisfactory, as the law may not afford him anything like a sufficient and adequate compensation for the injury.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> Much discussion of the .topic, however, is .unnecessary, as the record does not exhibit any sufficient evidence, in either point of view, to support such a defence or to warrant the court in finding for the defendants upon any such ground, which is all that need be said upon the subject, as it is obvious that that objection cannot be sustained.<footnotemark>||</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>4. Argument to show that the' court below had no jurisdiction of the case if the plaintiff claimants had a good title to the premises, is hardly necessary, as both the pleadings a'nd evidence show that they were in the possession of the lands and improvements when the prosecution, was commenced. ' Sufficient has been remarked to show that their title is a good, one as against the United States, and it is quite clear that the present defendants do not have any such standing in the pleadings in this information as- to give them the right to call it in question, as the suit is one in the name and for the benefit of the United States.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Such being the character of the suit, the mistake of the district attorney in supposing''that it might be-, prosecuted to confirm the title of the plaintiff claimants, cannot have the effect to give the court any jurisdiction of the case, much less to give the court jurisdiction to determine that the title to th\u00e9 premises is in the defendants and to eject the plaintiffs, holding under the United States, and to decree that the possession of the lands and improvements shall be- delivered to the defendants.' \"What.the district attorney expected to accomplish by continuing to prosecute the information after the seizure and sale of the property by the United States is hot perfectly certain, unless he supposed the court might treat the information as.one iu the nature of a bill in equity to remove a cloud upon the title of tlie grantees under the United States, arising from the pretence of the present defendants that the deed which they executedto the Confederate States was void as having been procured by duress. Concede that, still it is evident that it was an attempt to accomplish what the court under such a pleading had no jurisdiction to grant, as the parties interested were citizens of the same. State, and no such issue was alleged in the information, and if there had been, and the parties had been citizens of different States, it would nevertheless be clear that the court could not grant any such relief under any process founded upon the act of Congress, entitled an act to confiscate property.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark>\" Doubtless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>a bill in equity would lie, in a proper court, to remove a cloud upon their title, but it is obvious that for any encroachment upon their possessions they had a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law. They claimed title under the United States, and the record shows that the title of the United States was derived by conquest from the government of the late Confederate States. Our military forces captured the .property while it was in the possession of the Confed\u00e9rate States as means for prosecuting the war of the rebellion, and it appears that the captors took immediate possession of the property and continued to occupy it under the directions of the executive authority until the govern^ ment of the Confederate States ceased to exist and the unlawful confederation became extinct, when it was' sold by the orders of the executive- and conveyed to the plaintiff claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">All captures in war vest primarily in the sovereign, but in respect to real property, Chancellor Kent says, the acquisition by the conqueror is not fully consummated until confirmed by a treaty of peace, or by the entire submission or destruction uf the state to which it belonged,-which latter rule controls the question in the ease before the court, as the confederation having been utterly destroyed no .treaty of peace was or could be made, \u00e1s a treaty requires at least two contracting parties.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2020Power to\u2018acquire territory either by conquest or treaty is vested by the Constitution in the United .States. Conquered territory, however, is usually held as a \u25a0mere military occupation\u2019 until the fate of the nation from which it is conquered is determined, but if the nation is entirely subdued, or in case it be destroyed aud ceases to exist, the right of occupation becomes permanent, and the title vests absolutely in the conqueror.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Complete conquest, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>whatever mode it may be perfected, carries with it all the fights of the former government, or jn other words, the conqueror, by-the completion of his conquest, becomes the absolute owner of the property conquered from the enemy, nation, or state. His rights are no longer limited to mere occupation of what he has taken into his actual possession, but they extend to all the property and rights of the conquered, state, including even d\u00e9bts as well as personal and real property.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2020.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Tested by these considerations, it must be assumed for the further purposes of this investigation that the title acquired by the plaintiff claimants from the United States was a valid title, and if so, then it is clear that the court below had no jurisdiction of the cause of action alleged in .the information, as the plaintiffs, if disturbed in their possession of th\u00e9 premises, had a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law. Discussion of that rule of decision at this time, however, is unnecessary, as the whole subject was considered by this court in a recent case, to which reference is made as one em tirely applicable in principle to the case before the court..f</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Numerous exceptions were taken by the plaintiffs to the rulings of the court in admitting and rejecting evidence, several of which it is obvious were erroneous, but in the view taken of the case it is not necessary to re-examine any such questions, as the court is of the opinion that the court below had no jurisdiction to render any decree in the case upon the merits of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Usually where a court has no jurisdiction of a case, the correct practice is to dismiss* the suit, but a different rule necessarily prevails in an appellate court in case's where the subordinate court was without jurisdiction and has given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>judgment or decree for the plaintiff or improperly decreed affirmative relief to a claimant. In such a case the judgment or- decree in the court below must be reversed, else the party which prevailed there would have the benefit of such judgment or decree, though rendered by a court which had no authority to hear and determine the matter in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Decree in all thinos reversed for the want of jurisdiction in the court below, and the cause remanded with directions to dismiss the case, including the original and amended informations, and the claims of all the claimants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\"> McKinlay <em>v. </em>Morrish, 21 Howard, 346,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-5\"> 12 Stat. at Largo, 319,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\"> 14 Stat. at Large, 616.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\"> 14 Stat. at Large, 616.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-7\"> 12 Stat. at Large, 319; Confiscation Cases, 7 Wallace, 462; Jecker <em>v. </em>Montgomery, 18 Howard, 124; 2 Parsons on Shipping, 385; The Betsy, 1 Mason, 354</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\"> The Hoppet, 7 Cranch, 389; The Caroline, Ib. 500; The Charles, 1 Brockenborough, 347; The Mary Ann, 8 Wheaton, 380; 2 Parsons M.
