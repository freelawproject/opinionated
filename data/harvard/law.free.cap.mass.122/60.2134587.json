There was no evidence that the defendant obtained any passengers, and the whole time did not occupy more than from three to five minutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-6\">To prove that this was not a place assigned to the defendant, .the government offered as a witness Rufus C. Marsh, superintendent of hacks, who produced a book, which he stated to be a list of the owners of the several hackney carriages in the city, and the places assigned to them, put into, his hands by the board of mayor and aldermen, for his guidance. The first column of this book, the witness testified, contained the names of all the owners of hackney carriages in the city; and the second column contained a statement of the places assigned to them. From this book it appeared that Edward Bracket (in whose employ was the defendant) owned two coaches, Nos. 277 and 449, for which he had a license; that the stand for 277 was at the American Stable, and the stand for 449 was at No. 105 Court Street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-7\">The defendant objected to the book and the evidence of Marsh, and contended that there was upon this testimony no legal or sufficient evidence that he was not assigned to the Boston and Providence Railroad station; but the 'judge admitted the evidence, and instructed the jury that this was evidence for them to consider, as tending to show that the defendant was not assigned to Providence Street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The defendant asked the judge to rule, that the meaning of the rule was that the owner or driver should not stand in the place assigned to some other hack or to some one else, at the same locality; but the judge declined so to rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-4\">The defendant contended that there was no statute authorizing the board of mayor and aldermen to make these rules and regulations; but the judge ruled otherwise. The government contended that they were authorized by the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>19, \u00a714.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-5\">It also appeared that these rules and regulations were published once a week for two weeks in the Boston Journal, on September 24 and on October 1,1875, and in the Boston Post on September 24 and 27, 1875. The defendant asked the judge to rule that they were not properly published; but the judge ruled that, if a publication was necessary, it was sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-6\">There was no legal evidence of any laying out of Providence Street by the city, or of its formal acceptance; but a witness testified that he had known this street for twenty years to be a common thoroughfare for the public, and that the street had been paved and lighted by the city during that time, and that it had been called Providence Street during that time. To this evidence the defendant objected. But the judge admitted it, and ruled \u201cthat if the jury found that this street had been used by the public as a street for twenty years, and that the city had repaired and lighted it, and that during this time it had been known and called Providence Street, it was evidence from which the jury might infer that it had been located and dedicated to public use as a street, and that it was Providence Street.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-7\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant ah leged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b82-8\"><em>E.

This section shall not impair the rights of a city to make bylews relating to the subject.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Ames, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWz\">We have no doubt of the power of the board of aldermen to establish such a regulation, under the authority given them by the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>19, \u00a7 14. There is nothing, in the terms of that statute, that confines their powers to the making of rules as to the running of carriages in the streets; and it is manifest that the inconvenience occasioned by allowing them to stand at railroad stations, and other crowded places, might require equally minute regulations. The power to regulate is given in the most general terms, and we cannot say that the manner in which it is exercised is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">There can be no doubt that the purpose and meaning of that section is to authorize the board of aldermen to prescribe the place at which the carriage is to stand. The person having it in charge may fairly be considered as with it, within the meaning of the rule, although for the time being he may be inside of the passenger station of a railroad, or in the act of soliciting passengers at a place out of sight of, and remote from, his carriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">With regard to the testimony of the superintendent of such carriages, it appears that the book placed in his hands for his official guidance was prepared for his use by the board of aider-men, and purports to contain a list of the names of the owners of such carriages in the city, and a specification of the places assigned to them respectively. This, being the act of the board, was certainly competent evidence of an assignment of places, and might properly be considered by the jury as having a tendency to show that the defendant was not assigned to the place at which his carriage was found, but elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The court rightfully refused to rule that the meaning of the regulation was merely that one carriage should not occupy the place which had been assigned to another. So narrow a construction would be contrary to the plain language of the section. The objection founded upon an alleged insufficiency of publication is also untenable. The rules had been published more than the one week required by the statute in two newspapers published in the city. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>19, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">There was no evidence of the laying out of Providence Street by the city, or of its formal acceptance; but enough was proved to make it certain that the city would be responsible for its eon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>dition, and liable in damages to any traveller upon it who should suffer any injury through any defect or want of repair, rendering it unsafe and inconvenient. It was shown to have been a common thoroughfare for the public for twenty years', and to have been known as Providence Street during that time. This evidence, though not conclusive, was admissible. <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Tisbury, </em>5 Gray, 73. <em>Fall River Print Works </em>v. <em>Fall </em>River, 110 Mass. 428. The instruction given to the jury, that upon this evidence the jury would have a right to infer that it had been located and dedicated to the public use as a street, could not be sustained, if the term \u201c dedicated \u201d were to be taken in its strictly legal and technical sense, as defined in <em>Hobbs </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>19 Pick. 405, and other cases in which that subject has been considered. We do not understand the presiding judge to have used the term in that sense. The words \u201clocated and dedicated\u201d are not used disjunctively, as if to import that the way might have become a public street, either by location under the statute, or by dedication. On the contrary, the two terms are used in such a manner and connection as to indicate rather that they were substantially equivalent or synonymous expressions, and that the meaning of the instruction is the same as if the jury had been instructed that upon the evidence it would be competent for them to find that the way had been located and appropriated to the public use. It by no means imports of necessity a dedication by a private proprietor, within the meaning of the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>43, \u00a7 82. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
