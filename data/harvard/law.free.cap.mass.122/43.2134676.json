Marshall, all of said Boston, on the sixteenth day of March, in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five, at Boston aforesaid, with wicked intent to cause it falsely to appear of record that one Roderick D. Richardson was lawfully married to said Maud, and with intent to injure said Richardson thereby, and to prevent said Richardson (he, said Richardson, then and ever since being an unmarried man) from contracting any marriage, except with said Maud, and with intent to cheat and defraud, unlawfully and wickedly did combine, conspire, confederate and agree together that said Marshall should then and there apply in person to Nicholas A. Apollonio, the registrar of births, deaths and marriages, duly appointed and qualified, in said city of Boston, to record all facts concerning marriages, and should falsely represent to said registrar that he, said Marshall, was said Roderick D. Richardson, (said Richardson then being a citizen of said Boston, other than said Marshall,) and should, in the office of said registrar in said Boston, give notice and state that said Richardson and said Maud were both then residents of said Boston, and that said Richardson and Maud then intended shortly to be joined in marriage at said Boston, and should request and obtain from said registrar the certificare of said notice in such case required by law to be given by said registrar; that hereafter at said Boston, said Butterworth (he, said Butter-worth, being then and there a justice of the peace for said county of Suffolk, duly commissioned and qualified) .should falsely, and before, and without any marriage between said Maud and said Richardson, write a certain certificate and writing under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the hand of and signed by him, said Butterworth, as such justice, purporting to be a copy of a truthful and genuine record of a marriage, therein falsely to be alleged to have been solemnized by said Butterworth, as such justice at said Boston, between said Richardson and said Maud, pursuant to said notice, and said certificate to be obtained from said registrar in manner and form as aforesaid; and that said Douglass and Ingraham should thereupon falsely and publicly pretend to have been present at such marriage as witnesses thereto; and that said Maud should thereupon, without the knowledge of said Richardson, cause to be delivered such copy of record of marriage (signed by said Butterworth, as aforesaid) to said registrar, at his said office, for record, as and for a true and genuine copy of a truthful and genuine record of marriage, and that thereafter said Maud should publicly assume to be the wife of said Richardson, and that the said Butterworth, Douglass, Ingraham and Marshall should declare such assumption to be just and true within their own knowledge; and the jurors aforesaid, upon their oath aforesaid, do further present that then and there, in pursuance of said conspiracy and agreement, said Marshall did then and there apply to said registrar and give said notice, and then and there pretend to be said Richardson, and did then and there receive such certificate of said notice from said registrar; and said Butter-worth did thereafter, to wit, on said day, at said Boston, as such justice, write and sign such false copy of record as and for a true certificate and copy of a truthful record of marriage, and said Douglass and Ingraham did then and there publicly declare themselves to have been witnesses of such marriage, and said Maud did thereafter cause said writing, signed by said Butter-worth, to be duly entered and recorded in the office of said registrar, at said Boston; and said Maud did thereafter public'y say and aver falsely, that she, said Maud, was the lawful wife of said Richardson, and said Butterworth, Douglass, Ingraham and Marshall did declare the same to be true as of their own knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-4\">\u201c Whereas, in truth and in fact, said Marshall then and there was not Roderick D.

And so the jurors aforesaid, upon their oaths aforesaid, do say that said Butter-worth, Marshall, Ingraham, Douglass and Waterman, at said Boston, on said sixteenth day of March, did unlawfully combine, conspire, confederate and agree together, by the means and in form aforesaid, to cause said Richardson falsely to appear of record to be married to said Maud, against the law, peace and dignity of said Commonwealth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-4\">In the Superior Court, before the jury were empanelled, the defendants Waterman and Marshall, who alone were tried, moved tg quash the indictment, for the following reasons: \u201c 1. Ro common purpose is alleged against the defendants. 2. Ro common and unlawful purpose is alleged against the said defendants; and no unlawful purpose is alleged; and no criminal object is alleged. 3. It does not appear from said indictment that the acts alleged, or any of them, were unlawful and criminal acts, and no unlawful and criminal act is alleged. 4. It does not aver that the defendants performed the acts alleged for the purpose of effecting any wrong or injury to any person, or class of persons, or for the purpose of effecting any wrong or injury whatever. 5. It does not aver that the acts alleged to have been performed did result in any wrong or injury to the public, or to any person or persons. 6. The purpose alleged, and the acts alleged, and as alleged, are insufficient to sustain any charge of conspiracy cognizable by the laws of this Commonwealth. 7. The indictment sets forth no illegal means agreed upon, or concerted by the parties, and does not charge a conspiracy to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>a criminal act, or effect an object by any criminal means; and the allegations respecting the purpose and object and means are insufficient, and insufficiently stated. 8. The indictment is uncertain, indefinite, insufficient, and bad for duplicity, and does not set forth any criminal offence. 9. There is no allegation that Nicholas A. Apollonio had lawful authority to issue marriage certificate, or the certificate which is alleged to have been issued by him. 10. There is no sufficient averment that said Butterworth was\u2022 authorized to solemnize a marriage, and had legal authority so to do.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\">Aldrich, J., overruled the motion. The defendants were then tried, and a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows, was allowed :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">Nicholas A. Apollonio testified that he was the city registrar of Boston, and produced the records of his office, showing that on March 13,1875, a marriage license was issued to Roderick D. Richardson and Maud M. Waterman, both of Boston, (a notice of intention of marriage having been given on the same day,) and also the certificate of marriage between them, which recited that Roderick D.

M.; that said Maud, Richardson and Butterworth were there; that she asked Maud to put on the white dress, and they went up-stairs, and Maud put the dress on, and with the witness returned to her room, where Ingraham, Butter-worth and Richardson were ; that the witness made the remark that she looked well enough for a bride. She further testified that no ceremony of marriage took place on that occasion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">The government asked the witness to state conversations which took place between herself and the defendant Butter-worth before March 16, to all of which the defendants objected; but the judge admitted them as the admissions of fellow-conspirators; whereupon the witness said that some time before March 16, Butterworth told her that he wanted her to meet said Maud; that at that time she was a stranger to her; that Butter-worth said they wanted to get up a marriage ; that only the witness and Butterworth were then present; that Butterworth said he was going to get a commission as justice of the peace, and would have the marriage in another county ; that several weeks before March 16, the witness, together with Maud, Butterworth and Ingraham, went to the house of the defendant Marshall, at Boston Highlands, when she and Maud left the room, when Marshall saw Butterworth and Ingraham; that after this date she met Butterworth at the Tremont House in Boston, when the plan was talked over as agreed upon, which was finally carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>out on March. 16, 1875, in the room of the defendant Waterman, and that it was agreed that she and Ingraham should pretend tc be witnesses to the marriage which was to be pretended ; that she signed the certificate of marriage, and voluntarily, with fuh knowledge of what it was and of what she was doing, and that afterwards she had always declared that it was a true certificate, and had declared that the marriage did take place, and that she witnessed it; that she never made any other statement until after she had been for some time in jail under arrest on this indictment, and about two weeks before she was bailed out through a detective, by order of the district attorney, when she first made a different statement to the detective ; that she had before that time spoken to many persons about the matter of the marriage, and that she had always declared that she did witness the marriage and that the certificate was true; that she had no acquaintance whatever with Marshall, except as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-4\">Chase Philbrick testified that he was one of the state detective force, and was with detective Pinkham when he arrested Marshall ; that he, Philbrick, had a conversation with Marshall in Montreal; that Marshall asked him if we had a case against him, and said there was nothing in the case, and that when he was arrested in Newburyport by Pinkham, he arrested him on something no better. He said all he told Pinkham was, that he went and got a license for Miss Waterman for a marriage; but he said he gave his own name and did not conceal anything. He said, \u201c I suppose you fellows wanted me for something that I have known rather than what I have done.\u201d He said he did not represent anybody but himself when he got the license.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">Hollis C.

The witness further testified that he was informed and employed on this case as early as July, 1875 ; that he went and saw the defendant Maud and talked with her about it as early as July; that she said she would see Richardson with him, and declare in his presence the truth of the fact that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>married, as certified in the certificate; and that she did after-wards meet Pinkham and Richardson, at the house of Mrs. Shorey, on Chapman Street, and did declare that the marriage svas true; that Pinkham, in July and August, 1875, saw said Buttervzorth and said Ingraham several times about the matter of the marriage, and also Douglass; that Ingraham and Butter-worth remained in Boston until the last of October, 1875, when they left the State on account of other troubles that threatened them, and Pinkham had not seen them since, and did not know where they might be found; that Pinkham had all of the knowledge about this in July and August, 1875, that he now has except what has since been told him by Douglass. This witness further produced a letter which he said Marshall had admitted to him to be his writing, and it was admitted by the judge as a standard of his handwriting. Marshall, in his testimony, moreover, admitted it to be his writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-4\">Daniel E. Richardson testified that he was a brother of Roderick, and that he had received a letter, which was shown to him, and which was offered in evidence, and to which the defendants objected; but the judge admitted it, the government offering to produce evidence (which was subsequently given) tending to show that the letter was written by the defendant Marshall.

The counsel then offered to show the statements and declarations made to Marshall at the interview which took place in pursuance of what was said by Butterworth at the house of Marshall; but it was objected to, and the judge excluded it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-4\">Marshall also testified that he did not write, and knew nothing whatever about, the letter produced by D. E. Richardson; that he never had any conversation whatever with any person about the matter of the marriage of Richardson and Maud, except that she and Butterworth requested him to go to the city hall, or get the license for her, until after the time of the marriage. On cross-examination, Marshall testified that he said to officer Pinkham that a woman in Maine, named Wilson, knew about this marriage ; and he testified that he learned this from a man named J. J. Jones, who boarded with him at the Merrimack House, in Newburyport, Massachusetts, for a considerable time in the summer of 1875, and was engaged in silver mining in Ncwburyport, and whom he heard speak of this marriage several times in said hotel. He also, upon cross-examination, admitted that a certain letter was received by him in Montreal, and was written by his housekeeper, who was intimately acquainted with his affairs, and he admitted that the remark as to disguise and a photograph referred to this case.

The main purpose, with the means agreed to be employed in its accomplishment, make the agreement of the parties, to do the things charged by concerted action, criminal. It is not always essential that the acts contemplated should constitute a criminal offence, for which, without the element of conspiracy, one alone could be indicted. It is the combination of two or more to do something unlawful, either as a means or as an ultimate end, which constitutes the crime; and many acts not punishable by indictment have been held to come within this definition. It is said to be sufficient if the end proposed, or the means to be employed, are by reason of the power of the combination, particularly dangerous to the public interests, or particularly injurious to some individual, although not criminal. Thus a conspiracy to cheat by false pretences without false tokens, when a cheat by such pretences by one person was not punishable, was held indictable in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Boynton, cited in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>Thach. Crim. Cas. 609, 640. So it is an indictable conspiracy for a man and woman to marry by the use on the part of the man of the name of another, for the purpose of raising a specious title to the estate of the person whose name is assumed; and it is for the jury to say whether there was an intention to do a future injury to him. <em>The King </em>v. Robinson, 1 Leach, (4th ed.) 37. And so to persuade a young woman, by false representations, to leave the protection of her parents\u2019 house with a view to facilitate her prostitution; <em>Rex v. </em>Grey, 9 How. State Trials, 127; or to procure by false means \"he recognition upon the stock exchange of stock in a company not genuine ; <em>The Queen </em>v. Aspinall, 1 Q. B. D. 730; or to secure the election of certain persons as directors of an insurance company by issuing false policies. <em>State </em>v. Burnham, 15 N. H. 396. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>4 Met. 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">It is charged that the main purpose of the defendants in this case was to cause a marriage between certain parties falsely to appear of record. This, if successful, would directly tend to impair the value of a public record, necessary for the security of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the marriage relation, and the protection of the important rights arising therefrom and, if this were the only charge made, the prosecution might well be maintained, within the rule above stated. But the corrupt agreement in this case embraces the unlawful means which were to be used, as well as the unlawful end to be attained.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">It is, among other things, averred in substance that the defendants, with intent as above stated, and with further ir tent to defraud, unlawfully conspired together that one of them should give notice of an intended marriage to the city registrar, falsely representing himself to be one of the parties named therein, and should obtain the certificate of notice required in such cases; and that thereupon another of the defendants, who was a justice of the peace, should falsely issue a marriage certificate, to be delivered for record and to be recorded by the city registrar, as a true certificate of an actual marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">It is well established that, when an unlawful conspiracy is entered into, all acts done by any of the parties in pursuance of the combination, although done separately and apart from the others, are in law the acts of all. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. O'Brien, 12 Cush. 84. All the defendants would be criminally liable for the criminal act or acts of any one or more of the conspirators, and it is enough to support the prosecution if any one act contemplated is of this description.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The statutes provide that the record of a marriage kept by the person before whom the marriage is solemnized, or by the clerk or registrar of any city or town, shall be received in all courts as presumptive evidence of such marriage. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>106, \u00a7 21; <em>c. </em>21, \u00a7 6. They further provide that whoever falsely makes or utters a public record, or a certificate of a justice of the peace or other public officer, in relation to a matter wherein such certificate may be received as legal proof, with intent to injure or defraud any person, shall be punished, in like manner as the making and uttering a forged instrument is punished. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>162, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">It cannot be doubted that the making and issuing a false certificate of marriage by a justice of the peace, if not indictable, would at least justify impeachment and removal from office and it is enough to support this indictment that one- of the acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>contemplated as a means by these defendants would lead to such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The defendants\u2019 exceptions to the admission and rejection of evidence at the trial are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The conspiracy alleged necessarily required proof of the false and fraudulent character of the record, which is at most only presumptive proof of the marriage. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>106, \u00a7 21. Richardson was, therefore, properly allowed to state that he was never married to the person named, and that no marriage ceremony was ever performed between him and her. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Norcross, 9 Mass. 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">There is nothing to show that the government witness Douglass was not properly allowed to state the conversations had with one of the defendants, involving, by way of admission, the guilt of others. The order in which testimony is adduced is largely in the discretion of the court; and whether a <em>prima facie </em>case had then been made out against the parties to be affected or not, it is enough that upon the whole case, independently of the evidence objected to, there was sufficient to justify the inference that they were parties to the conspiracy. For the same reasons the letter written by Marshall under a feigned name was properly admitted, upon the offer of evidence subsequently produced that it was written by him. The contents of the letter were admissible as showing a corrupt motive on the part of the writer nd as an admission that there was no legal marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The letter to the defendant Marshall from his housekeeper, produced and admitted on his cross-examination to have been received in Montreal, advising him for the purpose of this case to disguise himself, in view of the fact that the writer was intimately acquainted with his affairs, was properly admitted in evidence as showing Marshall\u2019s relation to the case and his means of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The court gave full instructions, not excepted to, on all the questions of law involved in the case. The instructions requested, so far as they were refused, were properly refused. The fact that Richardson had lived with the defendant Waterman and had held her out as his wife, would not make the purpose of the alleged conspiracy less criminal and unlawful There was evidence sufficient to support the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
