Andrews \u201d \u201c in the cellar of a certain one and a half story wooden house \u201d occupied by said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Andrews \u201c as a storehouse for intoxicating liquors,\u201d with intent to sell the same in violation of law, and that one of the complainants \u201c on oath say, that I have reason to believe and do believe, that intoxicating liquors, such as is above mentioned, has been sold in the house above mentioned by the occupant of said house, or with the consent and permission of the occupant of said house, or have\" been taken from the said house for the purpose of being sold contrary to law, within one month next before this day, and that said liquor above mentioned is now kept m said house for sale by said Andrews contrary to law; and that my\" belief is founded on the following facts and circumstances : that I have been informed by credible persons that intoxicating liquors have been conveyed from said house for the purpose of being unlawfully sold within one month last past.\u201d The warrant issued on this complaint recited the averments of the complaint, and directed the officer \u201c to enter the cellar of the house herein above described,\u201d and make search, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-4\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Rockwell, J., the government proved that the liquors complained against were kept in the cellar of the dwelling-house in which said Andrews, who appeared as claimant, resided with his family, and introduced evidence tending to prove that the same were kept by him with intent to sell the same in violation of law. The claimant asked the judge to rule that the proof did not authorize the confiscation of the liquors under the complaint. The judge declined so to rule, and instructed the jury that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the liquors were kept by the claimant with intent to sell the same in violation of law, they should return a verdict against the liquors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\">The jury returned a verdict that said intoxicating liquors were kept with intent to sell as charged in the complaint; and the claimant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-6\"><em>I.

But it has been decided under the St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>415, \u00a7\u00a7 45, 66, now repealed, that such allegation is not necessary; that, under the provisions of those two sections construed together, a dwelling-house, used exclusively as such, might be searched, if the oath or affirmation provided in \u00a7 45, and in the form annexed to \u00a7 66, was added; and that a tavern, store, grocery, eating room or place of common resort kept therein, might be searched without such oath or affirmation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v <em>Intoxicating </em>Liquors, 108 Mass. 19. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating </em>Liquors, 110 Mass. 182. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, </em>116 Mass. 27. The language of the St. of 1876, <em>c. </em>162, \u00a7\u00a7 2,17, and of the forms annexed to \u00a7 17, are, so far as applicable to this inquiry, in substance the same as in the sections referred to in the St. of 1869. The complaint in this case follows the form prescribed in \u00a7 17, including the oath required by \u00a7 2, and the cases above cited are decisive of the question raised. See also <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Seagrave, </em>11 Gray, 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The allegation in the complaint and warrant is not that the liquors were kept and deposited in a building occupied by the claimant as a storehouse; but in the cellar of a one and a half story wooden house, occupied by him as a storehouse. The proof was they were kept in the cellar, and there was no variance. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, </em>6 Allen, 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
