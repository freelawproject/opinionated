Sts. <em>e. </em>7, \u00a7 29, alleging \u201c that the city of Salem is a municipal corporation duly established by the laws of said Commonwealth, in said county of Essex, and that on the fourteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five, a meeting of <em>i </em>he qualified voters of the various wards of said city of Salem, for the election of mayor, aldermen and members of the common council, and other municipal officers, having been duly warned and called according to law, was then and there holden, the same then and there being the regular annual municipal election,\u201d and that the defendant, \u201cat Ward One in said Salem, on said fourteenth day of said December, at the election aforesaid, did wilfully, fraudulently, knowingly and designedly give in more than one ballot and list of persons then and there to be elected and chosen into said offices, at one time of ballotting at the choice and election aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-4\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Gardner, </em>J., it appeared that, by the charter of the city of Salem, all elections were to be held in each of the six wards of the city, and that there was no general election of the voters of the city at any one place. Evidence was offered by the government tending to show that at an election held in Ward One in the city of Salem, at the time alleged in the indictment, the defendant wilfully, fraudulently, knowingly and designedly deposited seven ballots in the ballot box. The defendant objected to this evidence, upon the grounds that the indictment did not set forth any offence, that there was no allegation in the indictment that there was any election held in any of the existing wards in the city of Salem, and that there was no allegation that Ward One in Salem was one of the various wards of the city of Salem set forth in the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\">The judge admitted the evidence, and ruled that the indictment sufficiently set forth the offence of illegal voting in Ward One in the city of Salem.

The indictment avers that a meeting of jfehe qualified voters of the various wards of the city of Salem, for the election of municipal officers, was holden on a certain day, \u201c the same being then and there the regular annual municipal election.\u201d But as the charter of the city of Salem, and the various statutes in amendment thereto, are public acts, the court will judicially take notice that the municipal officers of the city of Salem are elected by the citizens, meeting and voting in wards. As a matter of literal exactness, it would have been more correct to have alleged that \u201c meetings \u201d of the voters of the various wards were held on that day, instead of describing it as \u201c a meeting \u201d in the singular number. It appears to us a sufficient allegation that the voters met in their respective wards, and that a meeting was held on that day in each of the wards. The expression \u201c at Ward One in said Salem, at the election aforesaid,\u201d is a sufficient averment that Ward One was one of the \u201c various wards \u201d that had already been mentioned. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
