In May, 1872, the libellant became suspicious, from various indications, that her husband had contracted a venereal disease ; upon being charged with having been unfaithful to her, he admitted it, in general terms, to be true; and it was proved that he had such a disease about that time, that he did not contract it from her, and that he had had adulterous connection with some other woman or women. The parties continued to live under the same roof, but, except on two or three occasions, occupied separate sleeping rooms, until August 6, 1875, at which time they separated, and ever since have con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>tinned separate. It was proved that, several times between the two dates above mentioned, they had occupied the same sleeping apartment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-4\">The libellant, when she discovered the condition her husband was in, in 1872, had no knowledge of the particulars as to his adultery, either as to time or place, or as to the person or persons with whom he had committed that crime, or as to the frequency or infrequency of his misconduct in that respect; and she was not informed and had no knowledge whatever upon that subject, except what she could infer from the existence and the nature of the disease and his confession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-5\">The judge found as a fact in the case, that the libellee had also been guilty of adultery in the years 1868 and 1869; but this faqt was not known to the libellant till after the libel was filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-6\">The judge ruled that the evidence warranted the finding, and found as a fact, that there had been a condonation by the libellant of her husband\u2019s adultery, including that which occurred in 1868 and 1869, and that she was not entitled to a divorce. The libellant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b444-7\"><em>H. H.

When sufficient grounds for the inference are presented in the facts proved in their ordinary effect upon the mind, such knowledge is presumed. <em>Anon. </em>6 Mass. 147. But forgiveness of one act is not forgiveness of other acts of which the forgiving party had neither knowledge nor reasonable ground of belief; nor does readiness to forgive a single offence imply willingness to forgive a life of profligacy. Whether the condonation in any given case is to be confined to one or more acts, or is to have a broader effect so as to include all past offences, is a question to be decided by the language and conduct of the parties, in view of the facts then known or reasonably suspected by the forgiving party. <em>Durant </em>v. <em>Durant, </em>1 Hagg. Eccl. 733. <em>D\u2019Aguilar </em>v. <em>D\u2019Aguilar, </em>1 Hagg. Eccl. 773, 786. It is not necessary, when the terms of the condonat'on indicate an intention to forgive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>without inquiry, all previous injury, that there should he actual knowledge of each distinct offence; it is enough if full forgiveness is granted upon well founded belief. <em>Keats </em>v. Keats, 1 Sw. &amp; Tr. 334, 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">In the case at bar, the libellant knew that her husband had been unfaithful. Upon her discovery of a venereal disease contracted by him, he admitted to her in general terms his want of fidelity. It does not appear that she made inquiries as to particulars of time, place or person with whom the offence was committed; nor does it appear that he refused to disclose how long his unfaithfulness had continued, or of how many acts it consisted. It is not claimed that any falsehood or concealment was practised upon her after the discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"AIz\">There is some evidence in all this that the wife, taking for granted the worst kind and degree of unfaithfulness in her husband, and forbearing to inquire into its details or extent, chose at once to forgive it all. When the knowledge of the adultery is general, and not of any particular act, and the forgiveness is general, it cannot be applied to any one act more than to all.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The justice of this court before whom the case was tried found as a fact that there had been a condonation by the wife of the adultery charged- in her libel, and that she was not entitled to a divorce. There was evidence sufficient to warrant this finding. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
