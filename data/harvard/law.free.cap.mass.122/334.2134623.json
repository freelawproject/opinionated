There was also evidence that on another occasion, during the same period, a carriage containing a man and some women stopped in front of this house; that the man went in, and soon came out with a pitcher and some glasses, and to an inquiry if he had some water, replied that he had something better. It also appeared that this house was located on the highway to Brighton, and that during the same period drovers had frequently been seen to stop and go into this place, leaving their cattle in the street, and come out in a few minutes. The house was a dwelling-house. This was all the evidence offered by the government, and no objection was made to its admissibility.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-4\">The defendant offered no evidence, but asked the judge to rule that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction.
