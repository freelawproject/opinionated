The plaintiff contended, and asked thu judge to rule, that the law would imply a promise to pay him, and offered to show a custom and usage in the defendant town and in other towns in Massachusetts to pay such officers a reasonable compensation for their services. The judge ruled that such evidence was immaterial, and that the plaintiff could not recover for his services. The defendant assented that the plaintiff might have a verdict for the amount of his expenses while rendering such services, and the jury, under the direction of the iudge, returned a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount of such expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-5\">The judge reported the case, by agreement f parties, for the determination of this court.

Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>8, \u00a7 23 ; <em>c. </em>64, \u00a7 5. St. 1867, <em>c. </em>130, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">For official services of the selectmen for which no compensation has been provided by statute, or by express contiact or vote of the town, no payment can be recovered; and the evidence offered in this case, of a practice in the same or other towns to pay for like services, affords no proof of such a general and lawful usage as will establish a legal liability. <em>Sikes </em>v.
