Trial in the Superior Court, before Pitman, J., who reported the case, after verdict, for the consideration of this court, in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-7\">The only question made at the trial was, whether there had been a breach of the recognizance upon the following facts: The debtor applied to a proper magistrate to take the oath for the relief of poor debtors, and due notice was given to the creditor to appear on June 22,1875. That meeting was duly adjourned to July 8, 1875, and thence to July 15, 1875, when charges of fraud were filed by the creditor, pursuant to the provisions of the statute; and on the same day the respective parties entered into and filed with the magistrate the following agreement in writing: \u201c It is agreed that the decision in this case shall turn upon the charges of fraud solely.\u201d The hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>was then continued, hy successive adjournments, to November 27,1875, at 9 o\u2019clock in the forenoon, at which time the creditor and his counsel, and also the counsel for the debtor, were present, but not the debtor himself, and the debtor\u2019s counsel thereupon moved for a continuance, which the magistrate refused. At the expiration of the hour, the creditor moved for the debt- or\u2019s default, and simultaneously the debtor\u2019s counsel made a motion in arrest of judgment, and filed the same. The debtor was defaulted, and the motion in arrest of judgment was continued for hearing by the magistrate to December 3. On December 1, a motion was filed by the debtor, supported hy affidavits, to take off the default. On December 3, this and the motion in arrest were continued for hearing to December 9, and thence to December 10, neither the creditor nor his counsel appearing subsequently to the default. On December 10, the magistrate decided to remove the default, and adjourned the meeting to December 11, 1875, in order to give special notice thereof to tne creditor, which was done, when the debtor duly appeared, and, the plaintiff making no appearance at the end of the hour, the magistrate administered the oath and discharged the debtor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-4\">Upon these facts, the judge directed a verdict for the defendant. If the magistrate had jurisdiction and authority to discharge the debtor at the time, the verdict was to stand; otherwise, the verdict was to he set aside, and judgment rendered for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-5\"><em>M. </em>Fischacher, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-6\"><em>W.
