Trial in the Superior Court at April term 1876, before Brigham, C. J., who, by consent of parties and before verdict, reported the case for the determination of this court upon the question whether the evidence reported was competent and sufficient to sustain the demandant\u2019s title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-7\">At October term 1876, the demandant moved for leave to become nonsuit as of right, without notice to the tenant, and Gardner, J., granted the same as of course, and a nonsuit was entered. Afterwards at the same term, the tenant objected thereto, and moved that the nonsuit be stricken off, which motion the judge refused to grant, upon the ground that the demandant was entitled to become nonsuit as of <em>right; </em>and the tenant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-8\"><em>I.

In the present case, the trial having been begun, and the question of law reserved at the trial being still undisposed of, the ruling by which the demandant was allowed to become nonsuit as of right and of course, against the objection of the tenant, and without any exercise of discretion on the part of the court, was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">In <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Merrimack Manuf.
