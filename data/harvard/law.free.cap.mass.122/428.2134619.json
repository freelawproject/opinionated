At the hearing before <em>Colt, </em>J., it appeared that the petitioner, a resident of Charlestown, in the State of New Hampshire, was arrested on March 20, 1877, and was now held, by a deputy of the sheriff of Suffolk, upon an execution issued upon a judgment of this court against him, in favor of a citizen of the Commonwealth, while he was in attendance as a witness in his own behalf before a joint committee of the Legisature, having petitioned for the allowance of a claim made by him against the Commonwealth; that his claim had been presented to the committee, and was under discussion on that day while he was present; that its further consideration had been adjourned to March 22,1877; and that as he was leaving the state-house, and after he had got into the street, he was arrested on the execution. It also appeared that the petitioner had not been summoned as a witness, but the judge found that he was in attendance in good faith, solely for the purpose of presenting and proving his claim, and with the intention of returning home without unnecessary delay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>The petitioner contended that he was exempt from arrest and was entitled to his discharge.

Const. Mass. <em>c. </em>1, \u00a7 3, arts. 10,11. It is provided by statute that senators and representatives, acting as members of a committee of the Legislature, may administer oaths to persons examined before the committee. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>2, \u00a7 20. Each house may exercise the power of summoning witnesses, and of examining witnesses so summoned, or who voluntarily appear, by means of committees, and may punish such witnesses, as for a contempt, if they refuse to testify. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>14 Gray, 226. And there can be no doubt that the privilege from arrest of parties and witnesses, attending either house or its committee, is the same as of those attending any strictly judicial tribunal. Cush.
