As to the suit of Elizabeth C. Wadman against said Emerson, we find that said Emerson is indebted in said suit to said Elizabeth in the full sum specified in the memorandum note and interest declared on, running to W. B.

Wadman recover of the said Henry Emerson the sum of two thousand dollars damages, and forty-seven dollars forty cents costs of suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">The errors assigned were the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\">\u201c 1. That the said Superior Court had no power or authority to enter judgment against your petitioner upon an award made under a submission not under rule of court, without the assent of all parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-7\">\u201c 2. That said court had no power or authority to enter judgment upon an award made under a submission to arbitrators in favor of Elizabeth C. Wadman alone; said submission, by its terms, covering and embracing controversies between parties other than the said Elizabeth C. and your petitioner, and not named in the record of said suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-8\">\u201c 3. That the court erred in entering judgment in favor of said Elizabeth C., upon an instrument not negotiable, payable to William B. Wadman, and upon which no action could be brought except in the name of said William B. Wadman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-9\">\u201c 4. The award is uncertain and not final, inasmuch as it does not contain any statement or allusion to other controversies and disputes embraced in said submission, or whether the same were considered or passed upon by said arbitrators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-10\">'* 5.

Hobbs, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-12\">N. <em>B. </em>Bryant, for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b407-13\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Apu\">Whether the first or the second count, each alleging that the note mentioned therein, though in terms payable to the plaintiff\u2019s husband, was in fact payable to her, could be sustained, need not be considered; because the third count Was clearly sufficient, and all three were alleged to be for the same cause of action. The submission to arbitration did not oust the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, and in terms looked to a disposition of the suit after the award should be returned. The judgment does hot appear to have been rendered upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>ft ward, but upon the default of the defendant, and for a less sum than was alleged in the third count to be due to the plaintiff; and the remitting by the plaintiff, in accordance with the award, of part of \u25a0 the sum which she might have recovered, did not make the judgment erroneous. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
