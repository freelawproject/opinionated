At the trial in the Superior Court, before Grardner, J., the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, and the defendant tendered a bill of exceptions, the material parts of which were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">The defendant offered evidence tending to show that he did not order the goods, but that the contract was made by George W. Meserve with the plaintiffs, who did business in Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-6\">The plaintiffs contended that Meserve was of such pecuniary credit at the time of the sale that they would not have sold the goods to him, and, for the purpose of showing that Meserve\u2019s credit was not good at that time, offered as a witness one Pond, who testified that he was a member of a firm in Boston in the same kind of business as the plaintiffs, and was acquainted with Meserve. In reply to the question, \u201c Did you know what his reputation for credit was ? \u201d he answered, under the objection of the defendant, \u201c With us, it was not good; \u201d and in answer to the question, \u201c In the trade in Boston, as far as you know, what was his reputation?\u201d he answered, \u201cIt was not good.\u201d On cross-examination, the witness said that he never heard Me-serve\u2019s reputation for credit called in question except by members of his own firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-7\">The defendant requested the judge to rule that the fact, that the witness Pond testified that he never heard Meserve\u2019s credit questioned by other firms in the trade, rendered him an incompetent witness as to the general financial standing of the witness Meserve. The judge declined so to rule; but instructed the jury that they must take the testimony as given upon the stand, and consider it; that the evidence as to Meserve\u2019s pecuniary credit was to be considered by them only upon the point as to whether the sale was made by the plaintiffs to Meserve or the defendant; that they must be satisfied from all the evidence that Meserve was a man whose credit was bad, that he had no financial credit m the community, and that his reputation as to credit was bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>and reputation is what his neighbors say of him, what is generally talked of concerning his credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-3\">The defendant, being aggrieved by the above rulings and refusals to rule, and the admissions and rejection of testimony, excepted to the same, and prayed that his bill of exceptions might be allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-4\">On this bill of exceptions the judge wrote and signed the following certificate, dated June 27, 1876: \u201cThe verdict in this case was returned into court, April 12,1876. On June 22,1876, and before the term had closed, the defendant presented to me the above bill of exceptions, the same not having been filed, with the following indorsement thereon: \u2018 This may be filed as of proper date. Cyrus Cobb, Attorney for Plaintiffs.\u2019 Ho application has ever been made to me to extend the time for filing this bill, and none has been granted. I have examined the above bill of exceptions and find them conformable to the truth. If, by the statutes and the thirty-sixth rule of the Superior Court, I am empowered, upon the above statement of facts, which I submit to the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court, to allow the above bill, I do hereby allow the same, and for the reasons above set forth I order that the same be filed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">The court ordered the question, whether this court had jurisdiction of the exceptions, to be first argued.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-6\"><em>H.

Sts. <em>c. </em>115, \u00a7 7, which requires the party alleging exceptions to file them with the clerk, give notice thereof to the adverse party, and present them to the judge, within the time ascertained or allowed as prescribed by the statute, is to protect the adverse party and the presiding judge from being compelled to examine the truth of exceptions of which they have no notice until after that time has expired; but not to prevent the judge from after-wards allowing the exceptions, if he is satisfied of their conformity with the truth, and sees fit so to do, and the adverse party consents to such allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">\n<em>Exceptions to stand for argument.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The case was then argued upon the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">N. <em>Morse &amp; </em>C.

This inquiry leads to another, Was his testimony the statement of a fact, or was it simply what is ordinarily designated as hearsay evidence ? The distinction between reputation and hearsay evidence is sometimes a difficult practical question, and is not always kept clearly in mind in the introduction of testimony upon a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">General reputation is a fact. The mere declaration of one or many is hearsay. It does not require a multitude of witnesses to prove the fact that there is a general reputation upon a particular subject. The question is a simple one of fact, Is there a general reputation ? Has the subject been so much discussed and considered that there is in the public mind a uniform and concurrent sentiment which can be stated as a fact ? By the public mind, of course, is not meant the mind of the whole public, but of that portion of the public which is cognizant of and interested in the matter of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">An examination of the evidence as given at the trial shows with entire certainty that the witness was not testifying to a fact which the general public mind had accepted as such, but that he was testifying to the opinions of individuals, as he had heard those individual opinions expressed. The first inquiry was, \u201c Did you Know what his reputation for credit was ? \u201d The answer was, \u201c With us, it was not good.\u201d The response was even more limited than the inquiry, which in itself was too narrow, and was wholly immaterial.' The next inquiry was, \u201c In the trade in Boston, as far as you know, what was his reputation ? \u201d The answer was, \u201c It was not good.\u201d If nothing further than that had appeared, it might have been doubtful whether the witness had any knowledge upon the subject; and perhaps, if neither party had made further inquiry, the testimony might properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>have been left to the jury for their consideration. But the opposite party went further, and on cross-examination the witness said that he \u201c never heard Meserve\u2019s reputation for credit called in question except by members of his own firm.\u201d There does not appear to have been any other testimony upon the subject. In this state of the evidence, the defendant requested the court to rule \u201c that the fact, that the witness Pond testified that he never heard Meserve\u2019s credit questioned by other firms in the trade, rendered him an incompetent witness as to the general financial standing of the witness Meserve.\u201d Without deciding that this request was couched in strictly accurate terms, it did call upon the court to state the true rule of law upon the subject, and that such testimony had no tendency to establish the fact required to be proved. We do not mean to say that, if there had been other evidence in the case, tending to prove the fact that there was a general reputation in relation to his credit as bad, the language of the learned judge would have been necessarily inaccurate; but that, there being no other evidence in the case upon the subject except that given by Pond, it was the duty of the court to say that there was no evidence proper to be con sidered upon that issue. <em>^Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
