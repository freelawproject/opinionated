J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">In this action of tort the plaintiff\u2019s wife, with his permission, was using hi\u00ae car to go to church. The defendant, driving an ice truck, drove \u201ca few feet beyond the plaintiff\u2019s driveway\u201d on Byron Road in' the town of Weymouth. For the purpose of turning around he backed his truck about six feet into' the plaintiff\u2019s driveway and was \u201cdriving back into the street\u201d when the rear of\" his truck was struck by the rear of 'the plaintiff\u2019s automobile, which was operated by his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-13\">The plaintiff seeks to recover from the defendant for the ensuing damage to his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-14\">The court filed a written finding that \u201cI find that the collision happened in the driveway mentioned in the\" evidence; that negligence of each driver concurred in causing the accident. I find' that if either driver had used due care, the accident would not have happened;. The plaintiff is the owner and I rule he is' not prevented from recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>under .the circumstances of this case,\u201d and found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">The defendant has argued that the negligence of the plaintiff\u2019s wife must be imputed to him. He ignores the decision in <em>Nash &amp; Lang, </em>268 Mass. 407, and the cases since, deciding that the negligence of a bailee doe's not bar recovery by a bailor who is not present and who is free from any negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-4\">We think this principal has \u2018been so thoroughly decided in <em>Nash &amp; Lang </em>and subsequent cases that further discussion is of no value. There was evidence on which the court could decide that his wife was the plaintiff\u2019s bailee, and that he, as bailor, was free from negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">However, the Judge gave requests of the defendant to which the plaintiff raised no objection. So far as they are requests for rulings of law they became the- law of the case. As requests for findings of facts, 'the facts were so found, and the court is forced to accept them. <em>Freeman vs. Crowell &amp; Thurlow, Inc., </em>296 Mass. 514 at 518. The Court here granted requests and therefore found that (1) \u201cit was not negligence for the defendant to back into the driveway . . ., if the plaintiff\u2019s car was in 'the garage . . .,\u201d Request 8, (2) \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s ear was in the garage when the plaintiff started to back into the driveway,\u201d Request 12, (3) \u201cthe defendant had turned and was driving back into the street when the plaintiff\u2019s car ran into the truck,\u201d Requests 15, 16 &amp; 17, (4) no \u201cwrongful\u201d act of the defendant contributed to the accident, Requests 18, 19, (5) \u201cthe presence of the defendant\u2019s truck on the plaintiff\u2019s private property, of itself, was simply the occasion and not a proximate cause of the accident,\u201d Request 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">The Court ruled that \u201cthe defendant might reasonably assume that if 'the car was .backed out of the garage-, the driver would see the truck .. . .,\u201d Request 11, but found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>that the defendant did not \u201cact with due care when he backed into the driveway after observing that the driveway was clear and that the plaintiff\u2019s oar was standing in the garage,\u201d Request 9. In s'o finding he said \u201cSee Special findings,\u201d as he did in ruling that the defendant might not \u201creasonably assume \u00a1that the- plaintiff\u2019s car would remain in the garage during the short time it would take him to turn his truck,\u201d Request 10, but he found \u201cthere is no evidence that any violation of the plaintiff\u2019s rights in the driveway was a proximate cause of 'the accident,\u201d Requests 21 and 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-3\">The Court found on ample evidence that 'the driver of the plaintiff\u2019s ear was negligent and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-4\">We find nothing in the report on which the court could find that the defendant was: negligent, or that any act of hisi \u201cconcurred in causing 'the accident.\u201d We find that the findings, as indicated by the granting of requests made by .the defendant, show that no negligence of the defendant contributed to the cause of 'the accident. No facts are set forth in the \u201cspecial\u201d findings on which to base a finding that the defendant was negligent. <em>Freeman vs. Crowell &amp; Thurlow, Inc. supra, </em>also see <em>Parke vs. Morin, </em>304 Mass. 35 at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The finding for the plaintiff is vacated and finding for the defendant ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
