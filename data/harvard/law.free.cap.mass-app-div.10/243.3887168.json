Loewenthal, Secretary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7q\">Represented by</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">Addison H. Vebeill (Signed)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">Thereupon both parties rested, and the plaintiff seasonably requested the following rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-13\">\u201c1. Upon all the evidence a finding for the plaintiff is warranted. 2. If the Court finds that the defendant has breached his contract the measure of damages is the full balance due under the terms of said contract. <em>International Textbook Company vs. Martin, </em>221 Mass. 1.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">The Court allowed the first and denied the second request, and made the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-15\">\u201cThe Court finds that there was no evidence introduced on the loss of profits suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the breach of the contract by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">The Court made a finding for the plaintiff for nominal damages in the sum of $1.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-17\">At the argument of this case both parties agreed that at the trial they had agreed at the bench that a breach of the contract had been made by the defendant. No question of pleading arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The plaintiff claims to be aggrieved by the refusal to give his second requested ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\">An analysis of the contract shows that the defendant bound himself to pay ninety dollars ($90.00) in installments of fifteen dollars ($15.00) on the first day of each month beginning August 1, 1943, and also, since there is no evidence of the discontinuance of the contract, the defendant bound himself to pay a second ninety dollars ($90.00) in installments of fifteen dollars ($15.00) on the first day of each month beginning February 1, 1944. Such installments might have been and undoubtedly were payable before anything was to be done by the plaintiff in the particular month during which the installments were called for. In other words, the promise to pay was an independent promise, which, without controlling evidence, bound the defendant to pay his monthly installments from August 1, 1943 up to August 1, 1944. <em>International Textbook Co. vs. Martin, </em>221 Mass. 1, at pages 4 and 5; Restatement of the Law of Contracts, Vol. 1, page 535. See <em>Eastern Advertising Co. vs. Shapiro, </em>263 Mass. 228, 233. The total of these payments was considerably more than the amount claimed in the declaration, but the amount there claimed limits the amount recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The defendant chose not to bring any cross action, and did not offer any evidence although the burden was on him to support his plea of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The second requested ruling should have been given, and as this ruling requires a judgment for the plaintiff in the amount claimed, or $98.70, judgment for that amount is to be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
