This is so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>quite apart from, considerations as to whether its draft report was inadequate or unfair; or lacked proper form; or whether its claim of report was properly disallowed by the trial judge because of the failure of the plaintiff to comply with the suggestions of the trial judge relating thereto. We do not pass on such questions because it clearly appears there are other legal barriers across the path of plaintiff\u2019s objective which prevent the allowance of its petition. . But, while we do not pass on the considerations above stated, it may be useful to point out in passing \u201cthat the procedure by petition is <em>strictissimi juris.\u201d John Henry Co., Petitioner, </em>222 Mass. 182, 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\">All necessary requirements must be observed. The petitioner must show that the draft report filed in such a draft report which the trial judge ought to have signed. <em>Freedman, Petitioner, </em>222 Mass. 179. Although the rules of court require preparation of a draft report by the party claiming the right, nevertheless it is a report of the presiding judge. He has a right to insert in it what he deems material to a full and true statement of the points of law involved. The judge not only has the authority to settle the report as justice requires, but also the duty to see that it conforms to what he believes to be the truth. Failure of a party to carry out the court\u2019s order to that end is ground for dismissal. <em>Kelly v. Foley, </em>284 Mass. 503, 509. In view of these strict requirements it is at least doubtful if the draft report filed in this case complies with the formal requirements of a draft report; but, since it is not necessary to decide this issue, we leave it without decision and pass on to well settled fundamental reasons which compel denial of the plaintiff\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">It appears from the record that at the close of the trial on June 21, 1945, the plaintiff duly filed eight requests for rulings; that the court granted all of these requests; made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>certain subsidiary findings of fact; and found generally for the defendant. From an inspection of the docket entries and the papers on file in the case, of which we take judicial notice; cf. <em>Kolda v. National-Ben Franklin Fire Ins. Co., </em>290 Mass. 182 it appears that on June 22,1945, the plaintiff filed a motion for new trial, alleging as reasons therefor that the finding was \u201cagainst the evidence,\u201d \u2014 \u201cagainst the weight of the evidence\u201d \u2014 \u201cand against the law.\u201d On June 26, 1945, the plaintiff filed a motion alleging, in substance, that there was \u201can incompatibility between the plaintiff\u2019s requests allowed by the court and the general findings for the defendant.\u201d It further appears from the docket entries that on June 26, 1945 the plaintiff filed the draft report in question. On August 9, 1945 the plaintiff waived its motion for new trial and on the same day the plaintiff\u2019s motion to correct the general finding was denied by the trial judge, and the plaintiff\u2019s claim of report disallowed. On August 14,1945 the plaintiff filed its petition to establish the draft report. It appears from the record that the trial judge in disallowing the plaintiff\u2019s claim of report did not file a certificate setting forth his reasons for so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\">The petition, at least inferentially, sets out that the plaintiff is aggrieved because the trial judge \u201cin disallowing the claim of report did not file a certificate setting forth his reasons for so doing. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s draft report does not set out this alleged grievance, therefore, the question would not be open even if the draft report were established. <em>Baker v. Davis, </em>299 Mass. 345, 348, and cases cited. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney, in his argument before this division contended that the report should be established because there is an inconsistency between the rulings granted by the trial judge and his special and general findings. The draft report which the petitioner seeks to establish sets out the plaintiff\u2019s alleged grievances in the following manner, \u2014 \u2018 \u2018 The plaintiff claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ing to be aggrieved that the conditional vendor was not damaged and that the negligence of the conditional vendee barred the. conditional vendor from recovery, I hereby report the same to the Appellate Division for determination. \u2019 \u2019 It is obvious from an inspection of the record and the plaintiff\u2019s draft report that the contention relating to inconsistency was not properly raised in the draft report and therefore would not be reviewable even if the plaintiff\u2019s draft report were established. <em>Okin v. Sullivan, </em>307 Mass. 227, 228. <em>Langdoc v. Gevaert Co., of America, Inc., </em>315 Mass. 8, 12 The force of the above observation becomes clearer from the fact that the docket entries show the draft report was filed on June 26, 1945, while the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion \u201cto correct the general finding\u201d because of alleged inconsistencies was not filed until August 9, 1945; and that no rights appear to have been saved by the plaintiff to that denial. <em>Calcagno v. P. H. Graham &amp; Sons Co. Inc., </em>313 Mass. 364, 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\">It is also clear from an inspection of the draft report that the alleged grievances which the plaintiff seeks reviewed relate to matters which are not reviewable under our law. The record shows that the court granted all of the plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings. It also appears that no review of the court\u2019s action on these rulings was sought; but, even if such a review was requested, it is well settled that requests granted are not reviewable at the instance of the party submitting them. <em>DiLorenzo v. Atlantic National Bank of Boston, </em>278, Mass. 321. <em>Baker v. Davis, </em>299 Mass. 345, 348. <em>Korb v. Albany Carpet Cleaning Co., </em>301 Mass. 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">It appears from the draft report attached to the plaintiff\u2019s petition to establish it that the court, after allowing the plaintiff\u2019s requests, stated it did \u201cnot find conditional vendor was damaged\u201d; found that \u201cthe bailed car was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>paired by the bailee\u201d; and that \u201cdrivers of both cars were negligent.\u201d The plaintiff evidently contends that from these findings it appears that the court impliedly ruled that the plaintiff could not recover because of the facts found relating to damage and contributory negligence of the drivers of the ears in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\">It is not necessary to pass on the question as to whether the court made any such implied rulings because, even if it could be so found, it is well settled that under our practice implied rulings are not reviewable. <em>Baker v. Davis, supra. </em>Furthermore, the plaintiff\u2019s alleged grievance based on the court\u2019s findings, above referred to, is also not reviewable. It has long been established that findings are not reviewable under our practice unless turned into a question of law. <em>Burns v. Winchell, </em>305 Mass. 276, 282. <em>Okin v. Sullivan, supra. Scaccia v. Boston Elevated Ry., </em>308 Mass. 310. <em>Codman v. Beane, </em>312 Mass. 570, 573. And this is so even if the court reported such findings. <em>Baker v. Davis, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">It follows from the above observations that there would be nothing reviewable presented by the plaintiff\u2019s draft report even if it were established. The order therefore is <em>Petition denied.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
