In other words, by the very terms of the act, which is chapter 97, Acts Regular Session, 42nd Legislature, \u201cnarcotic drug\u201d is made a generic term, in which case, under many authorities, it is not enough that one indicted for a violation of the provisions of said act be charged with possession, sale, etc., of narcotic drugs; but such indictment should go further and name the particular drug so possessed, or sold in the particular case. Brewer v. State, 5 Texas App., 248; McAfee v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 124; Dixon v. State, 21 Texas App., 517; Kennedy v. State, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 450; Todd v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep., 99; Stanford v. State, 99 Texas Crim. Rep., 111. The indictment in the instant case should have added to the averment that a narcotic drug was possessed, a further allegation such as, towit, morphine \u2014 or whatever drug was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-17\">The indictment being insufficient, the judgment is reversed and the cause dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-18\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
