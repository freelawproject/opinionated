C., 1925, from which the following is quoted: \u201cAny person who drives or operates an automobile * * * upon any public road or highway in this State while such person is intoxicated <em>or in any degree under the influence of intoxicating liquor,\u201d </em>etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>The sole question involved in this appeal is whether the indictment charges an offense. The part of the indictment which is relevant is in the following words: \u201c* * * <em>did then and there unlawfully drive and operate a motor vehicle, </em>to-wit, an automobile upon a public street within the limits of an incorporated city in this state, to-wit, upon North Fannin Street in the city of Tyler, Smith County, Texas, <em>while he, the said Loys Wilson, was then and there to some extent under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The charge of the court followed the language of the indictment; that is to say, the jury was instructed to convict the accused, if while driving an automobile upon the highway, he was <em>\u201cto some extent\u201d </em>under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In no previous case since the statute was.enacted has this court found it necessary to pass directly upon the sufficiency of the averment in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">In the case of Williams v. State, 100 Texas Crim. Rep., 50, the words \u201cin any degree\u201d were not used in the indictment, but the statute was attacked. It was held that their presence in the statute did not render it void. A like attack was made upon the statute with the same result in Nelson\u2019s case, 261 S. W., 1046; likewise in Nunn\u2019s case, 114 Texas Crim. Rep., 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">An indictment charging that the accused was intoxicated.,or under the influence of intoxicating liquor has been upheld although it contained an averment using the words \u201cin any degree\u201d under the influence of intoxicating liquor. See Wimberly v. State, 109 Texas Crim. Rep., 581; Stewart v. State,. 108 Texas Crim. Rep., 199; Brown v. State, 108 Texas Crim. Rep., 360; Rodriguez v. State, 104 Texas Crim. Rep., 7; Boyd v. State, 106 Texas Crim. Rep., 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">In the concurring opinion in Fuller v. State, 32 S. W. (2d) 358, it is said: \u201cThe words \u2018or in any degree under the influence of intoxicating liquor,\u2019 as contained in article 802, P. C., are too indefinite to define a criminal offense. The appearance of the words in the statute, however, does not vitiate it. * * * In the indictment it is charged that he drove an automobile upon a public street <em>while he was intoxicated, </em>and the jury was instructed in language to the same effect. Therefore the use of the words \u2018in any degree under the influence of intoxicating liquor,\u2019 so far as they affect the present case, is merely surplusage, and could not affect the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">A like case is Herring v. State, 35 S. W. (2d) 737. The conviction in the present case is based solely upon the phase of the statute italicized above, and is assailed upon the proposition that the words <em>\u201cin any degree under the influence </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>of intoxicating liquor,\u201d </em>as they appear in the act of the Legislature, do not create a crime. Our statute, article 6, P. C., declares inoperative an unintelligible law. Instances in which statutes or parts of statutes have been condemned as obnoxious to the statute mentioned are numerous. The rule is fundamental through the American and English jurisdictions. It was said by Lord Coke: \u201cThe acts of parliament ought to be plainly and clearly, and not cunningly and darkly, penned, especially in legal matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">The interpretation of statutes is approached upon the presumption of their validity. They are not to be held invalid capriciously nor merely because of difficulty in ascertaining their meaning, but a statute cannot be enforced where its meaning cannot be determined by any known rules of construction. See Lewis\u2019 Sutherland on Statutory Construction (2nd Ed.), vol. 2, sec. 86, and notes. Among the specific instances in which statutes or parts of statutes have been declared void, the following are mentioned, together with the language held indefinite: Augustine v. State, 41 Texas Crim. Rep., 59, \u201cmurder by mob violence\u201d; Russell v. State, 88 Texas Crim. Rep., 512, \u201coperating a motor vehicle upon the highway in a careless manner\u201d; Griffin v. State, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 498, \u201cseriously interfere with the sight of or temporarily blind the vision of driver of a vehicle approaching from an opposite direction\u201d; Cinadr v. State, 108 Texas Crim. Rep., 147, \u201cneedlessly killing a hog\u201d; Tozer v. United States, 52 Fed., 917, 919, \u201cundue and unreasonable advantage\u201d; Ex parte Jackson, 45 Ark., 158, \u201cinjurious to the public health, or public morals, or to the perversion or obstruction of public justice, or the due administration of law\u201d; Railway Co. v. Dey, 35 Fed., 866, \u201cunreasonable rate\u201d; Ex parte Slaughter, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 212, \u201cclosely built up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">In addition to the opinions of this court that have been cited, there are many others which give effect to the principle. Among them may be mentioned the following: Dockery v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep., 220; Overt v. State, 97 Texas Crim. Rep., 202; Ex parte Montgomery, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 636. It is an unnecessary, useless, and confusing part of a statute which is otherwise sound. It is in conflict with the statutory declaration requiring certainty in the formation of statutes, and of article 1, sec. 10 of the Constitution of the state guaranteeing to one accused of crime information as to the nature and cause of the accusation against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The words \u201cin any degree\u201d in the statute are useless for the reason that the other terms therein, namely, \u201cintoxicated\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor,\u201d have often been defined in judicial decisions and are well understood in legal parlance. See 68 Amer. Law Rep., p. 1360, note 4. The use of the words \u201cin any degree\u201d as used in the statute, if recognized as charging an offense, are capable of mischief in making an opening for expert testimony touching the quantity of intoxicating liquor that may or may not produce the effect contemplated in the statute. What is required to bring one \u201cin any degree\u201d under the influence of intoxicating liquor? The statute does not declare. Who then must determine what are the essential elements of the offense which the act attempts to denounce ? What standard would make uniform and stable the criminal denunciation? The peculiar fancy of the individuals who compose the jury is the sole guide. In the books are standards by which it may be declared that one is intoxicated. The terms \u201cintoxicated\u201d and \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d are found in the dictionaries and in the law books. The term \u201cto any degree under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d is an innovation. No attempt to define it is made by the law-making power. No criterion can be found in the books by which the trial court can define it in instructing the jury. It is denounced as a felony, but no information is given, either to the individual charged or to the jury by which to determine what is meant by the term. That as in the statute it does not mean \u201cintoxicated\u201d is manifest from the verbiage of the statute itself, wherein it says, \u201cwhile such person is intoxicated <em>or in any degree under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d </em>It recognizes the distinction between intoxicated and \u201cin any degree\u201d under the influence of intoxicating liquor, but fails to locate the point of distinction and leaves it purely to the imagination or volition of the jurors who happen to be trying the particular case. It is upon a parity with many of the cases decided by this court holding statutes invalid for uncertainty which are cited above, and offends against the principle controlling in all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">For the reason that the indictment does not charge an offense, the judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\n<em>Reversed and prosecution ordered dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b442-7\">LATTIMORE, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AaO\">(dissenting). \u2014 I regret the necessity for this dissent. The indictment herein charged appellant with driving a motor vehicle on North Fannin street of the city of Tyler while he was \u201cto some extent\u201d under the influence of intoxicating liquor. In fact, he was admittedly drunk, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>only defense interposed on the trial was that there was no such street in Tyler as North Fannin street. No issue was made as to the extent or degree of appellant\u2019s drunkenness. No motion was made to quash the indictment. On appeal appellant raises in his brief the question that the indictment herein charges no violation of the law because it contains the averment that he was \u201cto some extent\u201d under the influence of intoxicating liquor, but no authorities are cited and no argument apparently made in support of the position. My associates are of opinion that the allegation \u201cto some extent\u201d makes the indictment bad, and that for this reason the judgment must be reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed. It seems difficult to me to understand how such conclusion can be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Article 802, P. C., under which this conviction was had, has been on our statute books for ten years, and every phase of it has apparently been considered and construed by this court as now constituted. The exact language of the statute forbids that any person shall drive a motor vehicle on a public highway while intoxicated or \u201cin any degree under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">This court is thoroughly committed to the proposition that the indictment is sufficient for this offense if it charges that the accused was \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d at the time complained of. Williams v. State, 100 Texas Crim. Rep., 51; Jones v. State, 101 Texas Crim. Rep., 71; Boyd v. State, 106 Texas Crim. Rep., 494; Stewart v. State, 108 Texas Crim. Rep., 202; Nunn v. State, 114 Texas Crim. Rep., 487; Fuller v. State, 116 Texas Crim. Rep., 312; Farmer v. State, 119 Texas Crim. Rep., 213; Herring v. State, 35 S. W. (2d) 737. In the last case cited the indictment charged that the accused was \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d when he drove the car in question. In the original opinion we said the motion to quash the indictment was properly overruled. In the opinion on rehearing, it is said: \u201cThe indictment is attacked as being based upon an invalid statute * * * based upon the verbiage of. article 802, P. C., 1925, wherein the following words appear: \u2018Or in any degree under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u2019 The validity of the statute has been upheld, though the words * * * \u2018in any degree\u2019 have been regarded as surplusage.\u201d We expressly held that said words furnish no ground for a reversal of the case. In the Williams case, supra, we wrote that the theory that in charging that one was intoxicated \u2014 and under the influence of intoxicating liquor \u2014 charged two offenses, was untenable inasmuch as to charge that one was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number><em>intoxicated </em>was but a different way of alleging that he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\">Surplusage \u2014 under all the authorities in reference to indictments \u2014 is something written therein which may be discarded, leaving the offense fully charged. Warrington v. State, 1 Texas App., 168; Mayo v. State, 7 Texas App., 342; Rivers v. State, 10 Texas App., 177; Taylor v. State, 29 Texas App., 466; Jordan v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 222; Goodwin v. State, 158 S. W., 275; Jennings v. State, 88 Texas Crim. Rep., 639; Seebold v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep., 563; Schroeder v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 7; Harvey v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 645; Martin v. State, 95 Texas Crim. Rep., 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">To undertake to demonstrate by argument or illustration that the words \u201cto some extent,\u201d which are used in the indictment in the instant case, are the exact equivalent of the words \u201cin any degree,\u201d or \u201cto some degree,\u201d which are used in article 802, P. C., would be like arguing that two and two make four, or that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points. If \u2014 as Judge Morrow says in the Herring case, supra, and as we have substantially held in numerous cases \u2014 the words \u201cin any degree\u201d are surplusage, they may be stricken out of the indictment, or omitted in its consideration, and, if that which is left sufficiently charges the offense, the indictment would unquestionably still be good.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Applying what we have said in so many cases to the instant case, we should merely hold the words \u201cto some extent\u201d to be surplusage, and omitting same we would have here an indictment fully charging that the accused drove his car on a public street in the city of Tyler while * * * under the influence of intoxicating liquor, which is in exact accord with what we upheld in the Williams Case, supra, and which we have upheld in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In apparently the first considered case under article 802, supra, Nelson v. State, 97 Texas Crim. Rep., 210, the original opinion by Morrow, P. J., and by the writer on rehearing, the offense is stated in the original opinion as unlawfully operating a car on a public street while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. On rehearing, article 802, supra, was quoted in full and the statement plainly made that same does not attempt to fix any limit as to the amount of intoxicating liquor that will be permitted in the driver of a vehicle on a public street, but on the contrary it prohibits his being under the influence of intoxicating liquor \u201cto any extent.\u201d In Scoggins v. State, 98 Texas Crim. Rep., 547, opinion by Judge Morrow, the holding in Nelson\u2019s case, supra, is expressly approved, and we there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>held that when the proof showed the accused to be drunk, there could be no complaint of failure on the part of the trial court to attempt to define the term \u201cintoxicated.\u201d The Nelson case was again approved in Stewart v. State, 108 Texas Crim. Rep., 200. In the concurring opinion in Fuller v. State, 116 Texas Crim. Rep., 312, it is expressly admitted, as in the opinion in the Herring case, supra, that the expression \u201cin any degree\u201d is surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">I have never been able to agree that the language used by the Legislature in defining this offense is such as that when followed in an indictment the indictment should be held bad and the case reversed for that reason. I have agreed to the holding that certain words used by the Legislature might be held surplusage, and that the word \u201cintoxicated,\u201d and the expression \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor,\u201d meant the same thing, but I cannot now agree that the insertion into this indictment of words whose equivalent has often been held to be mere surplusage, viz: \u201cTo some extent,\u201d would warrant this court in reversing the case of a man who was shown to be, as a witness said, limber drunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">As far as the writer knows it has never been held in' any other state of this Union that such expressions as \u201cto any degree\u201d or \u201cto any extent,\u201d vitiate the indictment, and it occurs to me that this court is now embarking upon an entire departure. As illuminating we call attention to the language of similar statutes in other states. The following states have statutes punishing him who drives a car \u201cwhile under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d: Arizona, California, Georgia, Rhode Island, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, West Virginia, Utah, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Washington, Oregon, Oklahoma, Delaware, Tennessee, Idaho, Michigan, Florida, Vermont, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Virginia, North Carolina, Iowa, Maine, New Jersey, and possibly others. Some states punish him who so drives \u201cwhile intoxicated,\u201d or \u201cin an intoxicated condition.\u201d These are Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Alabama, Kentucky, New York, Indiana, Ohio, Arkansas, Minnesota, and Illinois. The Missouri statute forbids such action \u201cwhile in an intoxicated condition, or under the influence of drugs,\u201d the principle involved in the last clause of the statute being similar to the one here under consideration. Colorado forbids such driving \u201cwhile in any degree under the influence of any intoxicants.\u201d Mississippi prohibits such driving \u201cwhile in a state of intoxication, or in any other respect incapable of properly and safely operating,\u201d etc. Many of the states first named, in varying terms, make it penal to operate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>such car \u201cwhile intoxicated, or under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\">The expressions from the courts of last resort in other states in some instances are interesting. State v. Dudley, 159 La., 872, 106 So., 364, holds the words \u201cunder the influence of [intoxicating] liquor,\u201d to be exactly synonymous with the expression \u201cin an intoxicated condition.\u201d In State ex rel Sellers v. Parker, 87 Fla., 181, 100 So., 260, the terms \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d were held not lacking in definiteness or intelligibility. In Commonwealth v. Lyseth, 250 Mass., 555, 146 1ST. E., 18, it seems held sufficient to uphold a conviction, to prove that the driver of the car was under the influence of liquor rather than intoxicated, although the statute of Massachusetts penalizes him in specific terms who is \u201cintoxicated.\u201d In People v. Ekstromer, 235 Pac., 69, the Court of Appeals of California held that the law prohibiting the driving of a motor vehicle by a person under the influence of intoxicants was designed to protect the public from the menace of automobiles operated on public highways with inadequate or inefficient control in a world of traffic difficult of management under normal conditions, and that the law should be liberally construed to effect its purpose. In State v. Giles, 206 N. W., 133, the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed a judgment inflicting punishment at a year in the penitentiary of a car driver whose condition was such as that he could guide his car through traffic, but was shown to be under the influence of intoxicants, saying that the circumstances of the particular case were not aggravated, but that the very nature of the offense was such as that aggravation inheres in it; that the peril threatened by such an offense was so great and imminent that only severe punishment could be deemed adequate to restrain it. In People v. Weaver, 188 App. Div., 395, 37 N. Y. Crim. Rep., 566, the court said that for the purpose of a statute forbidding the operation of a car by one intoxicated, the accused was in such condition when he had imbibed enough liquor to render him incapable of giving that attention and care to the operation of his car that a man of reasonable prudence and intelligence would give, and the opinion is expressed that under said statute the jury should have been instructed that \u201cintoxication\u201d within the meaning of the statute, meant such condition (resulting from the use of intoxicants) as impairs to some extent, however slight it may be, the ability of such person to operate such car. So in State v. Rodgers, 91 N. J. L., 212, 102 Atl., 433, the court says that \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor,\u201d covers all conditions and degrees of intoxication, as well as any abnormal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>mental or physical condition which results from indulging in any degree in intoxicating liquor, and which tends to deprive such operator of clearness of intellect and safe control which he otherwise would possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Believing that at most the use in the indictment of the words \u201cto some extent\u201d amounts to but surplusage, and that with this stricken out the indictment fully charges the accused with operating his automobile on a public street while * * * under the influence of intoxicating liquor, which this court has expressly held to be a good indictment, I cannot bring myself to agree to the holding of the majority, and hence this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
