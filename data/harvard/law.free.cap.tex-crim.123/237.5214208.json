In Baker v. State (No. 15,799) and Baker v. State (No. 15,800), this day decided, similar indictments have been held fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-20\">In section 171, title 21, Mason\u2019s U. S. Code, vol. 1, the term \u201cnarcotic drug\u201d is defined to mean \u201copium, cocoa leaves, co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>caine, or any salt, derivative, or preparation of opium, cocoa leaves, or cocaine.\u201d The subsequent sections denounce as offenses and affix penalties for possessing and selling and otherwise unlawfully handling such \u201cnarcotic drugs.\u201d It will be noticed that the statute is very similar to our own in the respects pointed out. Our attention has been called to no prosecution under the federal statutes where the pleader charged only the illegal use or handling of a \u201cnarcotic drug\u201d; but in every instance the particular character of the drug was designated, such as opium, or by naming the drug and then averring that it was a derivative of some of the drugs specifically mentioned in the statute. Many indictments such as those designated have been held sufficient. See Sam Wong v. U. S., 2 Fed. Rep. (2d) 969; Toy v. U. S., 266 Fed. Rep., 326; Wong Lung Sing v. U. S., 3 Fed. Rep. (2d) 780; Yip Wah v. U. S., 8 Fed. Rep. (2d) 478; Proffitt v. U. S., 264 Fed. Rep., 299; Foster v. U. S., 11 Fed. Rep. (2d) 100. The forms of indictments found in the cases cited are at least persuasive of what ought to be alleged in prosecutions under our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\n<em>The Judgment is reversed and</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>Prosecution ordered dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
