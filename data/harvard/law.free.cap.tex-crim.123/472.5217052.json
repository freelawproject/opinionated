On that day the Governor of the state, upon certain declarations involving the health of the relator which were recited in the preamble, issued the following proclamation :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-16\">\u201cNow, THEREFOR I, R. S. Sterling, Governor of the State of Texas, by virtue of the authority vested in me under the Constitution and laws of this State, for the reasons stated above and now on file in the office of the Secretary of State, do hereby grant unto the said Mrs. David Black a ninety day furlough (effective June 29, 1932) for the above mentioned reasons. It is provided that she shall maintain exemplary conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-17\">\u201cIN testimony WHEREOF, I have hereunto signed my name officially and caused the Seal of State to be impressed hereon at Austin, this the 29th day of June, A. D., 1932.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-18\">\u201cR. S. Sterling,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqGH\">\u201cGovernor of Texas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-19\">On the 27th day of September, 1932, a \u201cfurlough\u201d in like terms as that above quoted was renewed and extended to the expiration date of October 29, 1932. In each of the proclama<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>tions it is stated that the \u201cfurlough\u201d was issued upon the recommendation of a physician, stating in substance that confinement in prison might impair the health of the relator. At the expiration time set forth in the second furlough the relator was arrested and held in custody by the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus was presented and denied and perfected to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The relator contends that the proclamation of the Governor was in fact a \u201cparole\u201d though described as a \u201cfurlough,\u201d and that the effect of the proclamation was to terminate the right of the state to imprison the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The sole power of granting clemency is vested in the Governor of the state in article 4, section 11, of the Constitution, in the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u201cIn all criminal cases, except treason and impeachment, he shall have power after conviction, to grant reprieves, commutations of punishment, and pardons; and, under such rules as the Legislature may prescribe, he shall have power to remit fines and forfeitures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">The term \u201cparole\u201d in our law, so far as it relates to convicts, is found in the Civil Statutes governing the penitentiary authorities, and under Acts 41st Leg., 1st Called Session, chap. 45, is but a regulation of the Legislature permitting the prison authorities to reward convicts for obedience by extending to them unusual privileges. In its legal aspects, the parole law has no relation to the power conferred upon the Governor by the Constitution. The authority of the Governor rests in the declaration quoted above from article 4, section 11, Const, of Texas. See Ex parte Redwine, 236 S. W., 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">We are in agreement with the relator to the effect that it is the substance of the proclamation of the Governor and not the name by which it is designated, that controls its effect. The elements of a statutory parole are obviously not embraced in nor a part of the proclamation, which applies to prisoners convicted of felonies, after they reach the penitentiary, and seems not applicable to misdemeanors.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">In the present instance, the effect of the proclamation of the Governor was to postpone the date upon which the relator should begin her sentence. Manifestly, it was not intended to and did not have the effect of relieving her of the sentence, but simply to postpone its execution. During the time elapsing between the date of the executive proclamation and the date fixed for the beginning of the relator\u2019s imprisonment, she was not restrained of her liberty and was not in custody, either actually or theoretically. She had not acquired any right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>credit on her term of imprisonment. Considered in the light of the terms and disclosed purposes of the proclamation, it has the attributes of a reprieve which is one of the acts of clemency embraced in the governor\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The term \u201creprieve\u201d has been defined thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u201cA reprieve signifies the suspension for a time, of the execution of a sentence which has been pronounced. * * * A reprieve * * * is the withdrawing of a sentence for an interval of time.\u201d Butler v. State, 97 Ind., 373, 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u201cThe term \u2018reprieve,\u2019 * * * is merely used to signify the postponement of the sentence for a time. It does not and cannot defeat the ultimate execution of a judgment of the court; it merely delays it.\u201d (Clifford v. Heller, 42 Atl., 155, 159, 63 N. J. Law, 105, 57 L. R A., 312.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">See other citations of judicial decisions in Words &amp; Phrases, 1st Series, vol. 7, pp. 6115-6116; Words &amp; Phrases, 3rd Series, vol. 6, p. 726; also Gore v.

As supporting our conclusion that what was intended by the Govemor of Texas in granting to applicant a \u201cfurlough\u201d was not the same as in granting a parole, during the continuance of which latter she would have been serving time as a prisoner, we call attention to the language appearing in the proclamation of the Governor in each instance as follows: \u201cDr. J. H. Fletcher writes that because of this woman\u2019s nervousness, her insomnia, her oversize, and because of her mind being subnormal and because of the fact that she is suffering from a mild case of kleptomania, he believes it would be to the best interest of the State to postpone her imprisonment until the weather gets cooler and when she is confined it is his recommendation that she be watched very closely to keep her from doing harm to herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">It is perfectly plain that it was the intention of the executive that applicant should serve out the prison term given her by the jury when \u201cthe weather gets cooler,\u201d and that, according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>doctor\u2019s suggestion, having reference to some future occurrence, the Governor said, \u201cWhen she is confined,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\">We are of opinion that, whatever may have been applicant\u2019s understanding, it was not intended nor expressed in the document called a \u201cfurlough\u201d that during the period of the continuance of same, applicant\u2019s time was to be counted upon her service of the prison term, or credit given her therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">There is some confusion in the record. The agreed statement of facts shows that applicant was given a term of four months\u2019 imprisonment in the county jail for misdemeanor theft; the proclamation of the Governor recites that she was given thirty days and a fine of $50. The original opinion of this court, based likely on what was said in the proclamation, stated that applicant was fined $50. Regardless, applicant\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled, and she is remanded to the custody of the sheriff to be kept by him in obedience to the original judgment of the district court of Wichita county.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\n<em>Overrvled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
