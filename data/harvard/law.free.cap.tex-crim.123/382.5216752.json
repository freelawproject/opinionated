The use of the words \u201cin some degree under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d has been held inadequate to charge an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">In the present instance, the words mentioned are not in the indictment but appear alone in the charge of the court in the connection quoted. Under such circumstances, it has been held that the words \u201cin any degree\u201d may be treated as surplusage. See Williams v. State, 100 Texas Crim. Rep., 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">In the instant case, the evidence is not before this court, and it must be assumed, in the absence of a showing in the record to the contrary, that the evidence adduced upon the trial supported the averment in the indictment, namely, that the appellant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. See Nunn v. State, 26 S. W. (2d) 648; Herring v. State, 35 S. W. (2d) 737; Farmer v. State, 43 S. W. (2d) 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
