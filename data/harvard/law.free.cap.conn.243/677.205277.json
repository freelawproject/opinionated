The plaintiff, John Conzo, while operating a police vehicle during the course of his employment as a police officer for the defendant city of West Haven (West Haven), sustained personal injuries in a collision with an underinsured vehicle. The plaintiff received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from West Haven for the injuries he sustained in the collision. He also received the $20,000 limit of the third party tortfeasor\u2019s automobile insurance policy. The plaintiff sought to recover uninsured motorist benefits from West Haven, which is self-insured pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and from the named defendant, Aetna Insurance Company (Aetna), which insured a vehicle owned by him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Both West Haven and Aetna denied coverage of the plaintiffs claim for uninsured motorist benefits, each claiming the coverage of the other was applicable. The plaintiff then brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment to determine whether one or both of the defendants must provide uninsured motorist benefits for his loss, and whose coverage would be primary. Aetna moved for summary judgment claiming that West Haven has a duty to provide uninsured motorist benefits, and that those benefits are primary. West Haven also moved for summary judgment seeking a declaration that pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, it had no duty to provide uninsured motorist benefits to an employee injured while operating a city owned vehicle during the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The trial court determined that both West Haven and Aetna are required to provide uninsured motorist benefits to the plaintiff, but that West Haven\u2019s coverage was primary and Aetna\u2019s coverage was secondary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> West Haven appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">We do not write on a clean slate with respect to the right of an employee to receive uninsured motorists benefits as a result of injuries sustained while operating an employer\u2019s motor vehicle during the course of employment. In 1992, in <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>222 Conn. 744, 755, 610 A.2d 1245 (1992), a majority of this court held that \u00a7 31-284 (a) prevented an employee from collecting uninsured motorist benefits from the employer. Id., 755-56. The court pointed out \u201cthat workers\u2019 compensation is an employee\u2019s only remedy for injuries that arise during the course of his employment,\u201d and that the exclusivity provision of \u00a7 31-284 (a) applies whether the employee\u2019s claim is predicated on common-law tort, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>statute or contract. In <em>CNA Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Colman, </em>222 Conn. 769, 773, 610 A.2d 1257 (1992), a companion case to <em>Bouley, </em>the majority held that \u00a7 31-284 (a) barred the employee\u2019s recovery even if it was from the employer\u2019s automobile liability insurance carrier because the carrier is \u201cthe alter ego of its insured, the employer . . . .\u201d The legislature promptly reacted by adopting No. 93-297, \u00a7 1 (f), of the 1993 Public Acts, now codified as \u00a7 38a-336 (f), which provides: \u201cNotwithstanding subsection (a) of section 31-284, an employee of a named insured injured while occupying a covered motor vehicle in the course of employment shall be covered by such insured\u2019s otherwise applicable uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In 1996, in <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Casualty Co. of Reading, Pennsylvania, </em>238 Conn. 285, 291, 679 A.2d 925 (1996), we held, with respect to an employer who was insured by a commercial insurance policy for uninsured motorist coverage, that \u00a7 38a-336 (f) clearly was intended to reverse the majority holding in <em>Colman </em>and, in doing so, \u201cwas intended to be clarifying legislation and, as such, must be accepted as a declaration of the legislature\u2019s original intent pertaining to the interplay between the uninsured motorist provisions of . . . \u00a7 38a-336 and the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision of \u00a7 31-284.\u201d Consequently, we applied \u00a7 38a-336 (f) retroactively. In <em>Reliance Ins. Co., </em>we also noted, however, that we were leaving open the question of the effect of \u00a7 38a-336 (f) on cases such as <em>Bouley </em>in which the employer is \u201cself-insured.\u201d Id., 289 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">West Haven argues that \u00a7 38a-336 (f) cannot be interpreted to apply to self-insured employers because it does not expressly create an exception to the bar set forth in \u00a7 31-284 (a). In response, Aetna argues that \u00a7 38a-336 (f) reverses the decision in <em>Bouley </em>as well as in <em>Colman </em>because the legislature intended to guarantee that the benefits of uninsured motorist coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>extend to all employees, regardless of the status of their employer as a self-insurer or as a purchaser of a commercial policy of insurance. We agree with Aetna.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Our resolution of this issue is guided by well established principles of statutory construction. \u201c[0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>242 Conn. 375, 379, 698 A.2d 859 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In its argument, West Haven focuses on the language of \u00a7 38a-336 (f), which excepts from the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201can employee of a named insured\u201d that shall be covered by \u201csuch insured\u2019s otherwise applicable uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d West Haven points out that because it is self-insured, it does not come within the purview of the phrase \u201cnamed insured\u201d in \u00a7 38a-336 (f), which is defined as \u201cthe person specifically designated in the policy as the one protected and, commonly, it is the person with whom the contract of insurance has been made.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). We disagree for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">First, West Haven, as a self-insurer, comes within the definition of insured. West Haven, pursuant to \u00a7 38a-371 (c),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> elected to become a self-insurer for its automobile liability including uninsured motorist coverage. Section 38a-371 (c) provides that in making the election to become a self-insurer, West Haven must provide \u201cassurance for payment of all obligations imposed by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>section substantially equivalent to those afforded by a policy of insurance that would comply with this section.\u201d Therefore, upon electing to become a self-insurer, West Haven not only became an insurer; General Statutes \u00a7 38a-363 (b);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but also, the functional equivalent of a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under \u00a7 38a-336 (f). Furthermore, West Haven concedes that every other subsection of \u00a7 38a-336 which regulates uninsured motorist coverage is applicable to self-insureds, notwithstanding the absence of any reference to \u201cself-insured\u201d in those subsections.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Reading \u00a7 38a-336 as a whole, as we must; <em>Munroe </em>v. <em>Great American Ins. Co., </em>234 Conn. 182, 187, 661 A.2d 581 (1995); we are persuaded that West Haven\u2019s restrictive interpretation of the phrase \u201cnamed insured\u201d in \u00a7 38a-336 (f) is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Second, the legislative history of \u00a7 38a-336 (f) persuades this court that the legislature intended to mandate uninsured motorist benefits for employee victims of accidents involving inadequately insured vehicles irrespective of the status of the victim\u2019s employer as a self-insurer or as a purchaser of a commercial policy of insurance. \u201cThe legislature is presumed to know the judicial interpretation placed upon a statute. ... It is further presumed that when the legislature subsequently acts with respect to a statute, it does so with full awareness of relevant judicial interpretations.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Charles </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>243 Conn. 255, 262-63, 701 A.2d 650 (1997); see also <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>480 U.S. 522, 525, 107 S. Ct. 1391, 94 L. Ed. 2d 533 (1987). The decisions <em>in Bouley </em>and <em>Colman, </em>the relevant judicial interpretations of the uninsured motorist statute, \u00a7 38a-336, rendered less than one year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>before the legislature enacted \u00a7 38a-336 (f), were grounded upon an analysis of the interplay between the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision found in \u00a7 31-284 (a) and \u00a7 38a-336, not on the basis of any distinction between self-insurers and commercial insurers. The <em>Colman </em>decision makes this clear by stating that \u201c[t]he fact that the employee\u2019s suit is based on an uninsured motorist insurance policy issued by a commercial insurer does not warrant a departure from the exclusive remedy policy of our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>CNA Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Colman, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 773. This was further underscored in <em>Colman </em>when the majority stated that the presence of insurance \u201cis not relevant to the issue of whether a claim for uninsured motorist benefits is precluded by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d Id., 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">When enacting \u00a7 38a-336 (f), the debaters confirmed that the legislature focused solely on its original intent with respect to the interplay between \u00a7 38a-336 and \u00a7 31-284 (a), without regard to whether the employer was self-insured or insured by a commercial carrier. Representative Richard Tulisano stated that the legislature, \u201cin drafting [\u00a7 38a-336 (f)] . . . intended [it] to be a recital [of] [w]hat [the legislature] believe[s] current law was and has been .... [T]here is a recent Supreme Court case<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that may have interpreted [it] differently and I think [\u00a7 38a-336 (f)] is a restatement of what we consider [the] law to be at this point in time.\u201d 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 27, 1993 Sess., p. 9673. Then, in response to a question from Representative Robert Farr, Tulisano stated: \u201cI think the courts might look at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>this [amendment] as [a] restatement of legislative intent and probably interpret the law [as] we always have .... I just note that we have always understood that the workers\u2019 comp[ensation] carriers had a lien on any proceeds . . . and I think a Supreme Court decision was just out of the ordinary in this area.\u201d Id., p. 9674; see <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Casualty Co. of Reading, Pennsylvania, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Third, the legislature could not have intended such an untenable result as denying uninsured motorist benefits to employees who work for self-insured employers, while providing uninsured motorist benefits to employees who work for employers that purchase commercial insurance. \u201cIt is ... a rule of statutory construction that those who promulgate statutes or rules do not intend to promulgate statutes or rules that lead to absurd consequences or bizarre results.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Siano, </em>216 Conn. 273, 278, 579 A.2d 79 (1990). Section 38a-336<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> mandates that each automobile liability policy issued in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Connecticut must offer uninsured motorist coverage. We have stated that \u201c[t]he public policy of \u00a7 38a-336 is to give a personal injury claimant access to insurance protection to compensate for the damages that would have been recoverable if the uninsured motorist had maintained an adequate policy of liability insurance.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>225 Conn. 566, 573, 624 A.2d 892 (1993). The legislature intended to create a uniform scheme of uninsured motorist insurance coverage applicable to self-insurers as well as commercial insurance carriers. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (c) (3). In view of the underlying public policy embraced in \u00a7 38a-336 and the legislative intent that self-insurers have the same obligation as commercial insurers with respect to uninsured motorist laws, \u00a7 38a-336 (f) must be construed to achieve a uniform treatment of employee victims of accidents involving inadequately insured vehicles. We reject West Haven\u2019s argument that the legislature, in adopting \u00a7 38a-336 (f), intended to create a class of persons who would not have uninsured motorist protection while operating their employer\u2019s vehicle in the coruse of employment merely because their employer elected to self-insure.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">We conclude, therefore, that an employee who is injured in the course of his employment while occupying a motor vehicle owned by his employer is entitled under \u00a7 38a-336 (f) to uninsured motorist benefits from his or her self-insured employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (f) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding subsection (a) of section 31-284, an employee of a named insured injured while occupying a covered motor vehicle in the course of employment shall be covered by such insured\u2019s otherwise applicable uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b706-11\"> The term \u201cuninsured\u201d will be used throughout the opinion to refer to both uninsured and underinsured motorist benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (c) provides: \u201cSubject to approval of the Insurance Commissioner the security required by this section, may be provided by self-insurance by filing with the commissioner in satisfactory form: (1) A continuing undertaking by the owner or other appropriate person to perform all obligations imposed by this section; (2) evidence that appropriate provision exists for the prompt and efficient administration of all claims, benefits, and obligations provided by this section; and (3) evidence that reliable financial arrangements, deposits or commitments exist providing assurance for payment of all obligations imposed by this section substantially equivalent to those afforded by a policy of insurance that would comply with this section. A person who provides security under this subsection is a self-insurer. A municipality may provide the security required under this section by filing with the commissioner a notice that it is a self-insurer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\"> Aetna\u2019s policy with the plaintiff provided uninsured motorist benefits in the amount of $300,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a) provides: \u201cAn employer who complies with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section shall not be liable for any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment or on account of death resulting from personal injury so sustained, but an employer shall secure compensation for his employees as provided under this chapter, except that compensation shall not be paid when the personal injury has been caused by the wilful and serious misconduct of the injured employee or by his intoxication. <em>All rights and claims between an employer who complies with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section and employees, or any representatives or dependents of such employees, arising out of personal injury or death sustained in the course of employment are abolished other </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number><em>than rights and claims given by this </em>chapter, provided nothing in this section shall prohibit any employee from securing, by agreement with his employer, additional compensation from his employer for the it\\jury or from enforcing any agreement for additional compensation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b708-11\"> The parties do not dispute that if West Haven is liable for uninsured motorist coverage, then it\u2019s coverage would be primary.
