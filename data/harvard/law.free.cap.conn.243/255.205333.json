J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9p\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the Superior Court has subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-44 (c) (l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> over a dissolution of marriage action brought by an individual who is not a resident of Connecticut against a member of the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Tribe (tribe) who resides on the tribe\u2019s reservation in Ledyard. We answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">The relevant facts and procedural history are as follows. On November 1, 1995, the plaintiff, Marilyn Charles, a nonlndian resident of Rhode Island, filed this action for dissolution of marriage in the Superior Court for the judicial district of New London. The defendant, Owen Charles, is a member of the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Tribe, who resides on the tribe\u2019s reservation in Ledyard. The defendant was a resident of the reservation for at least twelve months immediately prior to the initiation of the plaintiffs action. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-44 (c) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>On May 7,1997, the trial court, acting upon the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, determined that the defendant was not a resident of Connecticut for purposes of \u00a7 46b-44 (c) (1). The court concluded, consequently, that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs action and dismissed her complaint. The trial court reasoned that, because the defendant resided on the reservation, he was not a Connecticut resident and, therefore, the court was without jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We conclude that the trial court has subject matter jurisdiction over the dissolution action, and we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">An action for dissolution of a marriage \u201cobviously is a civil action.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>150 Conn. 15, 19, 183 A.2d 848 (1962). The Superior Court has exclusive jurisdiction of all complaints seeking a dissolution of marriage. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-42. Section 46b-44 establishes a residency requirement, satisfaction of which is essential to confer on the court subject matter jurisdiction over a dissolution action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the plaintiff in this case resides in Rhode Island, the statute can be satisfied only if the defendant meets the requirements of \u00a7 46b-44 (c) (1), which grants subject matter jurisdiction if \u201c[o]ne of the parties to the marriage has been a resident of this state for at least the twelve months next preceding the date of the filing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>complaint . . . .\u201d See footnote 2 of this opinion. The threshold question before us, therefore, is whether the defendant, a tribal member residing on the reservation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is subject to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of the state of Connecticut in this civil action for the dissolution of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The defendant argues that the Superior Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the tribe has not consented to the jurisdiction of the state in civil matters. The fallibility of this argument lies in its assumption that the tribe\u2019s consent is necessary. We previously have addressed the question of state jurisdiction over Indian residents of the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation in the criminal context. <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>234 Conn. 78, 662 A.2d 80, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1009, 116 S. Ct. 565, 133 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995). In <em>Spears, </em>after a lengthy analysis of the relevant statutes, we held that tribal consent to the state\u2019s criminal jurisdiction was not required. Id., 96. The rationale employed in <em>Spears </em>is equally applicable to the question of civil jurisdiction in this case. Accordingly, we conclude that tribal consent is not required to confer state jurisdiction over this civil action against a member of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe who resides on the tribe\u2019s reservation in Ledyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">To answer the question presented, we must construe those federal statutes that govern state jurisdiction over Indian country<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> generally and the territory of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe in particular. Our analysis of the statutes is guided by well established principles of statutory construction. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>Davis </em>v. Norwich, 232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995). \u201cWe . . . must effectuate the expressed Congressional intent. . . . [O]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . Ordinarily, if the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances suirounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Spears, supra, 234 Conn. 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We begin with an analysis of the text of the federal statutes that govern Indian affairs generally. The United States has the authority to regulate Indian affairs pursuant to the Indian commerce clause of the United States constitution. U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3; see <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe </em>v. <em>Bracker, </em>448 U.S. 136, 100 S. Ct. 2578, 65 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1980). Congress addressed the issue of state jurisdiction over tribal land in 1953 when it enacted Public Law 83-280.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That legislation granted five states civil jurisdiction over tribal lands within their boundaries, increasing that number to six the following year.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The 1953 act provided an option for other states to assume civil jurisdiction over tribal lands if their state legislatures affirmatively authorized such assumption.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In 1968, Congress repealed Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Law 83-280 and replaced it with Title IV of the Indian Civil Rights Act of April 11, 1968, 82 Stat. 78, which is codified at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1321 through 1326. Title IV provides in \u00a7\u00a7 1321 and 1322 (\u00a7\u00a7401 and 402 of Title IV), respectively, that the tribe must consent to the assumption by the states of civil and criminal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In 1971, the United States Supreme Court concluded that the <em>sole </em>method of tribal consent to the assumption of both criminal and civil jurisdiction under Title IV was the method established in \u00a7 1326. <em>Kennerly </em>v. <em>District Court of Montana, </em>400 U.S. 423, 429, 91 S. Ct. 480, 27 L. Ed. 2d 507 (1971). That section provides that \u201c[s]tate jurisdiction acquired pursuant to this subchapter with respect to criminal offenses or civil causes of action, or with respect to both, shall be applicable in Indian country only where the enrolled Indians within the affected area of such Indian country accept such jurisdiction by a majority vote of the adult Indians voting at a special election held for that purpose.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 (\u00a7 406 of Title IV). If that statute were the last word on state jurisdiction over Indian country, the defendant\u2019s claim that the court lacked jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>would be correct because the tribe has not accepted state jurisdiction \u201cby a majority vote of the adult Indians voting at a special election held for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In 1983, however, Congress enacted the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Claims Settlement Act<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Settlement Act) to effectuate a land dispute settlement between the tribe and the state of Connecticut. Congress provided in \u00a7 6 of the Settlement Act; 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1755; that \u201c[notwithstanding the provision relating to a special election in section 406 of the Act of April 11, 1968 (82 Stat. 80; 25 U.S.C. 1326), the reservation of the Tribe <em>is declared to be Indian country subject to State jurisdiction to the maximum extent provided in [T\\ille TV of such Act </em>[25 U.S.C. 1321 et seq.].\u201d (Emphasis added.) That provision has been interpreted by this court as conferring jurisdiction on the state without the requirement of tribal consent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 84-94. <em>Spears </em>involved a determination of the criminal jurisdiction of the state over members of the tribe. The statutory analysis and result with respect to civil jurisdiction are, however, substantially the same.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Relying on precedent of the United States Supreme Court, we concluded in <em>Spears </em>that the only mechanism for establishing the requisite tribal consent to criminal jurisdiction in \u00a7 1321 would have been through the special election provision of \u00a7 1326 (\u00a7 406 of Title IV of the Indian Civil Rights Act). <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 90, quoting <em>Kennerly </em>v. <em>District Court of Montana, </em>supra, 400 U.S. 429. Cognizant of the fact that the United States Supreme Court had interpreted \u00a7 1326 as the <em>only </em>mechanism for tribal consent, Congress eliminated that mechanism when it enacted \u00a7 1755 (\u00a7 6 of the Settlement Act). \u201cIt follows, then, that the nullification by \u00a7 1755 of the special election requirement, the sole means by which Indian tribes may consent to state jurisdiction [under Title IV], accompanied by an express grant of jurisdiction to the state, effectively nullifies the tribal consent requirement in \u00a7 1321 [and, likewise \u00a7 1322]. \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>supra, 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The legislature is presumed to know the judicial interpretation placed upon a statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>228 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Conn. 393, 401, 636 A.2d 804 (1994); <em>Cappellino </em>v. <em>Cheshire, </em>226 Conn. 569, 576, 628 A.2d 595 (1993). It is further presumed that when the legislature subsequently acts with respect to a statute, it does so with full awareness of relevant judicial interpretations. <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>480 U.S. 522, 525, 107 S. Ct. 1391, 94 L. Ed. 2d 533 (1987). It is essential that statutes be read as constituting one harmonious whole. <em>Digital Equipment Corp. </em>v. <em>Desktop Direct, Inc., </em>511 U.S. 863, 878-79, 114 S. Ct. 1992, 128 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1994). \u201cThe only way to harmonize [\u00a7 1321 or \u00a7 1322 and \u00a7 1326] with each other and with \u00a7 1755 is to conclude that the abrogation of the only method of consent abrogated the necessity for consent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The defendant attempts to distinguish our decision in <em>Spears </em>on the ground that in <em>Spears </em>we addressed only criminal jurisdiction, and that civil jurisdiction appears in a separate section of Title IV of the Indian Civil Rights Act. This argument is without merit. Although the holding in <em>Spears </em>regarding criminal jurisdiction may not control this civil action, its underlying rationale is equally applicable to this case. Section 1755 does not provide that the tribe is subject to state jurisdiction only to the maximum extent provided in \u00a7 1321. Rather, \u00a7 1755 provides: \u201c[T]o the maximum extent provided in <em>Title TV </em>of such Act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Title IV of \u201csuch Act\u201d refers to the Indian Civil Rights Act, which includes \u00a7\u00a7 1321 through 1326. Title IV encompasses both the criminal jurisdiction provision of \u00a7 1321 and the civil jurisdiction provision of \u00a7 1322. Therefore, \u201cjurisdiction to the <em>maximum </em>extent provided in Title IV\u201d (emphasis added) includes both criminal and civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>jurisdiction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section 1755, which is \u00a7 6 of the Settlement Act, therefore, eliminated the consent requirement with respect to civil jurisdiction contained within Title IV as well as the consent requirement with respect to criminal jurisdiction. The plain language of these interlocking statutes permits no other interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The legislative history of the Settlement Act provides further support for the proposition that Congress intended to eliminate the consent requirement. The reports of both the Senate and the House of Representatives indicate that \u201c[s]ection 6 [\u00a7 1755] provides that the reservation ... is subject to the full extent of State jurisdiction ... as defined in Title IV of the Act of April 11, 1968, the Indian Civil Rights Act. The Tribe\u2019s reservation <em>has this status </em>notwithstanding section 406 of the Indian Civil Rights Act [\u00a7 1326] which requires a majority vote of the enrolled members of an Indian tribe before a state may assume jurisdiction over that tribe.\u201d (Emphasis added.) S. Rep. No. 222, 98th Cong., 1st Sess., 16 (1983); H.R. Rep. No. 43, 98th Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1983). The \u201cfull extent of State jurisdiction ... as defined in Title IV\u201d includes both criminal and civil jurisdiction. Moreover, the use of the present tense, \u201chas this status,\u201d in the Senate report clearly indicates that the intent of Congress was that the grant of jurisdiction to Connecticut be accomplished by the enactment of the statute. If consent were still required, the statement would have been cast in the future tense, denoting that the tribe <em>will </em>have this status after it consents. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">As with criminal jurisdiction, the plain language and legislative history of \u00a7 6 of the Settlement Act; 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1755; evince a clear intent to eliminate the provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>in \u00a7 1326 requiring tribal consent as a prerequisite to conferring civil jurisdiction on the state pursuant to \u00a7 1322. Accordingly, Connecticut has jurisdiction \u201cover civil causes of action between Indians or to which Indians are parties which arise in the areas of Indian country situated within [Connecticut]\u201d pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Once the state acquires civil jurisdiction, it has \u201csuch measure of jurisdiction over any or all such civil causes of action arising within such Indian country or any part thereof as may be determined by such State <em>to the same extent that such State has jurisdiction over other civil causes of </em>action, <em>and those civil laws of such State that are of general application to private persons or private properly shall have the same force and effect within such Indian country or part thereof as they have elsewhere within that State. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Because Congress, in adopting the Settlement Act, conferred upon the state of Connecticut the civil jurisdiction provided in \u00a7 1322, it necessarily follows that the defendant is subject to the provisions of \u00a7 46b-44 \u201cto the same extent\u201d as if he were a resident of the state.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The civil laws of the state, including \u00a7 46b-44, have the same force and effect on the reservation as they have elsewhere in Connecticut. The defendant may not, therefore, avail himself of the argument that he is not a Connecticut resident in order to evade the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>jurisdiction of the Connecticut courts over this action. The Superior Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1755 and 1322 to the same extent it would have if the defendant were any other resident of Connecticut. The defendant, consequently, must be treated as a resident of Connecticut for purposes of \u00a7 46b-44 (c) (1) notwithstanding his tribal membership and residency on the tribal reservation. Therefore, the Superior Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this dissolution action.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-44 provides in relevant part: \u201c(c) A decree dissolving a marriage or granting a legal separation may be entered if: <em>(1) One of the parties to the marriage has been a resident of this state for at least the twelve months next preceding the date of the filing of the complaint or next preceding the date of the decree . . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b285-6\"> In its memorandum of decision, the trial court stated that \u201cRhode Island, by virtue of the plaintiffs residence, has an interest in the outcome of the divorce proceeding.

This court fails to find a corresponding interest for the state of Connecticut. For the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that a Mashantucket tribal member residing on the reservation does not satisfy the residency requirement of \u00a7 46b-44.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\"> See footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\"> Connecticut formally recognizes members of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe as \u201cIndians\u201d and recognizes their reservation in Ledyard.
