The plaintiff, Cadle Company of Connecticut, Inc., brought an action for payment of a defaulted note against the promisor of the note, the named defendant, C.F.D. Development Corporation (debtor), and the note\u2019s guarantors, the defendants Arnold H. Foster, Jan E. Cohen and Mario DiRienzo III (guarantors). The jury returned a plaintiff s general verdict form but also, in response to interrogatories, found that the debtor owed the plaintiff zero and that the guarantors owed the plaintiff $1,539,114.32. Thereafter, on the debtor\u2019s motion, the trial court, <em>Gray, J., </em>set aside, in part, the jury verdict for the plaintiff and rendered judgment thereon for the debtor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court denied the guarantors\u2019 motions to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The guarantors appealed to the Appellate Court and the plaintiff cross appealed. The Appellate Court dismissed the plaintiffs cross appeal as untimely. The validity of that dismissal is not before us. The court did, however, consider the merits of the guarantors\u2019 appeal, and directed that judgment be rendered in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>favor. <em>Cadle Co. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>C.F.D. Development Corp., </em>44 Conn. App. 409, 415, 689 A.2d 1166 (1997). We then granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the guarantors on the note held by the plaintiff were not liable on their guarantee?\u201d <em>Cadle Co. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>C.F.D. Development Corp., </em>241 Conn. 901, 693 A.2d 303 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Having examined the record on appeal and studied the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we have concluded that our grant of certification was improvident. Because of procedural irregularities at trial, the present proceeding does not afford us a proper opportunity to reexamine the thorny relationship between a guarantor\u2019s broadly phrased undertaking to ensure payment of a debt and such a guarantor\u2019s access to surety-ship defenses. See, e.g., Restatement (Third), Suretyship and Guaranty pp. 156-57 and \u00a7\u00a7 37-49 and 67 (1995); see generally <em>Packtor </em>v. <em>Seppala &amp; AHO Construction Co., </em>231 Conn. 367, 370, 650 A.2d 534 (1994); <em>Shaham </em>v. <em>Capparelli, </em>219 Conn. 133, 135, 591 A.2d 1269 (1991); <em>Lawler </em>v. <em>Lawler, </em>212 Conn. 117, 119, 561 A.2d 128 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\"> We express no opinion about the propriety of the trial court\u2019s decision to render judgment for the debtor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b697-6\">BERDON, J., with whom, MCDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Au0\">joins, dissenting. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that certification to appeal was improvidently granted. Rather, I would reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court because of its faulty analysis of the jury\u2019s verdict, and order that judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Cadle Co. of Connecticut, Inc., against the defendant guarantors in the amount of $1,539,114.32 be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The majority dismisses the appeal \u201c[bjecause of procedural irregularities at trial,\u201d but fails specifically to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>identify those procedural irregularities that allegedly prevent it from examining \u201cthe thorny relationship between a guarantor\u2019s broadly phrased undertaking to ensure payment of a debt and such a guarantor\u2019s access to suretyship defenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The following facts relied upon by the Appellate Court are not in dispute. \u201cThe pleadings establish that by a note dated October 19,1987, the named defendant, C.F.D. Development Corporation (CFD), promised to pay $1,900,000 plus interest and costs of collection to the order of Shawmut Home Bank (Shawmut). The defendants Arnold H. Foster, Jan E. Cohen and Mario DiRienzo III (guarantors) guaranteed payment and performance of the note by an instrument also dated October 19, 1987.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The note fell into default. The plaintiff, Cadle Company of Connecticut, Inc., alleged that the note was assigned to it, that it became the actual bona fide owner of the note and beneficiary of the guarantee, and that at the time it instituted action against CFD and the guarantors, there was due and owing the sum of $1,461,017.67 plus interest, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>\u201cThe defendants denied that the amount claimed was due and that the plaintiff was the beneficiary of the guarantee. They alleged that they had no knowledge that Shawmut had exercised its option to declare all sums immediately due and payable and that the note and guarantee had been assigned to the plaintiff. The defendants also filed several special defenses, including a claim that Connecticut National Bank (CNB), a former holder, had impaired the value of the collateral by taking no action for an unreasonable time and allowed the value of the collateral to decrease significantly, and a claim that CNB, by refusing to accept title to the collateral when its appraised value was in excess of $2,000,000, had breached its covenant of good faith and fair dealing. None of the other special defenses went to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">\u201cAt the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a plaintiffs general verdict form, showing a recovery for the plaintiff from each of the defendants in the amount of $1,539,114.32. In addition, the following interrogatories were answered as indicated and returned by the jury: T. Do you find that Connecticut National Bank, after commencing its foreclosure action against the defendants and during the term of a Receiver appointed by the Court, took actual or constructive possession of the subject property (Phoenix Landing Condominiums)? Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">\u201c \u20182. Do you find that the bank acted unreasonably or failed to act reasonably in prosecuting the foreclosure action which it initiated in November, 1989? Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">\u201c \u2018If your answer to question No. 2 is affirmative, please proceed to question No. 3. If your answer is \u201cNo,\u201d then you are to proceed to question 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">\u201c \u20183. Do you find that the bank\u2019s conduct after bringing the foreclosure action was a proximate cause of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>decline in value of the subject property (Phoenix Landing Condominiums)? No. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">\u201c \u20185. What is the total amount, including interest, that you find is due and owed to the plaintiff?:</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\u201c \u2018By Defendant C.F.D. Development Corporation, Inc., $0.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\u201c \u2018By Guarantor Defendants (Cohen, Foster and DiRienzo) $1,539,114.32.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cadle Co. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>C.F.D. Development Corp., </em>44 Conn. App. 409, 410-12, 689 A.2d 1166 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Notwithstanding the inconsistency between the answers to the interrogatories, which found that CFD was not liable for any damages, and the general jury verdict, which, by entering judgment in favor of the plaintiff against all the defendants, found that both CFD and the guarantors owed the plaintiff $1,539,114.32, the trial court accepted the interrogatories and the general verdict in favor of the plaintiff and dismissed the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants jointly filed a motion to set aside the verdict, for entry of judgment and in arrest of judgment. \u201cIn addition, CFD filed a separate motion to set aside the verdict and for judgment. The trial court granted the motion to set aside the verdict as against CFD, corrected the general verdict and rendered judgment for CFD. No appeal was timely taken from this judgment in favor of CFD. The motion of the [guarantors] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>set aside the verdict was denied and judgment was rendered against them on the verdict.\u201d Id., 412-13.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The guarantors appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 415. We granted certification to appeal on the following issue: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the guarantors on the note held by the plaintiff were not liable on their guarantee?\u201d <em>Cadle Co. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>C.F.D. Development Corp., </em>241 Conn. 901, 693 A.2d 303 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The standard of review with respect to setting aside a jury verdict is clear. \u201cIn considering a motion to set aside the verdict, the court must determine whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, reasonably supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>194 Conn. 35, 41, 478 A.2d 596 (1984). The trial court\u2019s refusal to set aside the verdict is entitled to great weight and every reasonable presumption should be indulged in favor of its correctness. <em>Herb </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>[190 Conn. 136, 139, 459 A.2d 521 (1983)]; <em>Katsetos </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>[170 Conn. 637, 656, 368 A.2d 172 (1976)]. This is so because \u2018[f]rom the vantage point of the trial bench, a presiding judge can sense the atmosphere of a trial and can apprehend far better than we can, on the printed record, what factors, if any, could have improperly influenced the jury.\u2019 <em>Birgel </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>163 Conn. 23, 26, 301 A.2d 249 (1972) . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Griffin Hospital, </em>207 Conn. 125, 139, 540 A.2d 666 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">After reviewing three possible bases on which CFD could have prevailed at trial, the Appellate Court concluded that the verdict against the guarantors could not be reconciled with the verdict for CFD and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>responses to the interrogatories. Applying flawed reasoning,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Appellate Court concluded: (1) that the jury could have found that CFD had paid the note; and (2) that the special defense that CNB had violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by acting unreasonably or failed to act reasonably in prosecuting the foreclosure action was proven by the jury\u2019s answer to interrogatory two. <em>Cadle Co. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>C.F.D. Development Corp., </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 413-15. The Appellate Court then concluded that because both of these defenses would also apply to the guarantors, the judgment against the guarantors could not stand. Id., 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">I reject the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusions. First, the guarantors failed to allege<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or introduce any evidence at trial that the note was paid. Practice Book \u00a7 164; <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Dadi, </em>182 Conn. 530, 438 A.2d 733 (1980). Indeed, at oral argument before this court, counsel for the guarantors conceded it was not paid. Second, proof of the special defense of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in prosecuting the foreclosure action must be rejected because the jury found in the third interrogatory that CNB\u2019s conduct after bringing the foreclosure was not the proximate cause of the decline of the value of the security. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>the instructions for the second interrogatory specifically led the jury to the third interrogatory in which it concluded that CNB\u2019s conduct was harmless.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">It is fundamental that the specific contract provisions between the parties control the extent of the guarantee. Restatement (Third), Suretyship and Guaranty \u00a7 6 (1996) (\u201c[e]ach rule in this Restatement stating the effect of suretyship status may be varied by contract between the parties subject to it\u201d). Indeed, in <em>American Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Valenti, </em>179 Conn. 349, 426 A.2d 305 (1979), this court, in a unanimous decision, held that a judgment of nonsuit rendered for the principal debtor did not discharge the liability of one who undertook by contract to guarantee absolutely the payment of the outstanding debt. As a result of the disciplinary nonsuit, judgment was rendered in favor of the principal debtor, which, like this case, was not appealed by the plaintiff. In <em>American Oil Co., </em>Justice Peters, relying upon her own bar journal article, wrote: \u201cThe mere fact that a suit against the principal debtor resulted in a nonsuit cannot be a defense to a surety who has agreed to pay regardless of whether and when demand for payment is made upon another. See Peters, A Negotiable Instruments Primer 64-65 (1974).\u201d <em>American Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Valenti, </em>supra, 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The guarantor in <em>American Oil Co., </em>James Valenti, undertook \u201c[o]n the contract of guaranty . . .as a\u2018primary obligation,\u2019 to guarantee \u2018absolutely and unconditionally . . . the prompt payment of all sums of money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>. . . unpaid by the principal debtor . . . .\u2019 The contract expressly waived, inter alia, \u2018failure upon the part of the Obligee ... to make demand or use diligence.\u2019 On both documents [the note and the guarantee], therefore, James Valenti agreed to be a surety, a person who would be primarily hable for payment without regard to any prior demand for payment from [the principal debtor].\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">In my view, the language of the guarantee in this case is at least as extensive as that in <em>American Oil Co.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The guarantee here provided in relevant part that \u201ceach of the undersigned Guarantors . . . unconditionally guarantee [d] by [the Guaranty] the payment and performance from or by the Borrower of any and all obligations from the Borrower to the Lender (the \u2018Obligations\u2019).\u201d Moreover, the guarantors also agreed to be primarily liable for payment: \u201c[T]he liability of the Guarantor[s] hereunder is direct and unconditional and may be enforced without requiring the Lender first to resort to any other right, remedy or security . . . .\u201d Finally, the guarantors agreed that their obligation did not terminate until the lender had been paid in full: \u201c[T]his Guaranty is, and shall be as to the Guarantor continuing, and shall not terminate unless and until all of the Obligations have been paid in full; and that if there is more than one Guarantor, the liability of the Guarantors hereunder shall be joint and several.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In light of the guarantors\u2019 concession that the note was not paid, the flawed analysis of the second and third jury interrogatories, and the broad and unconditional language of the guarantee, I would reverse the Appellate Court and direct that the judgment of the trial court awarding the plaintiff damages in the amount of $1,539,114.32 be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-5\"> The guarantee, in the form of a letter to Shawmut provided in relevant part: \u201c[1] To induce Shawmut Home Bank (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Lender\u2019) to make a loan in the amount of ONE MILLION NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND ($1,900,000.00) DOLLARS (the \u2018Loan\u2019) to CFD DEVELOPMENT CORP.

See General Statutes \u00a7 53-223 (\u201cThe court may, if it judges the jury has mistaken the evidence in the action and has brought in a verdict contrary to the evidence, or has brought in a verdict contrary to the direction of the court in a matter of law, return them to a second consideration, and for the same reason may return them to a third consideration.
