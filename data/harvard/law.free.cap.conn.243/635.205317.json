J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3W\">The plaintiff, the Connecticut Light and Power Company, appeals from a trial court judgment affirming a decision by the defendant department of public utility control (department),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> upon a request by the plaintiff for certain declaratory rulings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 4-176(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its appeal, the plaintiff raises the following three issues: (1) whether the trial court employed the proper standard of review for a conclusion of law by an administrative agency; (2) whether the trial court properly concluded that Texas-Ohio Power, Inc. (Texas-Ohio), a Texas corporation, is not an \u201celectric light company\u201d under General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 33-286 (b) and, consequently, is not prohibited, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 33-395, from selling electricity to retail customers in Connecticut, despite the lack of legislative authorization; and (3) whether the trial court properly concluded that a Texas corporation authorized under the general incorporation laws of Texas to engage in any lawful business is not a \u201cforeign electric company\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 16-246a (1) and, therefore, is not prohibited by General Statutes \u00a7 16-246c from selling electricity to retail customers in Connecticut. We conclude that the standard of review applied by the trial court was too deferential. We affirm the judgment of the trial court on the second issue on alternative grounds and reverse the decision of the trial court with respect to the third issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The facts and procedural history are undisputed. Texas-Ohio is a Texas corporation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> operating an energy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>cogeneration plant in Manchester. The cogeneration plant is located on land leased from the Central Connecticut Co-operative Farmers\u2019 Association (Co-op). Texas-Ohio negotiated contracts to sell the electricity it generates at its plant to the Co-op, which is located on the same parcel of land as its plant, and to an adjacent landowner, the Rogers Coiporation (Rogers), both of which are former customers of the plaintiff. The contracts require Texas-Ohio to maintain poles and wires to transmit its electricity on private property only. No aspect of Texas-Ohio\u2019s generation and transmission of electricity pursuant to its contracts with Rogers and the Co-op require it to utilize the public highways and streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The plaintiff, a Connecticut corporation, is a \u201cpublic service company\u201d and an \u201celectric company\u201d as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 16-1 (a) (4) and (8) respectively. As such, it is subject to regulation by the department, the state agency charged by \u00a7 16-1 et seq. with the regulation of public service companies, including electric companies. In return, it is legislatively protected from unauthorized competition. See <em>Groton </em>v. <em>Yankee Gas Services Co., </em>224 Conn. 675, 685-86, 620 A.2d 771 (1993). The plaintiff is vested, by special acts of the General Assembly, with an exclusive franchise to sell electricity in Manchester.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">On August 3, 1995, the plaintiff sought a declaratory ruling from the department that Texas-Ohio\u2019s retail sale of electricity to the Co-op and Rogers violates Connecticut statutes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Texas-Ohio is a foreign stock corporation and, as such, is prohibited under \u00a7 \u00a7 33-395 and 33-286 (b) from selling electricity to retail customers in Connecticut without express legislative authorization.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Additionally, the plaintiff asserted that Texas-Ohio is a \u201cforeign electric company\u201d under \u00a7 16-246a (1) and, therefore, is prohibited from selling electricity to retail customers in Connecticut pursuant to \u00a7 16-246c.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The department ruled that Texas-Ohio is not an \u201celectric company\u201d as defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>in \u00a7 16-1 (a) (8)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and, therefore, is not an \u201celectric light company\u201d under \u00a7 33-286 (b), concluding that both terms have the same meaning. It further concluded that Texas-Ohio is not a \u201cforeign electric company\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 16-246a (1), again because it is not an \u201celectric company\u201d as defined in \u00a7 16-1 (a) (8). Accordingly, the department denied the plaintiffs request for declaratory rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the department to the Superior Court. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 16-35 and 4-183. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to meet its burden of proving that \u201cthe agency, in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>evidence, has acted arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d It concluded that the department\u2019s interpretation of the statutes at issue was \u201centirely reasonable\u201d and affirmed the department\u2019s decision without engaging in any independent statutory analysis. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The first issue presented is whether the trial court employed the proper standard in reviewing the decision of the department. The standard of review of an agency decision is well established. \u201cOrdinarily, this court affords deference to the construction of a statute applied by the administrative agency empowered by law to carry out the statute\u2019s purposes. . . . [A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. . . . <em>Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . </em>Furthermore, when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny . . . the agency is not entitled to special deference.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>239 Conn. 638, 645, 687 A.2d 134 (1997); see also <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>236 Conn. 722, 735-36, 675 A.2d 430 (1996); <em>Angelsea Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>236 Conn. 681, 688, 674 A.2d 1300 (1996); <em>SLI International Corp. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>236 Conn. 156, 170-71, 671 A.2d 813 (1996); <em>Dept. of Administrative Services </em>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>226 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Conn. 670, 678-79, 628 A.2d 957 (1993); <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>216 Conn. 253, 263, 579 A.2d 505 (1990); <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>208 Conn. 709, 718-19, 546 A.2d 830 (1988). \u201c \u2018[I]t is for the <em>courts, and not administrative agencies, </em>to expound and apply governing principles of law.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 133, 140, 509 A.2d 1050 (1986); accord <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>211 Conn. 508, 521, 560 A.2d 403 (1989); <em>Southington </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>210 Conn. 549, 558, 556 A.2d 166 (1989); <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>209 Conn. 381, 385-86, 551 A.2d 724 (1988); <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>supra, 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">There were no disputed facts before the department. The resolution of the questions presented by the plaintiff for declaratory rulings rested entirely on the department\u2019s interpretation of the applicable statutes and the legal meaning to be attributed to specific phrases in those statutes. The questions before the department were, therefore, purely questions of law. Moreover, these questions of law previously had not been subjected to judicial scrutiny.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision indicates that the standard of review applied by the trial court was too deferential. In articulating the standard it employed, the trial court; stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>that its \u201cultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion,\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted), quoting <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 51, 58, 591 A.2d 1231 (1991). After summarizing the department\u2019s analysis, the court concluded only that the department\u2019s interpretation of the applicable statutes was \u201centirely reasonable.\u201d As noted previously, it is well established that this deferential standard is not applicable to the court\u2019s review of an agency\u2019s construction of a statute, which is a pure question of law, particularly when the question has not been subjected to prior judicial review. We conclude that under the circumstances, the trial court applied a standard of review that was too deferential when it affirmed the department\u2019s unfavorable response to the plaintiffs request for declaratory rulings. See <em>SLI International Corp. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 170. Because appellate review of conclusions of law is plenary, we will review the substantive merits of the trial court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The second issue raised by the plaintiff is whether the trial court properly concluded that a foreign stock corporation selling electricity at retail without utilizing the public highways is not an \u201celectric light company\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 33-286 (b) and, therefore, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>permitted to sell electricity to retail customers in Connecticut pursuant to \u00a7 33-395 without legislative authorization. The resolution of this issue rests upon an interpretation of the relevant statutes, which are \u00a7\u00a7 33-395 and 33-286 (b). \u201cWhen we engage in statutory interpretation, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>234 Conn. 78, 86-87, 662 A.2d 80, cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1009, 116 S. Ct. 565, 133 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Section 33-395 provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o foreign corporation referred to in subsection (b) of section 33-286 . . . shall transact in this state the business authorized by its certificate of incorporation or by the laws of the state under which it was organized, unless empowered so to do by some general or special act of this state . . . .\u201d Section 33-286 (b) provides that \u201c[n]o corporation formed under this chapter [i.e., a domestic corporation] shall have power <em>to transact in this state the business of a </em>telegraph company, gas, <em>electric light </em>or water <em>company, </em>or cemetery corporation, <em>or of any company, </em>except a telephone company, <em>requiring the right to take and condemn lands or to occupy the public highways of this state.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) When these two statutes are interpreted together, we recognize that a foreign stock corporation, like a domestic corporation, may be precluded from transacting in Connecticut \u201cthe business of [an] . . . electric light . . . company\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 33-286 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>(b); without express legislative authorization. The plaintiff argues, therefore, that \u00a7 33-395 prohibits Texas-Ohio, admittedly a foreign stock corporation, from selling electricity at retail in Connecticut without express authorization of the legislature because such sales constitute the business of an \u201celectric light company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The defendants counter that Texas-Ohio is not an \u201celectric hght company\u201d and that the statutory prohibition in \u00a7 33-395 is inapplicable. \u201cElectric fight company\u201d is not explicitly defined in \u00a7\u00a7 33-395 or 33-286. It is necessary, therefore, to establish its meaning relative to the statutes in issue. To that end, the department looked to the definition of an \u201celectric company\u201d in \u00a7 16-1 (a) (8). There, an \u201celectric company\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as \u201cevery corporation . . . owning, leasing, maintaining, operating, managing or controlling poles, wires, conduits or other fixtures, <em>along public highways or streets, for the transmission or distribution of electric current for sale </em>for fight, heat or power within this state, <em>or engaged in generating electricity to be so transmitted or distributed for such purpose . . </em>. .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The department determined that because the legislature is presumed to harmonize statutes; <em>Tolly </em>v. <em>Dept. of Human Resources, </em>225 Conn. 13, 28, 621 A.2d 719 (1993); the terms \u201celectric fight company\u201d and \u201celectric company\u201d have the same meaning in both statutes. It concluded that because Texas-Ohio does not generate electricity to be transmitted or distributed on poles, wires, conduits or other fixtures, along public highways or streets, it is neither an \u201celectric company\u201d nor an \u201celectric fight company\u201d and, therefore, is not precluded by \u00a7 33-395 from selling its electricity at retail without legislative authorization in the limited circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Although Texas-Ohio urges us to agree with the department and conclude that the terms \u201celectric light company\u201d and \u201celectric company\u201d have the same meaning, we are not inclined to go that far. The two terms are different and they appear in unrelated statutory schemes. Related terms appearing in different titles unrelated to the same subject do not give proper guidance in statutory interpretation. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>179 Conn. 415, 422, 426 A.2d 1324 (1980). Moreover, an interpretation that the two terms at issue have different meanings would not necessarily create disharmony among the statutes. There is insufficient support in the text and legislative history of the statutes in question to justify a conclusion that the legislature intended that these terms be accorded the same meaning. Nonetheless, we agree with the department\u2019s conclusion that Texas-Ohio is not precluded <em>by \u00a7 33-395 </em>from engaging in the sale of electricity at retail to the Co-op and to Rogers, an endeavor that does not require Texas-Ohio to utilize the public highways or streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">We begin our statutory analysis by noting that both \u00a7 33-395 and \u00a7 33-286 are within the Business Corporation Act. They are not part of title 16 governing public service companies and vesting the department with authority to regulate those companies. Sections 33-395 and 33-286 were first enacted in 1901 in substantially the same form as they exist today. Public Acts 1901, c. 157, \u00a7 2, the predecessor to \u00a7 33-286, provided: \u201cAny three or more persons may associate to form a corporation for the transaction of any lawful business, <em>except </em>that of a bank, a savings bank, a trust company, a building and loan association, an insurance company, a surety or indemnity company, a steam railroad or street railway company, a telegraph company, a gas, electric light, or water company, or any company which shall need to have the right to take and condemn lands or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>to occupy the public highways of this state. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In addition, \u00a7 51 of that act, the predecessor to \u00a7 33-395, provided that \u201cno foreign corporation shall engage or continue in any kind of business in this state, the transaction of which is not permitted to domestic corporations [under \u00a7 2] by the laws of this state.\u201d The language of \u00a7 51 was amended by Public Acts 1903, c. 194, \u00a7 81, to approximate the language as it currently appears in \u00a7 33-395.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We have interpreted the language of \u00a7 51 to permit \u201ccorporations established under the laws of other States to exercise in this State their appropriate corporate powers in the transaction of any kind of business permitted to a domestic corporation formed under the Corporation Act of 1901; and [to forbid] corporations of other States to engage in any kind of business in this State which is not permitted to domestic corporations formed under said Act.\u201d <em>Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co. of New York </em>v. Smith, 74 Conn. 625, 628, 51 A. 609 (1902). We later affirmed that interpretation notwithstanding the textual change to the predecessor to \u00a7 33-395 in 1903. <em>Equitable Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Plume, </em>92 Conn. 649, 654-56, 103 A. 940 (1918). \u201c[W]e presume that the legislature has knowledge of this longstanding construction which this court has given to the objective and purpose of legislation in this field. . . . We also presume that the legislature is aware of the effect that its action or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>inaction will have on an existing statute, and to intend the effect that its action or inaction produces.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fair Cadillac-Oldsmobile Isuzu Partnership </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>229 Conn. 312, 321, 640 A.2d 101 (1994). Through numerous reenactments leading to the present \u00a7\u00a7 33-395 and 33-286 (b), the legislature has made no textual change that would persuade us that it does not concur in our statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">With that historical perspective on the function and purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 33-395 and 33-286 (b) in mind, we turn to the present case. Section 33-286 precludes domestic corporations from engaging in a variety of businesses without legislative authorization. Subsection (b) specifically prohibits a domestic corporation from \u201ctransact[ing] in this state the business of a[n] . . . electric light . . . company ... or of any company . . . requiring the right to take and condemn lands or to occupy the public highways of this state.\u201d Admittedly, the phrase \u201crequiring the right to condemn land or to occupy the public highways\u201d grammatically does not relate back to modify, and thereby define, the term \u201celectric light company.\u201d It does, however, inform our consideration of what the legislature intended when enacting that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 33-286, unfortunately, is sparse and generally uninformative as to the intended meaning of the term \u201celectric light company.\u201d We note, however, that the predecessor to \u00a7 33-286 enacted in 1901; Public Acts 1901, c. 157, \u00a7 2; contains the same catch-all phrase that prohibits any company that requires the right to use the public highway or condemn land from transacting business without further legislative authority. The only notable difference between the original act and the present \u00a7 33-286 is that the 1901 statute contained only one relevant section comprised of a comprehensive list of all of the businesses in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>domestic corporations could not engage under the general incorporation provisions. That list included businesses such as banks and insurance companies as well as public service companies. The legislature later divided this original, comprehensive list into several subsections containing related businesses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At present, subsection (a) governs banks and related businesses including savings banks, building and loan associations, and trust companies. Subsection (c) of \u00a7 33-286 governs insurance companies and related businesses including surety and indemnity companies. Subsection (b) refers only to public service types of businesses including telegraph, telephone, gas, water and electric light companies, and to cemetery corporations. It includes the catch-all provision applicable to businesses that require use of the public streets or the right to condemn land. The only logical reason we can discern as to why the legislature left the catch-all phrase in the same subsection as electric light companies is that it considered electric light companies, as well as all of the other businesses named, as businesses similar to those included in the catch-all phrase and \u201crequiring the right to take and condemn lands or to occupy the public highways of this state.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 33-286 (b). If the two are unrelated, we are persuaded that the legislature would have separated the various public utility types of businesses and the phrase \u201crequiring the right to take and condemn lands or to occupy the public highways of this state\u201d into separate subsections as it did with entities related to insurance and banking.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>We conclude that for puiposes of \u00a7 33-286 (b), the legislature intended an \u201celectric light company\u201d to be a company that requires the right to occupy the public highways and streets and to condemn land to conduct its business. If Texas-Ohio were a domestic corporation incoiporated under the laws of the state of Connecticut to engage in any lawful business, we believe that it would be permitted, notwithstanding \u00a7 33-286 (b), to engage in the retail sale of electricity to the Co-op and Rogers because those sales do not require it either to utilize the public highways or streets or to condemn land.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Consequently, Texas-Ohio is not transacting the business of an \u201celectric light company\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 33-286 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>As previously noted, we have interpreted \u00a7 33-395 to permit a foreign corporation to transact any business that a domestic corporation could transact pursuant to \u00a7 33-286 (b) and as prohibiting foreign corporations from engaging in only those businesses in which a domestic corporation would not be permitted to engage pursuant to \u00a7 33-286 (b). See <em>Equitable Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Plume, </em>supra, 92 Conn. 654-56; <em>Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co. of New York </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 74 Conn. 628. The purpose of \u00a7 33-395, as interpreted, would not be effectuated if Texas-Ohio, solely because it is a foreign corporation, were precluded, without further legislative authorization, from engaging in the same business in which a domestic corporation could engage without such authorization. Consequently, <em>there is no basis in the Business Corporation Act, </em>specifically \u00a7\u00a7 33-395 and 33-286 (b), for precluding Texas-Ohio from engaging in the transactions complained of by the plaintiff. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s affirmance of the department\u2019s ruling denying the plaintiffs request for a favorable declaratory ruling on the effect of \u00a7\u00a7 33-395 and 33-286 (b) was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The final issue presented by the plaintiff is whether the trial court correctly agreed with the department\u2019s conclusion that a foreign corporation authorized under the general incorporation laws of the state wherein it is incorporated to engage in any lawful business, which, a fortiori, includes transmitting and generating electricity, is nonetheless not a \u201cforeign electric company\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 16-246a (1) and, consequently, is not prohibited by \u00a7 16-246c from selling electricity to retail customers in Connecticut. Section 16-246c (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNotwithstanding any limitations otherwise imposed by the general statutes on the transacting of an electric utility business in this state, any <em>foreign </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number><em>electric company </em>is authorized and empowered to generate and transmit electric energy, and to acquire utility facilities necessary or convenient for the purposes of its electric utility business or undivided interests therein and to operate the same, anywhere within this state; <em>provided, unless otherwise authorized by the general statutes or any special act of this state, no such company shall have the power (1) to sell electric energy in this state to persons other than electric companies </em>(Emphasis added.) The parties agree that if Texas-Ohio is a \u201cforeign electric company,\u201d the retail sale of electricity to the Co-op and Rogers would be a violation of \u00a7 16-246c. Texas-Ohio argues that it is not a \u201cforeign electric company\u201d because it is not an \u201celectric company\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 16-1 (a) (8) and because \u00a7 16-246a (1) is intended to apply only to foreign public utilities subject to regulation as such in their states of incorporation. Relying on this alleged intent of the legislature with respect to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 16-246a through 16-246d, the department agreed with Texas-Ohio\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of \u201cforeign electric company.\u201d We find no such limitation in the statute\u2019s unambiguous text and, therefore, do not agree with the department\u2019s interpretation or its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The term \u201cforeign electric company\u201d is a statutorily defined term that appears in \u00a7 16-246a, a section containing definitions expressly applicable to \u00a7 16-246c. \u201c \u2018[C]ourts are bound to accept the legislative definition of terms in a statute\u2019; <em>Toll Gate Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milk Regulation Board, </em>148 Conn. 341, 347, 170 A.2d 883 (1961) . . . .\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 225, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992). Section 16-246a (1) provides that a \u201c \u2018[fjoreign electric company\u2019 means a corporation . . . organized under the laws of a state other than this state . . . <em>authorized </em>under the laws of the state in which organized to generate or transmit electric energy . . . .\u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>added.) Nowhere in \u00a7 16-246a or \u00a7 16-246c is there a reference to \u00a7 16-1 for aid in defining \u201cforeign electric company\u201d; indeed, the opposite is true. Section 16-246a (4) requires that <em>\u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided in sections 16-246a to 16-246d, </em>inclusive, terms which are defined in section 16-1 shall have the respective meanings specified therein.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because the definition of \u201cforeign electric company\u201d is \u201cotherwise provided\u201d in \u00a7 16-246a (1), \u00a7 16-246a (4) explicitly mandates that the definitions in \u00a7 16-1 do not control the interpretation of the meaning of that term as used in \u00a7\u00a7 16-246a through 16-246d.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Furthermore, the term \u201celectric company\u201d appears nowhere in the text of the statutory definition of a \u201cforeign electric company\u201d in \u00a7 16-246a (1). By contrast, the definition of a \u201cdomestic electric company\u201d contained in \u00a7 16-246a (2) is \u201can electric company organized under the laws of this state . . . .\u201d This provision, in conjunction with \u00a7 16-246a (4), evinces a legislative intent to refer to \u00a7 16-1 (a) (8) for the definition of an \u201celectric company\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 16-246a (2), but not \u00a7 16-246a (1). If the legislature had intended the same definition to be applicable to a \u201cforeign electric company,\u201d it could have employed the same language in subdivision (1) as it employed in subdivision (2) of \u00a7 16-246a. In the absence of such language, it is reasonable to conclude that the legislature intended a different, broader definition of a \u201cforeign electric company\u201d than simply an \u201celectric company,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 16-1 (a) (8), incorporated in a foreign state.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The unambiguous definition in \u00a7 16-246a (1) raises two questions that, if answered in the affirmative, require a conclusion that a corporation is a \u201cforeign electric company\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 16-246c. First, is the corporation organized under the laws of a state other than Connecticut? The answer to that question is obviously in the affirmative because it is undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>that Texas-Ohio is organized under the laws of the state of Texas. Second, if a corporation is a foreign corporation, is the corporation <em>authorized </em>under the laws of the state in which it is incorporated to generate or transmit electric energy? Again, the answer is in the affirmative. Texas law <em>authorizes </em>corporations organized under its general incorporation laws to engage in any lawful business. See Tex. Bus. Corp. Act Ann. art. 3.02 (A) (3) (West 1998 Pocket Part). There is no limitation in Texas law prohibiting a domestic corporation from engaging in the business of generating or transmitting electric energy, which is a lawful activity. It would appear, then, that Texas-Ohio is a \u201cforeign electric company\u201d that is prohibited from selling electricity at retail in Connecticut to the ultimate consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The defendants argue that this interpretation is overly broad and in conflict with the legislative purpose of the statutory scheme of \u00a7\u00a7 16-246a through 16-246d. They contend that it is appropriate to look to the legislative purpose because the language of the statute is ambiguous. The ambiguity, they argue, stems from their assertion that the phrase, \u201cauthorized under the laws of the state in which organized to generate or transmit electric energy\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 16-246a (1); is not self-explanatory. They maintain that the phrase is meant to include only those corporations that are affirmatively chartered for that purpose.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We find no such limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>in the statutory language. \u201cWe will not torture the words or sentence structure of a statute to import an ambiguity where the ordinary meaning of the language leaves no room for it.\u201d <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>210 Conn. 531, 543, 556 A.2d 572 (1989). Affirmative authorization is not the only means by which a corporation obtains authority to generate or transmit electric energy. A Texas corporation, for example, is vested with authority to generate and transmit electric energy by virtue of its statutory authorization to engage in any lawful business, without limitation. It cannot be said, as the defendants argue, that Texas-Ohio is not authorized to generate or transmit electric energy simply because the Texas legislature did not affirmatively charter it for that purpose. In Texas, an affirmative charter is not required. Section 16-246a (1) is necessarily broad in order to bring within its reach any foreign corporation that <em>could </em>generate or transmit electric energy.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">We believe that the statute is plain and unambiguous on its face and that it is unnecessary to look beyond its text to the legislative purpose. Ordinarily, \u201cwhen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 430, 650 A.2d 557 (1994); <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>228 Conn. 498, 508, 636 A.2d 1342 (1994). Moreover, even if we consider the legislative purpose, which was to allow foreign utility companies to engage in joint ventures with domestic utilities, it does not militate in favor of the defendants\u2019 interpretation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>We conclude that Texas-Ohio is a \u201cforeign electric company\u201d as defined by \u00a7 16-246a (1) and, therefore, it is prohibited, unless otherwise authorized, from engaging in the retail sale of electricity by \u00a7 16-246c (a) (1). Consequently, the trial court improperly affirmed the department\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs request for a declaratory ruling that Texas-Ohio is a foreign electric company and, as such, is not authorized to sell electricity at retail in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment determining that Texas-Ohio is a foreign electric company as defined in \u00a7 16-246a (1) and, consequently, is prohibited from engaging in the sale of electricity at retail to the ultimate consumer by \u00a7 16-246c (a) (1), thereby sustaining the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-11\"> There axe three defendants in this action: Texas-Ohio Power, Inc.; the department; and the office of consumer counsel, the state agency that serves as consumer advocate with respect to public service agencies.

The plaintiff argues that the decision rested on the conclusion that an injunction was not proper until the department issued its ruling, and the statutory interpretation language is mere dicta. We need not decide whether the injunction proceeding constituted a prior judicial interpretation affording this aspect of the department\u2019s decision a right to special deference because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>we conclude that the department\u2019s decision, if not its reasoning, was correct with respect to this issue.

Section 62 of the 1903 act, which is identical to \u00a7 2 of the 1901 act, is the predecessor to \u00a7 33-286. The only significant change in the present statute is that the list of businesses that foreign corporations may not transact has been decreased from all of those appearing in \u00a7 2 to only those noted in \u00a7 33-286 (b), i.e., public service companies.

Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 46.05, p. 103 . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 91.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\"> In its decision, the department relied heavily on an 1893 statute and a 1909 amendment regarding limitations on the sale of electricity, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>repealed in 1915; Public Ads 1915, c. 228; in determining the meaning of an \u201celectric light company.\u201d The 1893 statute authorized private generation of energy by a landowner and the sale of electricity to a tenant on the same property. The 1909 amendment to that statute more broadly granted permission to sell electricity as long as it was not done over or along the public streets. Public Acts 1909, c. 254. The statute at issue here, \u00a7 33-286, was first adopted in 1901 in a separate statute, wholly independent of the 1893 and 1909 statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">In its brief, the department contends that its analysis of the 1893 and 1909 statutes nonetheless was appropriate. It looked to those statutes not as controlling or determinative of the intent of the 1901 legislature, but as helpful in informing its understanding of what the legislature might have considered the definition of an \u201celectric light company\" in 1901 when it adopted the predecessor to \u00a7 33-286. Because of the dearth of legislative history on \u00a7 33-286 and its predecessors, it is reasonable to look to any piece of the legislative history that may aid the understanding of the meaning of the statute. The 1893 and 1909 statutes are roughly contemporaneous with the 1901 statute. They are more helpful in understanding how t,urn-of-the-century lawmakers viewed the sale of electricity than is any current provision. It was not unreasonable, therefore, to seek guidance in their language. Their key concern seemed to be directed only at regulating electricity sales that required occupying the public streets. Such an understanding comports with our interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 33-286 (b) and 33-395.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b679-7\"> We emphasize that the conclusion we reach today is limited by the specific facts presented. Texas-Ohio, in the transactions complained of, delivers electricity over private property only and makes no use of the public streets for its generation or transmission of electricity. If, for example, Texas-Ohio delivered electricity to a neighbor across a public street, the conclusion would be different under \u00a7\u00a7 33-395 and 33-286 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b683-6\"> The department conceded at oral argument that this interpretation of the statute would allow a foreign corporation like Texas-Ohio to engage in the business of an electric company without authorization by our legislature, by avoiding public streets, and not be subject to regulation simply because it is not expressly chartered as an electric company. This would enable such a corporation to set up a network for electricity distribution over private ways, for example in a private subdivision, and be free from all regulation by the department, including rate regulation and other consumer protection. We do not believe the legislature intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The defendants assert that public policy in this state regarding electric companies and competition is changing in favor of such an interpretation and they anticipate that the legislature will act accordingly in its next session. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>The defendants maybe correct, but the legislature has given us no indication of this policy change. The legislature is free to modify or clarify the policy as it desires. Until it does so, however, we are limited to an interpretation of the statutes as presently written.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\"> The purpose of these statutory provisions, as articulated by the sponsor of the bill, was to allow foreign electric companies to engage in joint ventures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>with domestic utility companies in this state in order to create generating plants to meet the growing need for electricity. 11 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2, 1965 Sess., p. 883, remarks of Representative Ralph Brown. The legislature was aware of a proposed plan for such generating plants that included participation by a foreign corporation and enacted this legislation to implement that plan. Id. Notwithstanding, the legislature apparently did not want foreign corporations to have the same status as domestic electric companies. Thus, prohibition of the retail sale of electricity and the right to occupy the public streets or condemn lands was included in the legislation. Nothing in this stated purpose is inconsistent with our interpretation. To the contrary, our interpretation prevents all foreign corporations that could sell electricity at retail, including those affirmatively chartered for that purpose, from achieving the privileged status enjoyed by legislatively authorized domestic electric companies, namely, the right to sell electricity at retail and the right to condemn land and occupy the public streets.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
