Sess. P. A. 94-1), authorized the revocation of a permit to carry a pistol held by a person convicted of an offense before the effective date of that public act. We conclude that \u00a7 29-32,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as amended, requires the defendant, Kenneth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Kirschner, the commissioner of public safety (commissioner), to revoke the permit to carry a pistol held by an individual convicted of a disqualifying criminal offense before the effective date of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The facts are not in dispute. On April 16, 1989, the plaintiff, Austin Taylor, was issued a state permit to carry a pistol pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 29-28. In April, 1991, he was convicted of possession of marijuana in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (c). In April, 1994, he renewed his permit to carry a pistol for a five year period pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Following the passage of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-1,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which became effective October 1, 1994, the commissioner revoked Taylor\u2019s permit to carry a pistol, and Taylor appealed to the board of firearms permit examiners (board), which upheld that revocation. Taylor then appealed that decision to the Superior Court, which also upheld the revocation. He thereafter appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Taylor argues that the legislature did not intend that Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-1, \u00a7 6, be applied retroactively, and that his permit should not have been revoked because his conviction occurred prior to the effective date of the act. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">We conclude that Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-1, \u00a7 6, required the revocation of Taylor\u2019s permit for a crime of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>he had been convicted prior to the act\u2019s effective date. Whether this legislation should be applied in this manner depends upon a determination of the legislature\u2019s intent. \u201cThe rules of statutory construction that govern the applicability of new legislation to preexisting transactions are well established. . . . [W]e have uniformly interpreted [General Statutes] \u00a7 55-3<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as a rule of presumed legislative intent that statutes affecting substantive rights shall apply prospectively only. . . . The Legislature only rebuts this presumption when it clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Vermilyn Brown, Inc., </em>232 Conn. 780, 786, 657 A.2d 616 (1995). The parties agree that Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-1, \u00a7 6, affects Taylor\u2019s substantive right to bear arms and, therefore, \u00a7 55-3 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Special Session Public Act 94-1 and its legislative history reveal the legislature\u2019s clear intent that \u00a7 29-32 be applied retrospectively. The act itself provides the most compelling indicia of the legislature\u2019s intent that it apply to current permit holders with past convictions. The act clearly requires the revocation of such permits held by persons acquitted within the past twenty years of a crime on grounds of mental illness, those committed within the past twelve months because of mental illness, and persons subject to court-issued restraining orders involving use or threats of physical force, as well as individuals convicted under \u00a7 21a-279 (c), among other offenses. General Statutes \u00a7 29-28 (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plain language of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-1, \u00a7 6, requires the commissioner to revoke the permit when past circumstances show unfitness, as determined by the legislature, to carry a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Moreover, because Taylor has been convicted of \u00a7 2 la-279, \u00a7 3 of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-1 made his future possession of a handgun a felony. See footnote 2 of this opinion. It cannot be maintained that the legislature intended both to allow the plaintiff to retain his permit to carry a pistol and, at the same time, to criminalize his doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The legislative history also supports the conclusion that the provisions of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-1, \u00a7 6, were to be applied to all persons convicted of the disqualifying offenses, without regard to when they were convicted. In interpreting legislative intent, we look to the history of the act, its objective, and its underlying policy. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 554, 400 A.2d 712 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">A cosponsor of the bill, Representative Robert G. Gilligan, made introductory comments that reveal the legislation was intended to take away the right to possess handguns from persons who \u201cdemonstrated by their conduct <em>in.the past </em>that they are not fit subjects to possess or purchase a handgun.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 37 H.R. Proc., Pt. 26, Spec. Sess., July, 1994, p. 9279. With regard to Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-1, Senator George Jepsen stated: \u201cVery briefly, what the bill does is to broaden the criteria for disqualifying certain individuals based on their own criminal behavior, past criminal behavior, or conditions that are innate to them, certain mental diseases that disqualify them for permission to purchase or own a gun.\u201d 37 S. Proc., Pt. 10, Spec. Sess., July, 1994, p. 3543. It is clear from these remarks that Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-1, \u00a7 6, was intended to revoke the permits of those persons deemed unsuitable to carry handguns, whether because of past or future events.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The purpose of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-1, \u00a7 6, was to protect the public from the misuse of handguns. When read in that light, it is clear the legislation not only prohibited the issuance of pistol permits to individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>who are unfit to carry handguns but also provided for the revocation of existing permits held by individuals shown to be unfit to carry handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-32, as amended by Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-1, \u00a7 6, provides in relevant part: \u201cAny permit for the carrying of any pistol . . . may be revoked by <em>the </em>authority issuing the same for cause and shall be revoked by the authority issuing the same upon conviction of the holder of such a permit of [a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (c)] or upon the occurrence of any event which would have disqualified the holder from being issued the permit pursuant to subsection (b) of \u00a7 29-28.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">General Statutes \u00a7 29-28 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo permit to carry a pistol . . . shall be issued under this subsection if the applicant ...

(4) has been confined in a hospital for mental illness . . . within the preceding twelve months ...

Sess. P.A. 94-1, now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217 (c), provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver when he possesses a pistol or revolver . . . and . . . has been convicted ... of a violation of subsection (c) of section 21a-279 ....</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u201c(b) Criminal possession of a pistol or revolver is a class D felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Section 4 (b) of Spec.
