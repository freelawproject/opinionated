We reverse the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed. While employed by the named defendant, Mattatuck Manufacturing Company (Mattatuck), between October 14, 1970, and August 18, 1987, the plaintiff sustained a repetitive trauma injury to his back caused by his employment. During that period, Mattatuck was insured for workers\u2019 compensation liability by four different carriers. The defendant Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty) was Mattatuck\u2019s insurer for a five year period commencing in 1970 and ending in 1975; the defendant Travelers Insurance Company (Travelers) was the insurer for a five year period commencing in 1976 and ending in 1980; American Mutual was the insurer for a six year period commencing in 1981 and ending in 1987; and Fireman\u2019s Fund was the insurer for a one year period commencing in 1987 and ending in 1988. Fireman\u2019s Fund, as the last insurer on the risk, became initially liable for the plaintiffs award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-299b and paid benefits to him for a period of 104 weeks totaling $54,457.39. Thereafter, liability was transferred to the defendant second injury fund pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Fireman\u2019s Fund then sought reimbursement pursuant to \u00a7 31-299b from Mattatuck\u2019s previous insurers for their proportionate shares of the benefits it had paid to the plaintiif. Both Liberty and Travelers agreed to reimburse Fireman\u2019s Fund for their proportionate shares of the benefits paid. American Mutual, however, on March 9, 1989, had been adjudicated insolvent as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (7) of the Connecticut Insurance Guaranty Association Act (guaranty act). Thereafter, in accordance with General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u00a7 38a-841, the association became obligated to pay covered claims against American Mutual. Consequently, the commissioner ordered the association to reimburse Fireman\u2019s Fund in the amount of $19,060. The association, however, appearing on behalf of American Mutual, refused to reimburse Fireman\u2019s Fund, and pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 appealed from the commissioner\u2019s order to the board. The board, on October 30, 1996, affirmed the award ordered by the commissioner and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The association bases its appeal primarily upon two arguments. First, the association contends that the Fireman\u2019s Fund claim is not reimbursable because the association is authorized to pay only covered claims, and the Fireman\u2019s Fund claim does not satisfy the requirements of a \u201ccovered claim\u201d as that term is defined by the guaranty act. Second, the association claims that the workers\u2019 compensation commission (commission) lacked subject matter jurisdiction to order reimbursement by the association. We agree with the association with regard to the first issue, but disagree with it as to its second argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">We address the jurisdictional claim first because if the commission lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute when it ordered reimbursement, we would not reach the association\u2019s second claim that the order was improper under the guaranty act. The substance of this claim is that the limited subject matter jurisdiction of the commission does not authorize it to order reimbursement by the association because such an order requires a determination by the commission that the claim to be reimbursed is a covered claim within the meaning of \u00a7 38a-838 (6) of the guaranty act. That determination cannot be made by the commission, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>association argues, because the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act limits the commission\u2019s jurisdiction to claims and questions arising only under that act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the association acknowledges that the commission may interpret other statutory provisions as incidentally necessary to its resolution of claims arising under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it argues that in this case the required interpretation of the guaranty act is not merely incidental to the issue, but, rather, constitutes the central issue in the case. Fireman\u2019s Fund, on the other hand, contends that because the legislature inserted into the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, through General Statutes \u00a7 31-355 (e),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the association\u2019s obligations in relation to workers\u2019 compensation claims, it clearly intended that the association\u2019s obligations be determined by workers\u2019 compensation commissioners. We agree with Fireman\u2019s Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The association is correct in its contention that the subject matter jurisdiction of the commission is circumscribed by the agency\u2019s enabling legislation. \u201cAdministrative agencies [such as the commission] are tribunals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>of limited jurisdiction and their jurisdiction is dependent entirely upon the validity of the statutes vesting them with power and they cannot confer jurisdiction upon themselves.\u201d <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 428, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988). \u201c \u2018It is a familiar principle that a court which exercises a limited and statutory jurisdiction is without jurisdiction to act unless it does so under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation.\u2019 \u201d Id., 427-28. Therefore, resolution of the jurisdictional issue here is a matter of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 22, 670 A.2d 851 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In interpreting statutes, we are guided by \u201cwell established tenets of statutory construction. [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Furthermore, [w]e presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . and that [statutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 663-64, 680 A.2d 242 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Our analysis begins, therefore, with the language of the relevant provisions. General Statutes \u00a7 31-278 sets forth the powers and duties of commissioners. Pursuant to that section, commissioners \u201cshall have all powers necessary to enable [them] to perform the duties imposed upon [them] by the provisions of [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act],\u201d and each commissioner is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>directed to \u201chear all claims and questions arising under [the act] . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-355 (e) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act directly refers to the association, providing that \u201cwhenever the employer\u2019s insurer has been determined to be insolvent . . . payments required under [this section] shall be the obligation of the Connecticut Insurance Guaranty Association pursuant to the provisions of sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Although the association contends that these provisions do not create subject matter jurisdiction in the commission to allow it to resolve issues central to the case that do not arise under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, it does not dispute that this case originated as a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Instead, its argument appears to be that at a certain stage in the present litigation, presumably after the commissioner apportioned liability among the prior insurers, resolution of the case ceased to turn upon provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and became dependent upon an interpretation of the guaranty act.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">While it may be true that in the final stages of this litigation resolution of the remaining claim required the commissioner to interpret a provision of the guaranty act, it is not necessarily true that that task removed the case from the operation of \u00a7 31-278. In fact, \u00a7 31-355 (e) suggests otherwise. The insertion in \u00a7 31-355 (e) delineating the association\u2019s obligations under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act reflects the legislature\u2019s intent for the commission to have jurisdiction to adjudicate claims against the association originating under that act. Otherwise, it would not have included instruction regarding the association\u2019s responsibilities under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Furthermore, it is important to recognize that when a claim originates under the Workers\u2019 Compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Act and at some point during the proceedings it becomes necessary for the commission to interpret provisions of other enactments in order to resolve the claim, the purposes and public policy concerns underlying the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act nevertheless continue to be implicated until a conclusion is reached. If jurisdiction were found not to exist in such circumstances and the commission was precluded from seeing such claims through to their conclusion, the result would be to thwart the operation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the public policies underlying it. A case that had arisen under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and proceeded through many stages under the jurisdiction of the commission would suddenly be called to a halt and the parties would be left to pursue the final resolution of their claims in another tribunal with jurisdiction over the final element of the controversy. Such a result hardly serves the legislature\u2019s goal in enacting this remedial legislation, as recently reiterated in <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>242 Conn. 375, 381, 698 A.2d 859 (1997): \u201cThe purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act . . . is to provide compensation for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, regardless of fault. . . . Under the statute, the employee surrenders his right to bring a common law action against the employer, thereby limiting the employer\u2019s liability to the statutory amount. ... In return, the employee is compensated for his or her losses without having to prove liability. ... In a word, these statutes compromise an employee\u2019s right to a common law tort action for work related injuries in return for relatively quick and certain compensation.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Here, because the injured employee plaintiff is no longer directly involved in the dispute, it is not immediately obvious how a determination that jurisdiction exists to enable the commission to resolve this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>will advance the remedial purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. It may not always be the case, however, that whenever the commission is called upon to interpret a provision of another act, the employee claimant will have already received compensation. If the commission is to function effectively in the manner contemplated by the legislature, it must be able to interpret other acts when necessary in order to resolve cases originating under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Any other result would be inconsistent with the remedial public policy underlying the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Accordingly, we conclude that the commission did not lack subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The association\u2019s second claim is that it is not obligated to reimburse Fireman\u2019s Fund for American Mutual\u2019s proportionate share of the award made to the plaintiff because the Fireman\u2019s Fund claim is not a covered claim as defined by \u00a7 38a-838 (6) of the guaranty act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, the association argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Fireman\u2019s Fund claim falls within the exception to the covered claim definition contained in that section that excludes amounts due insurers \u201cas subrogation recoveries or otherwise.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (6) (c). Fireman\u2019s Fund, on the other hand, contends that the language relied upon by the association does not absolutely exclude all claims made by insurers and is not directed toward claims based upon the statutory right to reimbursement provided for by \u00a7 31-299b. We conclude that the commission improperly determined that the Fireman\u2019s Fund claim is a covered claim reimbursable by the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. In an administrative appeal, \u201c[o]ur resolution of [the] issue is guided by the limited scope of judicial review afforded by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act; General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.; to the determinations made by an administrative agency. [W]e must decide, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or illegally, or abused its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse Commission </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Com</em>mission, 233 Conn. 28, 39, 657 A.2d 630 (1995). \u201cCases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>239 Conn. 638, 645, 687 A.2d 134 (1997). \u201cAlthough the inteipretation of statutes is ultimately a question of law . . . it is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse Commission </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 39. An exception is that \u201cwhen a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny . . . the agency is not entitled to special deference.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>supra, 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In this case, the issue of whether an insurer\u2019s claim against the association is properly reimbursable constitutes a question of law. Furthermore, although statutory interpretation by the commission \u2014 an administrative agency \u2014 is required, the statute to be interpreted is not part of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act assigned to the commission for enforcement, but, rather, is a provision of the guaranty act. Consequently, although, as we have previously stated, the commission had the authority to inteipret \u00a7 38a-838 (6), we afford no special deference to its interpretation. Our analysis is guided, however, by the same well established tenets of statutory construction that instructed our resolution of the association\u2019s first claim in this appeal. <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-841, the association is authorized to pay only covered claims, and must deny all other claims. In order to be reimbursable by the association, a claim against the association must be encompassed within the definition of a covered claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>contained in \u00a7 38a-838 (6). The language relied upon by the association as excluding the Fireman\u2019s Fund claim provides that \u201cthe term \u2018covered claim\u2019 shall not include any amount due any . . . <em>insurer ... as subrogation recoveries or otherwise </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (6) (c). Specifically, because the amount allegedly due is not purported to be based upon a right of subrogation, it is the \u201cor otherwise\u201d language of the statute that the association argues excludes the claim. While the association reads the words \u201cas subrogation recoveries or otherwise\u201d as disjunctive and excluding all claims by insurers, Fireman\u2019s Fund argues that the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d merely modify the words \u201csubrogation recoveries,\u201d so that only claims based on subrogation or akin to subrogation recoveries are excluded from the definition of a covered claim. Furthermore, Fireman\u2019s Fund contends that if the legislature had intended to bar absolutely all claims by insurers, it could have done so explicitly rather than by employing a broad, catchall phrase of uncertain meaning. We agree with the association\u2019s reading of \u00a7 38a-838 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">To begin with, we note that the term \u201cotherwise\u201d is defined by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) as meaning \u201c[i]n a different manner; in another way, or in other ways.\u201d Substituting this definition for the term \u201cotherwise\u201d in the statute demonstrates that not only are subrogation recoveries by an insurer excluded but so are recoveries obtained in a different manner or in other ways. This result comports with the everyday understanding of the phrase \u201cor otherwise,\u201d and with a plain reading of \u00a7 38a-838 (6). Read this way, the language is very broad, and encompasses all amounts claimed by insurers as reimbursement. Contrary to the assertion by Fireman\u2019s Fund that the phrase \u201cor otherwise\u201d is of uncertain meaning, we conclude that the language provides a strong indication that under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>guaranty act, all claims by insurers are excluded from the definition of a covered claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The legislative purpose underlying the guaranty act supports our interpretation of \u00a7 38a-838 (6). The association was established for the purpose of providing a limited form of protection for policyholders and claimants in the event of insurer insolvency. The protection it provides is limited based upon its status as a nonprofit entity and the method by which it is funded. Specifically, the association is a nonprofit legal entity created by statute to which all persons licensed to transact insurance in the state must belong. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38a-838 (8) and 38a-839.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When an insurer is determined to be insolvent under \u00a7 38a-838 (7), the association becomes obligated pursuant to \u00a7 38a-841, to the extent of covered claims within certain limits. The rates and premiums charged by member insurers are authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 38a-849 to include amounts sufficient to recoup the assessments levied upon insurers by the association. Because \u00a7 38a-849 provides that insurers may pass on the costs of the assessments made against them by the association, it is in reality policyholders who pay for the protections afforded by the association. Limitations on the association\u2019s obligations, therefore, provide another form of protection against increased premiums for policyholders in addition to the primary protection afforded all claimants against losses resulting from insurer insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The legislative history confirms that the association was established for the benefit of consumers. At the public hearing held prior to passage of the bill proposing the creation of the association, Peter Kelly, a member of the state insurance department stated: \u201c[T]his bill provides the means to avoid financial loss to Connecticut residents because of the insolvency of [insurance companies], ... In the late 1960s . . . [consumers were being hurt and on a personal scale, an insolvency can be ruinous. . . . [The bill] provides the means for all insurance companies assessed to recover from the entire insured residents of this state the cost of such assessments so that it is really not an assessment on a company but an assessment on the entire residents of the state who are insured after the fact. This is spreading the risk amongst all Connecticut residents. . . . I think you must remember that industry is not paying the cost. This bill provides that Connecticut residents will pay the cost. . . . This bill provides for protections of residents of this state and the residents if any assessments are ever made will pay for the cost of such assessments in their future insurance premiums.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Insurance and Real Estate, 1971 Sess., pp. 55-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">An interpretation of the covered claim definition that excludes claims by insurers is in accord with this legislative purpose to provide protection for policyholders and claimants from insurer insolvency. The exclusion of claims by insurers leaves the risk of insurer insolvency on the insurance industry. The result is that policyholders, who in effect fund the association, pay only for protection for fellow policyholders and claimants in the event that an insurer becomes insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Other jurisdictions that have construed similar provisions in their guaranty association acts have also concluded that claims by insurers are excluded by their acts. In <em>Maxwell Communications </em>v. <em>Webb Publishing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>Co., </em>518 N.W.2d 830, 833 (Minn. 1994), the Minnesota Supreme Court interpreted identical language contained in its guaranty association act as excluding claims by insurers. The language of the Minnesota act provided that \u201c \u2018a covered claim does not include . . . claims due a reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association, as subrogation recoveries or otherwise.\u2019 \u201d Id., 832, quoting Minn. Stat. \u00a7 60c.09 (2) (2). The Minnesota guaranty association, like our association, was funded by assessments levied on member insurers that were by statute allowed to be passed directly on to policyholders. The court based its decision upon the breadth of the \u201cor otherwise\u201d language employed by the Minnesota act, and upon the public policy sought to be advanced by the act, namely, protection for policyholders as distinct from insurance companies. <em>Maxwell Communications </em>v. <em>Webb Publishing Co., </em>supra, 833. The court reasoned that \u201c[b]y excluding claims of what may be described as insurance industry creditors, policyholders pay only for the protection lost by similarly-situated policyholders of insolvent insurers. The members of the insurance industry itself bear the risk of loss of their own direct claims against the insolvent carrier, which they still may assert against the insolvent carrier\u2019s receiver. In other words, the Guaranty Act does not provide a solvent substitute for an insolvent insurer, but, rather, is a limited form of protection for the public.\u201d Id.; see also <em>Ursin </em>v. <em>Ins. Guaranty Assn., </em>412 So. 2d 1285, 1289 (La. 1981); <em>Ferrari </em>v. <em>Toto, </em>383 Mass. 36, 37-38, 417 N.E.2d 427 (1981). We find this reasoning persuasive and equally applicable to an interpretation of \u00a7 38a-838 (6) of our own guaranty act.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Although we realize that \u00a7 31-299b, by placing initial liability on the last insurer in circumstances where a compensable injury is the responsibility of several insurers, may create a hardship for the last insurer in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the event that a prior insurer has become insolvent, we believe that the conclusion we reach reflects the result intended by the legislature. We express no opinion, however, as to whether the last insurer may seek reapportionment among the remaining solvent insurers by the commission when a prior insurer has been adjudicated insolvent, because that decision is not necessary to the resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The decision of the board is reversed and the case is remanded to the board with direction to render a decision in favor of the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-11\"> The association is a nonprofit legal entity established by General Statutes \u00a7 38a-839 and governed by the Connecticut Insurance Guaranty Association Act, which is codified at General Statutes \u00a7 38a-836 et seq. The association was established in order to reimburse, to a limited extent, covered claims against insolvent insurers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b468-5\"> A right of reimbursement is provided for by General Statutes \u00a7 31-299b, which also imposes initial liability upon the last employer or insurer for a workers\u2019 compensation claim relating to a period of time during which there was more than one employer or insurer liable for the injury. Section 31-299b provides: \u201cInitial liability of last employer. Reimbursement. If an employee suffers an injury or disease for which compensation is found by the commissioner to be payable according to the provisions of this chapter, the employer who last employed the claimant prior to the filing of the claim, or the employer\u2019s insurer, shall be initially liable for the payment of such compensation. The commissioner shall, within a reasonable period of time after issuing an award, on the basis of the record of the hearing, determine whether prior employers, or their insurers, are liable for a portion of such compensation and the extent of their liability. If prior employers are found to be so liable, the commissioner shall order such employers or their insurers to reimburse the initially liable employer or insurer according to the proportion of their liability.
