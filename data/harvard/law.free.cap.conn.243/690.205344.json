We conclude that, in the absence of compliance with the relevant statute, General Statutes \u00a7 54-56, the trial court did not have such authority. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court dismissing the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed. On October 26, 1995, the defendant was charged by misdemeanor summons and complaint with criminal trespass in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-107.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the police report on which the complaint was based, the defendant, a former employee of Trudy Toy, Inc. (Trudy Toy), in Norwalk, was fired from his job at that company\u2019s manufacturing facility on October 20, 1995. Peter Ogilve, a supervisor with Trudy Toy, told the police that the defendant\u2019s employment had been terminated for poor performance and, because of reports that he had been stealing items from an adjacent company that shares warehouse space with Trudy Toy.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">On October 26,1995, Ogilve arrived at the warehouse to find the defendant arguing with another Trudy Toy supervisor, Mario Coppolla. According to Coppolla, he observed the defendant in the warehouse space used by the company adjacent to Trudy Toy, in the vicinity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>of a pallet of watches. The defendant, who was carrying a bag containing three boxes, informed Coppolla that he had come to the warehouse to speak to Ogilve about his recent job termination. Ogilve instructed the defendant to leave the property and not to return for any reason. Ogilve then observed the defendant leave the premises.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Several minutes after the defendant had departed, however, two other Trudy Toy employees saw the defendant return to the area of the warehouse where the pallet of watches was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Ogilve reported these events to David Wrinn, a Nor-walk police officer, who proceeded to the defendant\u2019s home to speak to him about the incident. The defendant denied that he had returned to the warehouse after Ogilve had ordered him to leave. The defendant further stated that the bag he had been carrying contained pamphlets for distribution to a group that he was organizing. Wrinn then served the defendant with a misdemeanor summons and complaint charging him with first degree criminal trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The defendant appeared in court on November 29, 1995, at which time a public defender was appointed to represent him. The defendant entered a plea of not guilty to the charge, and elected to be tried by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The defendant next appeared in court the following week. At that time, his counsel informed the trial court, <em>Stevens, J., </em>that the state had \u201cmade an offer\u201d to the defendant, but that the defendant \u201cdoesn\u2019t want it. He says he\u2019s innocent and wants his trial.\u201d The case then was continued for several weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>At the defendant\u2019s next court appearance on January 5, 1996, his attorney informed the trial court that the defendant, who by then had been incarcerated for a parole violation stemming from the filing of the criminal trespass charge,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had forwarded to the court a motion for a speedy trial. Although the clerk\u2019s office had not yet received the defendant\u2019s motion, the court placed the case on the firm jury list and scheduled the case for a pretrial conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">On January 31, 1996, the defendant again appeared in court. Counsel for the defendant informed the trial court that the defendant wanted the case to be dismissed. Defense counsel further stated, however, to the court: \u201cI\u2019ve done my research on this and I do not see grounds under [Practice Book \u00a7 815]<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for dismissal.\u201d Because a pretrial conference on the defendant\u2019s case already had been conducted, the trial court ordered that the case be placed on one hour notice for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>The defendant appeared in court again on March 20, 1996. The trial court, <em>Dean, J.,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>indicated that the case was ready for trial, during the following colloquy between the trial court and the deputy assistant state\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">\u201cThe Court: [Y]ou know, we have a lot of serious cases on the jury [list]. We have a burglary [case] right behind this. We have six cases [for which] subpoenas are out behind this case, and in twenty-six years I have never tried a trespassing case to the jury. Never. And I\u2019ve read this police report and it\u2019s simple trespass.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> [It c]ould either be an infraction or [it] could be a trespass first, I suppose. No one was hurt, no injuries. It was just a plain old trespass. Now we have a situation here where clerks are being let go, we have backlogs, and quite frankly, I would be embarrassed to put this [case] before a jury who has taken their time off from work. They don\u2019t want to be here and ... sit here and . . . listen to something like this. I don\u2019t know why you gentlemen cannot resolve this thing. However, I\u2019m going to resolve it. [Deputy assistant state\u2019s attorney Richard J.] Colangelo\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">\u201cMr. Colangelo: Yes, Your Honor. I do understand your position and I share your sympathies. Unfortunately\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">\u201cThe Court:. . . Absolutely. And this is for the benefit of \u2014 the people of the state of Connecticut [whose] taxes pay for this court and pay for the jurors, and in the great scheme of things when we have burglaries and robberies on the juries that are not being reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>and we have something like this \u2014 Mr. Colangelo, if you want to substitute an information for trespass \u2014 what do you call the simple one, infraction of trespass. I will try it on the spot as a court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, if you don\u2019t want to do that, I\u2019m going to dismiss this because\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">\u201cMr. Colangelo: Actually, Your Honor, I do share your concerns [and] sympathy, but it is the defendant that elects a jury trial and the [s]tate does not have any control over that.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">\u201cThe Court: . . . Well, I\u2019m saying\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">\u201cMr. Colangelo: I could very definitely, I could change the charge, but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m saying if you would like to get a conviction\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">\u201cMr. Colangelo: No, sir. I am not going to reduce the charge. The defendant is charged with a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">\u201cThe Court: Okay, dismissed. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">\u201cMr. Colangelo: Could I ask for a basis?</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">\u201cThe Court: In the interest of\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">\u201cMr. Colangelo: Permission to appeal. Permission to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-15\">\u201cThe Court: Do whatever you want.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-16\">\u201cMr. Colangelo: Thank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>\u201cThe Court: In the interest of justice, the basis that I\u2019m dismissing this is because right behind it is a burglary case. Now this was set down for a speedy trial and it\u2019s just a matter of priorities. We can\u2019t try all the cases, and when I weigh this case against the burglary or other cases we have here and the expense involved in trying this, and I\u2019ve examined \u2014 I mean nobody \u2014 I\u2019ve examined the police report. Nobody was hurt. It was just a plain old trespass where he had an argument with his former employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">\u201cMr. Colangelo: [The defendant] was instructed to leave, [and he] did come back later, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">\u201cThe Court: . . . was instructed to leave and didn\u2019t leave. And certainly the infraction would be appropriate in this matter, and\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">\u201cMr. Colangelo: Could I have the report back?</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">\u201cThe Court:... I just gave it to the clerk. And under the circumstances whereby we have such a backlog, and I talked to [supervisory assistant state\u2019s attorney Steven] Weiss and he\u2019s got thirty jury trials, the next one is a burglary, and\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">\u201cMr. Colangelo: We have approximately a hundred\u2014 well, probably\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">\u201cThe Court: And for me to spend a week selecting a jury and trying this case, I\u2019m not going to do it. So dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">\u201cMr. Colangelo: Thank you, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">\u201cThe Court: All right, the case is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-14\">\u201c[James Ginnochio, Defense Counsel]: Thank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. And let\u2019s see how much the appeal costs you, Mr. Colangelo. You want to waste some more money?</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>\u201cMr. Colangelo: I\u2019m just doing my job, Judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The proceeding thereupon concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">On appeal, the state claims that, in the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the first degree criminal trespass charge constituted an impermissible usurpation of the prosecutor\u2019s authority to charge the defendant in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers. The defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the charge was not constitutionally impermissible and, further, that the dismissal was authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 54-56.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The separation of powers provision of article second of the Connecticut constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cThe powers of government shall be divided into three distinct departments, and each of them confided to a separate magistracy, to wit, those which are legislative, to one; those which are executive, to another; and those which are judicial, to another.\u201d \u201c[T]he primary purpose of this constitutional doctrine is to prevent commingling of different powers of government in the same hands. . . . The constitution achieves this purpose by prescribing limitations and duties for each branch that are essential to each branch\u2019s independence and performance of assigned powers. . . . [Thus, t]he separation of powers doctrine serves a dual function: it limits the exercise of power within each branch, yet ensures the independent exercise of that power. . . . [I]n deciding whether one branch\u2019s actions violate the constitutional mandate of the separation of powers doctrine, the court will consider if the actions constitute: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>(1) an assumption of power that lies exclusively under the control of another branch; or (2) a significant interference with the orderly conduct of the essential functions of another branch.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Massameno </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance </em>Committee, 234 Conn. 539, 551-53, 663 A.2d 317 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The state\u2019s attorneys, who are responsible for prosecuting violations of the criminal laws of this state, are executive branch officials. Id., 558-59; see General Statutes \u00a7 51-276; see also Conn. Const., amend. XXIII. \u201cThere can be no doubt that [t]he doctrine of separation of powers requires judicial respect for the independence of the prosecutor.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Massameno </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 574. Prosecutors, therefore, have \u201ca wide latitude and broad discretion in determining when, who, why and whether to prosecute for violations of the criminal law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>200 Conn. 453, 460, 512 A.2d 183 (1986). This broad discretion, which necessarily includes \u201cdeciding which citizens should be prosecuted and for what charges they are to be held accountable\u201d; <em>Massameno </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 575; \u201crests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review. Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution\u2019s general deterrence value, the [state\u2019s] enforcement priorities, and the case\u2019s relationship to the [state\u2019s] overall enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake. Judicial supervision in this area, moreover, entails systemic costs of particular concern. Examining the basis of a prosecution delays the criminal proceeding, threatens to chill law enforcement by subjecting the prosecutor\u2019s motives and decisionmaking to outside inquiry, and may undermine prosecutorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>effectiveness by revealing the [state\u2019s] enforcement policy. All these are substantial concerns that make the courts properly hesitant to examine the decision whether to prosecute.\u201d <em>Wayte </em>v. <em>United States, </em>470 U.S. 598, 607-608, 105 S. Ct. 1524, 84 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1985).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201c[judicial deference to the decisions of these executive officers . . . also stems from a concern not to unnecessarily impair the performance of a core executive constitutional function.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. 456, 465, 116 S. Ct. 1480, 134 L. Ed. 2d 687 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">For these reasons, \u201cunless constitutional or other compelling reasons require otherwise, we abstain from setting policy for the performance of the prosecutorial function.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 478, 497 A.2d 974 (1985); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 474, 450 A.2d 828 (1982) (\u201c[s]o long as [the prosecutor] acts within the jurisdiction of his office it is not appropriate for a court to set policy for the performance of his prosecutorial function\u201d). Consistently with this principle, the court, \u201c[i]n the absence of statutory authority . . . has no power of its own motion to dismiss a criminal prosecution unless there is a fundamental legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>defect in the information or indictment (such as want of jurisdiction or form of the information), or a constitutional defect such as denial of the right to a speedy trial . . . -\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>172 Conn. 608, 610-11, 376 A.2d 74 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dills, </em>19 Conn. App. 495, 500, 563 A.2d 733 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">In this case, the trial court identified no constitutional infirmity or other fundamental defect in the state\u2019s exercise of its prosecutorial authority to warrant dismissal of the first degree criminal trespass charge. Moreover, the trial court did not purport to be acting under any legislative grant of authority in dismissing the charge. It is settled law that a trial court lacks the power to terminate a prosecution against an accused in such circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 610-11; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dills, </em>supra, 19 Conn. App. 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The defendant claims that, although the trial court did not expressly invoke \u00a7 54-56 in dismissing the criminal trespass charge, we nevertheless may sustain the court\u2019s judgment under that statutory section, which authorizes a court to dismiss pending criminal charges if \u201cthere is not sufficient evidence or cause to justify\u201d the continued prosecution of the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number><em>Latimer </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>216 Conn. 237, 252, 579 A.2d 497 (1990) (appellate court may rely upon alternative grounds supported by record to uphold trial court\u2019s judgment); <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>180 Conn. 345, 353, 429 A.2d 900 (1980) (same). Even if we assume, arguendo, that the trial court was acting pursuant to the authority vested in it under \u00a7 54-56, we disagree with the defendant that the dismissal of the first degree criminal trespass charge was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The defendant first claims that the record supports the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the criminal trespass charge under the evidentiary insufficiency prong of \u00a7 54-56. This contention is without merit for two reasons. First, it is clear from the record that the trial court did not dismiss the charge on the ground of evidentiary insufficiency. Although the court expressed the opinion that, in light of the nature of the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct as set forth in Wrinn\u2019s report, the state <em>ought </em>to reduce the charge from first degree criminal trespass to simple trespass, the court nevertheless acknowledged that the report provided a factual basis for the first degree criminal trespass charge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Furthermore, the information contained in the police report, if proven, was sufficient to establish the crime of first degree criminal trespass. In determining whether the evidence proffered by the state is adequate to avoid dismissal, such proof must be viewed in the light most favorable to the state. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>213 Conn. 708, 717, 570 A.2d 174 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>193 Conn. 602, 611, 478 A.2d 994 (1984). \u201cIn order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>convict the defendant of criminal trespass in the first degree [under \u00a7 53a-107], the state [has] to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following essential elements of that offense: (1) that the defendant, knowing he was not privileged or licensed to do so, entered or remained in a building; and (2) that the defendant committed that act after an order to leave or not to enter had been personally communicated to him by the owner or other authorized person.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>LoSacco, </em>12 Conn. App. 172, 174-75, 529 A.2d 1348 (1987). Because the facts set forth in the police report, viewed most favorably to the state, satisfy those statutory requirements, the defendant was not entitled to dismissal of the first degree criminal trespass charge under the sufficiency prong of \u00a7 54-56.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Alternatively, the defendant claims that the trial court properly dismissed the charge in the exercise of its discretion under the insufficient cause prong of \u00a7 54-56. We reject this argument also.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim by noting that a trial court is empowered to dismiss a case for insufficient cause under \u00a7 54-56 only in the most compelling of circumstances. <em>State </em>v. Corchado, supra, 200 Conn. 460. Because discretionary prosecutorial decisions, including the decision whether to proceed to trial, ordinarily are unreviewable by the court absent a showing of prosecutorial impropriety, the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>render a dismissal under \u00a7 54-56 for insufficient cause is to \u201cbe sparingly exercised and then only with great caution and awareness of the probable consequences.\u201d Id., 464. In order to ensure that this discretion is exercised in accordance with these principles, it is essential for \u201cthe court explicitly to weigh all the competing factors and considerations of fundamental fairness to both sides \u2014 the defendant, the state and society, and presumably the victim. . . . This difficult and delicate process necessarily involves a careful consideration by the court of such factors as the strength of the state\u2019s case, the likelihood of conviction, the severity of the crime, its effect on the victim, the strength of the defendant\u2019s defense, the defendant\u2019s personal situation, and all the other myriad factors that underlie a judgment regarding fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dills, </em>supra, 19 Conn. App. 503-504; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>209 Conn. 225, 238, 550 A.2d 885 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1069, 109 S. Ct. 1349, 103 L. Ed. 2d 817 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, 458-59. Thus, atrial court\u2019s invocation of its authority to dismiss a case under the insufficient cause prong of \u00a7 54-56 can be justified only when: (1) the court expressly and carefully has considered all of the relevant competing factors; and (2) dismissal is supported by overriding equitable considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The defendant contends that the trial court properly applied the necessary balancing test and concluded, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, that insufficient cause existed to justify the defendant\u2019s prosecution. We do not agree that the trial court carefully weighed the relevant considerations, nor are we persuaded, on the basis of the record before us, that dismissal was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">It is apparent that, in the trial court\u2019s view, the defendant\u2019s misdemeanor case was not sufficiently important, in light of other pending felony cases also ready for trial, to warrant the expenditure of the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>and resources necessary for a jury trial. There is no indication, however, that the court, due to a backlog of cases or to a lack of resources or both, was faced with the likelihood that any other case would have to be dismissed, for speedy trial reasons or otherwise. We need express no view, therefore, as to whether, or in what circumstances, a trial court properly might exercise its extraordinary power under \u00a7 54-56 to dismiss a case primarily for reasons of judicial administration. Suffice it to say that there is absolutely no basis in the record of this case to support the court\u2019s dismissal, for administrative reasons, of the first degree criminal trespass charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The other reasons articulated by the trial court for dismissing the char ge also fall short of satisfying the stringent requirements of \u00a7 54-56. That the trial court had \u201cnever tried a trespassing case to the jury ... in twenty-six years [on the bench]\u201d has no bearing on the question of whether insufficient cause existed to justify the prosecution in <em>this </em>case. Similarly irrelevant is the court\u2019s view that a jury trial is not warranted in this case and, further, that a jury would not \u201cwant to\u201d decide such a case. Because the law guarantees a right to a jury trial for misdemeanor trespass, the court\u2019s personal opinion on the issue is without legal significance. Moreover, so long as the facts warranted a charge of first degree criminal trespass, the prosecutor was entitled to pursue a conviction of that offense rather than of the infraction of simple trespass. See footnote 13. Finally, the fact that \u201c[n]o one was hurt [or] injur [ed]\u201d as a result of the defendant\u2019s alleged criminal trespass provides no support for the court\u2019s dismissal of the charge, for the state is not required to prove that anyone was \u201churt\u201d or \u201cinjur[ed]\u201d in a prosecution under \u00a7 53a-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court was justified in dismissing the first degree criminal trespass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>charge because the court reasonably believed that the defendant\u2019s alleged offense was minor and, consequently, that no significant period of incarceration likely would be imposed. Even if we assume that the record adequately reflects the court\u2019s belief regarding these two related issues, we do not agree with the defendant that \u00a7 54-56 authorizes atrial court to dismiss a pending criminal case simply because it views the offense as not sufficiently serious to justify a prosecution. It is the responsibility of the legislature, not the judiciary, to determine what conduct shall be deemed criminal, and it is the responsibility of the state\u2019s attorneys, not the judiciary, to determine \u201cwhen, who, why and whether to prosecute for violations of the criminal law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The defendant further maintains that because he already had served 140 days in prison due to the parole violation stemming from the first degree criminal trespass charge, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that, even if the defendant were to have been convicted of first degree criminal trespass, he likely would not have received any significant term of imprisonment for that offense. This argument also is unavailing because the record does not reflect that the trial court ever considered this issue before rendering its judgment of dismissal. In light of the sensitive balancing test required under \u00a7 54-56, we will not presume that the trial court considered factors to which absolutely no reference was made, either by the court or by the parties, prior to the court\u2019s dismissal of the charge. Indeed, because this issue was not raised, the trial court also never considered the fact that the defendant, at the time of the alleged criminal trespass, already was on parole from a fifteen year prison sentence for his conviction of manslaughter in the second degree with a firearm and carrying a pistol without a permit. See footnote 4 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>The defendant also contends that the trial court, in dismissing the first degree criminal trespass charge, reasonably could have considered the fact that, even though the defendant had requested a speedy trial, he still had not been tried 140 days after the filing of the charge. Again, however, there is nothing in the record of the \u00a7 54-56 proceedings to indicate that the trial court took account of this fact. Furthermore, the defendant concedes that because his pro se speedy trial motion was not received by the clerk\u2019s office until February 9, 1996, the state had 120 days from that date, until June 8, 1996, within which to try the defendant. In these circumstances, we disagree with the defendant that his failure to receive a speedier trial could have provided a basis for dismissal under \u00a7 54-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 453, provides no support for the judgment of dismissal rendered in this case. In <em>Corchado, </em>the defendant was facing retrial almost two years after his conviction of manslaughter in the first degree had been reversed on appeal. In the meantime, the defendant already had served his sentence and had been released from parole. Id., 454-55. In the highly unusual circumstances of that case, described as \u201cunique\u201d both by the trial court and by this court; see id., 458,461,464; the trial court, after engaging in a thorough balancing of all the relevant considerations, concluded that because there was no reasonable likelihood that the defendant could be sentenced to further imprisonment, insufficient cause existed to retry the defendant. Consequently, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss under \u00a7 54-56. In light of the careful and reasoned exercise of discretion by the trial court, we affirmed the judgment of dismissal. Id., 463-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">By contrast, the trial court in this case failed to weigh the factors relevant to the determination of whether sufficient cause existed to justify the prosecution, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>did it engage in the careful and sensitive balancing of interests required under \u00a7 54-56.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 238 (trial court properly-weighed interests of state, society and defendant before imposing life sentence on defendant, rather than requiring new sentencing hearing, after jury could not reach unanimity required for imposition of death penalty). Indeed, it is clear from the record that the trial court took the bench fully intending to dismiss the charge unless the prosecutor reduced the charge to simple trespass. Furthermore, the concerns that motivated the trial court to dismiss the first degree criminal trespass charge hardly compare with the \u201cGordian knot-like problem presented by the competing interests\u201d in <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Thus, because the trial court failed to determine that a compelling justification existed for its dismissal of the first degree criminal trespass charge, we conclude that the dismissal constituted an improper usurpation of an essential prosecutorial function. Having established that the court exceeded its authority in terminating the prosecution of the defendant, the state is entitled to proceed with its case against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-96 provides: \u201cAppeals by the state from Superior Court in criminal cases.

The judicial branch, and, concomitantly, the defendant are not in the best position to consider the various factors that prosecutors weigh, such as the strength of the evidence, the visibility of the crime, the availability of resources and possible deterrent effects.

For purposes of this appeal, however, we assume, without deciding, that the defendant\u2019s failure to seek a dismissal of the charge under \u00a7 54-56 is not fatal to his claim. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>189 Conn. 42, 48-49, 454 A.2d 266 (1983) (state may seek dismissal under \u00a7 54-56 even though statute contains no express authorization for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>motion thereunder by state); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>40 Conn.
