On October 7,1994, the defendant plumbing and piping work board (board)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> issued complaints against the plaintiffs, Hartford Hospital (hospital) and Herve Gelinas, Charles Rowe and Arnrit Kalicharen, three of the hospital\u2019s employees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>alleged that the hospital had violated General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 20-334, 20-337 and 20-341<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because certain of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>employees had performed plumbing and piping work<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on the hospital premises without a certificate, license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>or registration to do so. The board further alleged that Gelinas, a foreman, had violated the licensure requirements of chapter 393 by causing plumbing work to be performed by hospital employees who were not licensed or registered to do such work.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With respect to Rowe and Kalicharen, the board claimed that they had violated statutory licensure provisions by performing plumbing work at the hospital without a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In November, 1994, the plaintiffs sought a declaratory ruling<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the statutory licensure requirements are inapplicable to them because the work performed by Rowe and Kalicharen was primarily maintenance work and not plumbing installation work. Alternatively, the plaintiffs claimed that they are exempt from the requirements of chapter 393 because the hospital is an \u201cindustrial firm\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 20-340 (6).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>hearing, the board issued a declaratory ruling in which it concluded that the work performed by Rowe and Kalicharen constituted plumbing and piping work under \u00a7 20-330 (3) and, further, that \u00a7 20-340 (6) does not exempt the hospital\u2019s employees from the statutory licensure requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The plaintiffs appealed from the declaratory ruling of the board to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, claiming that \u00a7 20-340 (6) exempts employees of the hospital from the licensure requirements of chapter 393.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court agreed with the plaintiffs that the hospital is an \u201cindustrial firm\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 20-340 (6) and, consequently, sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. The defendants appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). On appeal, the defendants renew their argument that the hospital is not an \u201cindustrial firm\u201d under \u00a7 20-340 (6) and, therefore, is not exempt from the licensure requirements of chapter 393. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">\u201c[B]ecause our resolution of the [defendants\u2019] claim requires the application of a statutory provision, namely, [\u00a7 20-340 (6)], to a specific factual scenario, we are . . . guided by well established tenets of statutory interpretation. It is fundamental that statutory construction requires us to ascertain the intent of the legislature and to construe the statute in a manner that effectuates that intent. . . In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cannata v. Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>239 Conn. 124, 140-41, 680 A.2d 1329 (1996). \u201cFurthermore, when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny, as in this case, the agency\u2019s determination is not entitled to special deference.\u201d <em>Angelsea Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>236 Conn. 681, 688, 674 A.2d 1300 (1996); see <em>Duni </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>239 Conn. 19, 25, 682 A.2d 99 (1996). Finally, exemptions to statutes are to be strictly construed; <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept, of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 141; and \u201cthose who claim the benefit of an exception under a statute have the burden of proving that they come within the limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>class for whose benefit it was established.\u201d <em>Conservation Commission </em>v. <em>Price, </em>193 Conn. 414, 424, 479 A.2d 187 (1984); <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 549, 441 A.2d 30 (1981). With these principles in mind, we turn to the defendants\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Section 20-334 provides that individuals performing certain kinds of work, including plumbing and piping work, must be licensed. Since the enactment of the statutory licensure requirements in 1965,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the legislature has created eleven exemptions to the licensing mandate of \u00a7 20-334, including the exemption under \u00a7 20-340 (6) for any person employed by an \u201cindustrial firm\u201d whose main duties concern, inter aha, plumbing and piping work.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 sole claim of exemption from the requirements of \u00a7 20-334 is that the hospital is an \u201cindustrial firm\u201d under \u00a7 20-340 (6). Specifically, the plaintiffs, urging a broad construction of the term \u201cindustrial firm,\u201d maintain that that term encompasses all commercial enterprises engaged in any industry, including the health industry. The defendants, on the other hand, contend that the term applies only to business entities involved in manufacturing activities and, consequently, that the hospital, because it is not involved in such activities, does not fall within the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Where, as here, a statute does not define a term, \u201cwe refer to [its] commonly approved usage for guidance in our determination.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Best Cleaners, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>237 Conn. 490, 500, 677 A.2d 1356 (1996); see <em>Krafick </em>v. <em>Krafick, </em>234 Conn. 783, 794, 663 A.2d 365 (1995). The term \u201cindustrial firm\u201d is not defined in the dictionary; see, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary; and the dictionary definitions of \u201cindustrial\u201d and \u201cfirm\u201d provide little guidance as to whether the term \u201cindustrial firm\u201d connotes only an enterprise that is involved in manufacturing activities, as the defendants claim, or one that is engaged in any form of business or commercial activity, as the plaintiffs contend.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, we have not had previous occasion to define the precise term \u201cindustrial firm,\u201d in this or any other context. Cf. <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 754-55, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992) (discussing term \u201cindustrial plant\u201d as defined in regulations relating to taxing statutes); <em>Roan </em>v. <em>Connecticut Industrial Building Commission, </em>150 Conn. 333, 335-36, 189 A.2d 399 (1963) (discussing term \u201cindustrial plant\u201d as defined under statute, since repealed, creating industrial building commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">As the plaintiffs conceded at oral argument, however, the term \u201cindustrial firm\u201d is not one which, in common parlance, ordinarily would be deemed to include a hospital. Moreover, the plaintiffs further acknowledge that, under the expansive definition of the term they espouse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>virtually any business or commercial enterprise would qualify as an \u201cindustrial firm,\u201d including, for example, insurance companies, banks, private schools and colleges, hotels and restaurants, retail stores, apartment complexes, and the like. We do not think that the commonly approved usage of the term \u201cindustrial firm\u201d includes these and other such business enterprises. By contrast, the term \u201cindustrial firm\u201d more readily brings to mind commercial entities engaged in manufacturing activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Furthermore, several well established tenets of statutory construction provide persuasive support for the defendants\u2019 claim regarding the intended scope of the exemption created under \u00a7 20-340 (6). First, under the interpretation of the term \u201cindustrial firm\u201d advanced by the plaintiffs, the word \u201cindustrial\u201d has little, if any, significance because virtually any \u201cfirm\u201d \u2014 that is, any \u201cbusiness unit or enterprise\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 would qualify for the exemption created under \u00a7 20-340 (6). In addition, under the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u201cindustrial firm,\u201d the exemption created by \u00a7 20-340 (9) for \u201cemployees of stage and theatrical companies\u201d and the exemption under \u00a7 20-340 (10) for \u201cemployees of carnivals, circuses or similar transient amusement shows\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> would be unnecessary because those persons already would be exempt from the statutory licensure requirements by operation of \u00a7 20-340 (6). \u201cIt is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature did not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . [I]n construing statutes, we presume1 that there is a purpose behind every sentence, clause, or phrase used in an act and that no part of a statute is superfluous.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Castagno </em>v. <em>Wholean, </em>239 Conn. 336, 346, 684 A.2d 1181 (1996); <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 90-91, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994). In contrast to the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 20-340 (6), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>statutory construction advanced by the defendants gives full effect both to the word \u201cindustrial\u201d and to each of the ten other exemptions created by the legislature under \u00a7 20-340.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Second, the plaintiffs also concede that under their construction of the term \u201cindustrial firm,\u201d only that class of persons performing plumbing services for the general public is likely to fall outside the scope of the exemption created by \u00a7 20-340 (6). If the legislature had intended to limit the statutory licensure requirement in such a manner, it easily could have done so without creating the numerous exemptions set forth under \u00a7 20-340.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>LoPresto </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>234 Conn. 424, 435, 451-52, 662 A.2d 738 (1995). The fact that the legislature eschewed that approach and, instead, crafted eleven specific exemptions to the licensure requirement suggests that it did not intend such a sweeping application of \u00a7 20-340 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Finally, a primary purpose of the licensure requirement, in addition to establishing a uniform, statewide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>system of licensing, is to protect the public health and safety. See, e.g., 11 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1965 Spec. Sess., p. 2186, comments by Senator Charles T. Alfano (\u201c[w]e feel that [the electrical, plumbing, steamfitting and elevator repair] trades are of such a character that they are essential to the public health and safety, and they should be regulated on the state level\u201d). As a remedial statute, we must afford it a liberal construction in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit. <em>Knight </em>v. <em>F.L. Roberts &amp; Co., </em>241 Conn. 466, 474, 696 A.2d 1249 (1997); <em>Fruin v. Colonnade One at Old Greenwich Ltd. Partnership, </em>237 Conn. 123, 133, 676 A.2d 369 (1996). \u201cIn furtherance of that principle, exemptions or exclusions are to be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Success Village Apartments, Inc. v. Local 376, </em>175 Conn. 165, 168, 397 A.2d 85 (1978); <em>State Board of Labor Relations </em>v. <em>West Hartford Board of Education, </em>177 Conn. 68, 74, 411 A.2d 28 (1979). Construing the term \u201cindustrial firm\u201d to include virtually any commercial or business enterprise would be contrary to that principle. Indeed, the plumbing and piping work performed in a hospital is critical to the health and safety of its patients; as the defendants have explained, such work includes the installation and maintenance of water and gas lines for patient rooms, operating rooms, and laboratories and, therefore, it is likely the legislature intended those performing such work to meet the highest professional standards.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, the plaintiffs acknowledge that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>our determination regarding the scope of the exemption created under \u00a7 20-340 (6) for plumbing and piping work is equally applicable to the electrical, fire protection system, elevator repair and installation, and heating and cooling trades. Thus, under the statutory construction espoused by the plaintiffs, the hospital, and all other business or commercial entities that provide services to the public, would be allowed to employ unlicensed personnel to perform any or all of its electrical work; see General Statutes \u00a7 20-330 (2);<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> any or all of its elevator installation, repair and maintenance work; see General Statutes \u00a7 20-330 (7);<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> any or all of its heating, piping and cooling work; see General Statutes \u00a7 20-330 (5);<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and any or all of its fire protection sprinkler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>systems work. See General Statutes \u00a7 20-330 (9).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The significant additional public health and safety implications raised by a broad application of the exemption to those occupations militates strongly in favor of the less expansive interpretation of the term \u201cindustrial firm\u201d urged by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">This case presents a good example of why the legislature, for purposes of granting exemptions under \u00a7 20-340 (6) from the licensure requirements of \u00a7 20-334, distinguished between firms engaged in manufacturing activities and firms engaged in other business or commercial pursuits. In the case of a firm or company involved in a manufacturing activity, the general public is unlikely to be affected by the plumbing and piping work performed at the manufacturing site. By contrast, faulty plumbing and piping poses a far greater public safety risk in the case of an enterprise that, like the hospital, provides services to the public. Moreover, manufacturing firms are far more likely than most other businesses to employ persons who, due to their mechanical and engineering training and skill, may be able to rectify problems arising from substandard plumbing and piping work performed by unlicensed personnel. Consequently, the legislature reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>concluded that the need for licensed personnel is significantly less in the case of a firm engaged in manufacturing activities than it is for other business and commercial enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">We conclude, therefore, contrary to the determination of the trial court, that the hospital is not an \u201cindustrial firm\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 20-340 (6). Accordingly, the plaintiffs are not exempt from the licensure requirements of chapter 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C.

There is nothing in the relevant legislative debate, however, indicating an intent by the legislature to exempt service providers, as distinguished from firms engaged in manufacturing activities, from the licensure requirements. Indeed, the limited debate about the licensure requirements, which focuses almost exclusively on the applicability of those requirements to a firm engaged in industrial manufacturing and construction, arguably suggests a contrary conclusion. Specifically, Senator Morgan McGuire raised the following concern about the applicability of the licensure requirements to steamfitters: \u201c[T]here are many industries in the state lhathave great numbers of electrical workers, for example, great numbers of steamfitters. ...

Section 20-340 (6), however, contains no such requirement. Consequently, a business or commercial enterprise that is entitled to the exemption created under \u00a7 20-340 (6) need not employ <em>any </em>licensed plumbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The plaintiffs also maintain that there is no logical reason why the legislature would exempt persons employed by federal, state and municipal agencies from the statutory licensure requirements; see General Statutes \u00a7 20-340 (1); and not also exempt persons employed by private enterprises, like the hospital, which provide the same or similar services. We disagree. Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, it was reasonable for the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>to entrust to each of those governmental entities the responsibility for regulatory oversight of its public agencies. The dissent argues that this reasoning is flawed because the state also is responsible for the regulatory oversight of some private agencies, as illustrated by the number of regulations that apply to hospitals. The dissent fails to acknowledge, however, that its proposed broad definition of service provider encompasses other service providers who are not as heavily regulated as hospitals, such as large corporations, insurance companies, restaurants, and private colleges. The lack of strict health and safety regulations affecting these businesses is all the more reason to believe that the legislature intended, as a minimal safety requirement, that the plumbers and electricians working on those buildings at least be licensed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-330 (2) provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Electrical world means the installation, erection, maintenance, alteration or repair of any wire, cable, conduit, busway, raceway, support, insulator, conductor, appliance, apparatus, fixture or equipment which generates, transforms, transmits or uses electrical energy for light, heat, power or other purposes . . .

The decision of the majority unfortunately will have a substantial adverse impact on hospitals and other institutions by requiring them to employ licensed plumbers and other tradesmen in order to perform trivial tasks that are performed everyday by ordinary persons in their own homes. For example, the named plaintiff, Hartford Hospital (plaintiff), which, according to the majority, does not fall within the definition of \u201cindustrial firm\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 20-340 (6), will now be required to employ a licensed plumber to replace a faucet in a bathroom sink or, for that matter, to replace the washer in the faucet.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court\u2019s decision, applicable to providers of services, such as hospitals, private educational institutions, corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>complexes and the like, will not only result in increased labor costs, but also, decreased maintenance services during periods when the economy is robust and skilled labor is scarce.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The plaintiff argues that it is exempt from the statutory licensing requirements<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with respect to plumbing work pursuant to \u00a7 20-340 (6) because it falls within the definition of industrial firm. Section 20-340 (6) provides an exemption for \u201cemployees of industrial firms whose main duties concern the maintenance of the electrical, plumbing and piping, solar, heating, piping and cooling, or elevator installation, repair and maintenance work of such firm on its own premises or on premises leased by it for its own use . ...\u201d In construing this exemption, we are required to look \u201cto the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, 240 Conn. 422, 431, 692 A.2d 742 (1997); and to the legislative scheme in which the exemption is set forth. <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 663-64, 680 A.2d 242 (1996). We are also required to use our \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cassume that [the legislature intended to accomplish] a reasonable and rational result . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Caltabiano </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 662, 667, 560 A.2d 975 (1989). I conclude that the majority, by narrowly defining the term industrial firm as one engaged only in manufacturing activities, does nothing to advance the legislative scheme of protecting the consuming public, but, rather, unnecessarily adds costs to vital services required by the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>I begin my analysis with the language of the statute. The defendants, the state department of consumer protection and the state plumbing and piping work examining board do not contest that the plaintiff is clearly a \u201cfirm\u201d under any definition of the term, and thus the inquiry is whether a hospital is \u201cindustrial\u201d in order to satisfy the requirement for an exemption under \u00a7 20-340 (6). The majority concludes that a service provider, like a hospital, does not fit within the \u201ccommonly approved usage of the term \u2018industrial firm\u2019 \u201d because that term \u201cmore readily brings to mind commercial entities engaged in manufacturing activities.\u201d The dictionary definition of industry, however, includes reference to both manufacturing concerns and providers of services.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is an established rule of construction that we not only use our common sense, but \u201c[w]here a statute does not define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding expressed ... in dictionaries.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 183, 186, 438 A.2d 859 (1981). Moreover, service businesses, such as insurance, health care, credit and banking, are commonly referred to as industry. Thus, the term \u201cindustrial firm\u201d is not restricted to manufacturing activities in its common usage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>I also find support for exempting the plaintiff from the licensing requirements in the legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 20-334. The primary purpose of the licensing requirement in \u00a7 20-334<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was to protect the general consuming public from unqualified and/or unscrupulous contractors. Roswell Goodman, the executive director of Hartford Mechanical Contractors, Inc., testified before the legislative committee on General Law when it was considering the bill, which was subsequently codified as \u00a7 20-334, that \u201c[n]ot only have we members of this industry, the people who work with the tools and the contractors to consider, but we have got to think about <em>the people who they are serving, </em>the public.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, General Law, Pt. 1, 1965 Sess., p. 348. Robert Hartigan, appearing before the same committee on behalf of the Connecticut Light and Power Company, concurred that \u201cthe purpose [of \u00a7 20-334] is to protect the public and maintain certain minimum standards in competence to the public.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, General Law, Pt. 3, 1965 Sess., pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>1138-39. Hartigan commented further that, <em>\u201cof course, [the licensing requirements of \u00a7 </em>20-334] <em>would not be applicable to our employees who do not work for the general public, but work for </em>companies.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 1139. Senator Paul Amenta confirmed this legislative purpose during debate on \u00a7 20-334 when he stated, \u201cif a person works for an individual firm, [he is] not going to offer himself to the general public . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 61 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1965 Sess., p. 2187. Furthermore, a review of the specific eleven exemptions in \u00a7 20-340 demonstrates that the legislature was concerned with creating a state licensing system for plumbers, electricians and heating and cooling technicians who come into <em>direct contact with the public. </em>For example, employees of \u201cany federal, state or municipal agency,\u201d as set forth in subdivision (1), \u201cemployees of stage and theatrical companies,\u201d as set forth in subdivision (9), and \u201cemployees of carnivals, circuses or similar transient amusement shows,\u201d as set forth in subdivision (10), all of whom are exempt from the licensing requirements, do not hold themselves out to the public as being qualified to perform plumbing, electrical or heating and cooling services.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The majority argues that if \u00a7 20-340 (6) covers employees of the plaintiff, the exemptions created by \u00a7 20-340 (9) and (10) for employees of stage and theatrical companies and employees of carnivals, circuses or similar transient amusement shows \u201cwould be unnecessary because those persons already would be exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>from the statutory licens[ing] requirements by operation of \u00a7 20-340 (6).\u201d According to the majority, if the legislature had wanted to limit the statutory licensing requirement to persons who perform services for the general public, \u201cit easily could have done so without creating the numerous exemptions set forth under \u00a7 20-340,\u201d and the \u201cfact that [it] eschewed that approach . . . [by creating eight more exemptions] suggests that it did not intend such a sweeping application of \u00a7 20-340 (6).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the legislature did not intend a sweeping application of \u00a7 20-340 (6). The legislative history of No. 789, \u00a7 12, of the 1967 Public Acts, which added six licensing exemptions; now General Statutes \u00a7 20-340 (2), (3), (4), (5), (7) and (9);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> indicates that the exemptions were listed with specificity because the act was \u201cmerely a technical amendment\u201d of Public Acts, Spec. Sess., February, 1965, No. 493, \u00a7 9. 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2, 1967 Sess., p. 5376, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>remarks of Representative Edwin A. Lassman. According to Lassman, the legislature simply wanted to redefine certain \u201coccupational provisions,\u201d and redefine \u201careas [of Public Acts, Spec. Sess., February, 1965, No. 493, \u00a7 9] so that ambiguities could be cleared up in the various fields of licensing.\u201d Id. There is no indication from this history that the legislature wanted local plumbing enforcement officers to limit \u00a7 20-340 (6) to manufacturing firms.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the legislature reasonably could have concluded that it was sound policy to exempt plumbers employed to work in state operated hospitals, such as the state veterans hospital, and elementary, junior high and senior high schools, while requiring employees of private service providers, such as the plaintiff, Yale New Haven Hospital, Trinity College and Wesleyan University, to be licensed before they can perform plumbing tasks. The exemption for employees of industrial firms was one of three exemptions in the original version of \u00a7 20-334. The other exemptions were those for employees of federal, state and municipal agencies (now \u00a7 20-340 [1]) and public service company employees (now \u00a7 20-340 [2]).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to the majority, the legislature determined in 1965, that it was acceptable to have unlicensed plumbers work in state operated hospitals, where the plumbing work \u201cis critical to the health and safety of [the] patients,\u201d and public schools, where thousands of young students in the state attend class and may use gas lines for basic laboratory work, but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>would not be acceptable to have unlicensed plumbers in private hospitals and schools. This distinction does not make sense. \u201c[Compelling principles of statutoiy construction . . . require us to construe a statute in a manner that will not . . . lead to [such] absurd results.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 712-13, 595 A.2d 297 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The majority points to no legislative history to justify this untenable result. Instead, the majority assumes that there is some form of assurance of safety in private manufacturing firms and federal, state and municipal agencies that does not exist in private service providing firms. The majority argues, without any basis, that hospitals and other service providers are less likely than manufacturing firms to voluntarily employ licensed supervisory employees, who \u201cmay be able to rectify problems arising from substandard plumbing and piping work performed by unlicensed personnel.\u201d I disagree with this reasoning because private service providing firms, such as hospitals and schools, have the same incentive as manufacturing entities and public service providers to act with reasonable care and employ licensed supervisory persons \u2014 they both want to avoid any liability that could arise from allowing unlicensed plumbers to work without proper supervision. In fact, the plaintiff, like nearly every private hospital in the state, maintains a department of facilities and management, which ensures that its employees perform competent plumbing work under proper supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The majority also argues that it is logical for the state to treat state agencies differently from private firms providing similar services because the legislature reasonably could have entrusted \u201ceach of those governmental entities [with] the responsibility for regulatory oversight of its public agencies.\u201d The flaw in this analysis is simple: state agencies are equally as responsible for regulatory oversight of private service providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>firms like hospitals as they are for public service providing firms. For example, pursuant to \u00a7 19-13-D3 (a) (1) and (2) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which was adopted by the department of health prior to 1965 when the \u201cindustrial firm\u201d exception was created, hospitals are required to provide adequate equipment for patient service, \u201cin accordance with the requirements of the <em>slate department of health,\u201d </em>and \u201cthe requirements of the <em>state fire safety code.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Moreover, hospitals have to pass inspection of the <em>local fire marshall </em>each year in order to file their annual applications for operating licenses. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19-13-D3 (a) (2). Furthermore, \u201c[a]reas in which explosive gases are used, and areas in which radioactive materials are used shall meet the requirements of the <em>state department of health </em>for adequate protection of patients and personnel.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19-13-D3 (a) (3). Above all else, hospitals must ensure that \u201c[t]he management, personnel, equipment, facilities, sanitation and maintenance of the hospital shall be such as reasonably to ensure the health, comfort and safety of the patients at all times.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19-13-D3 (h) (6) (now \u00a7 19-13-D3 [i] [7]). In light of the state\u2019s regulatory oversight of hospitals, it would have been unreasonable for the legislature to have concluded that public hospital employees who perform plumbing work, as opposed to private hospital employees who perform similar work, would be better supervised.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">I conclude that the plaintiff and its employees, the plaintiffs Herve Gelinas, Charles Rowe and Amrit Kalicharen, did not violate the statutory licensing provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>of \u00a7 20-334 by performing plumbing and piping work on hospital premises without a certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-9\"> The nature of the plumbing duties that were at issue in this case is best described by reference to the declaratory ruling of the state plumbing and piping work examining board (board), which includes the following statement: \u201cThe aforesaid duties, which [the plaintiff] avers should not require a license, include:</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">\u201c(a) Maintenance of leaky sinks and drains, and packing of faucets;</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">\u201c(b) Replacement of valves to correct running toilets;</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">\u201c(c) Maintenance/replacement of shower heads, hoses and nozzles;</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">\u201c(d) Maintenance of kitchen garbage disposals;</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">\u201c(e) Replacement of vacuum breakers on sinks; and</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>\u201c(f) Maintenance and/or unplugging of plaster traps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The board ruled that \u201c[a]ll the stated plumbing-related duties involve the performance of plumbing work,\u201d and that a license was required to perform such work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\"> See footnote 5 of the majority opinion for the text of General Statutes \u00a7 20-334, which sets forth the licensing requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b753-5\"> Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines industry in relevant part as: \u201c3a: systematic labor especially] for the creation of value . . . b: a department or branch of a craft, art, business, or manufacture: a division of productive or profit-making labor; esp[ecially]: one that employs a large personnel and capital esp[ecially] in manufacturing . . . c: a group of productive or profit-making enterprises or organizations that have a similar technological structure of production and that <em>produce or supply technically substitutable goods, services or sources of income </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\"> The majority mistakenly argues that the plaintiffs construction of General Statutes \u00a7 20-330 (2), which defines the term \u201celectrical work,\u201d would allow \u201call commercial entities\u201d to employ unlicensed personnel to perform its electrical work, and any or all of its elevator installations.

Furthermore, it is absurd to believe that a private service providing firm, like the plaintiff here, which must prove each year that it has systems and personnel in place to protect the health and welfare of its patients and personnel or risk losing its operating license; see Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19-13-D3; would be more likely to allow one of its employees to install an elevator than would supervisors in a public school.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\"> Section 20-334 was also part of a legislative scheme to replace municipal licensing of skilled trades with a uniform statewide system of licensing. <em>White Oak Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Consumer Protection, </em>12 Conn.

This argument is flawed because the exemption of municipal, state and federal employees, theater and carnival employees and manufacturing employees raises equally as significant public health and safety implications. Indeed, government facilities, entertainment facilities and large manufacturers serve the same number of members of the general public, if not more, than service providing firms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b756-6\"> Public Acts 1967, No. 789, \u00a7 12, added the following six exemptions to \u00a7 20-340: (1) \u201cemployees of industrial firms whose main duties concern the . . . fabrication of electrical, plumbing and piping, heating, piping and cooling ... or elevator installation, repair and maintenance equipment used in the production of goods sold by [such] industrial firms\u201d; (2) \u201cemployees of any municipal corporation specially chartered by the state of Connecticut\u201d; (3) \u201cemployees of any contractor while said contractor is performing work for or subject to inspection by any federal, state or municipal agency or corporation other than a municipal building department, or any public service company\u201d; (4) \u201cpersons engaged in the installation, maintenance, repair and service of electrical or other appliances of a size customarily used for domestic use where such installation commences at an outlet receptacle or connection previously installed by persons licensed to do the same and maintenance, repair and service is confined to the appliance itself and its internal operation\u201d; (5) \u201cpersons performing work necessary to the manufacture or repair of any apparatus, appliances, fixtures, equipment or devices produced by it for sale or lease\u201d; and (6) \u201cemployees of stage and theatrical companies performing the operation, installation and maintenance of electrical equipment if such installation commences at an outlet receptacle or connection previously installed by persons licensed to make such installation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b757-6\"> Public Acts, Spec.
