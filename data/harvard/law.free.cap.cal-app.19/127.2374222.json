To this complaint the court sustained a general demurrer. Plaintiff declining to amend, judgment was entered for defendant, from which plaintiff appeals upon the judgment-roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">Assuming that defendant was a corporation having no capital stock (which fact, though not elearly appearing, is conceded by counsel), plaintiff\u2019s liability as a member thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>is fixed by section 322 of the Civil Code. Under this provision the liability for the debts of such corporation is equally distributed between all the members thereof, and plaintiff, in the absence of any contractual obligation disclosed by the complaint, was liable for her share only of such debt. Since the statutory obligation to pay the debt of the corporation was thus limited to her share thereof, upon payment of which she would secure a release of liability, it must follow that, in the absence of any act of defendant authorizing the same, the payment of any sum in excess of her share was a purely voluntary contribution on her part and imposed upon defendant corporation no legal obligation to reimburse her for the amount so contributed. <em>(Huddleston </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>136 Cal. 519, [69 Pac. 146] ; <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>55 Cal. 106; <em>McGlew </em>v. <em>McDade, </em>146 Cal. 553, [80 Pac. 695].)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">It follows there was no error of the court in sustaining the demurrer, and the judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Allen, P.
