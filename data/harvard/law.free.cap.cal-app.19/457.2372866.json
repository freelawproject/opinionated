This application prays for a writ directing the respondents to vacate and set aside the order made and entered dismissing the appeal. We are of opinion that this writ should be denied upon the authority of <em>Rigby </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>162 Cal. 334, [122 Pac. 958]; <em>W. P. Jeffreys &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>13 Cal. App. 193, [109 Pac. 147], and <em>Stimpson Scale Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>12 Cal.
