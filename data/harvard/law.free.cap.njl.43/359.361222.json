DUNN, WHO APPLIES TO BE ADMITTED TO EXAMINATION FOR ATTORNEY\u2019S LICENSE.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b389-8\">The rule which directs that every applicant for examination for an attorney\u2019s license, must first have served a regular clerkship with some practicing attorney for four years, requires that the applicant should, during that period, have been actually engaged in assisting the attorney whom he serves, in his business and under his control. The rule is not complied with by the mere study of law for four years, coupled with the registering of the student\u2019s name in an attorney\u2019s docket and occasional visits to his office. Full, fair and <em>bona fide </em>service as a regular assistant is enjoined.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-9\">On motion to admit Mr. John T.

C. Spencer.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-12\"><em>Contra, J. R. English </em>and <em>R. E.

It indicates that Mr. Dunn has, during the last four years, given considerable time to the study of law, but that is not what the express provisions of the rule demand. Whether an applicant has studied sufficiently is left, by our rules, to be determined upon the examination which he must undergo; and altogether aside from that question is the inquiry whether he has served the necessary clerkship.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The substance of this prerequisite it is not difficult to perceive. A clerkship to an attorney imports the office of assistant to an attorney, an actual occupation in and about the attorney\u2019s business and under his control. The service is to be rendered, not solely or mainly by the study of law-books, but chiefly by attending to the work of the attorney under his direction. The purpose of the rule is that the clerk shall be actually engaged in the practice of law under the guidance of his master for the stated period, so that by direct contact with an attorney\u2019s duties he may acquire the skill and facility in the profession which are necessary for enabling him to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>tect and promote independently the interests that clients may afterwards commit to him. This is the sole object of requiring the clerkship to be served with a practicing attorney. For the mere study of legal principles, a retired counselor or a professor would be an apter guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The rule is a very old one in this state. It is found among the rules as revised at February Term, 1805, and printed in <em>Coxe, p. VI. </em>No doubt it was derived from the English statutes of 2 Geo. II., chaps. 23, 46, which required similar service.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Under these acts, the King\u2019s Bench struck an attorney\u2019s name from the roll, because it appeared that he had not, during the whole time of his preliminary clerkship, been actually employed by the attorney to whom he was articled in the proper business, practice or employment of an attorney. <em>In re Taylor, </em>6 <em>D. &amp; R. </em>428. And in <em>Ex parte Hill, 1 T. R. </em>452, and <em>In re Smith, 10 Jur. </em>(N. <em>S.) </em>939, the alleged service was deemed insufficient, because not rendered at the place of business of the master, or one presided over by him or some partner or managing clerk representing him, and competent to instruct the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">But we need not cite other cases for the interpretation of the rule. Its language is clear, and, in our judgment, expresses what we have above stated to be its meaning. In the present case, the applicant and the.attorney seem both to have misconceived its purport. They have regarded study as equivalent to clerkship. We do not. We are not called upon to determine whether the pursuits of the applicant outside of his legal studies were incompatible with the full, fair and <em>bona fide </em>service of a clerkship, (in which event alone are they forbidden by the rule,) because, we think, there has been no attempt, either by the applicant to render or by the attorney to exact, at least during three years of the designated term, such a regular clerkship as the rule enjoins.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The motion to admit Mr. Dunn to examination must be refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
