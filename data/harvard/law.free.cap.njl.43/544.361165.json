It is shown that this map was in the office of the clerk of Camden county as early as 1865, and that it was marked <em>\u201c </em>Map of the land of the Gloucester Land Company,\u201d in the handwriting of Benjamin Browning, who was clerk of said county from 1849 to 1859. It was not marked \u201c filed,\u201d but was kept with other maps filed in the office, and on it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>endorsed a resolution of the land company, purporting to be signed by its president, that it be filed in the clerk\u2019s office. This map was transferred to the register\u2019s office with other maps, when that office was established in 1875.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The twenty-first section of the city charter, before mentioned, passed in February, 1868, refers to a map of lots and streets of the said land company on file in the clerk\u2019s office, and there is no evidence to show that any other map had, prior to that time, been filed by said company. Under the evidence in the case, there can be no doubt that this is the map mentioned in the city charter. The effect of it is to dedicate Hudson street as there laid down, and it was not in the power of the relator to retract and annul the prior dedication, by filing a new map in 1879.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The defendant, therefore, had a right to extend Hudson street as laid down upon the earlier map.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">A further objection to the proceeding is taken, that the ordinance is not in conformity with the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The petition asks for an ordinance to lay out and open Hudson street upon its present line from Broadway to the new bridge over Newton creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">The ordinance orders it to be laid out and extended in the' same course as Hudson street (south, fifty-one degrees five minutes cast,) for a distance of one thousand eight hundred and twenty-two and a half <em>feet; </em>thence in an easterly direction five hundred and forty-one feet, to the centre of the new bridge over Newton creek. The improvement ordered is substantially that applied for, but if there was a departure from the petition, the relator having dedicated the street as far as the West Jersey railroad and owning no lands over which the street is laid east of the railroad, will not be permitted to annul the proceedings. <em>State, Montgomery pros., </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Trenton, </em>7 <em>Vroom </em>79.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">The <em>certiorari </em>should be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
