The power given to the common council in the charter of New Brunswick to license and regulate hawkers, peddlers and others, is a police power for the purpose of regulation only, and cannot be used for the purpose of raising revenue.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b205-6\">2. If the ordinances passed in pursuance of this authority are in effect revenue measures, they are illegal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b205-7\">3. Proceedings for the recovery of penalties for violating city ordinances cannot be commenced by summary arrest without process, but must be conducted in the same manner prescribed in the Small Cause act.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-8\">On <em>certiorari to </em>review conviction for violation of an ordinance of the city of New Brunswick.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-9\">Argued at November Term, 1880, before Justices Yan Syckel and Magie.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-10\">For the plaintiff, <em>George Berdine.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-11\">For the defendant, <em>Howard MacSherry.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b205-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b205-13\">Van Syckel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO9\">This <em>certiorari </em>is prosecuted to review the proceedings by which the plaintiff was convicted of violating the city ordinance of New Brunswick which forbids peddling without a license, under the penalty of $10 for each offence.</p>\n<p id=\"AtR\">The city charter <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1863, <em>p. </em>359, <em>subd. </em>24,) empowers the common council to pass ordinances to license and regulate carfcmen, hawkers, peddlers, auctioneers, pawnbrokers, junk-shop-keepers and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">Under such grant of power it has been repeatedly held in this state, the right of taxation for revenue purposes is not conferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>It is purely a police power, and must be exercised for the purpose of regulation. The city may be incidentally benefited by the imposition of fines and penalties, but they must be reasonable and appropriate to the regulation of the various pursuits enumerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Any attempt to establish a fiscal scheme under the grant is without authority of law. <em>Kip </em>v. <em>Paterson, </em>2 <em>Dutcher </em>298 ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoboken, </em>4 <em>Vroom </em>280; <em>North Hudson Railway </em>v. <em>Hoboken, </em>12 <em>Vroom </em>71; <em>State </em>v. <em>Long Branch Com\u2019rs, </em>13 <em>Vroom </em>364.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In exercising their power under this charter, the common council passed the following ordinance :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">\u201c There shall be charged to each person licensed as aforesaid, aud paid to the city-clerk, for the use of the city, on issuing the license mentioned in this ordinance, the following sums, together with the clerk\u2019s fee of fifty cents, for making out such license:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">\u201cFor each cart, wagon, truck or dray, $2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">\u201cFor each hawker or peddler, with the privilege of using one peddler\u2019s wagon or cart, $5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">\u201c For each auctioneer, if the person to whom the license is granted is an actual resident of the city of New Brunswick, $10; if a non-resident, $25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">\u201c For each pawnbroker, $30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">\u201c For each junk-shop keeper with the privilege of using one junk Avagon or cart, $10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-13\">\u201cFor each additional junk wagon or cart, $5.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">What license fee may be exacted under this police power Avas considered in the cases above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">In the case in 12 <em>Vroom, </em>the views of Chief Justice Cooley and Judge Dillon Avere cited with approbation. They agree in placing it \u201c Avithin the limit of the necessary or probable expense of issuing the license and of inspecting and regulating the business the license covers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-16\">In State <em>v. </em>Long Branch Com\u2019rs, Justice Knapp says :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-17\">\u201c When authority is given to require the possession of a license, as a condition for selling, a reasonable fee, to cover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>probable expenses, can be demanded. But the exaction of sums in excess of such expenses, and graduated by the amount of business done, can be nothing else than a tax upon sucli business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">This limitation upon the exercise of police power is fully established by the adjudications in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Testing the ordinance in question by this rule, its validity cannot be maintained, if it be made to appear that it was adopted as a revenue measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Whether the circumstances incident to the inspection and regulation of these occupations can justify the imposition of the prescribed rates for a legitimate purpose, is the proper subject of testimony where the validity of ordinances is to be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">In the absence of this alleged defect, the conviction in this case cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">The arrest was made by a constable without process, and the conviction was summary, without any complaint in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">The charter provides that proceedings for the recovery of penalties for the violation of city ordinances shall be conducted in the same manner prescribed in the act entitled \u201cAn act constituting courts for the trial of small causes,\u201d and that in such actions the first process may be by warrant or summons, and that it shall be lawful to declare generally in debt. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1863, <em>p. </em>362, \u00a7\u00a7 33, 49, 51, 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">The conviction is illegal and should be set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
