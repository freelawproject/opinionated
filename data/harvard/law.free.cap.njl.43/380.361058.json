This deponent made demand in writing, signed by deponent and served on the said Henry Layton, on the 28th day of June last, requiring the possession of the premises. And deponent further saith that satisfaction for such rent cannot be obtained by distress of any goods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">Upon filing the affidavit, the justice issued a summons, and proceedings were taken to remove Layton from the premises. These proceedings purported to be under the act entitled \u201cAn act concerning landlords and tenants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">The affidavit is clearly defective in several particulars. It is uncertain whether the removal of the tenant was sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>because of holding over or on account of non-payment of rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">If because of non-payment of rent, the amount unpaid and the time when due should have been stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">If for holding over, the duration of the term should have been set forth in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">A lease for <em>\u201c </em>a few days\u201d is extremely indefinite as to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The proceedings are summary, and the statute must be strictly pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">The affidavit being defective, the justice had no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\"><em>Certiorari </em>in such case is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">The following are authorities on the subject: <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>549; <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Sliker, </em>2 <em>Vroom </em>432; <em>Morris Canal </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>2 <em>Vroom </em>99.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">Proceedings set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
