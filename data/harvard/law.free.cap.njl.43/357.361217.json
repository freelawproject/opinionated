For this reason the Common Pleas dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The appellant was guilty of an omission to perfect and prosecute his appeal with such diligence as the law directs, <em>(Dist. Court Ad, </em>\u00a7 173; <em>Rev., p. </em>1330); and no good cause being shown in excuse of his laches, the court was justified in dismissing his appeal. <em>Lum </em>v. <em>Price, </em>1 <em>Harr. </em>195; <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Van Ness, </em>2 <em>Vroom </em>443.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Let the judgment be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
