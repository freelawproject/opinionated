The plain language of the Rent Stabilization Law permits luxury deregulation for previously stabilized buildings such as Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town. <em>(Pultz v Economakis, </em>10 NY3d 542; <em>State of New York v Patricia II., </em>6 NY3d 160; <em>Jones v Bill, </em>10 NY3d 550; <em>Matter of KSLM-Columbus Apts., Inc. v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>5 NY3d 303; <em>Sarniento v World Yacht Inc., </em>10 NY3d 70; <em>In re Princo Corp., </em>478 F3d 1345; <em>State of New York v Fashion Place Assoc., </em>224 AD2d 280; <em>Matter of Tall Trees Constr.

The Appellate Division erroneously failed to consider that the Legislature\u2019s decision not to modify the deregulation provisions supports the Division of Housing and Community Renewal\u2019s interpretation and dismissal of the complaint. <em>(Matter of Patton Indus. v New York City Conciliation &amp; Appeals Bd., </em>97 AD2d 716; <em>Rent Stabilization Assn, of N.Y.

III. The Appellate Division\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d concerns are irrelevant and unfounded. <em>(Matter of KSLM-Columbus Apts., Inc. v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>5 NY3d 303; <em>Matter of Raritan Dev.

IV The decision\u2019s abrupt departure from prior interpretation supports reversal, but in the event the decision is affirmed, any remedy should not be retroactively applied to defendants. <em>(Chevron Oil Co. v Huson, </em>404 US 97; <em>Gurnee v Aetna Life &amp; Cas.

II. Principles of equity dictate that the Appellate Division\u2019s order, if affirmed, should have only prospective effect. <em>(Chevron Oil Co. v Huson, </em>404 US 97; <em>Gurnee v Aetna Life &amp; Cas.

The Real Property Tax Law and Rent Stabilization Law require that the complex remain rent stabilized until the owners\u2019 J-51 benefits expire. <em>(Matter of Schmidt v Roberts, </em>74 NY2d 513; <em>Matter of Agioritis, </em>52 AD2d 128; <em>Matter of Raritan Dev.

II. The Appellate Division\u2019s reading of the statute avoids inequitable and unreasonable results. <em>(Long v State of New York, </em>7 NY3d 269; <em>People v Santi, </em>3 NY3d 234; <em>People v Kramer, </em>92 NY2d 529; <em>Milbrandt v Green Refractories Co., </em>79 NY2d 26; <em>Matter of Ellington Constr. Corp. v Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Inc. Vil. of New Hempstead, </em>77 NY2d 114.) III. The Appellate Division properly did not defer to the Division of Housing and Community Renewal on this matter of statutory interpretation. <em>(Matter of Gruber [New York City Dept, of Personnel\u2014Sweeney], </em>89 NY2d 225; <em>Matter of Ansonia Residents Assn, v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>75 NY2d 206; <em>Matter of Schenectady Police Benevolent Assn. v New York State Pub.

IV The Division of Housing and Community Renewal regulations conflict with the statute. <em>(Kurcsics v Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>49 NY2d 451; <em>Festa v Leshen, </em>145 AD2d 49; <em>Matter of Nicholas v Kahn, </em>47 NY2d 24.) V. Defendants\u2019 legislative \u201cacquiescence\u201d argument is baseless. <em>(Matter of New York State Assn. of Life Underwriters v New York State Banking Dept., </em>83 NY2d 353; <em>Clark v Cuomo, </em>66 NY2d 185; <em>Rent Stabilization Assn. of N.Y.

Defendants\u2019 public policy arguments are impermissible and, in any event, are speculative and unpersuasive. VII. The Appellate Division\u2019s decision should be retroactive. <em>(Gurnee v Aetna Life &amp; Cas.

The Appellate Division\u2019s decision correctly interprets Rent Stabilization Law ([RSL] Administrative Code of City of NY) \u00a7 26-504 (c), and its interpretation is in harmony with RSL \u00a7\u00a7 26-504.1 and 26-504.2 (a). <em>(Matter of KSLM-Columhus Apts., Inc. v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>5 NY3d 303; New York City <em>Campaign Fin. Bd. v Ortiz, </em>38 AD 3d 75; <em>Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent. School Dist., </em>91 NY2d 577; <em>People v Mobil Oil Corp., </em>48 NY2d 192; <em>Friedman v Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>9 NY3d 105; <em>Matter of Briffel v County of Nassau, </em>31 AD3d 79.) II. The receipt of J-51 tax benefits subjects all apartments to rent stabilization as landlords who receive J-51 tax benefits agree to be governed by rent regulatory statutes. <em>(Denza v Independence Plaza Assoc., LLC, </em>17 Misc 3d 1122[A], 2007 NY Slip Op 51106[U]; <em>State of New York v Fashion Place Assoc., </em>224 AD2d 280, 89 NY2d 917; <em>Kent v Bedford Apts.

The judicial construction of Rent Stabilization Law (Administrative Code of City of NY) \u00a7\u00a7 26-504.1 and 26-504.2 (a) advanced in the appellate decision contradicts established precedents and will have grave consequences for owners of New York City apartment buildings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>their lenders, as well as New York City and state as a whole and therefore must be reversed. II. The Appellate Division\u2019s construction of Rent Stabilization Law \u00a7\u00a7 26-504.1 and 26-504.2 (a) is incorrect.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-5\"><em>Himmelstein, McConnell, Gribben, Donoghue &amp; Joseph, </em>New York City <em>(David S.

Languedoc </em>of counsel), for New York State Tenants &amp; Neighbors Coalition, Inc. and another, amici curiae.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANZ\">I. The Appellate Division correctly determined that the express language of the statute provided that all units for which the owner receives J-51 benefits may not be deregulated, regardless of how or when the units first became rent stabilized. <em>(Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent. School Dist., </em>91 NY2d 577; <em>Matter of Alonzo M. v New York City Dept, of Probation, </em>72 NY2d 662; <em>State of New York v Fashion Place Assoc., </em>224 AD2d 280.) II. The legislative history of the Decontrol Law supports the Appellate Division\u2019s construction of the statute. III. The Appellate Division correctly found that the Decontrol Law is to be interpreted in a manner consistent with the purpose of the J-51 Law and the rent laws. <em>(518 E. 13th Owner, LLC v Ellis, </em>22 Misc 3d 446; <em>Matter of Bleecker St. Mgt. Co. v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>284 AD2d 174, 97 NY2d 606; <em>Matter of KSLM-Columbus Apts., Inc. v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>5 NYSd 303; <em>Drucker v Mauro, </em>30 AD3d 37, 7 NY3d 844; <em>Pultz v Economakis, </em>40 AD3d 24, 10 NY3d 542.) IV Defendants\u2019 misapplication of the Decontrol Law has resulted in a loss of affordable housing. <em>(Jemrock Realty Co. LLC v Krugman, </em>64 AD3d 290; <em>Matter of KSLM-Columbus Apts., Inc. v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>6 AD3d 28, 5 NY3d 303.) V Neither the Division of Housing and Community Renewal\u2019s misinterpretation of the law nor the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s policies provide a basis to reverse the court below. <em>(Matter of Community Hous. Improvement Program v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>230 AD2d 66; <em>Doctors Council v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>71 NY2d 669; <em>Matter of Dworman v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>94 NY2d 359; <em>Kurcsics v Merchants Mut.

Cabrera </em>of counsel), for Community Housing Improvement Program, Inc. and another, amici curiae.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWF\">I. The construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>relevant statutes and regulations adopted by the Appellate Division will have severe and unwarranted consequences to all owners of units which had been properly exempted from rent stabilization under the previously unquestioned administrative interpretation upon which the real estate community relied. <em>(Noto v Bedford Apts. Co., </em>21 AD3d 762.) II. The presence of deregulated apartments in a J-51 building results in lower rents for current rent-stabilized tenants. III. The Supreme Court properly dismissed the complaint because the apartments at issue were properly deregulated as a matter of law. <em>(Matter of Prince Wooster Corp. v Tax Commn. of City of NY., </em>115 Misc 2d 100; <em>Matter of M.B., </em>6 NY3d 437; <em>Long v State of New York, </em>7 NY3d 269; <em>Matter of Orens v Novello, </em>99 NY2d 180; <em>Matter of Dworman v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>94 NY2d 359; <em>Samiento v World Yacht Inc., </em>10 NY3d 70; <em>Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent.

Bragg, Jr., </em>of counsel), for Maria del Carmen Arroyo and others, amici curiae.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGi\">I. The First Department correctly held that the plain language of the Rent Regulation Reform Act makes clear that high rent decontrol does not apply to units in the J-51 program. <em>(Geissal v Moore Medical Corp., </em>524 US 74; <em>State of New York v Fashion Place Assoc., </em>224 AD2d 280; <em>Matter of DaimlerChrysler Corp. v Spitzer, </em>7 NY3d 653; <em>Matter of Washington Post Co. v New York State Ins. Dept, </em>61 NY2d 557.) II. Appellants\u2019 argument ignores the legislative history of the Rent Regulation Reform Act, which clearly demonstrates that the Legislature intended to exempt all J-51 units from high rent decontrol. <em>(Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent. School Dist., </em>91 NY2d 577; <em>Northeast Bancorp, Inc. v Board of Governors, FRS, 4=12 </em>US 159; <em>People ex rel. Davies v Cowles, </em>13 NY 350.) III. Appellants\u2019 construction of the Rent Regulation Reform Act is at odds with other provisions of the Real Property Tax Law and Rent Stabilization Law which demonstrate the Legislature\u2019s long-standing intent that all J-51 units remain rent stabilized. <em>(Matter of Seaman, </em>78 NY2d 451.) IV The City Council intended that J-51 units be rent stabilized, and appellants fall far short of meeting the high standard of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the Legislature intended to preempt the City Council. <em>(Matter of Spielvogel v Ford, </em>1 NY2d 558; <em>Bates v Dow </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>Agrosciences LLC, </em>544 US 431; <em>Incorporated Vil. of Nyack v Daytop Vil., </em>78 NY2d 500; <em>Le Drugstore Etats Unis v New York State Bd. of Pharm., </em>33 NY2d 298; <em>Matter of Pell v Coveney, </em>37 NY2d 494; <em>Khrapunskiy v Doar, </em>49 AD3d 201; <em>State of New York v Green, </em>96 NY2d 403; <em>41 Kew Gardens Rd.

Rent Stabilization Law ([RSL] Administrative Code of City of NY) \u00a7 26-504 (c) does not apply to apartments that originally became subject to stabilization for reasons other than receiving J-51 benefits, which thereafter received such benefits, and does not bar luxury deregulation under RSL \u00a7\u00a7 26-504.1 and 26-504.2. <em>(Matter of 275 Webster Tenants v Wright, </em>238 AD2d 143; <em>La Guardia v Cavanaugh, </em>53 NY2d 67; <em>Matter of KSLM-Columbus Apts., Inc. v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>5 NY3d 303; <em>8200 Realty Corp. v Lindsay, </em>27 NY2d 124; <em>Riley v County of Broome, </em>95 NY2d 455; <em>Matter of Metropolitan Life Ins.

Rent Stabilization Law ([RSL] Administrative Code of City of NY) \u00a7\u00a7 26-504.1 and 26-504.2 allow apartments like those at Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town to be luxury deregulated, irrespective of how broadly RSL \u00a7 26-504 (c) is interpreted. <em>(Matter of Tall Trees Constr.

The Appellate Division, when construing Rent Stabilization Law ([RSL] Administrative Code of City of NY) \u00a7\u00a7 26-504.1 and 26-504.2, failed to take into account the rent regulatory community\u2019s long-term practical construction of those provisions. <em>(Rent Stabilization Assn, of NY.

We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">In New York City, multiple dwellings may qualify for tax incentives designed to encourage rehabilitation and improvements <em>(see </em>Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 11-243 [previously \u00a7 J51-2.5]). Specifically, the City\u2019s J-51 program, authorized by Real Property Tax Law \u00a7 489, allows property owners who complete eligible projects to receive tax exemptions and/or abatements that continue for a period of years. Eligible projects include moderate and gut rehabilitations; major capital improvements (for example, asbestos abatement or boiler replacement); and conversions of lofts and other nonresidential buildings into multiple dwellings <em>(see </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 11-243 [b] [2], [3], [8]; 28 RCNY 5-03 [a]). Rental units in buildings receiving these exemptions and/or abatements must be registered with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), and are generally subject to rent stabilization for at least as long as the J-51 benefits are in force <em>(see </em>28 RCNY 5-03 [f|). The Department of Housing Preservation and Development administers the J-51 program in the City of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">MetLife apparently first applied for and received J-51 benefits for the properties in 1992. At the time, the apartment complexes, which MetLife built in the 1940s, had already been rent-stabilized since at least 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">In 1993, the Legislature enacted the Rent Regulation Reform Act (RRRA) (L 1993, ch 253), which provided for the luxury decontrol or deregulation of certain rent-stabilized apartments. The RRRA identified two circumstances in which deregulation was warranted: (1) in vacant apartments where the legal regulated rent was $2,000 per month or more; and (2) in occupied apartments where the legal regulated rent was $2,000 per month or more and the combined annual income of all occupants exceeded $250,000 per year (RSL [Administrative Code] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 26-504.1, 26-504.2). The RRRA carved out an exception to luxury decontrol, which stated: \u201cthis exclusion [i.e., luxury decontrol] shall not apply to housing accommodations which became or become subject to this law [i.e., the RSL] (a) by virtue of receiving tax benefits pursuant to section . . . four hundred eighty-nine of the real property tax law [J-51 benefits]\u201d (RSL \u00a7\u00a7 26-504.1, 26-504.2 [a]). The Legislature subsequently expanded the scope of luxury decontrol by lowering the income threshold for defining high-income households to $175,000 and allowing postvacancy improvements to count toward the $2,000 per month rent threshold (L 1997, ch 116); and permitting deregulated units to remain deregulated even if an owner subsequently charges less than the $2,000 per month threshold (L 2003, ch 82).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">On January 16, 1996\u2014prior to the 1997 amendments to the RRRA\u2014DHCR issued an advisory opinion, which stated that participation in the J-51 program only precluded luxury decontrol \u201cwhere the receipt of such benefits is the <em>sole reason </em>for the accommodation being subject to rent regulation\u201d (emphasis added). On its face, the DHCR advisory opinion relies exclusively on a textual interpretation of the RRRA\u2019s relevant provisions. Further, DHCR took the position that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">\u201cwhere Luxury Decontrol is applied before the \u2018J-51\u2019 tax benefit period has expired, the abatement should be reduced proportionately. That the Legislature recognized the inherent inequity of an owner\u2019s continuing to enjoy tax benefits after decontrol is apparent from RPTL Section 489 7 (b) (1), which provides that as to . . . [\u2018]any multiple dwelling, building or structure which is decontrolled subsequent to the granting of such benefits, the local legislative body or other governing agency may withdraw such benefits from such dwelling.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In April 2000, DHCR proposed changes to the Rent Stabilization Code (RSC) in order to \u201cconform regulations to statutes, particularly the RRRAs of 1993 and 1997, judicial determinations and . . . agency practice\u201d (22 NY Reg [issue 14], Apr. 5, 2000, at 17). After public hearing and comment, DHCR adopted these changes, which became effective on December 20, 2000 (see 22 NY Reg [issue 51], Dec. 20, 2000, at 18-20 [notice of adoption]). As relevant to this appeal, DHCR amended section 2520.11 of the RSC, titled \u201cApplicability,\u201d to provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">\u201c[luxury decontrol] shall not apply to housing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>accommodations which became or become subject to the RSL and this Code:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\u201c(i) <em>solely </em>by virtue of the receipt of tax benefits pursuant to . . . section 11-243 (formerly J51-2.5) or section 11-244 (formerly J51-5) of the Administrative Code of the city of New York, as amended\u201d (RSC [9 NYCRR] \u00a7 2520.11 [r] [5]; [s] [2] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">And in February 2004, DHCR issued (and subsequently reissued in January 2007) Fact Sheet 36, entitled \u201cHigh-Rent Vacancy Decontrol and High-Rent High-income Decontrol,\u201d which similarly specified that \u201c[a]partments that are subject to rent regulation <em>only because of </em>the receipt [of J-51 benefits] do not qualify for high-rent vacancy decontrol\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">At some point after the RRRA was enacted, MetLife, with DHCR\u2019s approval (see RSL \u00a7 26-504.3 [b]), began charging market-rate rents for those rental units in the properties where the conditions for high rent/high income luxury decontrol were met. In late 2006, MetLife sold the properties to PCV/ST for $5.4 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Months after the sale, plaintiffs\u2014nine individuals who reside in seven apartments in the apartment complex\u2014sued MetLife and PCV/ST on behalf of a putative class of all current and former tenants who allegedly were, or will be, charged rents that exceed rent stabilization levels for any period during which the landlord receives real estate tax benefits under the J-51 program. Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that \u201cin or about 2001 or 2002, and continuing through the present time,\u201d defendants have \u201cimproperly and unlawfully charged thousands of tenants market rents, even as [defendants] have collected . . . tax benefits under the J-51 program,\u201d amounting to \u201cnearly $25 million\u201d; they alleged that about one quarter of the 11,200 apartments in the apartment complex had been luxury decontrolled. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that units in the properties would remain rent-stabilized \u201cuntil the last applicable J-51 tax benefits period . . . has expired [in or about 2017 or 2018],\u201d and that defendants would \u201ccomply with all appropriate legal requirements to deregulate the units.\u201d Plaintiffs also sought relief in the form of rental overcharges totaling $215 million and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">PCV/ST and MetLife moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, arguing that the RRRA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>exception to deregulation for apartments that \u201cbecame or become\u201d subject to the RSL \u201cby virtue of\u2019 receiving J-51 tax benefits did not apply to the properties because they did not \u201cbecome subject to\u201d the RSL \u201cby virtue\u201d of the receipt of J-51 tax benefits. Rather, the apartment complex \u201cbecame subject to rent stabilization in or prior to 1974,\u201d nearly two decades before MetLife first received J-51 benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In a decision dated August 16, 2007, Supreme Court dismissed the complaint, reasoning that \u201cthe clear and unambiguous language of the RSL states that the luxury decontrol \u2018exclusion shall not apply to housing accommodations which became or become subject to this law (a) by virtue of receiving [J-51] tax benefits\u2019 \u201d (2007 NY Slip Op 32639, *10, quoting RSL \u00a7\u00a7 26-504.1, 26-504.2 [a]). Because the properties became subject to the RSL \u201c18 years before applying for J-51 tax benefits,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cdefendants did not become subject to rent stabilization by virtue of receiving\u201d these benefits <em>(id. </em>at *11).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Supreme Court further noted that this interpretation, adopted by DHCR, was consistent with the luxury decontrol laws, which were intended to \u201crestore some rationality to a system which provides the bulk of its benefits to high income tenants\u201d <em>(id., </em>quoting <em>Noto v Bedford Apts. Co., </em>21 AD3d 762, 765 [1st Dept 2005] [internal quotation marks omitted]); that DHCR\u2019s interpretation of the statute, if not unreasonable or irrational, was entitled to deference; and that the Legislature\u2019s failure to amend the RSL in response to DHCR\u2019s interpretation when subsequently amending the luxury decontrol provisions showed that it acquiesced in this construction. Plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The Appellate Division unanimously reversed Supreme Court\u2019s decision and order, and reinstated the complaint. The court concluded that building owners who receive J-51 benefits forfeit their rights under the luxury decontrol provisions even if their buildings were already subject to the RSL. According to the Appellate Division, the words \u201cby virtue of\u2019 did not confine the exclusion from luxury deregulation to buildings that became subject to the RSL only because they received J-51 benefits; DHCR\u2019s interpretation of this provision was not entitled to deference because a pure issue of statutory reading and analysis was involved; if the Legislature had intended the provision to mean \u201csolely by virtue of,\u201d as DHCR concluded, it would have used the word \u201csolely\u201d; its interpretation was \u201cmore consistent with the overall statutory scheme,\u201d which made no overt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>distinction between properties \u201csubject to\u201d the RSL solely as a result of the owner\u2019s receipt of J-51 benefits and those \u201csubject to\u201d the RSL before receiving such benefits; and Supreme Court\u2019s reading \u201cinvite[d] absurd and irrational results\u201d <em>(Roberts v Tishman Speyer Props., L.P, </em>62 AD3d 71, 83 [1st Dept 2009]).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The Appellate Division subsequently granted defendants\u2019 motion for leave to appeal, certifying the following question: \u201cWas the order of this Court, which reversed the order of the Supreme Court, properly made?\u201d For the reasons that follow, we answer affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">PCV/ST and MetLife argue principally that the relevant exception to luxury decontrol applies only to accommodations that \u201cbecame or become\u201d subject to the RSL \u201cby virtue of receiving tax benefits pursuant to section . . . four hundred eighty-nine of the real property Tax Law [J-51 benefits]\u201d (RSL \u00a7\u00a7 26-504.1, 26-504.2 [a]). And since the word \u201cbecome\u201d means to \u201cpass from a previous state or condition\u201d or to \u201ctake on a new role, essence, or nature\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language 195 [1963]), a rental unit can \u201cbecome\u201d subject to the RSL only when it passes from being unregulated to being regulated\u2014i.e., when its status changes on account of the owner\u2019s receipt of J-51 benefits. By contrast, a rental unit does not \u201cbecome\u201d subject to the RSL by virtue of receiving J-51 benefits if it was already subject to rent stabilization. According to PCV/ST and MetLife, if the Legislature had intended to preclude luxury deregulation for all rent-stabilized apartments receiving J-51 benefits, it would have omitted the phrases \u201cbecame or become\u201d and \u201cby virtue of\u2019 from the statute, and simply written that the exception did not apply to accommodations \u201creceiving\u201d such tax benefits. They note that the Legislature used this latter phraseology in RSL \u00a7 26-504 (c) (referring to \u201cDwelling units in a building or structure receiving the benefits of [J-51]\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">PCV/ST and MetLife emphasize that since 1996 DHCR\u2014the state agency entrusted with administering rent stabilization\u2014 has interpreted the luxury decontrol provisions in the manner they advocate. This is not, however, entirely correct; DHCR\u2019s interpretation and the one PCV/ST and MetLife now offer are different. DHCR has interpreted \u201cby virtue of\u2019 to mean \u201csolely by virtue of,\u201d while PCV/ST and MetLife rely on the \u201cbecame or become\u201d language of the statute. The two interpretations would lead to the same result in this case, but not in every case. For example, under DHCR\u2019s interpretation, a building that first became subject to the RSL due to receipt of J-51 benefits\u2014but is also subject to the provisions of the RSL for some other reason <em>(see </em>RSL \u00a7 26-504)\u2014would be subject to luxury decontrol because it would not be stabilized \u201csolely\u201d because of J-51 benefits. On the other hand, under the argument made by PCV/ST and MetLife, the same building would be exempt from luxury decontrol because it \u201cbecame\u201d subject to stabilization when the first triggering event\u2014receipt of the J-51 benefits\u2014 occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">It is understandable that PCV/ST and MetLife prefer not to defend DHCR\u2019s reading, because it is contrary to the plain text of the statute. \u201cBy virtue of\u2019 and \u201csolely by virtue of\u2019 simply do not mean the same thing. Nor do we owe deference to DH-CR\u2019s reading, for this appeal does not call upon us to interpret a statute where \u201cspecialized knowledge and understanding of underlying operational practices or . . .an evaluation of factual data and inferences to be drawn therefrom\u201d is at stake such that we should \u201cdefer to the administrative agency\u2019s interpretation unless irrational or unreasonable\u201d <em>(Matter of KSLM-Columbus Apts., Inc. v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, 5 </em>NY3d 303, 312 [2005], quoting <em>Kurcsics v Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>49 NY2d 451, 459 [1980] [internal quotation marks omitted]). Rather, where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">\u201cthe question is one of pure statutory reading and analysis, dependent only on accurate apprehension of legislative intent, there is little basis to rely on any special competence or expertise of the administrative agency and its interpretive regulations . . . And, of course, if the regulation runs counter to the clear wording of a statutory provision, it should not be accorded any weight\u201d <em>(Kurcsics, </em>49 NY2d at 459).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>When construing a statute, we seek to discern and give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent <em>(Carney v Philippone, </em>1 NY3d 333, 339 [2004]), and the starting point for accomplishing this is the statute\u2019s language <em>(Matter of DaimlerChrysler Corp. v Spitzer, </em>7 NY3d 653, 660 [2006]). If the language is ambiguous, we may examine the statute\u2019s legislative history <em>(Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent School Dist, </em>91 NY2d 577, 583 [1998]).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Here, we conclude that defendants\u2019 interpretation of the exception to luxury decontrol for units that \u201cbecame or become\u201d subject to rent stabilization \u201cby virtue of receiving\u201d J-51 benefits conflicts with the most natural reading of the statute\u2019s language. Defendants essentially read these words as recognizing two categories of J-51-benef\u00edtted buildings\u2014those, like the properties, that were rent-stabilized prior to receiving J-51 benefits, for which luxury decontrol became available in 1993; and those that only became rent-stabilized as a condition of receiving J-51 benefits, for which luxury decontrol is unavailable (at least during the benefit period). But there is no language anywhere in the statute delineating these two supposed categories, and we see no indication that the Legislature ever intended such a distinction\u2014one that never occurred to anyone, so far as this record shows, until after the present lawsuit was brought. Contrary to PCV/ST\u2019s and MetLife\u2019s argument, there is nothing impossible, or even strained, about reading the verb \u201cbecome\u201d to refer to achieving, for a second time, a status already attained.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Even assuming that the reading given to \u201cbecame or become\u201d by PCV/ST and MetLife is a possible one, the RRRA\u2019s legislative history better supports our interpretation of the statute. The RRRA\u2019s sponsor stated that luxury decontrol was unavailable to building owners who \u201cenjoy[ed] another system of general public assistance\u201d such as J-51 benefits (NY Senate Debate on Assembly Bill A8859, July 7, 1993, at 8214). Although the dissent accuses us of \u201cpluck[ing] a snippet\u201d of the sponsor\u2019s words to support our conclusion (dissenting op at 291), in response to a question posed by a colleague exploring the very issue presented here, he said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">\u201cshould the exemptions contained in section 489 end, that\u2019s\u2014those J.51s and 489s end, then they would be subject so that at no point do you have the [luxury] decontrol provisions applying to the buildings which have received the tax exemptions that I just mentioned\u201d (Senate Debate at 8214).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The dissent\u2019s attempt to selectively highlight portions of the question does not diminish the force of the sponsor\u2019s answer, which plainly indicates that \u201cat no point\u201d would the luxury decontrol provisions apply to buildings which \u201creceived\u201d tax exemptions being discussed, including J-51 benefits. Certainly it cannot be argued that the thrust of that statement indicates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Nor will we infer, as defendants suggest, that the Legislature\u2019s inactivity in the face of DHCR\u2019s interpretation of the statute constitutes its acquiescence thereto. Legislative inactivity is inherently ambiguous and \u201c \u2018affords the most dubious foundation for drawing positive inferences\u2019 \u201d <em>(Clark v Cuomo, </em>66 NY2d 185, 190-191 [1985], quoting <em>United States v Price, </em>361 US 304, 310-311 [I960]). It is true that, where the practical construction of a statute is well known, the Legislature may be charged with knowledge of that construction and its failure to act may be deemed an acceptance <em>(Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v New York State Human Rights Appeal Bd., </em>41 NY2d 84, 90 [1976]). However, at the time the Legislature most recently considered the statute, there is no indication that the specific question presented here\u2014that DHCR\u2019s interpretation is improper and conflicts with the plain language of the statute\u2014had been brought to the Legislature\u2019s attention <em>(see Kurcsics, </em>49 NY2d at 459 n 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Defendants predict dire financial consequences from our ruling, for themselves and the New York City real estate industry generally. These predictions may not come true; they depend, among other things, on issues yet to be decided, including retroactivity, class certification, the statute of limitations, and other defenses that may be applicable to particular tenants. If the statute imposes unacceptable burdens, defendants\u2019 remedy is to seek legislative relief. Moreover, the dissent predicts that our decision will cause \u201cyears of litigation over many novel questions to deal with the fallout from today\u2019s decision\u201d (dissenting op at 295). That the courts and litigants may experience some additional burden, however, is no reason to eschew what we view as the only correct interpretation of the statute <em>(cf. Matter of Gross v Perales, </em>72 NY2d 231, 237 [1988]).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-9\">.

PCV/ST and MetLife also suggest that if we affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s decision and order, we should apply the statute prospectively rather than retroactively because they reasonably relied on DHCR\u2019s unambiguous and long-standing interpretation of the RSL\u2019s luxury decontrol provisions. Because the lower courts did not consider this issue\u2014as defendants acknowledge\u2014we do not consider it at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Read, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Ayi\">This appeal calls upon the Court to interpret an exception to the luxury decontrol mandated by the Legislature when it enacted the Rent Regulation Reform Act in 1993 (RRRA), \u201ca first attempt to restore some rationality\u201d to the then current rent regulation system by paring back the benefits conferred on \u201cthose not in economic need of protection\u201d (Senate Mem in Support, 1993 NY Legis Ann, at 175). The exception reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">\u201cProvided, however, that this exclusion [for luxury decontrol] shall not apply to housing accommodations which became or become subject to [the Rent Stabilization Law (RSL)] (a) by virtue of receiving tax benefits pursuant to section [421-a] or [489] of the real property Tax Law . . . ,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] or (b) by virtue of article seven-C of the multiple dwelling law\u201d (RSL [Administrative Code of City of NY] \u00a7\u00a7 26-504.1, 26-504.2 [a]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The majority interprets the portion of the exception dealing with Real Property Tax Law \u00a7 489 (which authorizes New York City\u2019s J-51 program) to exclude from luxury decontrol all buildings receiving J-51 tax benefits. Defendants, who point to DH-CR\u2019s long-standing interpretation of the statute, read it to exempt only those buildings subject to the RSL solely because of the receipt of J-51 tax benefits. The majority takes the position that defendants\u2019 view is \u201ccontrary to the plain text of the statute\u201d (majority op at 285), and \u201cconflicts with the most natural reading of the statute\u2019s language\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 286). I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The Statutory Language</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The majority\u2019s interpretation necessarily supposes that the Legislature inserted pointless words into the statute. That is, if the Legislature had intended for all buildings <em>receiving </em>J-51 tax benefits to be exempt from luxury deregulation, it could have easily said just that. Instead, the exception includes 10 additional words\u2014excluding from luxury decontrol those buildings that \u201cbecame or become subject to this law [the RSL] (a) by virtue of\u201d receiving J-51 benefits. We generally assume that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>every word in a statute contributes something to its meaning <em>(see e.g. People v Finley, </em>10 NY3d 647, 655 [2008], citing <em>People v Giordano, </em>87 NY2d 441, 448 [1995], quoting <em>Sanders v Winship, </em>57 NY2d 391, 396 [1982] [\u201cUnder well-established principles of interpretation, effect and meaning should be given to the entire statute and every part and word thereof\u2019 (internal quotation marks omitted)]).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Defendants\u2019 interpretation of the exception, unlike the majority\u2019s, gives meaning to all of its operative language. As defendants point out, the words \u201cbecame\u201d or \u201cbecome\u201d mean to \u201cpass from a previous state or condition and come to be\u201d or to \u201ctake on a new role, essence, or nature\u201d <em>(see </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 195 [1986]). The definition of \u201csubject\u201d is \u201cone that is placed under the authority, dominion, control, or influence of\u2019 <em>(id. </em>at 2275); and the parties do not dispute that \u201cby virtue of\u2019 means \u201cbecause of\u2019 or \u201cby reason of.\u201d Thus, buildings that \u201cbecame or become subject to [the RSL] by virtue of\u2019 receiving J-51 tax benefits passed from their former state (unregulated) into a new state (rent-stabilized) because of their owners\u2019 receipt of these benefits. That did not happen here since the apartment buildings comprising Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town have been rent-regulated since at least 1974, 18 years before any building in either complex is alleged to have received J-51 benefits. They did not \u201cbecome\u201d rent-stabilized by virtue of receiving J-51 benefits; they already <em>were </em>rent-stabilized <em>(see Matter of KSLM-Columbus Apts., Inc. v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>5 NY3d 303, 311-312 [2005] [once a building became rent-stabilized, later, redundant statutory routes \u201cwould not have (been) needed\u201d to make the building subject to the RSL]).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The majority resists the logic of this reading on several bases; first, that \u201cthere is nothing impossible, or even strained, about reading the verb \u2018become\u2019 to refer to achieving, for a second time, a status already attained\u201d (majority op at 286). While \u201cbecome\u201d may be used colloquially in this imprecise sense, we usually\u2014in the absence of statutory definitions\u2014look to dictionary definitions when trying to figure out the meaning of a word or phrase used in a statute <em>(see e.g. Rosner v Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Liab. Ins. Co., </em>96 NY2d 475, 479-480 [2001]). Even accepting the majority\u2019s point, all this means is that defendants\u2019 reading of \u201cbecome\u201d is not clearly correct\u2014i.e., the usage is ambiguous\u2014not that it is clearly wrong, although this seems to be the majority\u2019s implicit conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The majority also takes issue with defendants\u2019 emphasis on the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DH-CR)\u2019s reading of the statute, stating that \u201cDHCR\u2019s interpretation and the one [defendants] now offer are different\u201d because \u201cDHCR has interpreted \u2018by virtue of to mean \u2018solely by virtue of,\u2019 while [defendants] rely on the \u2018became or become\u2019 language\u201d (majority op at 285).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the majority adds, \u201c \u2018[b]y virtue of and \u2018solely by virtue of simply do not mean the same thing\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In fact, what defendants argue is that the words \u201cbecame or become subject to,\u201d read according to their dictionary meaning, modify the subsequent phrase \u201cby virtue of\u2019 so as to create \u201cno less a narrowing effect . . . than would \u2018solely.\u2019 \u201d In short, by inserting \u201csolely\u201d before the phrase \u201cby virtue of,\u201d DHCR simply created a redundancy in its regulations <em>(see </em>Rent Stabilization Code [RSC] [9 NYCRR] \u00a7 2520.11 [r] [5]; [s] [2]); it did not change the statute\u2019s meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Finally, the majority objects that defendants\u2019 reading of the statute implicitly creates two categories of J-51-benefitted properties\u2014i.e., \u201cthose . . . that were rent-stabilized prior to receiving J-51 benefits, for which luxury decontrol became available in 1993; and those that only became rent-stabilized as a condition of receiving J-51 benefits, for which luxury decontrol is unavailable (at least during the benefit period)\u201d; and that there is \u201cno indication that the Legislature ever intended such a distinction,\u201d or that it ever \u201coccurred to anyone . . . until after the present lawsuit was brought\u201d (majority op at 286).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Addressing the latter point first, it is not at all obvious that this distinction occurred to no one until this lawsuit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Contrariwise, it is apparent (as discussed later) that, until this lawsuit, no one thought to argue that already rent-stabilized buildings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>subsequently receiving J-51 tax benefits were excluded from luxury decontrol.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">As for what the Legislature intended, the distinction complained about by the majority flows naturally from the legislative language chosen (i.e., \u201cbecome or became\u201d and \u201cby virtue of\u2019), given the nature of the J-51 program. Two general categories of buildings are eligible for J-51 tax benefits. First, there are existing, already rent-stabilized apartment buildings (like those in the Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town apartment complexes), which receive J-51 benefits in connection with capital improvements or repairs, such as a new boiler <em>(see e.g. </em>Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 11-243 [b] [4], [5], [6]; Rules of City of NY Dept of Hous Preserv and Dev [28 RCNY] \u00a7 5-03 [b], [c]). The second category includes buildings that are substantially rehabilitated to create new family units and receive benefits on account of those conversions or rehabilitations <em>(see e.g. </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 11-243 [b] [2], [3], [8]; 28 RCNY 5-03 [a] [1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [7]). Buildings within the second category become rent-stabilized as a condition of receipt of J-51 benefits,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and enter the rent-stabilization regime at existing market rates <em>(see </em>Rent Stabilization Code [RSC] [9 NYCRR] \u00a7 2521.1 [h]). Again, if the Legislature had intended to exclude <em>all </em>buildings receiving J-51 tax benefits from luxury decontrol\u2014i.e., those in both categories\u2014it should have, and presumably would have, specified in the statute that housing accommodations <em>receiving </em>J-51 benefits were excluded, not just those that \u201cbecame or become subject to [the RSL] by virtue of\u2019 receiving J-51 benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Legislative Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">To bolster its textual analysis, the majority plucks a snippet from a floor exchange during the Senate debate on the bill that became the RRRA. We have always treated this species of legislative history \u201ccautiously\u201d <em>(see Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent. School Dist., </em>91 NY2d 577, 586-587 [1998]). In any event, the full text of this question-and-answer dialogue (which follows) does not appear to support the meaning teased out of it by the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>\u201csenator mendez: Senator Hannon, your bill will include\u2014will affect those renters who are in apartments J.Sls and 421-As. O.K. Those <em>buildings were constructed </em>with some part of taxpayers\u2019 monies, monies from all of us, and all of the people out there in the state of New York to help the <em>developers build those apartments.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">\u201cMy question to you is, once this bill is approved here and it will pass this chamber, will <em>those landlords </em>keep and not get taken away, keep the decontrol of the so-called luxury apartments with the abatements, those tax abatements that they have negotiated, or will they be returned to the taxpayers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">\u201csenator hannon: Well, <em>in answer to your question, </em>Senator, which is an excellent one, we have provided that, because some buildings are enjoying another system of general public assistance, namely the tax exemptions, that to the extent the building is currently enjoying a 421 tax exemption, it is not subject to the decontrol provisions here. Should those exemptions end or should the exemptions contained in section 489 end, that\u2019s\u2014those J.Sls and 489s end, then they would be subject so that at no point do you have the decontrol provisions applying to the buildings which have received the tax exemptions that I just mentioned\u201d (Senate Debate on NY Assembly Bill A8859, July 7, 1993, at 8213-8214 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">By referring to buildings that were <em>constructed </em>and to <em>developers </em>who <em>build </em>with tax benefits, Senator Mendez\u2019s question was directed at buildings entering the rent-stabilization regime for the first time as a condition of receiving J-51 tax benefits (i.e., the second category of J-51-benefitted properties, previously discussed), or section 421-a tax benefits (i.e., new construction). In short, Senator Hannon\u2019s response to Senator Mendez was limited by her question to developers of new construction projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Critically, the majority does not even mention the most important gauge of statutory meaning in this case, apart from the actual words the Legislature chose. The RRRA has a sunset clause, which forces the Legislature to reconsider its terms periodically. This has happened twice since 1996, when DHCR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>issued its advisory opinion\u2014in 1997 and in 2003.\u00ae While otherwise amending the RRRA in both 1997 and 2003, the Legislature left the language central to this appeal (\u201cbecame or become subject to [the RSL] by virtue of\u2019) intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">As plaintiffs themselves put it, \u201c[b]attles over rent stabilization are among the fiercest in Albany.\u201d It is therefore doubtful that the Legislature was unaware in 1997 of DHCR\u2019s advisory opinion, especially in light of the existence of DHCR decontrol orders premised on it, and the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD)\u2019s issuance of prorated J-51 tax benefits to buildings with luxury-decontrolled apartments. And it is inconceivable that the Legislature did not know what was afoot six years later in 2003. This is especially so because DHCR in the meantime revised the Rent Stabilization Code (RSC or the Code) for the express purpose of incorporating regulations implementing its interpretation of the substantive changes wrought by \u201cthe RRRAs of 1993 and 1997\u201d (22 NY Reg [issue 51], Dec. 20, 2000, at 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">After receiving and evaluating an \u201cextensive volume and scope of comments,\u201d DHCR adopted the revised RSC, effective December 20, 2000 <em>(id. </em>at 19). The Code made DHCR\u2019s interpretation of RSL \u00a7\u00a7 26-504.1 and 26-504.2 unmistakably clear: the exception from luxury decontrol for buildings receiving J-51 tax benefits covered only those buildings rent-stabilized solely on this basis <em>(see </em>RSC \u00a7 2520.11 [r] [5]; [s] [2]). Yet, the Legislature in 2003 did not amend the RRRA to adopt the interpretation favored by plaintiffs, although it otherwise modified the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">As we have observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">\u201c[questionable as may be any reliance on legislative inactivity, we would distinguish instances in which the legislative inactivity has continued in the face of a prevailing statutory construction. Thus, <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> [w]here the practical construction of a statute is well known, the Legislature is charged with knowledge and its failure to interfere indicates acquiescence\u2019 \u201d <em>(Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v New York State Human Rights Appeal Bd., </em>41 NY2d 84, 90 [1976], quoting <em>Engle v Talarico, </em>33 NY2d 237, 242 [1973]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">We were faced with a fact pattern comparable to this case in <em>Matter of Ansonia Residents Assn, v New York State Div. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number><em>Hous. &amp; Community Renewal </em>(75 NY2d 206 [1989]). There\u2014as here\u2014the tenants argued that the plain wording of a provision in the RSL conflicted with the way in which DHCR interpreted and implemented it. We observed that DCHR and its predecessor agencies had construed the statute consistently, however, and that \u201cthe local legislature, in never choosing to amend the statute to provide otherwise, has acquiesced in [DHCR\u2019s] construction\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 215; <em>see also Rent Stabilization Assn, of N.Y. City v Higgins, </em>83 NY2d 156, 170 [1993] [when concluding that DHCR was authorized to adopt challenged regulations, Court considered it significant that Legislature had not sought to undo DHCR\u2019s interpretation at a time when it was substantially reforming rent regulation]).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Regulatory Interpretation and Implementation</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The majority gives no weight whatsoever to DHCR\u2019s interpretation of the exception. DHCR is vested with a \u201cbroad mandate to promulgate regulations in furtherance of the rent control and rent stabilization laws\u201d <em>(Higgins, </em>83 NY2d at 168), and is steeped in the history and lore of rent regulation. While we may not owe deference to the administrative agency, it should count for something that DHCR adopted its interpretation as a formal regulation after a notice-and-comment rulemaking enjoying wide participation by both landlord and tenant advocacy groups and interests. If DHCR\u2019s interpretation were as wide of the mark as the majority claims, it is odd that this infirmity was not discovered then. In this regard, defendants point out that two of the amici supporting plaintiffs on this appeal<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> submitted over 50 pages of comments objecting to many aspects of DH-CR\u2019s proposed amendments to the Code in 2000, but they never mentioned, much less complained about, the proposed rules codifying the word \u201csolely\u201d <em>(see </em>http://www.tenant.net/ DHCR_info/newcode/legserv-RSC.pdf):</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Further, the majority ignores the manner in which HPD actually administers the J-51 program. HPD\u2019s J-51 application form requires the building owner to identify the number of both \u201cexempt\u201d and rent-stabilized apartments <em>(see </em>http:// www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/downloads/pdf/J5 l-application.pdf). The record on appeal includes a certificate of eligibility issued by HPD on July 28, 2003, awarding J-51 tax benefits to 350 First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Avenue, a building in the Peter Cooper Village complex. This certificate shows that HPD <em>reduced </em>the J-51 benefit in proportion to the number of luxury-decontrolled units in the building, consistent with DHCR\u2019s interpretation and regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The majority downplays the risk of \u201cdire financial consequences from [this] rulingt ] for [defendants] and the New York City real estate industry\u201d (majority op at 287). While it is true that dire predictions often prove to be mistaken, this is not always the case just because it usually is. After all, the Trojans would have done well to heed Cassandra. And you do not have to be gifted with her powers of prophecy to foresee significant, if not severe, dislocations in the New York City residential real estate industry as a result of today\u2019s decision. This is inevitable because the Court has upended an understanding of the law upon which numerous and substantial business transactions and dealings have been predicated for over a decade. On the other side of the equation, since at least 2000 no tenant residing in Stuyvesant Town or Peter Cooper Village has had any reason to expect immunity from the RSL\u2019s luxury-decontrol provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The majority\u2019s observation that the extent of defendants\u2019 losses ultimately will turn on legal issues and defenses yet to be resolved is cold comfort. It will take years of litigation over many novel questions to deal with the fallout from today\u2019s decision. In the absence of meaningful legislative action, uncertainty will reign in an industry already rocked by the bursting of the great residential real estate bubble. And as one amicus reminded us, many of those at risk are \u201cMom and Pop\u201d owners of a single building, and owners with midsized portfolios, mostly located outside Manhattan. For some of these entities, a prolonged summary proceeding with even a few tenants may threaten financial viability, even in the best of times.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Of course, I do not suggest that the Court shirk from its responsibility to interpret statutes because of untoward or uneven consequences for the parties. In every decision we make, one side loses. But the Court does not, in my view, fulfill its duty to safeguard the stability of the laws when it tosses out a reasonable and long-standing statutory interpretation made by a specialized agency, as it does today.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Thirty-five years ago we described the rent laws as \u201can impenetrable thicket, confusing not only to laymen but to lawyers\u201d <em>(Matter of 89 Christopher v Joy, </em>35 NY2d 213, 220 [1974]), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the thicket has only grown denser since then. While the majority confidently proclaims that DHCR\u2019s and defendants\u2019 reading of the statute is plainly wrong, and its contrary interpretation is plainly correct, the opacity of the thicket guarantees that neither proposition is true. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Judges Ciparick, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur in per curiam opinion; Judge Read dissents in a separate opinion in which Judge Graffeo concurs; Chief Judge Lippman taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-9\">.

Hereafter, these provisions are referred to collectively as \u201cthe exception\u201d or \u201cthe statute.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\">. The majority also opines that these two purportedly divergent interpretations \u201cwould lead to the same result in this case, but not in every case,\u201d and then poses a hypothetical example to illustrate this point (majority op at 285). It is not evident that, in the real world (as opposed to the hypothetical one), the different results theorized would ever occur, absent changes in the current rent regulation/tax benefit regimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b360-9\">. Amicus Rent Stabilization Association of NYC, Inc. provided us with a detailed history of the J-51 statute and rent regulation over several decades. The gist of this presentation (although disputed) is that by law and practice the New York City rent laws have long distinguished between apartments that became subject to rent regulation by virtue of receiving J-51 tax benefits, and apartments that were already rent-regulated for other reasons (like those in the Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town apartment complexes) at the time they received J-51 benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\">.
