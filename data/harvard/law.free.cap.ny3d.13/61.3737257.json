The Appellate Division correctly found that defendants\u2019 placing of a conduit across Bloomingdales, Inc.\u2019s easement was both a trespass and a nuisance and was, therefore, not time-barred. <em>(509 Sixth Ave. Corp. v New York City Tr.

In the course of the work, Janus cut a working drainpipe that ran down from plaintiff Bloomingdales, Inc.\u2019s roof, believing it to be a \u201cdead\u201d water main. It then installed a conduit encased in concrete in its place. Sometime thereafter, Bloomingdales experienced flooding on the lower level of its store when it rained. In February 2002, Bloomingdales hired a contractor, who excavated the area of the drainpipe, determined that it had been cut and discovered the conduit. Bloomingdales alleges it was required to install a new drainpipe above the conduit costing in excess of $165,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>After filing a notice of claim, Bloomingdales then commenced an action against the New York City Transit Authority, in January 2003, alleging causes of action for negligence, trespass and nuisance. Third- and fourth-party actions ensued involving various contractors and subcontractors on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The Transit Authority and third-party defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, invoking Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1212, General Municipal Law \u00a7\u00a7 50-e and 50-i and CPLR 214, arguing that Bloomingdales\u2019 claim was barred by the statute of limitations because the action was commenced more than one year and 90 days after the complained-of negligent act\u2014the severing of the drainpipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Supreme Court concluded that the moving parties established their entitlement to summary judgment, finding that, pursuant to the controlling statutes, the statute of limitations was triggered when the drainage pipe was severed in September 1999 (13 Misc 3d 1202[A], 2006 NY Slip Op 51642[U]). Blooming-dales appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The Appellate Division reversed and reinstated the trespass and nuisance causes of action (52 AD3d 120 [2008]). The majority held that the concrete conduit \u201cphysically interrupted [Bloomingdales\u2019] storm drainpipe and interfered with [Bloomingdales\u2019] easement and right of access to the sewer\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 123-124). Thus, it held that this was a \u201ccontinuing\u201d tort resulting in successive causes of action and because the claims were not tied to the single negligent act of severing the drainpipe, the actions were timely commenced <em>{id. </em>at 124).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The Appellate Division certified the following question to this Court: \u201cWas the order of this Court, which reversed the order of Supreme Court, properly made?\u201d We now answer the question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1212 (2) and General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-i both require that an action for damage to real property be commenced within one year and 90 days after the occurrence of the event upon which the claim is based, irrespective of when the action accrued (see <em>Klein v City of Yonkers, </em>53 NY2d 1011, 1013 [1981]). The Transit Authority and third-party defendants argue that this is the correct time period upon which to measure all of Bloomingdales\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">There is no dispute that if the happening of the event complained of by Bloomingdales was solely the severing of the drainpipe, all of the causes of action would be time-barred. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>However, another act occurred here\u2014the placement of the conduit.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The essence of trespass to real property is injury to the right of possession, and such trespass may occur under the surface of the ground. A person need not have title to the property, but must simply have sufficient property rights to maintain an action for trespass <em>(see </em>87 CJS, Trespass \u00a7 30). Although Bloomingdales did not have exclusive possession of the area of the drainpipe, it still had legal rights against trespass for an unlawful encroachment to its right-of-way. We have held that a trespass that constitutes an unlawful encroachment on a plaintiffs property will be considered a continuous trespass giving rise to successive causes of action <em>(509 Sixth Ave. Corp. v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>15 NY2d 48 [1964]). Thus, for purposes of the statute of limitations, suits will only be time-barred by the expiration of such time as would create an easement by prescription or change of title by operation of law <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Here, the presence of the concrete conduit interfered with Bloomingdales\u2019 access to its drainpipe and ultimately the city sewer, and as a result, Bloomingdales was required to install a new pipe following a new path over the conduit. Notably, the actual damages sought by Bloomingdales did not arise from the mere severance of its drainpipe, but from the need to install the new drainpipe in a different location. Thus, because the conduit encroached on Bloomingdales\u2019 right-of-way, we find that the Appellate Division correctly concluded that Bloomingdales has a viable cause of action sounding in trespass, for which the statute of limitations has not yet run.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">For the same reasons, we find that there is a viable claim for private nuisance, which is, in this case, simply another way of characterizing the trespass claim. There was a continuous interference with Bloomingdales\u2019 right to use and enjoy its property right, and as such the same statute of limitations as the trespass applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question should be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Jones concur; Chief Judge Lippman taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
