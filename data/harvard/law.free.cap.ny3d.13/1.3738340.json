After jury selection and before opening statements, the trial judge said \u201cit is my policy in cases of this nature, this degree of seriousness, to have the defendant either in leg shackles, which I don\u2019t like to do, or the belt that can deliver a shock should there be a problem.\u201d Addressing defendant directly, the court added: \u201cI do believe it is necessary not just for you .... This is something I would do for anybody charged with murder.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel and defendant himself objected strenuously. When defendant said, \u201cI have done nothing to warrant this,\u201d the court replied: \u201cI can\u2019t disagree with you. You have not done anything to warrant that.\u201d But the court decided to require a stun belt \u201cin the interest of being overly cautious for security.\u201d The court also asked an officer who was present: \u201cThe Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s position is you would like that to remain on?\u201d, to which the officer answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">At the end of the first day of trial, defendant complained that the belt was uncomfortable, and the court ordered that he be examined. At the beginning of the next trial day, the court said it had received a report to the effect that the defendant \u201chas no medical reason not to use the shock belt\u201d and ordered the belt kept on. To defendant\u2019s continued protests, the court replied that it had to rely on \u201cthe security experts,\u201d and again assured defendant that the court\u2019s ruling was nothing personal; the court said that even \u201can innocent man on trial for murder\u201d could be dangerous. Defendant thus wore a stun belt under his clothing for the duration of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Defendant was convicted of second degree murder, and the Appellate Division affirmed, with two Justices dissenting (53 AD3d 46 [2008]). An Appellate Division Justice granted leave to appeal, and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Defendant argues that the use of the stun belt deprived him of due process of law, relying on <em>Deck v Missouri </em>(544 US 622, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>626 [2005]), in which the United States Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause prohibits a state from confining a defendant in \u201cvisible shackles\u201d during a criminal trial, unless a \u201cspecial need,\u201d based on facts specific to the case, is shown. The People argue that <em>Deck </em>is distinguishable because the stun belt here was not visible to the jury. We need not reach the constitutional issue, however, for we conclude as a matter of New York law that it is unacceptable to make a stun belt a routine adjunct of every murder trial, without a specifically identified security reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">We have no doubt that there are cases in which a court may properly find, considering the nature of the charged offense, the defendant\u2019s history and other relevant factors, that a stun belt is necessary, but those factors must be considered before that finding is made. Thus, we adopt the rule that a stun belt may not be required unless the trial court makes findings on the record showing that the particular defendant before him needs such a restraint. A formal hearing may not be necessary, but the trial court must conduct a sufficient inquiry to satisfy itself of the facts that warrant the restraint. Where it does so, a trial court has broad discretion in deciding whether a restraint is necessary for courtroom security.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b74-7\">Read, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Al\">I agree with the majority that the trial judge in this case should have explained on the record why, to safeguard courtroom security, he ordered defendant to wear a stun belt during trial. In this case, however, the presumption of innocence was not implicated by the judge\u2019s failure to inquire about the particular need for use of a stun belt and to make factual findings on the record. Defendant\u2014a man in his thirties who apparently stands more than six feet tall and weighs over 300 pounds\u2014repeatedly protested that the stun belt was uncomfortable (a complaint that the judge ordered a physician to evaluate), and that he should not have to wear this restraint because he was presumed to be innocent. But defendant failed to show that the stun belt was visible to the jury or otherwise compromised the fundamental fairness of the trial; he never objected that the stun belt impaired his ability to communicate with his attorney or meaningfully participate in his defense. Since I therefore do not believe that defendant has shown any actual prejudice, I would affirm his conviction <em>(see e.g. State v Bowen, </em>340 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>487, 496, 135 P3d 272, 279 [2006], <em>cert denied </em>549 US 1214 [2007]).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur in per curiam opinion; Judge Read dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
