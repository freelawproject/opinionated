Hawkins, the defendant below and the appellant here, purchased from Tom\u2019s Chevrolet Co., Inc., in Wheaton, Montgomery County, a 1965 Chevrolet El Camino, which, including freight, accessories, sales tax, and license tags, involved a gross cash price of $3,073.00. After the deduction of a discount of $439.25, a deposit of $83.00, and a trade-in allowance of $250.75, there remained a $2,300.00 unpaid balance of purchase price which was financed by an assignment of the contract by Tom\u2019s Chevrolet to General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC). To the $2,300.00 were added: charge for insurance on life of buyer, $50.78; \u201cofficial fees,\u201d $3.50; and finance charges, $348.72, thus bringing the total amount to be financed to $2,703.00, which was to be paid in 30 monthly installments of $90.10, commencing 5 July 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Hawkins defaulted in his payments; GMAC repossessed the truck on 16 February 1966, at which time unpaid installments aggregated $2,092.18, net of adjustments for unearned insurance premiums and finance charges; sold the car on 10 March 1966 at public auction for $700.00; and on 16 September 1966, brought suit against Hawkins in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for a deficiency of $1,381.95,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plus attorney\u2019s fees provided for by the sales contract of $207.29, or $1,589.24. With the declaration GMAC filed a motion for summary judgment. Hawkins filed a general issue plea; GMAC\u2019s motion for summary judgment was denied; the case went to trial on the merits; on 15 June 1967, judgment <em>nisi </em>was entered against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Hawkins \u201cin the amount of $1,589.24 and costs <em>and attorney\u2019s fees\u201d </em>(emphasis added) ; on 19 June 1967, Hawkins filed a notice of appeal; and on 21 June 1967, judgment absolute was entered against Hawkins \u201cfor the sum of One Thousand Five Hundred eighty-nine and 24/100 Dollars ($1,589.24) current money with interest from June 15, 1967 and costs, <em>and Attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) It should be noted that Hawkins appealed from the judgment <em>nisi </em>and not from the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Maryland Rule 812 requires that an order for appeal be filed within 30 days of the date of the judgment appealed from. In <em>Merlands Club, Inc. v. Messall, </em>238 Md. 359, 208 A. 2d 687 (1965), we held that an appeal would lie only from a judgment absolute and not from a judgment <em>nisi. See also, </em>26 Md. L. Rev. 94 (1966). Since Hawkins\u2019 order for appeal was entered on 19 June 1967, four days after the entry of the judgment <em>nisi </em>and two days <em>before </em>the entry of the judgment absolute, GMAC could have moved to dismiss the appeal, but failed to do so. Since Rule 812 is mandatory, we have no alternative but to dismiss the appeal, Rule 835 a 2, b (3),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the absence of proof of extenuating circumstances. <em>Compare Keystone Engineering Corp. v. Sutter, </em>196 Md. 620, 626-27, 78 A. 2d 191 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Had the appeal been properly taken, however, the result reached by the lower court would not have been disturbed by us. In the lower court, and on appeal, Hawkins rested his case on two contentions: first, that Hawkins was not given notice of repossession by registered or certified mail as required by \u00a7 141 (c) of Maryland\u2019s Retail Installment Sales Act, Maryland Code (1957) Art. 83, \u00a7\u00a7 128-53 (the Act) and that the finance charges of $348.72 exceeded the maximum of $9.00 per $100.00 per year permitted by \u00a7 132 (g) of the Act. Chapter 806 of the Laws of 1965 amended the Act in one significant respect:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>definition of \u201cGoods\u201d appearing in \u00a7 152 (a), which \u201cmeans all chattels personal having a cash price of two thousand dollars ($2,000) or less but not including money or things in action\u201d was amended by substituting \u201cfive thousand dollars ($5,000)\u201d for \u201ctwo thousand dollars ($2,000).\u201d By its terms, chapter 806 was to take effect on 1 June 1965. We have previously held that the Act, as it read prior to 1 June 1965, did not apply to sales of motor vehicles where the cash price was more than $2,000.00, except insofar as finance charges and insurance costs are concerned. <em>Sampson v. First Credit Corporation, </em>244 Md. 317, 223 A. 2d 627 (1966); <em>Nuttall v. Baker, </em>217 Md. 454, 143 A. 2d 500 (1958); <em>Auto. Accept. Corp. v. Univer. Corp., </em>216 Md. 344, 139 A. 2d 683 (1958). Since the notice to which Hawkins claims he was entitled is provided for by the Act, and not by his contract, this contention is not persuasive.i.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">With respect to the finance charges, GMAC argues, and we think correctly, that since the car was financed over a period of 30 months, the maximum finance charge permitted by \u00a7 132 of the Act would have been $529.70 rather than $348.72 actually charged by GMAC. <em>Falcone v. Palmer Ford, Inc., </em>242 Md. 487, 497-500, 219 A. 2d 808 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Hawkins\u2019 second contention is that the contract was induced by a fraud. He testified that it was his father and not he who desired to purchase the truck, that a salesman at Tom\u2019s Chevrolet had asked him if he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">\u201cwould be willing to go along with the contract, if after a couple of weeks, they would transfer the contract over to [his] father\u2019s name. That would be done in order to get the paper work through and then when the paper work was cleared they would transfer it over to [his] father\u2019s name and [he] would be free of any liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>The lower court failed to find in Hawkins\u2019 uncorroborated testimony a clear and satisfactory proof of fraud, and such a finding cannot be set aside on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous. Rule 886 a; <em>Grain Dealers Mut. Ins. Co. v. Van Buskirk, </em>241 Md. 58, 70, 215 A. 2d 467 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">We feel constrained to point out, however, that the judgment absolute for $1,589.24 (with interest and costs) <em>included </em>attorney\u2019s fees of $207.29 and that when attorney\u2019s fees were inadvertently added to the amount of the judgment, the fees were allowed a second time. The appellant may wish to consider the filing of an appropriate motion for a revision of the judgment to correct this mistake as permitted by Rule 625 a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-10\">. The record discloses that this figure was incorrectly arrived at. The true amount of the deficiency was $1,392.18 to which should have been added repossession costs of $12.92, or a total of $1,405.10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\">. \u201ca 2: This Court may, on its own motion, dismiss an appeal for any cause set forth in section b of this Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u201cb (3) The order for appeal has not been filed with the lower court within the time prescribed by Rule 812.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b166-9\">. \u00a7 143 (b) of the Act was also amended, but under our view, this is not pertinent to the question presented by the case before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\"><em>. </em>The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), Maryland Code (1957, 1964 Replacement Volume) Art. 95 B, \u00a7\u00a7 9-503, 9-504 controlled the repossession and sale of the truck. There was testimony that GMAC wrote to Hawkins, but Hawkins denied receiving the letter. The letter sent by GMAC to Hawkins was sufficient notice of the sale under the requirements of UCC \u00a7 9-504 (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b168-10\">. \u201ca. <em>Generally.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">For a period of thirty days after the entry of a judgment, or thereafter pursuant to motion filed within such period, the court shall have revisory power and control over such judgment.
