Although not a party to the case, it will be referred to in this opinion as \u201cPhiladelphia Snelling.\u201d Its operations have two aspects: In Philadelphia, commencing as a partnership in 1950, and later as a corporation, it has operated an employment agency. The other phase of Philadelphia Snelling\u2019s activity commenced in 1955 and involves the licensing of franchisees, under which individuals or corporations are permitted to operate similar employment agencies in various sections of the country under the trade name \u201cSnelling and Snelling,\u201d using the techniques, office procedures, business forms, trade name, and after 1961 the trade mark \u201cFort Snelling.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The consideration for such a license usually consists of an initial lump sum payment by the franchisee, plus a <em>7\u00b0/o </em>commission or override on the gross monthly billings of the franchisee, of which 2 <em>\u00b0/o </em>was originally allocated to the cost of a program of national advertising contracted for by Philadelphia Snelling. While the agreements under which franchisees have been licensed have varied, all of them contain stringent provisions restricting assignment, controlling the operation of the franchise, and insuring uniformity in stationery, forms and advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">On 5 September 1956, Philadelphia Snelling entered into a licensing agreement with Lionel Jacobs and James A. MacDougal, who paid $12,000 for a franchise which gave them \u201cthe exclusive right to use the name \u2018Snelling &amp; Snelling\u2019 \u201d in a territory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">\u201cComprised of Baltimore, Maryland, and the surrounding counties * * * limited to the following Counties * * *: Queen Anne, Harford, Baltimore, Carroll, Howard, Anne Arundel, and Kent; it being expressly understood between the parties that the right to solicit applicants within said territory shall not be granted to any other Licensee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The Jacobs-M'acDougal effort proved unsuccessful, and the agreement was ultimately revoked by Philadelphia Snelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">On 5 July 1960, Philadelphia Snelling entered into a licensing agreement with Snelling and Snelling of Baltimore, Inc., a Maryland corporation (Baltimore Snelling) of which Maynard Z. Drossner was president, treasurer and principal owner. Drossner had considered other franchises, including one in Atlantic City, and possibly another in Norristown, Pennsylvania (this testimony is disputed, however) ; knew that Philadelphia Snelling had licensed independent franchisees in the environs of Philadelphia; was aware of the failure of the Jacobs-MacDougal franchise; and knew also that their territory had included not \u2022only Baltimore City, but the surrounding counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The agreement with Baltimore Snelling contained two provisions which are particularly significant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u201cl.(a) Snelling [Philadelphia Snelling] hereby grants to licensee [Baltimore Snelling] <em>the exclusive right to use the name </em>Snelling and Snelling and/or Snelling and Snelling of Baltimore, Inc. <em>in connection with one office only to- be opened by licensee in </em>Baltimore, <em>Maryland. </em>Licensee shall not directly or indirectly establish an office or place of business, or move to any locations outside of such territory; nor shall licensee change its name without first obtaining the written consent of Snelling; nor shall licensee establish any branch or additional office without the written consent of Snelling. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\"><em>\u201c9. </em>* * * Licensee and shareholders [Baltimore Snelling] agree, when requested by Snelling [Philadelphia Snelling], to waive any and all objections licensee may legally have against the use of the name \u2018Snelling and Snelling\u2019 in territories other than the territory granted to licensee herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Baltimore Snelling commenced operations in August, 1960, and was immediately successful. In 1962, Drossner wished to expand his business to include Towson, the county seat of Baltimore County, which is beyond the corporate limits of Baltimore City. When Drossner failed to reach agreement with Philadelphia Snelling on the amount of the franchise fee, he began to' press the contention that Towson was a part of the metropolitan area within the contemplation of the parties when the licensing agreement of 5 July 1960 was signed, granting to Baltimore Snelling a franchise for Baltimore, Maryland. Philadelphia Snelling resisted this, relying on a literal interpretation of the agreement: <em>i.e., </em>that Baltimore, Maryland, meant the corporate limits of Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Although the agreement with Baltimore Snelling limited it to one office in Baltimore, in 1963 Drossner wanted to open a second office in the heavily industralized area of Highland-town, which lies within the city\u2019s eastern boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">In 1963, Drossner and his wife formed a Maryland corporation, Snelling and Snelling of Highlandtown, Inc. (Highland-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>town Snelling) and on 20 December 1963, Highlandtown Snelling entered into a licensing agreement with Philadelphia Snelling. While structured similarly to the agreement of 5 July 1960, which had been entered into with Baltimore Snelling, the contract was patently more sophisticated, and probably reflected Philadelphia Snelling\u2019s experience in the franchise field. Two provisions are of particular importance. Paragraph 1(a) omits the word \u201cexclusive\u201d and precisely limits the territory subject to the franchise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">\u201c1. (a) [PHILADELPHIA] SNELLING hereby grants to Licensee [Highlandtown Snelling] the right to use the registered tradename \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d, the Fort Snelling registered trademark,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and to be identified as a member of the Snelling and Snelling System in connection with the operation of a personnel consulting and employment agency business (herein sometimes called \u2018Licensee\u2019s business\u2019) to be conducted at an office located within the <em>following area: Bounded on the North by Pulaski Highway; on the East by Kresson Street; on the South by Eastern Avenue and on the West by Broadway. All located within the city of Baltimore.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">For that portion of Paragraph 9 of Baltimore Snelling\u2019s agreement (which required Baltimore Snelling to waive any objections which it might legally have to the use of the Snelling name in other territories) Paragraph 1(c) was substituted in Highlandtown Snelling\u2019s agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">\u201c1. (c) In connection with the operation of Licensee\u2019s business, Licensee shall use only the name \u2018Snelling and Snelling\u2019 and Licensee shall identify itself as a member of the Snelling and Snelling System, unless state law requires other or additional identification. SNELLING shall not grant to any other person, firm or corporation the right to use the name \u2018Snelling and Snelling\u2019 in connection with the operation of a personnel consulting and employment agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>office within the area described in paragraph 1(a) hereof ; <em>provided, however, that in the event SNBLLING shall open offices or grant such right to others outside the described area but within the State where Licensee's office is located, Licensee does hereby release and waive any objection to the use of the name \u2018Snelling and Snelling\u2019 in connection therewith.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Drossner paid no franchise fee for Highlandtown. Robert O. Snelling, president of Philadelphia Snelling, testified that it was not his company\u2019s policy to exact a franchise fee for the opening of a second office in a territory already franchised, but because of Highlandtown\u2019s close proximity to the Essex-Dundalk industrial complex, he believed that there was a possibility that the value of a Dundalk-Essex franchise might be prejudiced by the close proximity of another office. Consequently, Baltimore Snelling was required to amend its 1960 agreement, with the result that a <em>7Jo </em>override with no allocation for national advertising was substituted for the earlier override of <em>5% </em>and a 2% contribution to Philadelphia Snelling\u2019s national advertising budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">On 28 January 1964, Drossner and Stanley Sackett entered into an agreement with Philadelphia Snelling for the licensing of an office in Towson. The franchise fee was $3,000; the agreement, substantially similar to Highlandtown Snelling\u2019s, except that the territory was described as \u201cthe city of Towson, Maryland, as of this date\u201d; and on 16 March 1964, the agreement was assigned, with Philadelphia Snelling\u2019s consent, to Snelling and Snelling of Towson, Inc. (Towson Snelling). On 14 June 1965, Philadelphia Snelling again entered into a substantially similar agreement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with Snelling and Snelling of Glen Burnie, Inc. (Glen Burnie Snelling). A franchise fee of $2,600 was paid for a territory described as \u201cthe city limits of Glen Burnie, Maryland as of this date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">It is interesting to note that the ownership of the several franchises was not identical: Baltimore was owned by Drossner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>and his wife (50%) and Bert H. Cohen and his wife (50%); Highlandtown, entirely by Drossner and his wife; Towson, by Drossner (50%) and Sackett (50%); and Glen Burnie, by Drossner and his wife (50%) and Robert L. Cobaugh (50%). Because Snelling and Snelling appears in each of the corporate-titles, Baltimore Snelling\u2019s consent was required in order for Highlandtown, Towson and Glen Burnie to be incorporated, as contemplated by Paragraph 9 of the agreement of 5 July 1960, and was given to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">On 4 November 1965, Angelo R. Mascaro, the appellant here and one of the defendants below, entered into a licensing agreement with Philadelphia Snelling for a franchise in the Dundalk-Essex area of Baltimore County, for which he paid a franchise fee of $7,800. The territory was described in detail<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the franchise is hereafter referred to as \u201cDundalk-Essex Snelling.\u201d Except for the fact that the agreement was with an individual, it was substantially similar to Glen Burnie Snelling\u2019s, and included Paragraph 1 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Dundalk-Essex Snelling opened an office at 809 Eastern-Boulevard in Baltimore County (and about 4 miles from Highlandtown Snelling) on 2 January 1966 and five days later Baltimore Snelling instituted suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The suit was brought in equity against Mascaro, the A. S. Abell Company (publishers of the Baltimore \u201cSun\u201d) and Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on grounds of unfair-competition. The bill of complaint alleged that Baltimore Snelling had since 17 August 1960, conducted business as an employment agency under the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d and had extensively advertised such name; that Drossner, the president,, director and a stockholder in Baltimore Snelling was also an of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ficer, director and shareholder in Towson Snelling, Highland-town Snelling and Glen Burnie Snelling, also employment agencies trading under the same name with the consent of Baltimore Snelling. The bill further alleged that defendant, Angelo R. Mascaro had applied for an employment agency license indicating he would trade under the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d and had advertised under such name. The bill alleged that Mascaro sought to mislead the general public and take advantage of the good-will in the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d that Baltimore Snelling allegedly had established by advertising. Claiming that its trade name had been damaged and that Mascaro was unfairly competing, Baltimore Snelling sought a temporary and permanent injunction restraining Mascaro from using the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling.\u201d The bill also sought injunctions against The Abell Company and the Telephone Company restraining them from accepting advertisements from Mascaro under the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling.\u201d An ex parte injunction dated 7 January 1966 was issued restraining the defendants as prayed but granting leave to move for a hearing within two days. On 15 January 1966, another order was signed extending the injunction for a period of ten days on the petition of Baltimore Snelling alleging that no service had as yet been made on Angelo Mascaro.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">On 17 January 1966, Mascaro moved to dissolve the ex parte injunction, alleging that he was a licensee of the parent organization, Philadelphia Snelling, the same corporation that had licensed Baltimore Snelling. Mascaro contended that under his contract he had been granted the right to the use of the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d in connection with an office to be opened in the territory in Baltimore County described in his agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">After a hearing on Mascaro\u2019s motion, an interlocutory order was entered on 2 February 1966, dissolving the ex parte injunction and granting Mascaro the right to the use of the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d in connection with his office but requiring him to add as a suffix to his advertising and material distributed to the public, the words \u201cof Dundalk-Essex A. R. Mascaro\u201d in the same type as the words \u201cSnelling and Snell<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ing,\u201d and also the words \u201cnot connected with any other Snelling and Snelling office in this area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Thereafter an answer was filed by Mascaro, and the case went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">At trial Baltimore Snelling contended that through its prior use and advertising it had acquired the common law right to the exclusive use of the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d in the Baltimore metropolitan area. Mascaro contended that both he and Baltimore Snelling were licensees of Philadelphia Snelling, and that the parties\u2019 rights to the name were governed by their respective contracts with Philadelphia Snelling. By virtue of these contracts Mascaro said he had the right to open an office in the Dundalk-Essex territory as described in his contract and to use the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d in connection therewith and Baltimore Snelling\u2019s contract granted it the right to open an office in Baltimore, Maryland and use the name in connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Baltimore Snelling replied, saying that its contract gave it the exclusive right to use the name in Baltimore City and Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In its opinion, the trial court found that Baltimore Snelling had no common law right to the use of the name Snelling and Snelling and that its right to use of the name derived from its license agreement with Philadelphia Snelling. It further found that the words \u201cBaltimore, Maryland\u201d in the contract between Baltimore Snelling and Philadelphia Snelling meant Baltimore City. However, the court went on to rule that by virtue of its contract, Baltimore Snelling had the exclusive right to the use of the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling,\u201d in Baltimore City, and, therefore, while not denying defendant Mascaro the right to the use of the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d the court enjoined Mascaro from using the name unless he added a suffix to distinguish himself from Baltimore Snelling. Specifically, the court\u2019s decree enjoined Mascaro from using the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d in advertisements, materials distributed to the public, license applications and income tax returns</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">\u201cunless he includes the identifying designation \u2018of Dundalk-Essex, A. R. Mascaro\u2019, or \u2018(Dundalk-Essex)\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u2018A. R. Mascaro\u2019, immediately following said name (and, in the advertising and listing referred to in (a) and (b) above, in the same size type, print or lettering as said name if the use of said name is in typed, printed, written or other graphic form) and the explanatory words \u2018not connected with any other Snelling and Snelling office in this (or \u2018the Baltimore\u2019) area\u2019, or \u2018(not connected with any other Snelling and Snelling office)\u2019 in a prominent place therein, except that said Angelo R. Mascaro, one of the defendants, be and he is hereby relieved of the necessity of including said identifying designation and explanatory words in connection with the use of said name \u2018Snelling and Snelling\u2019 (or \u2018Snelling &amp; Snelling\u2019) on the door to the office of his said employment agency business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">It is from this decree that Mascaro appealed, on the ground that the injunction was unwarranted, and Baltimore Snelling appealed, arguing that the injunction should have been absolute, that Baltimore Snelling\u2019s rights to the use of the name extended beyond Baltimore City, and that the injunction should have issued against the A. S. Abell Company and the Telephone Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">One of the operational manuals prepared by Philadelphia Snelling for the use of its franchisees, and admitted as an exhibit at the trial below, contains the statement \u201cSnelling and Snelling now humorously regards itself as the Howard Johnson of the personnel field.\u201d Even if spoken in jest, this is the core of the controversy. In 1960, when Baltimore Snelling received its franchise, Philadelphia had licensed between 40 and 50 franchisees. At the time this case came to trial, there were approximately 280 licensees in the United States, Canada and Argentina. The basic philosophy of the multiple franchise operation, amply evidenced by the terms of the licensing agreements, the operational manuals, and the form of both national and local advertising, is the creation of a monolithic system in which individual franchisees exchange personal identity for total anonymity, and wrap themselves in the cloak of \u201cSnelling and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Snelling, Inc.\u201d, \u201cPioneers in Personnel,\u201d \u201cOffices Coast to Coast,\u201d \u201cThe World\u2019s Largest Personnel System.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Baltimore Snelling\u2019s display advertisement in the classified telephone directory typified this idea. In large type, it began:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">\u201cSNELLING AND SNELLING</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">The Largest And Most Comprehensive Personnel System In The Nation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">BRANCH OFFICES\u2014COAST TO COAST\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The advertisements which Baltimore Snelling inserted in the classified section of the Baltimore \u201cSun\u201d followed the same format.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">\u201cSNELLING</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">AND</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-11\">SNELLING</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-12\">THE NATION\u2019S LARGEST PERSONNEL SYSTEM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-13\">200 offices coast to coast</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-14\">Either office to serve you Downtown</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-15\">Towson</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-16\">Glen Burnie</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-17\">Highlandtown</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-18\">[Then followed a list of job opportunities]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV0\">SNELLING &amp; SNELLING\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Baltimore Snelling reads the provision of the license agreement of 5 July 1960, which grants</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">\u201cthe exclusive right to&lt; use the name Snelling and Snelling and/or Snelling and Snelling of Baltimore, Inc. in connection with one office only to be opened by Licensee in Baltimore, Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">to mean that Dundalk-Essex Snelling is prohibited from listing its telephone in the Baltimore telephone directory (which contains listings for subscribers in Dundalk and Essex) ; from advertising in Baltimore newspapers or on Baltimore radio and television stations and perhaps from advertising in newspapers which circulate in Baltimore or Baltimore County or on radio \u25a0or television stations heard there. In its cross appeal, Baltimore Snelling challenges the lower court\u2019s decree because it falls short of this goal and fails to enjoin the A. S. Abell Company -and the Telephone Company from accepting such advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In support of this contention Baltimore Snelling insists that \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d has acquired a secondary meaning in .Baltimore, by dint of Baltimore Snelling\u2019s extensive program of newspaper, radio and television advertising, costing \u201cwell over :$100,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The chancellor concluded, and we agree, that Baltimore Snelling\u2019s use of the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d is based on its rights under the agreement of 5 July 1960, and not on a common law right, since the name acquired no secondary meaning -as a result of Baltimore Snelling\u2019s use of it; that by contract, Baltimore Snelling was given the exclusive right to use the name '\u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d in connection with its office in Baltimore, Maryland; and that Baltimore, Maryland, as used in the agreement, means the corporate limits of Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">We agree, however, with the appellant\u2019s argument, that the .\u2022grant of an \u201cexclusive\u201d right to use the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d <em>in connection with one office in Baltimore </em>is not an unrestricted right. Philadelphia Snelling retained a right, and \u2022could assign to others the right, to use the name in Baltimore in ways not connected with the Baltimore office. To hold otherwise would give rise to the conclusion that Baltimore Snelling might, if it wished, prevent Philadelphia Snelling from adver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tising in national magazines which circulated in Baltimore. This, was clearly not intended by anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The agreement of 5 July I960' between Philadelphia Snelling and Baltimore Snelling provided that it was to \u201cbe construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\u201d Where contract language is plain and unambiguous, its meaning should be determined without reference to extrinsic facts or aids. <em>Sternbergh v. Brock, </em>225 Pa. 279, 74 Atl. 166 (1909); <em>Kennedy v. Erkman, </em>389 Pa. 651, 133 A. 2d 550 (1957). Words are to be given their ordinary meaning <em>Pines Plaza Bowling, Inc. v. Rossview, Inc., </em>394 Pa. 124, 145 A. 2d 672 (1958). However, if the language under consideration is ambiguous or uncertain a court must then determine the intention of the parties. In such a case a court may consider evidence of extrinsic factors: <em>i.e., </em>negotiations of the parties, the circumstances surrounding execution of the contract, the parties\u2019 own construction of the contract and the conduct of the parties. <em>DeMoss v. Beryllium Corporation, </em>358 Pa. 470, 58 A. 2d 70 (1948); S<em>ternbergh v. Brock, supra; Kennedy v. Erkman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The lower court also found that the licensing of Dundalk-Essex Snelling by Philadelphia Snelling permitted the invasion by one licensee of another\u2019s territory and that this invasion and the resulting confusion mounted up to unfair competition, entitling Baltimore Snelling to equitable relief. We agree that an element of confusion was introduced by the licensing of Dundalk-Essex Snelling. We concede that Dundalk-Essex Snelling gained access to the communications media located in Baltimore; but we do not agree that this was the degree of confusion or the sort of invasion which warrants the granting of relief, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">There is ample authority for the proposition that a trade name-may seldom be licensed or assigned, except as an incident to the sale of a business or of its good will. <em>Gault v. Wagner, 227 </em>Md. 521, 525, 177 A. 2d 691 (1962); Nims, <em>The Law of Unfair Competition and Trademarks, </em>4th Ed. 1947, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 22. The reason for the rule is that such transactions are likely to break the continuity of business reputations on which customers are likely to rely. <em>Emerson Electric Mfg. Co. v.

The rules relating to liability for harm caused by unfair trade practices developed from the established principles in the law of torts. These rules developed largely from the rule which imposes liability upon one who diverts custom from another to himself by fraudulent misrepresentation that the goods he is offering are the goods produced by the other. In England this type of fraud is commonly called \u2018passing off\u2019 or \u2018palming off\u2019 one\u2019s goods as those of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201cThe American Law Institute made the following comment in 3 <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>ch. 35, pages 539, 540, on this constantly developing doctrine:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">\u2018The law has not yet developed a complete generalized standard for measuring trade practices like the standard of reasonable care in negligence. In part this is due to differing standards of commercial morality in the various industries; in part it is due to the fact that this branch of the law developed eclectically from the law dealing with the older wrongs which were not directly related to trade practices and competition. But the tendency of the law, both legislative and common, has been in the direction of enforcing increasingly higher standards of fairness or commercial morality in trade.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">A definitive discussion of recent developments in the field can be found in \u201cDevelopments in the Law\u2014Trade Marks and Unfair Competition\u201d 68 Harv. L. Rev. 814 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\"><em>Parkway Baking Company v. Freihofer Baking Co., </em>255 F. 2d 641 (3d Cir. 1958) involved the question of competition be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tween licensees in a multiple licensing arrangement. In that case, National Bakers Service, Inc., which owned a secret formula for baking low calorie bread and the trade mark \u201cHollywood,\u201d granted to Parkway an exclusive license to bake and sell Hollywood bread in a carefully defined area in Greater Philadelphia. Freihofer held the license for the territory, including the city of Allentown, immediately north of Parkway\u2019s. For a time, both Parkway and Freihofer sold to American Stores in their respective territories. American, desiring to deal with a single supplier, commenced to purchase its entire requirements from Parkway, which made deliveries to American\u2019s Philadelphia warehouse, although some of the bread was ultimately reshipped to American Stores in Freihofer\u2019s territory. Freihofer retaliated by making deliveries of Hollywood bread baked by him to a controlled distributor who took delivery of the bread in Allentown and redelivered to customers in Philadelphia. The court held that Parkway\u2019s sale to American in Philadelphia did not violate its license to bake and sell bread in Philadelphia, but that Freihofer\u2019s retaliatory sales, not being made in good faith, were a violation of its franchise. In so holding, the court construed the provisions of Parkway\u2019s license agreement in accordance with its literal terms <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and concluded that there had been no invasion of Freihofer\u2019s territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The doctrine of confusion, relied on by the lower court in the case before us is of relatively recent development. Originally, unfair competition consisted of \u201cpassing off\u201d or \u201cpalming off\u201d one\u2019s goods as those of another through the practice of deception. As the law developed, proof of fraudulent deception was no longer essential for relief, and this is the Maryland rule. <em>Edmondson Vil. Theatre, Inc. v. Einbinder, supra, </em>and at the same time, the earlier cases, holding that lack of competition between the parties was a defense, were being overruled. <em>Compare Borden Ice Cream Co. v. Borden\u2019s Condensed Milk Co., </em>201 F. 510, 514, (7th Cir. 1912) <em>with Ward Baking Co. v. Potter-Wrightington, </em>298 F. 398 (1st Cir. 1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>In the course of this development, confusion came to be recognized as a ground for equitable relief, even in the absence of deception or direct competition. For the complaining party to obtain injunctive relief on grounds of confusion, in cases where a trade name is at issue, the existence of a secondary meaning must be established, <em>National Shoe Stores Co. v. National Shoes of New York, Inc., </em>213 Md. 328, 131 A. 2d 909 (1957); <em>Baltimore Bedding Corp. v. Moses, </em>182 Md. 229, 34 A. 2d 338 (1943); Nims, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 334; Annot. 150 A. L. R. 1067. In the absence of a finding of secondary meaning, there must be proof of deception. <em>National Shoe Stores Co. v. National Shoes of New York, Inc., supra; Drive It Yourself Co. v. North, </em>148 Md. 609, 614, 130 A. 57 (1925); <em>Afro-American Owls v. Talbot, 123 </em>Md. 465, 91 A. 570 (1914); Annot. 150 A. L. R. 1067. In the case before us, the court below found no evidence that the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning in consequence of its use by Baltimore Snelling. With this w\u2019e agree, since should we conclude that a secondary meaning had been developed, it follows that it had been developed by Philadelphia Snelling, and that Baltimore Snelling and Dundalk-Essex Snelling were derivative beneficiaries of the secondary meaning by virtue of their license agreements. While the lower court found that \u201cdestructive competition\u201d and \u201cconfusion\u201d existed, there was no direct finding of fraud or deception, nor would such a finding have been supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">A multiple franchise operation of the sort conducted by Philadelphia Snelling is a comparative newcomer to the business world. Philadelphia Snelling cites Howard Johnson as comparable, but others readily suggest themselves: Quality Courts, Holiday Inns, Arthur Murray Dance Studios, and Sunkist Oranges are typical.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Adopting the characterization contained in the opinion in <em>Quality Courts United, Inc. v. Quality Courts, Inc., </em>140 F. Supp. 341 (M. D. Pa. 1956), \u201cSnelling and Snelling,\u201d like \u201cQuality Courts\u201d could be regarded as a collective trade name,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> analogous to the collective marks <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> registerable under the Lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>ham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. 1054, which are used in connection with the services of any person other than the owner to certify the quality and characteristics of the services. <em>See also, Huber Baking Company v. Stroehmann Bros. </em>Co., 252 F. 2d 945 (2d Cir.), <em>Cert. Denied, </em>358 U. S. 829 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">While the contractual arrangements and legal relationships between the multiple licensees may vary, all multiple franchise operations have one element in common\u2014the complete subordination of the identity of the individual owner or operator to the group image. The \u201cconfusion\u201d of which Baltimore Snelling complains is not only a natural result, but may even be a desired product of the structure, and must be sharply differentiated from the situations considered by this Court in <em>A. Weiskittel &amp; Son Co. v. Harry C. Weiskittel Co., </em>167 Md. 306, 173 A. 48 (1934) and <em>Neubert v. Neubert, </em>163 Md. 172, 161 A. 16 (1932). No better example of the monolithic facade of the Snelling \u201csystem\u201d can be found than in Drossner\u2019s own operation. His advertising would leave the uninformed to believe that Baltimore, Highlandtown, Towson and Glen Burnie are integral parts of a nation-wide system, which they are, for there is nowhere in the advertising an intimation that each of the four offices is a separately organized and owned business entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In recent times, the doctrine of unclean hands which Dundalk-Essex Snelling asserted in its answer has been regarded as, a doctrine applied for the protection of the court and not of the parties, <em>Space Aero Products Co. v. R. E. Darling Co., supra, </em>238 Md. at 120, and is seldom a defense available in an unfair competition action. Chafee, \u201cComing Into Equity With Clean Hands,\u201d 47 Michigan L. Rev. 1065, 1076-1080 (1949). The case which denied relief to the manufacturer of \u201cBalm of Thousand Flowers\u201d soap, which contained no flowers;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to the formulater of \u201cCalifornia Fig Syrup,\u201d which contained no figs;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the problem faced by this Court in the He-No Tea case, where a blend of tea sold as \u201cthe kind of tea the Chinese drink\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>was shown to be unknown in China,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in today\u2019s world would be resolved on broader equitable grounds. As Judge Learned Hand said in the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Dwinell-Wright Co. v. White House Milk Co., </em>132 F. 2d 822, 825 (2d Cir. 1943): \u201cHere, as often, equity does not seek for general principles, but weighs the opposed interests in the scales of conscience and fair dealing.\u201d Putting this another way, equitable estoppel may bar the relief sought. In the <em>White House </em>case, the complainant knew of the defendant\u2019s use of the brand name on its cans of evaporated milk, and was selling White House tea and coffee to the defendant for resale. In denying relief, the court said \u201c* * * the owner may have so conducted himself as impliedly to assure the newcomer that he does not object, and the newcomer may have built upon that assurance.\u201d 132 F. 2d at 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Or, as was said in <em>Holly Hill Citrus Growers\u2019 Assn. v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, Inc., 75 </em>F. 2d 13, 17 (5th Cir. 1935):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201cThere is a kind of evidential estoppel which, though it may not amount to a complete estoppel in pais, is raised when persons who have spoken or acted one way under one set of circumstances, and with one objective in mind, undertake under other circumstances and when their objective has changed, to testimonially give a different color to what they formerly said and did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">We think that principle applies here. Drossner is estopped from challenging the validity of a licensing system which he used to his own advantage when he obtained the Towson and Glen Burnie franchises, and from attempting to impose upon Mascaro limitations with respect to access to communications media which he did not assert against Towson and Glen Burnie. To permit him to do so would be to sanction the weaving of the very web of broader exclusivity which he failed to achieve by contract.

This exclusive right was to be used in connection with one office only which was to be opened by Baltimore Snelling in Baltimore City. As I read paragraph 1 (a) this is what the licensing agreement states. This is confirmed, in my opinion, by the provisions of paragraph 9 of the licensing agreement whereby Baltimore Snelling agreed when requested by Philadelphia Snelling to waive objections which Baltimore Snelling might legally have against the use of the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d in territories <em>other than the territory </em>granted to Baltimore Snelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">It is well established that the primary source for determining the intention of the parties to a contract is the language used by the parties. <em>Kelley Construction Co. v. Washington Sub6urban Sanitary </em>District, 247 Md. 241, 230 A. 2d 672 (1967); <em>Cadem v. Nanna, </em>243 Md. 536, 221 A. 2d 703 (1966). The words of the contract are to be understood in their plain, ordinary and popular sense, unless they have acquired a peculiar sense by trade usage or for some other cause. <em>Highley v. Phillips, </em>176 Md. 463, 5 A. 2d 824 (1939). It is only when the words of the contract, used in their ordinary sense, are vague, doubtful or ambiguous, that extrinsic evidence is admissible to determine the intention of the parties. <em>Coopersmith v. Isherwood, </em>219 Md. 455, 150 A. 2d 243 (1959). As pointed out in the majority opinion, the Pennsylvania law is to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The Chancellor concluded that Baltimore Snelling acquired the legal right, by the terms of the licensing agreement, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>exclusive </em>use of the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d in Baltimore-City in connection with its office located in that area, that the operation of Mascaro, by soliciting and advertising, could not be effectively confined within his Dundalk-Essex franchise area, without invading some sections of Baltimore City, and that this operation violated Baltimore Snelling\u2019s exclusive right to use-the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d in its franchise area. In my opinion the Chancellor\u2019s conclusion was correct and carries into-effect the intention of the parties to the licensing agreement as disclosed by the words of the contract itself. The purpose of the-exclusive grant was to protect the franchisee from competition within the franchise area and this was a lawful provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">The majority indicates that the exclusive right to use file-name in Baltimore City in connection with one office in that City \u201cis not an unrestricted right\u201d and that \u201cPhiladelphia Snelling retained a right and could assign to others the right to use the name in Baltimore in ways not connected with the Baltimore office. To hold otherwise would give rise to the conclusion that Baltimore Snelling might, if it wished, prevent Philadelphia Snelling from advertising in magazines which circulated in Baltimore.\u201d It was further stated \u201cThis was clearly not intended by any one.\u201d With great respect, this appears to me to-beg the question. The language of the contract gives an unrestricted right against those who can <em>compete </em>with Baltimore Snelling, not against national advertising generally or advertising by franchisees who geographically cannot compete with Baltimore Snelling as a practical matter. There is no contention that Philadelphia Snelling could grant another franchise for another office to someone other than Baltimore Snelling in Baltimore City. It seems clear that Baltimore Snelling then has the exclusive right to use the Snelling name in Baltimore City in connection with that one office and no one else can be granted any right to use the name in Baltimore City in competition with Baltimore Snelling. The conclusion of paragraph 1 (a) provides:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">\u201cLicensee (Baltimore Snelling) shall not directly or indirectly establish an office or place of business, or move to any locations outside of such territory; nor shall licensee [Baltimore Snelling] change its name without obtaining the written consent of Snelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>[Philadelphia Snelling]; nor shall licensee [Baltimore Snelling] establish any branch or additional office without the written consent of Snelling [Philadelphia Snelling].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">'This provision indicates that there are two prohibitions on the activities of Baltimore Snelling, (1) that only one office will be maintained that one in its <em>territory, </em>and (2) that there will be no change in its <em>name. </em>Paragraph 9 provides for waiver by Baltimore Snelling in territories <em>other than </em>the territory granted 'to Baltimore Snelling. This language clearly indicates that the territory granted to Baltimore Snelling is Baltimore City (it is the only <em>territory </em>mentioned in paragraph 1) and there is no \u2022provision that there will be any waiver of objection to the use \u2022of the name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d in <em>that territory. </em>This language confirms the exclusive nature of the grant to Baltimore \u2022Snelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the licensing agreement is ambiguous, the extrinsic evidence, in my opinion, confirms the \u2018Chancellor\u2019s construction of the contract. When the licensing -agreement was negotiated, the prior franchisees in the Baltimore area had failed badly in their operation, leaving a collection of unpaid bills and ill will behind them. The <em>name </em>\u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d was at that point a liability rather than an :asset. In short, the situation gave rise to a franchisee\u2019s \u201cmarket,\u201d \u2022as it were, and Philadelphia Snelling was obliged to give Baltimore Snelling a licensing agreement most beneficial to the franchisee and at a small license payment in order to obtain a \u2022competent and qualified operator who would enter the unfortunate situation in Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">In addition to the specific situation in the Baltimore area, Philadelphia Snelling in 1960 had not enlarged its licensing op\u2022erations to the substantial size it enjoys at the present time. Here again it was necessary to give favorable licensing agreements to its franchisees in order to build up its business at that time. It is significant that after the situation in Baltimore was rectified and Philadelphia Snelling\u2019s business had substantially \u25a0expanded, a <em>different </em>form of contract from which the word \u201cexclusive\u201d was removed was used by Philadelphia Snelling, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>more substantial original license payments were required. It seems clear that Philadelphia Snelling believed that there was a substantial legal difference between a licensing agreement containing the word \u201cexclusive\u201d and one from which that word was excluded. It is unreasonable to suppose that Baltimore Snelling would have proceeded to make the very substantial payments for advertising and other promotional items <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> if it had not believed that it had the exclusive right for which it had successfully bargained.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Then too, the licensing agreement of July 5, 1960, was prepared by Philadelphia Snelling. It is well settled that in the event of ambiguity in the contract, it is to be construed against the party preparing it. <em>Hughes &amp; Co. v. Pioneer, </em>230 Md. 36, 185 A. 2d 383 (1962). Applying this maxim of construction to the licensing agreement, the ambiguity would be resolved against Philadelphia Snelling and the Chancellor\u2019s construction sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In the majority opinion, as an alternative ground for reversing the Chancellor\u2019s decree, it is indicated that Baltimore Snelling is equitably estopped from challenging the validity of the licensing system which Drossner \u201cused to his own advantage when he obtained the Towson and Glen Burnie franchises and from attempting to impose upon Mascaro limitations with respect to communications media he did not assert against Tow-son and Glen Burnie.\u201d Although the basic principle of estoppel is sound in a proper case, in my opinion, it is not applicable in the present case, as Drossner was <em>Mmself one of the principals </em>in the Towson and Glen Burnie franchises. The granting of these franchises was not injurious to the exclusive franchise granted to Baltimore Snelling inasmuch as a substantial part of the profits of their operation accrued to the principal in Baltimore Snelling. The obtention of the Glen Burnie and Towson franchises might possibly establish an equitable estoppel, prima facie, against Drossner in his contention that Baltimore Snelling\u2019s franchise included areas outside of Baltimore City, but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>would not, in my opinion, operate as an estoppel to insist on the exclusive franchise as against Mascaro, a competitor. More importantly, it would seem that merely because Drossner permitted one person to infringe his exclusive franchise, he would not be prevented from enforcing that franchise against another infringement by a different person.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Assuming for the argument that the estoppel would otherwise be effective against Drossner, in my opinion the estoppel is not available to Mascaro in this case because it was not raised, considered or passed upon by the Chancellor in the trial court and was not briefed or argued before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">It is indicated in the majority opinion that Mascaro in his answer to the bill of complaint asserted the defense that the plaintiff was guilty of \u201cunclean hands\u201d and the inference is that this affirmative defense sufficiently raised the question of estoppel. In my opinion, the raising of this affirmative defense does not raise the question of estoppel against Drossner by his acquisition as one of the principals of the Towson and Glen Burnie franchises. Paragraph 20 of the Mascaro answer alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201c20. Further answering, Complainant is guilty of unclean hands in that the Bill of Complaint, which prayed under oath an ex parte injunction which was successfully obtained and then dissolved on motion of Defendant, fails to make a full and frank disclosure of all the facts, to wit, that both Complainant and Defendant are licensees of Snelling and Snelling, Inc., owners of the registered trade name \u201cSnelling and Snelling\u201d by virtue of contracts dated July 5th, 1960, and November 4th, 1965, respectively.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">There is nothing alleged in paragraph 20 to suggest any estoppel of Drossner by having acquired, as one of the principals, the Towson and Glen Burnie franchises. The reference in paragraph 20 is to licenses acquired under the licensing agreements of Baltimore Snelling and Mascaro, dated July 5, 1960 and November 4, 1965 respectively. The Chancellor does not mention or pass upon any estoppel point in his written opinion and there is nothing concerning it in the final decree. The point is not mentioned in the briefs of the respective parties and the cases cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>on this point by the majority are not cited. There was no argument before us on the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Under these circumstances the point is not available to Mascaro as a ground for reversal in this case. Maryland Rule 885 provides that this Court \u201cwill not ordinarily decide any point or question which does not plainly appear by the record to have been decided by the lower court.\u201d In my opinion, the point was not presented to the lower court and I see no reason to decide the point here. See <em>Elko v. Elko, </em>187 Md. 161, 49 A. 2d 441, 168 A. L. R. 256(1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Then too, we have rather consistently held that even if a point were raised and decided by the lower court, it will be deemed to be waived on appeal if the point is not briefed in this Court. <em>Harmon v. State Roads </em>Commission, 242 Md. 24, 217 A. 2d 513 (1966); <em>Myers v. Chief of Baltimore County Fire Bureau, </em>237 Md. 583, 207 A. 2d 467 (1965). For this additional reason, the estoppel point is not available to Mascaro in this case as a ground for the reversal of the Chancellor\u2019s decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">I would affirm the decree.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">.
