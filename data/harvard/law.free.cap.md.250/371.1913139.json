The trial judge, Carter, J., ordered the broker to return $3,500 of an $8,000 deposit he had retained as his commission. We shall affirm Judge Carter\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">\u201cCadillac Jack\u201d is the nom de guerre of Wilbur F. Haugh, who claims to be the sole owner of appellee,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a once prosperous used car business in Harford County which he conducted on a 10 acre tract situate on the east side of U. S. Route No. 1 (Belair Road) about 3 miles south of Belair. Pressed by creditors, Haugh, in October 1963, commissioned appellant (Adler)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to find a purchaser for the property. He executed one of the printed Standard Listing Contract forms (first making minor revisions) of the Real Estate Board of Greater Baltimore (the Board) giving Adler authority, for 3 months only, to sell the property for $185,000. The listing contract was solicited by Veri J. Edwards (Mrs. Edwards), an employee of Adler. Adler said Mrs. Edwards was a personal friend of Haugh and had known him for 20 years. In February 1964, the October listing having expired, a new listing contract was signed by Haugh. This was for 6 months. The sale price ($185,000) remained the same. Nine months later, in October 1964, Haugh signed still another listing contract on the same terms, except that its duration was for 3 months instead of 6 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">It should be remembered that each of the 3 listing contracts provided that Adler\u2019s commission was to be based on the \u201cStandard Schedule of Commissions\u201d (the Schedule) promulgated by the Board, which is set forth, in part, below: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">\u201c(a) Improved Commercial and Industrial Property (including retail store properties, office buildings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>and apartments) : 6% on the first $50,000, 5% on the next $450,000, and 3% on the balance in excess of $500,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">\u201c(b) Special Utility and/or Special Effort Properties\u2014Theatres, churches, wharf properties, abbatoirs, mill properties, dairies, laundries, distilleries, breweries as well as special effort properties: 7% % ; higher rates may be charged not in excess of 10% when specified in the original employment agreement or listing contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The October 1964 listing contract expired on 18 January 1965. At or about that time Mrs. Edwards persuaded Winston B. Osborne, to whom she had shown the property some months earlier, to offer $80,000 for it. He gave her a down payment of $500. She returned to the office and saw to the preparation of the agreement of sale, in which Osborne agreed to pay an additional $7,500 upon the execution of the agreement by the seller, Haugh. The agreement required the seller to pay Adler a commission \u201cin accordance with the [Board\u2019s] Schedule.\u201d Also included in the agreement was a provision that it contained \u201cthe final and entire agreement between * * * parties * * * and [that | neither * * * [of them] shall be bound by any terms, conditions or representations not [t] herein written.\u201d She obtained Osborne\u2019s signature and the agreement was then sent to Haugh.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The record is silent in respect of what, if anything, happened between the signing of the agreement of sale by Osborne and a meeting which was held at Karson\u2019s Inn on Holabird Avenue on 28 January 1965. Present at the meeting were Haugh, a young woman said by some to be his \u201cgirl friend\u201d and by others to be his nurse, Adler, Mrs. Edwards, John T. Smith, whom Haugh identified as vice president of the appellee, and Mrs. Smith. Xo minutes of this meeting appear in the record but one\u2019s first guess would be that the principal item on the agenda was the disparity between Haugh\u2019s asking price of $185,000 and Osborne\u2019s offer of $80,000. The record suggests that Llaugh was not in the best of moods, at the time, and that he may have been somewhat difficult; not without reason it seems. Dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ing 1953 and 1964 he had been treated at Spring Grove State Hospital for alcoholism. Judgments against him amounted to about $85,000. His business had gone down the drain and he seems to have suspected that Adler\u2019s failure to obtain a better offer was more the result of indifference and inertia than any lack of marketability of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">After what Adler described as a \u201cbig hassle\u201d Haugh signed the agreement of sale and the following statement written in longhand on a \u201cCadillac Jack\u201d letterhead (the addendum) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cJan. 28, 1965</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">T, Wilbur F. Haugh, trading as \u201cCadillac Jack Enterprises, Inc.,\u201d signed the attached contracts with the understanding that said contracts must meet the approval of John T.

Haugh will as agents and through their attorney Mr. Heath contact each creditor and settle said outstanding obligations in the most advantageous manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">T want 25,000.00 net for complete settlement on final signature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">By Wilbur F.

Edwards, Agt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">Adler contends there was a \u201cverbal\u201d agreement for a 10% commission. \u201cHe [Haugh] was not only going to give ten percent, he was going to give us a thousand dollars <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to pay the attorney to compromise these deals.\u201d Asked why he didn\u2019t \u201cget a written contract\u201d providing for a 10% commission, Adler said, \u201cI guess because we were stupid; we assumed there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>wouldn\u2019t be any question about it.\u201d The following excerpt from the cross-examination of Adler is revealing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">\u201cQ. All right. Now you say this ten percent contract is a verbal contract, as you put it, when did this arise ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>As far as I was concerned it never arose, it was an understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">\u201cQ. You are saying you got a ten percent verbal contract, is that what you say ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">\u201cA. From Mrs. Edwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">\u201cQ. When did you get it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">\u201cA. When we first got the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">\u201cQ. In October? [1963]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>When she gets on the stand you can ask her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">Mrs. Edwards specifically denied that she had any negotiations with Haugh or with anyone else concerning commissions. She said a 10% commission was discussed at the 28 January meeting but she was \u201cnot positive as to any definite decision on it.\u201d We quote from the cross-examination of Mrs. Edwards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-13\">\u201cQ. Now you say the subject of commissions arose at that time ? [ 28 January meeting]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-14\">\u201cA. It was discussed. Of course I had no right to enter into the discussion because I was not the broker involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-15\">\u201cQ. Do you recall who brought up the discussion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-16\">\u201cA. Mr. Adler brought up the discussion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-17\">\u201cQ. And what did he claim as to towards commission, he said he was entitled to ten percent ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-18\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-19\">\u201cQ. And what was the response from Mr. Haugh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-20\">\u201cA. Mr. Haugh kept saying \u201cno, no, no, no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-21\">Daniel Wagner, a certified public accountant and a member of the bar, testified he was engaged by Haugh \u201cto see [the] settlement through.\u201d He said he undertook negotiations with Haugh\u2019s creditors and succeeded in reducing the liens from $85,000 to about $61,000. He had trouble accomplishing this, he said, because the creditors were upset and unhappy. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>had been irritated by the earlier approach of another person (either Adler or Mrs. Edwards). He (Wagner) telephoned Adler several days before the settlement to learn how much of the $8,000 deposit would be \u201cforthcoming from Associated Realty at the date of settlement.\u201d Asked what had been Adler\u2019s reaction he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">\u201cA. He indicated to me that this was not so, that the commission would be ten percent and that <em>if the commission of ten percent was not agreed to </em>he would take his prospective purchaser that signed the contract into another property and that the sale would not go through.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">When he reported this, Haugh told him there had been talk (at the 28 January meeting) about a <em>10\u00b0/o </em>commission but that even assuming such an agreement, which he denied, it would have been contingent upon his walking away from the settlement with $25,000, \u201cafter all expenses of settlement including commission had been taken care of.\u201d Haugh said, \u201cDon\u2019t settle; don\u2019t give them ten percent commission.\u201d Because Haugh \u201cwas under pressure and * * * wanted funds\u2014any funds he could get\u201d Wagner said to him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">\u201cThe proper thing to do is to go through with the settlement peacefully and let them take the ten percent; they are bonded real estate company, then, if in fact you are entitled to a reduction because of this contract being in effect, you will be able to sue in a court of law to recover your refund.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Adler, on the other hand, claims Wagner telephoned him a few days before settlement and said, \u201cI\u2019m not getting enough money out of this deal. You will have to cut your commission. If you don\u2019t cut the commission there won\u2019t be any deal.\u201d Adler said he told Wagner, \u201cWe are going to stand pat\u201d and that \u201ca little bit later\u201d Wagner called back and said, \u201cAll right, we will go through with it, everything is O.K.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The closing was held at the office of John E. Clark, Esq., in Belair on 14 April 1965. Mrs. Edwards presented to Mr. Clark a receipted bill for $8,000. Mr. Clark remarked, she tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>tilled, that since the \u201ccommissions are paid * * * [he would not] enter it on the settlement sheet.\u201d Haugh was not present at the settlement but he was said to be in the vicinity. The \u201csettlement statement\u201d indicates that $18,257.11 was paid to Wagner who, after deducting his compensation, handed over to Haugh $17,000. Haugh promptly (25 May 1965) filed suit in the Superior Court of Baltimore City to recover $3,500 from Adler, conceding, in effect, that Adler was entitled to the commission set forth in subsection (a) of the Schedule. The case was tried before Judge Carter, without a jury, on 1, 2 and 3 May 1967. In this appeal no brief was filed on behalf of Haugh nor was there any appearance for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Judge Carter had \u201cno difficulty in determining that there is no satisfactory evidence of any oral agreement relating to commissions for the sale of this property.\u201d After commenting on the meeting of 28 January, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201cThe only thing that I can make out of that is that Mr. Adler was asking for ten percent and Mr. Haugh was saying \u2018no,\u2019 or perhaps qualified his negative response by saying \u2018All right, I wall give you ten percent provided I receive the net amount of $25,000,\u2019 or, perhaps, according to this one Exhibit, it might have been $20[000] to $25,000. The fact is, he didn\u2019t get that much, so even if he gave, what I term a qualified consent to a ten percent commission, he did it on a condition that didn\u2019t occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">If in this record there is any support for an oral agreement to pay a ten percent commission it must be found in the testimony of Adler. Haugh denied any such arrangement. There is nothing in Wagner\u2019s testimony to support it and Mrs. Edwards\u2019 testimony falls short of establishing it. Even Adler\u2019s testimony contains inconsistencies which impair its credibility. As earlier noted, he testified at one point that the \u201cverbal\u201d (oral) arrangement concerning commissions was made by Mrs. Edwards when she \u201cfirst got the contract\u201d in October 1963. It seems very odd indeed, if that were the case, that none of the three listing con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tracts contained any reference to it, especially in light of the Real Estate Board requirement that \u201chigher rates may be charged not in excess of 10% <em>when specified in the original employment agreement or listing </em>contract(Emphasis supplied.) Even more curious is the retention in the (printed) agreement of sale of the provision binding the seller to pay a commission to \u201cAssociated Realty Company\u201d (typed in) in accordance with the Board\u2019s Schedule. Elsewhere in his testimony Adler insisted the \u201cverbal\u201d agreement was made at the 28 January meeting at Karson\u2019s Inn. We think Judge Carter\u2019s comment just about hit the nail on the head and it follows, of course, that we cannot say he was clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule 886 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">We turn now to the question whether there was a written contract for the payment of a 10% commission. We understand it to be conceded that on 18 January 1965 all of the listing contracts had expired. Since we have agreed there is no support for an oral agreement it is clear that any written agreement must be found in the agreement of sale and the addendum.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nothing could be more obvious than the fact that the agreement of sale refers only to the Board\u2019s Schedule. It is equally obvious that Haugh was painfully aware of the fact that the liens ($85,000) would consume the proposed sale price ($80,-000), leaving no cash for him. The addendum makes it clear that his execution of the agreement of sale was conditioned upon his walking away from the settlement with $25,000. It was up to others to reduce the liens to an amount which might make this possible. There is nothing in the addendum about commissions. It seems incredible that, after a meeting lasting 3 to 4 hours, Adler and Mrs. Edwards would have been content to leave unsettled the amount of the commission especially if they expected to receive more than the amount stipulated- in the agreement of sale. Judge Carter was not in error when he said he could \u201carrive at only one conclusion, that the commission was payable on the basis\u201d of the Schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Falling back on his second line of defense, Adler contends that, while he may not be entitled to 10%, he is entitled, at least, to 7j4% because this is a \u201cSpecial Effort Property\u201d as provided in the Schedule. Judge Carter found \u201cno evidence * * * to suggest * * * that this is a Special Effort Property.\u201d While we think there is perhaps some evidence along that line it is certainly not enough for us to say that Judge Carter\u2019s conclusion is erroneous. It does not appear that the property was ever shown to anyone but Osborne and, it seems, it was shown to him on only one earlier occasion. If Wagner is to be believed, the solicitation of lien creditors by Adler or Mrs. Edwards was unsuccessful; indeed neither of them claimed any success in this regard. In fact, Wagner said, they so irritated the lienors that his efforts in that direction were made very difficult. We think Adler had the burden of showing that more time and effort were required, and expended, than would have been involved in an ordinary sale. He has not met that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The gist of Adler\u2019s final contention is that Haugh, by completing the settlement, is estopped from claiming the return of any part of the $8,000. Adler did not use the word \u201cestoppel\u201d but it is clear that he is relying upon it. Adler insists he has paid Airs. Edwards her share of the commission (60% of $8,000) but this is not borne out by the testimony. Mrs. Edwards flatly denied receiving her share. In fact, she says, Adler owes her $12,000. Judge Carter referred that aspect of the case to one of the court auditors to take testimony, examine the accounting records and to make and submit his findings. This record indicates the matter is still pending. Of course, if Adler really had paid Mrs. Edwards her $4,800 there might be some force to his estoppel argument. However, since it does not appear, on this record, that his position has worsened, that defense is not available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.
