Following the operation decedent developed a number of serious postoperative complications. Because defendant made no attempt to determine the cause of these problems, decedent sought treatment from another physician, Doctor Herman Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Doctor Smith suspected decedent might have an abscess and that his common bile duct was obstructed. When decedent\u2019s condition had improved sufficiently to permit further surgery, Smith\u2019s suspicions were confirmed. He found an abscess below the liver where decedent\u2019s gallbladder had been removed and discovered defendant had ligated decedent\u2019s common bile duct rather than his cystic duct during the August 24 surgery. Unfortunately, the corrective measures taken by Smith failed to stem the bacterial infection in decedent\u2019s abdominal cavity necessitating additional surgery a week later in a final attempt to save his life. This procedure, too, was unsuccessful and on October 31, 1982, Charles Yates died.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">All doctors testifying at the time of trial, including defendant, concurred that ligation of the common bile duct violates the standard of care required of a reasonably prudent surgeon. Doctor Smith further agreed it was probable decedent would have \u201cbeen alive today\u201d were it not for \u201cthe events that took place in the course of the surgery on August the 24th at Pico Rivera Community Hospital which resulted in the obstruction of the common bile duct and the development of abscesses and infections and the consequences of that act . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Defendant\u2019s first contention is persuasive insofar as he challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to reduce noneconomic damages to $250,000 as required by the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act of 1975 (MI-CRA). (Stats. 1975, 2d Ex. Sess., chs. 1 and 2.) Civil Code section 3333.2 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) In <em>any action </em>for injury against a health care provider based on professional negligence, the injured plaintiff shall be entitled to recover noneconomic losses to compensate for pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, disfigurement and other nonpecuniary damage. [H] (b) In <em>no action </em>shall the amount of damages for noneconomic losses exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250 000). [fl] (c) For the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>purposes of this section: . . . [H](2) \u2018Professional negligence\u2019 means a negligent act or omission to act by a health care provider in the rendering of professional services, which act or omission is the proximate cause of a personal injury or <em>wrongful death </em>. . . (Italics added; hereinafter section 3333.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">We have no difficulty ascertaining the legislative intent of this statute since it is unambiguous on its face. Its plain language unequivocably manifests a desire to place a $250,000 cap on awards for noneconomic damages in all medical malpractice litigation, whether recovery is sought by patients who have themselves suffered personal injuries or by the survivors of such victims who initiate suits for wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Should any lingering doubt exist on this point, it is quickly dispelled by an examination of the legislative history of section 3333.2. Certain of the tentative drafts of the proposed MICRA legislation actually did explicitly exclude plaintiffs in wrongful death actions from the specified ceiling on noneconomic damages and permitted them to recover \u201c[a]ll noneconomic damages. . . .\u201d (Assem. Bill No. 1 (1975-1976 2d Ex. Sess.) May 19, 1975, proposed Health &amp; Saf. Code \u00a7\u00a7 21153, 21154, pp. 11-12; Sen. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 1 (1975-1976 2d Ex. Sess.) June 27, 1975, \u00a7\u00a7 24.6, 24.7.) Ultimately, however, the Legislature rejected that approach in favor of a comprehensive provision which restricted the amount of noneconomic damages without regard to the status of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Despite the clear wording of the statute plaintiffs maintain it has no applicability to wrongful death actions because subdivision (a) refers only to actions for \u201cinjury\u201d rather than \u201cinjury or wrongful death.\u201d This argument fails, inter alia, because it ignores the fact that wrongful death claims are for \u201cinjuries\u201d suffered by the heirs of medical malpractice victims. (See <em>Krouse </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 59, 68 [137 Cal.Rptr. 863, 562 P.2d 1022].)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Plaintiffs also urge that inasmuch as survivors may not recover for \u201cpain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, disfigurement and other nonpecuniary damage\u201d (\u00a7 3333.2, subd. (a)), the Legislature must have intended to exclude wrongful death actions from the reach of the statute. We disagree. Subdivision (a) does not purport to set forth a comprehensive catalogue of the types of losses to which the statute is applicable; it simply identifies certain of the more common types of noneconomic damages which arise in malpractice actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Similarly the statute\u2019s reference to \u201cnonpecuniary damage\u201d is not fatal to its application in the wrongful death context. Although it is true that California decisional law indicates only \u201cpecuniary\u201d losses are compensable in wrongful death suits, nonetheless, as our highest court recognized in <em>Krouse </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>v. <em>Graham, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at pages 67-68, damage awards in such cases, in fact, have never been restricted to those elements having an ascertainable economic value. That is to say, they have included what are, in effect, inherently nonpecuniary factors akin to pain and suffering, e.g., the loss of a decedent\u2019s society, comfort, protection, care, companionship, etc. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 68. See also <em>Canavin </em>v. <em>Pacific Southwest Airlines </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 512, 527 [196 Cal.Rptr. 82].) The continued affirmance of such awards, notwithstanding their \u201cnoneconomic\u201d nature, undoubtedly reflects \u201ca realization that if damages truly were limited to \u2018pecuniary\u2019 loss, recovery frequently would be barred by the heirs\u2019 inability to prove such loss. . . .\u201d <em>(Krouse, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that section 3333.2 unconstitutionally abridges the right to a jury trial (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16) is but an indirect attack upon the Legislature\u2019s power to place a cap on damages. While it is clear section 3333.2 will in some cases result in the recovery of a lower judgment than would have been obtained before the enactment of the statute, it is well established that \u201cthe Legislature retains broad control over <em>the measure, </em>as well as <em>the timing, </em>of damages that a defendant is obligated to pay and a plaintiff is entitled to receive, and that [it] may expand or limit recoverable damages so long as its action is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. . . .\u201d <em>(Fein </em>v. <em>Permanente Medical Group </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 137, 158 [211 Cal.Rptr. 368, 695 P.2d 665], italics in original; <em>American Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Community Hospital </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 359, 368-369 [204 Cal.Rptr. 671, 683 P.2d 670, 41 A.L.R.4th 233].)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">While the general propriety of noneconomic damages is \u201cfirmly imbedded in our common law jurisprudence [citation],\u201d no California case \u201chas ever suggested that the right to recover for such noneconomic injuries is constitutionally immune from legislative limitation or revision. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Fein </em>v. <em>Permanente Medical Group, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 159-160.) This being so, plaintiff\u2019s challenge must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">As a \u201cfall back\u201d position, plaintiffs assert that even if section 3333.2 is applicable to wrongful death actions, its $250,000 limitation should be applied to each plaintiff individually and not to all plaintiffs in the aggregate. However, it is evident from the terms of the statute that while each injured plaintiff is entitled to seek noneconomic damages, the maximum recovery permitted in any single medical malpractice <em>action </em>is $250,000, regardless of the number of plaintiffs involved.  Since the Legislature was obviously aware that \u201ccase precedent has consistently held \u2018only <em>one action </em>[can] be brought for the wrongful death of a person thereby preventing multiple actions by individual heirs and the personal representative\u2019 . . .\u201d and that \u201cthe cause of action for wrongful death has been consistently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>characterized as \u2018a joint one, a single one and an indivisible one\u2019 . . <em>(Canavin </em>v. <em>Pacific Southwest Airlines, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.3d at p. 529; italics in original; <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 690, 694 [36 Cal.Rptr. 321, 388 P.2d 353]), we can but conclude its use of the word \u201caction\u201d in section 3333.2 represents its conscious decision to limit the total recovery for noneconomic loss in such suits to $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Our decision in this respect renders moot plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal, as well as defendant\u2019s claim that the judgment may not exceed plaintiffs\u2019 specification of damages in the amount of $1 million.  Likewise, we need not pass on defendant\u2019s charge that the jury\u2019s assessment of noneconomic damages was excessive, since the actual award to be entered, $250,000, is eminently reasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Decedent and his wife had been married for 35 years at the time of his death.

He was in frequent communication with four of his five children and they visited regularly. He was in every respect a very generous and supportive father, including financially.
