Costantino, J., on various counts all having to do with the interstate transportation of a stolen tractor trailer containing a shipment of beef. Both appellants were convicted of unlawfully receiving and possessing the trailer in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 659, and of conspiring to violate that statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Fields was also found guilty of transporting in interstate commerce goods which he knew had been stolen. 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 2314. Fields received a four-year concurrent sentence on each count. Hamilton received concurrent five-year sentences. Because we find that the judge committed plain error in his charge, we must reverse for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\"> In discussing the alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 659, the judge first read the indictment to the jury. This charged that both defendants, among other things, \u201cdid unlawfully receive and possess\u201d the trailer, which contained stolen goods that both defendants \u201cknew had been stolen.\u201d The judge went on to say that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">In addition, the government need not' prove that the defendant actually knew that it was stolen property. If the evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, tends to prove knowledge of the contents and also of the trailer itself being stolen, that would be sufficient. That is only sufficient again if you apply the rule \u2014 and I will keep repeating this because it\u2019s necessary to do so \u2014of beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">This charge on an essential element of the crime \u2014 a defendant\u2019s knowledge that the goods were stolen \u2014 was inadequate and misleading. Contrary to the judge\u2019s instructions, the Government did have to prove that the defendants \u201cactually knew\u201d that the beef was stolen property. See United States v. Massarotti, 462 F.2d 1328 (2d Cir. 1972); United States v. Nitti, 444 F.2d 1056, 1059 (7th Cir. 1971). And it was not \u201csufficient\u201d if the evidence only \u201ctended\u201d to prove such knowledge. We realize that the judge may have been attempting to distinguish between direct and circumstantial evidence, or perhaps between participating in the theft of the goods or directly witnessing the theft and merely having knowledge of a theft. Only the latter, provable by circumstantial evidence, is required for conviction. But the instruction, apparently given extemporaneously, did not come out that way and was obviously confusing at best. Moreover, the judge never defined \u201cknowledge\u201d again although he referred to this element of the crime in explaining the remaining counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">In addition, the judge charged the wrong portion of section 659. In explaining the crime charged in the first count, the court read from the first paragraph of section 659. This deals with the unlawful <em>taking </em>of goods, but defendants were not charged with that crime. They were charged with unlawfully <em>receiving </em>and <em>possessing </em>stolen goods. This crime is defined in the second paragraph of section 659, which the judge did not read. Similarly, in explaining the conspiracy count the judge told the jury that the charge was that defendants had conspired to \u201ctake this property\u201d whereas the indictment charged conspiracy to \u201creceive and possess\u201d the stolen goods. In addition, the court did not explain the additional degree of knowledge required for a conviction of conspiracy to violate section 659, i. e., that the Government must prove not only the defendants knew the goods were stolen but also that they knew the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>goods were stolen from interstate commerce. See United States v. Vilhotti, 452 F.2d 1186, 1189-90 (2d Cir. 1971), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The Government makes a manful effort to minimize the effect of these errors but its only argument of \u00e1ny merit is that none of the errors was called to the attention of the trial judge by defense counsel. This is, incredibly, accurate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, we think that the cumulative effect of the errors in the charge was, in the words of Fed.R. Crim.P. 52, \u201cplain,\u201d that it affected \u201csubstantial rights\u201d of defendants on all counts and should \u201cbe noticed\u201d although not raised below. United States v. Vaughan, 443 F.2d 92, 94-95 (2d Cir. 1971). We regret the need for a new trial because the evidence of the guilt of these defendants was substantial,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but we do not see how we can fairly follow any other course. This is not, after all, a case of nit-picking over nuances in a judge\u2019s charge; the errors go directly to a defendant\u2019s right to have the jury told what crimes he is actually being tried for and what the essential elements of those crimes are.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">One further matter requires brief discussion. After this appeal was argued, counsel for appellant Fields successfully applied to us for bail. The application had first been made to the district judge immediately after sentence was imposed. According to the transcript, the judge responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">I never consider bail once I\u2019ve sentenced a man. I don\u2019t think this is the type of case where I should set bail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">This approach is wholly improper. The Bail Reform Act of 1966 incorporates a presumption in favor of bail even after conviction</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-14\">unless the . . . judge has reason to believe that no one or more conditions of release will reasonably assure that the person will not flee or pose a danger to any other person or to the community. If such a risk of flight or danger is believed to exist, or if it appears that an appeal is frivolous or taken for delay, the person may be ordered detained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-15\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148. Obviously, denial of bail after conviction is frequently justifiable, but it must be done on an individual rather than on a blanket basis, and the reasons for doing so must comport with the statute and be stated with particularity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-16\">Judgments reversed and case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\">. At the end of the charge, the government attorney pointed out that \u201cthey were charged with the possession and <em>not </em>the taking.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The judge then briefly recharged the jury to the effect that the defendants were charged with both taking <em>and </em>possession of the trailer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b193-8\">. The argument of defendant Hamilton that there was insufficient evidence to allow the jury to find that he knew the goods were stolen is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b193-17\">. Cf. F.R.A.P. 9(b), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-18\">Application for release after a judgment of conviction shall be made in the first instance in the district court. If the district court refuses release pending appeal, or imposes conditions of release, the court shall state in writing the reasons for the action taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-19\">We have interpreted the Rule to mean that a statement of reasons by the trial judge given on the record and recorded in the transcript is sufficient. See United States v. Manarite, 430 F.2d 656 (2d Cir. 1970) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
