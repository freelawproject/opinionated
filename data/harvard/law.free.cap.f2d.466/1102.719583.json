S.C. \u00a7 141 (1947). Initially, as passed by the House of Representatives, the bill \u201cmade it an unfair labor practice [for employers] to give favors to \u2018any person in a position of trust in a labor organization * * *\u2019 H.R. 3020, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 8(a) (2). The scope of this bill was enlarged when it reached the Senate to include, in the words of Senator Taft, a \u2018case where the union representative is shaking down the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>ployer * * * \u2019 93 Cong.Rec. 4746.\u201d The resulting bill \u201coutlaw [ed] all payments, with stated exceptions, between employer and representative,\u201d imposing criminal liability on both the employee representatives and those members of management who indulged in the forbidden transactions. United States v. Ryan, 350 U.S. 299, 305-306, 76 S.Ct. 400, 100 L.Ed. 335 (1956).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">The Taft-Hartley Bill did not succeed in stamping out the corruption problem, however. Many of those dishonest enough to betray the employees\u2019 interests prior to the legislation were devious enough to avoid the reach of the TaftHartley Act. \u201c [Widespread public concern\u201d with \u201cracketeering, crime, and corruption\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> continued; and the Eighty-Sixth Congress responded by enacting the Labor Management Act of 1959. By so doing, Congress hoped to \u201cclose loopholes\u201d which \u201cboth employer representatives and union officials [had] turned to advantage at the expense of employees.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The bill was intended to make certain that employer representatives, like other trustees, would not profit from their positions of trust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-6\">For centuries the law has forbidden any person in a position of trust to hold interests or enter into transactions in which self-interest may conflict with complete loyalty to those whom they serve. Such a person may not deal with himself, or acquire adverse interests, or make any personal profit as a result of his position. The same principle has long been applied to trustees, to agents, and to bank directors. It is equally applicable to union officers and employees. The ethical practices code of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations states \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-11\">It is too plain for extended discussion that a basic ethical principle in the conduct of union affairs is that no responsible trade union official should have a personal financial interest which conflicts with the full performance of his fiduciary duties as a workers\u2019 representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1176-12\">After the McClellan committee hearings no one can dispute the simple fact that although the vast majority of union officials are honest and conscientious men, a small number have ignored this basic standard of conduct. No one would deny that the conduct is wrong. The wrongs should not be ignored by the Federal Government. The national labor policy is founded upon collective bargaining through strong and vigorous unions. <em>Playing both sides of the street, using union office for personal financial advantage, undercover deals, and other conflicts of interest, corrupt and thereby undermine and weaken the labor movement. </em>The Copgress should check the abuses in order to foster the national labor policy. <em>The Government which vests in labor unions the power to act as exclusive bargaining representative must make sure that the power is used for the benefit of workers and not for personal profit.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-13\">The part of that Act which is of particular concern to us in this case is Section 302(a) (1) and (4) and (b), 29 U.S.C. 186(a) (1) and (4) and 186(b). Subsection (a) proscribes payments by employers \u201cto any representative of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>of his employees * * * \u201d or to \u201cany officer * * * of a labor organization * * * with intent to influence him in respect to any of his actions, decisions, or duties as a representative.\u201d Subsection (b) imposes a parallel prohibition on those who might receive such funds, and makes it \u201cunlawful for any person to * * * receive, or accept * * * any payment, loan, or delivery of any money or other thing of value prohibited by section (a).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since (b) incorporates (a)\u2019s prohibitions, it forbids any employee representative to accept money from any employer or to accept any payment made with the intent to influence his behavior as a representative.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-6\">The 1959 amendments:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-7\">remove any doubt that all forms of bribery which might escape the provisions of [the then] existing law would be prohibited under pain of criminal penalties. * * * The intent of these amendments to sections 302(a) and (b) is to forbid any payment or bribe by an employer of anyone who acts in the interest of an employer whether technically an agent or not and to forbid the receipt of any such bribe by any person, whether an individual, an officer or employee of a labor organization or a committee representing employees. Payment to and receipt of such payments by any union officer or employee having the intent of influencing such officer or employee in respect to any of his actions, decisions, or duties as a representative of employees or as such union officer or employee would also be made a criminal offense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-16\">With these basic principles in mind, we can proceed to the case at hand. The appellant Louis Lanni, Sr., was convicted under amended \u00a7 302(b), 29 U. 5. C. \u00a7 186(b), for receiving and accepting $16,300, from D\u2019Agata National Trucking Company (D\u2019Agata Trucking) while he was Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters\u2019 Local No. 830 and while that local represented D\u2019Agata Trucking\u2019s employees. Both Lanni and appellant Mary Maiale were convicted of a separate count of conspiring to obtain and receive the money.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Lanni was sentenced to eight months imprisonment and put on probation for the year following his release. He was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>fined $5000. Maiale was fined $2500. and sentenced to one year probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">On this appeal three issues are presented for review: (1) did the court below err in construing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186 (b); (2) is that statute unconstitutionally vague, and (3) did the court err in refusing defendants\u2019 requested instructions on willfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">The facts leading to the appellants\u2019 convictions are admirably set forth in the thorough opinion of Judge Becker.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The appellants, who did not testify, do not challenge his findings and we see no reason to reiterate them in detail. Instead, we limit ourselves to recounting only the most critical facts and to setting forth the legitimate inferences which the jury could reasonably have drawn from them. United States v. Hamilton, 457 F.2d 95, 99 (3d Cir. 1972), United States v. Moraites, 456 F.2d 435 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">The evidence established that Mary Maiale received $16,300. from D\u2019Agata Trucking, ostensibly for her work as a bookkeeper.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Maiale was, however, a full time bookkeeper for the Health and Welfare Fund of Lanni\u2019s Local 830 and \u201cnever performed any bookkeeping * * * or any other services\u201d for D\u2019Agata Trucking.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At the time she was receiving these payments, Lanni had full knowledge that she was not performing any services in exchange for her \u201csalary.\u201d This is not surprising as Maiale was Lanni\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and shared a Miami Beach condominium apartment with him. The down payment check on that apartment was drawn on the account where Maiale deposited her \u201csalary\u201d checks. Nonetheless, Lanni openly referred to the apartment as \u201cmy place.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">The appellants \u201chad other business dealings and * * * in them Maiale was a \u2018straw man\u2019 for Lanni.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> When Lanni and two partners established' a truck leasing company, Lanni chose to place his interest in Maiale\u2019s name. Similarly, when Lanni contemplated entering the realty field, his plan called for Maiale\u2019s holding his interest, but in name only. Together, these transactions gave the jury reasonable ground to believe that \u201cwhat was nominally Maiale\u2019s was, in reality, Lanni\u2019s\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">Soon after Maiale was placed on the D\u2019Agata Trucking payroll, she and Lanni began making very frequent visits to Joe D\u2019Agata, an officer of the Trucking Company. Lanni took a strong interest in D\u2019Agata Trucking and began to refer to it as being partly his. The Lanni-D\u2019Agata ties were publicized enough for Joe D\u2019Agata to become known as \u201cLou Lanni\u2019s boy.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-13\">Lanni repaid D\u2019Agata\u2019s salary to Maiale by forcing local businesses to hire D\u2019Agata Trucking. C. Schmidt &amp; Sons breweries, for example, were told to switch to D\u2019Agata and they complied because they recalled how on a prior occasion, when they had refused to accede to Lanni\u2019s wishes, Lanni had exercised his power over their Teamster employees to shut down their plant. D\u2019Agata Trucking underwent a sudden growth, which continued until Lanni chose to destroy D\u2019Agata\u2019s business by forcing Schmidt and other companies to replace D\u2019Agata Trucking.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-4\">In his charge, Judge Becker told the jury that section 302 did not require that the government show Lanni had actually received the money D\u2019Agata had paid Maiale. In his view, Maiale\u2019s receiving money from D\u2019Agata as the \u201cagent, intermediary, go-between or front\u201d for Lanni would come within the ambit of 302(b) if all three parties contemplated that (1) Maiale would receive the money and \u201clike a conduit\u201d transmit it to Lanni; or that (2) she would receive the money on his \u201cbehalf\u201d and hold it \u201cfor his use.\u201d <footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">The appellants now argue, as they did in the district court, that this instruction was erroneous. They claim that \u00a7 302 does not reach a situation where the labor representative merely benefits from a payment made by management. According to them, the government\u2019s burden under 302(b) was to demonstrate that Lanni had actually received the money, i. e. that he had the money \u201cin his hands.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-14\">The appellants concede, as they must, that had Lanni received the $16,300. directly from D\u2019Agata Trucking, he would have been in violation of \u00a7 302(b) and would have been subject to criminal penalties for his corrupt conduct. Seen in proper perspective, Lanni and Maiale are really arguing that it was lawful for Lanni to circumvent the blanket prohibition of 302(b) by using his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d as his \u201cagent, intermediary, go-between or front.\u201d They contend, in effect, that Maiale\u2019s initial receipt of the D\u2019Agata money shielded it from the taint which would have attached had Lanni received it directly, and that the money remained untainted (1) even though Lanni knew Maiale was receiving it without performing any services for D\u2019Agata and (2) in the face of evidence establishing that Lanni did D\u2019Agata favors such as procuring the Schmidt contract, in ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>change for the payments to his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d Maiale. In the appellants\u2019 view, once the money was filtered through Maiale, Lanni was thereafter free to benefit from the money she was holding for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">The appellants contend that drawing a distinction under \u00a7 302(b) between direct and indirect payments produces a viable interpretation of that provision even though the companion section 302(a) concededly makes no such distinction. Under their analysis an employer would be prohibited from using a middleman to transmit a bribe, but an employee representative would not be barred from so acting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">In support of this interpretation, the appellants rely upon the differences between the wording of subsections (a) and (b). Subsection (a) prohibits payment to an employee representative \u201cby an employer * * * or any person who acts * * * in the interest of the employer.\u201d Subsection (b) prohibits \u201cany person\u201d from receiving \u201cany [subsection (a)] payment\u201d but does so without specifically prohibiting the receipt of payment by someone \u201cwho acts * * * in the interest of\u201d the employee representative. The appellants argue that the omission from subsection (b) of the phrase used in subsection (a) indicates that Congress did not intend to prescribe payments made to representatives through an \u201cagent, intermediary, go-between or front.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">Appellants\u2019 thesis is devoid of merit. Their end-run tactics might be suitable on a football field, but they are not persuasive in a court of law. Our purpose is to interpret a statute so that it fulfills the legislature\u2019s purpose and not to construe it, as the appellants would have us do, to subvert the legislative intent. As the Supreme Court said in United States v. Shirey, 359 U.S. 255, 260-261, 79 S.Ct. 746, 749, 3 L.Ed.2d 789 (1959), where the appellants were also attempting to finesse a bribery statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-8\">Statutes, including penal enactments, are not inert exercises in literary composition. They are instruments of government, and in construing them \u201cthe general purpose is a more important aid to the meaning than any rule which grammar or formal logic may lay down.\u201d United States v. Whitridge, 197 U.S. 135, 143 [25 S.Ct. 406, 408, 49 L.Ed. 696]. This is so because the purpose of an enactment is embedded in its words even though it is not always pedantically expressed in words. See United States v. Wurzbach, 280 U.S. 396, 399 [50 S.Ct. 167, 168, 74 L.Ed. 508.] Statutory meaning, it is to be remembered, is more to be felt than demonstrated, see United States v. Johnson, 221 U.S. 488, 496 [31 S.Ct. 627, 55 L.Ed. 823], or, as Judge Learned Hand has put it, the art of interpretation is \u201cthe art of proliferating a purpose.\u201d Brooklyn Nat. Corp. v. Comm\u2019r, 2 Cir., 157 F.2d 450, 451.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-14\">In the case before us the statutory purpose is clear: The stamping out of \u201call forms of bribery\u201d between management and labor officials.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Furthermore, the broad and unequivocal language of \u00a7 302 clearly reaches the conduct for which appellants were convicted. Read together subsections (a) and (b) express an intention to forbid indirect union official-management bribery, be it through the middleman of the officials or of management.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-15\">The original subsection (a) of the Taft Hartley Act forbid employers from giving any money to a representative of his employees, whereas (b) prohibited the representative from receiving any such payments. Both provisions were revised and expanded in 1959, so that (a) now also reaches payments made to an employee representative by an agent of the employer. Subsection (b), as it now reads, makes it \u201cunlawful for any person to receive or accept * * * any payment * * * prohibited by subsection (a).\u201d Appellant argues that \u201cany payment\u201d really means only \u201cdirect payment,\u201d but we reject this interpretation. \u201c[A]ny payment\u201d is clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>sweeping in its scope and embraces both direct and indirect payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">This construction of \u00a7 302 is required by the basic principles set forth in Arroyo v. United States, 359 U.S. 419, 424, 79 S.Ct. 864, 867, 3 L.Ed.2d 915 (1959):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-6\">\u2018[T] hough penal laws are to be construed strictly, they are not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature.\u2019 United States v. Wiltberger, supra [5 Wheat. [76]] at [page] 95 [5 L.Ed. 37]. As Mr. Justice Holmes put it, \u2018We agree to all the generalities about not supplying criminal laws with what they omit, but there is no canon against using common sense in construing laws as saying what they obviously mean.\u2019 Roschen v. Ward, 279 U.S. 337, 339 [49 S.Ct. 336, 73 L.Ed. 722],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">The other Circuits which have interpreted section 302 support our conclusion that it embraces indirect payments. In Brennan v. United States, 240 F.2d 253 (1957) cert. den. 353 U.S. 931, 77 S.Ct. 718, 1 L.Ed.2d 723 (1957), the Eighth Circuit upheld the convictions of union officials who had not received any direct payments from the employer. Instead, a cheek had been sent to a third party, the son of one of the officials, and it had been made out to a nonexistent corporation as the payee. The third party deposited the check to his father and two other officials, retaining some of the money for himself. Korholz v. United States, 269 F.2d 897 (10th Cir. 1959), cert. den. 361 U.S. 929, 80 S.Ct. 367, 4 L.Ed.2d 352 (1960) is to the same effect. The employer in that case discharged the loan owed by an employee representative by making bank payments on his behalf. The court upheld the conviction which arose out of this indirect payment, noting that the use of the third party did not permit the defendants to circumvent the statute.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The most recent case on indirect payments is United States v. McMaster, 343 F.2d 176 (6th Cir. 1965). The union official was president and controlling stockholder of a trucking company which received funds from the employer of employees he represented. The employer in that case had made payments not directly to his employees\u2019 representative, but rather had sent these checks to a corporation controlled by the representative. Holding that by virtue of the representative\u2019s \u201csubstantial access\u201d to the corporate funds, receipt by the corporation constituted a violation of \u00a7 302, the court affirmed the representative\u2019s conviction. We find no reason to depart from the rationale of <em>Brennan, Korholz </em>and <em>McMaster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-11\">As a connected second argument, the appellants claim that section 302 as construed by the district court was unconstitutionally vague. We disagree. The test for vagueness, which has recently been reiterated in Palmer v. City of Euclid, 402 U.S. 544, 545, 91 S.Ct. 1563, 29 L.Ed.2d 98 (1971), was set forth in United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617-618, 74 S.Ct. 808, 812, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-12\">The constitutional requirement of definiteness is violated by a criminal statute that fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute. The underlying principle is that no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-13\">Applying the <em>Harriss </em>test to the facts of this case, we find no constitutional vagueness. The statute\u2019s broad prohibition of \u201call payments\u201d gave the appellants fair notice that indirect payments were included.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">When he came to the question of \u201cwillfulness,\u201d the trial judge charged the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-5\">Now, an act is done \u201cwillfully\u201d if done voluntarily and intentionally, and with the specific intent to do something the law forbids; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or to disregard the law. Intent to disregard the law, that\u2019s willfulness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">I\u2019ll repeat it: An act is done willfully if done voluntarily and intentionally, and with the specific intent to do something the law forbids; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or to disregard the law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The appellants contend that these instructions were inadequate and claim that it was reversible error for the judge to refuse to give their requested instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-7\">18. Before you may return a verdict of guilty against either defendant, you must find that he or she acted willfully. This means that either intentionally and deliberately violated the law. In reaching your conclusion, you may consider the wording of the statute under which defendants are charged and, if it does not clearly make unlawful the conduct of these defendants, or either of them you should find that neither defendant acted willfully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHn\">29. The word \u2018willfully,\u2019 as used in the statute, requires proof not only that the defendants actually did violate the provisions of the law but, further, that they were conscious of the fact that what they were doing constituted a violation of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-9\"> Requested instruction No. 18 invited the jury to make its own interpretation of Section 302. However, it is fundamental that the construction of a statute is within the province of a judge. The requested charge, which would have cast the jury in the role of the judge, was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">Similarly, requested instruction No. 29 does not conform with the law. Section 302 is, in the language of the Supreme Court, <em>\u201cmalum prohibitum.\u201d </em>United States v. Ryan, supra, 350 U.S. p. 305, 76 S.Ct. 400. Consequently, all that had to be shown in order to establish that it was \u201cwillfully\u201d violated is that Lanni benefited from the money paid to Maiale with knowledge (1) that they were \u201cpayments\u201d and (2) that D\u2019Agata employed workers represented by Lanni. United States v. Ricciardi, 357 F.2d 91, 100 (2nd Cir. 1966), cert. den. 384 U.S. 942, 86 S.Ct. 1464, 16 L.Ed.2d 540 (1966); United States v. Alaimo, 191 F.Supp. 625, 627 (M.D.Pa. 1961), aff\u2019d 297 F.2d 604 (3d Cir. 1961) cert. den. 396 U.S. 817, 82 S.Ct. 829, 7 L.Ed.2d 784 (1962). See United States v. Budzanoski, 462 F.2d 443 (3d Cir. 1972); Cf. Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-11\">In his charge, Judge Becker told the jury that an act is done willfully when it is done \u201cwith bad purpose * * * to disregard the law.\u201d We agree with the judge that this instruction was \u201cmore favorable to defendants than that to which they were entitled.\u201d United States v. Lanni, 335 F.Supp. p. 1079. \u201cBad purpose\u201d need not be shown.

And you may, if all other requisites of proof under the Act as I will define them to you have been met, you can make a finding of guilt. If you find based on all the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Lanni actually received or accepted in his possession the sums paid by D\u2019Agata to Maiale, then that aspect of the Act is met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-11\">However, I also instruct you that the requirements of Section 186 of the Labor-Management Relations Act concerning acceptance and receipt by an employee representative or officer of a labor organization are also met, if, based upon the evidence in the case, you find beyond a reasonable doubt that money paid by an employer is received or accepted by someone who is the agent, intermediary, go-between or front for the employee representative or officer of a labor organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-15\">Now, in order, however, for one to be an agent, intermediary, go-between or front, it is essential [1] that the parties to the transaction contemplate that the agent, intermediary, go-between or front is to receive the payments on behalf of the employee representative or labor union officer; with the further contemplation that the monies be available to or transmitted like a conduit to the employee representative or labor union officer; or that [2] the parties contemplate that the money be received and held for his use.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1179-16\">. This argument was put forth by the appellants at the trial level, as well. 355 F. Supp. 1060, 1067. In the district court, the government argued that no receipt by Lanni or benefit to him was necessary for a \u00a7 302 conviction. If Lanni had directed or suggested that D\u2019Agata pay Maiale, that would be sufficient, in the government\u2019s view.
