The Taxpayers had paid the first half of the real estate taxes for the 1969 fiscal year on September 30, 1968, but they did not pay the second half until March 26, 1969. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>3 On June 19, 1969, the District of Columbia Tax Court denied the District of Columbia\u2019s motion to dismiss. Subsequently, the District filed its answer to the Taxpayers\u2019 petition, and, on October 10, 1969, Taxpayers filed a \u201cMotion for Leave to Amend Petition,\u201d so that they could request that the Tax Court\u2019s decision be applied to 1970 and subsequent years until a reappraisal of the relevant properties by the District of Columbia was effectuated. The Tax Court deferred its ruling on Taxpayers\u2019 amendment motion, and the case was heard on the merits on October 20, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">As the Tax Court stated in its decision, counsel for the Taxpayers and counsel for the District of Columbia stipulated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">* * * Mr. F. E. Diamond, a qualified fee appraiser in the District of Columbia, personally present at the hearing, would testify that in his expert opinion the appraised value of the Towne Towers Apartments for purposes of D. C. real estate tax for fiscal year 1969 is $1,173,250 and of the Aristocrat Apartments is $884,000, rather than, respectively, $1,280,581 and $1,029,944 at which figures said properties were assessed. * * * [Joint Appendix at 114]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">The District of Columbia presented no evidence and elected to stand on its \u201cMotion to Dismiss,\u201d which was based upon the alleged lack of jurisdiction of the District of Columbia Tax Court to determine the case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">On January 13, 1970, the Tax Court handed down its decision in which it said:</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">1. Petitioners\u2019 [Taxpayers\u2019] motion for leave to amend be, and hereby is, <em>denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-17\">2. Respondent\u2019s [District of Columbia\u2019s] motion to dismiss, re-presented at the hearing herein, be and hereby is <em>denied. </em>The Ruling and Order on Motion to Dismiss issued June 19, 1969 is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-18\">3. Petitioners shall have and recover from the District of Columbia the sum of $7,598.25 plus statutory interest, on account of excess taxes paid on the properties more fully described in the petition herein, for the fiscal year 1969. [Joint appendix at 115]</p>\n<p id=\"b441-19\">Thereafter, the District filed a petition for review by this court of the District of Columbia Tax Court decision, and Taxpayers filed a cross-petition for review of the same decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-20\">On March 26, 1970, we granted the motion of Taxpayers to consolidate the cross appeal and appeal. Subsequently, on April 24, 1970, the District filed a combined motion for summary reversal in Docket Number 23,997 and for summary affirmance in Docket Number 24,-003. On May 4, 1970, Taxpayers filed their combined motion for summary affirmance in Docket Number 23,997 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>for summary reversal in Docket Number 24,003. We denied these motions on July 31, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">We now hold that the District of Columbia Tax Court was without jurisdiction to decide this case, due to the fact that Taxpayers had not paid <em>all </em>of the taxes assessed for the 1969 fiscal year, on the properties in question, prior to the time they filed their petition with the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Before reaching the merits of the jurisdictional issue raised by the District of Columbia\u2019s appeal, we wish to point out a codification error appearing in D.C.Code \u00a7 47-2405 (1967), which was discussed by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">D.C.Code Section 47-2405 (1967) provided <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">\u00a7 47-2405.

The Codifier\u2019s notes explain the basis for section 47-2405\u2019s compilation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqSg\">The five paragraphs of this section comprise, respectively, the last sentences of subsecs, (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of section 5 of the act Aug. 17, 1939, title IX. Such section 5 is classified in its entirety as follows: subsection (a) to sections 47-708 and 47-709; subsection (b) to section 47-710; subsection (c) to section 47-711; subsection (d) to section 47-712, and subsection (e) to section 47-716.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">When section 5 of the Act of August 17, 1939, Title IX, 52 Stat. 372, which was an amendment to the District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 673, is compared with the codification in sections 47-709, 47-710, 47-711, 47-712, 47-716, and 47-2405 in the D.C.Code (1967), it is readily apparent that an error was made in the codification of section 47-2405. The last sentences of subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of section 5, Title IX, 52 Stat. 372-374, all refer to \u201csections 3 and 4\u201d of the Act of August 17, 1939, Title IX, 52 Stat. 371-372. \u201cSections 3 and 4\u201d were codified in the D.C.Code (1967) as sections 47-2403 and 47-2404, respectively, and are properly cross-referenced in D.C. Code sections 47-709, 47-710, 47-711, 47-712, and 47-716. However, the first three paragraphs of D.C.Code section 47-2405,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which correspond to portions of sections 5(a) [\u00a7 47-709], 5(b) [\u00a7 47-710], and 5(c) [\u00a7 47-711], respectively, instead of properly referring to section 47-2403 [i. <em>e., </em>section 3, 52 Stat. 371], are erroneously cross-referenced to section 47-2413, which is the codification of section 14, which was added to the District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1937, in 1952. 66 Stat. 546. Under such circumstances, the statute, as enacted by Congress, is controlling and the erroneous references in D.C.Code \u00a7 47-2405 to \u00a7 47-2413 are supplanted by the correct references found in the Statutes at Large (52 Stat. 372-374).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">1 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(b) (1970) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-12\">In all courts, tribunals, and public offices of the United States, at home or abroad, of the District of Columbia, and of each State, Territory, or insular possession of the United States\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-14\">[b] The matter set forth in the edition of the Code of the District of Columbia current at any time shall, together with the then current supplement, if any, <em>establish prima facie </em>the laws, general and permanent in their nature, relating to or in force in the District of Columbia . . .

Therefore, the erroneous cross-references in D.C. Code section 47-2405 to section 47-2413, instead of to section 47-2403, must be supplanted by references to section 47-2403, in order to conform them to the statute enacted as section 5 of the District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1937, as amended, as set out in the Statutes at Large [52 Stat. 372-374]. This is because section 3 of the same Act is codified as section 47-2403 of the D.C.Code, and not section 47-2413.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">\u201cAssessments of real estate in the District of Columbia for purposes of taxation shall be made <em>annually . . </em>. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">D.C.Code \u00a7 47-702 (1967) (emphasis supplied).

However, they did not pay the second half of the challenged taxes until March 26, 1969. The District of Columbia contends that the requirement of D.C.Code section 47-2403 (1967) that a taxpayer \u201cshall first pay such tax\u201d before appeal may be taken, required the payment of <em>all </em>of the tax based on the questioned assessment for the <em>entire tax year </em>in issue before the Tax Court could acquire jurisdiction. Taxpayers, on the other hand, maintain that D.C.Code \u00a7 47-1209 (1967),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which permits payments of real estate taxes in equal semi-annual installments in September and March, must be read in conjunction with section 47-2403 to have required only the prepayment of such tax as was <em>due </em>at the time the appeal was filed, as a prerequisite to the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">It is well established by our prior decisions that the prepayment requirement of section 47-2403 is jurisdictional. <em>See </em>District of Columbia v. McFall, 88 U.S. App.D.C. 217, 188 F.2d 991 (1951); Industrial Bank of Washington v. District of Columbia, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 233, 188 F.2d 46 (1951). In <em>Industrial Bank of Washington, </em>we held that where the second half of the tax in question had not been paid before the appeal was taken, the Tax Court was without jurisdiction concerning the second half. The question of whether the Tax Court had properly accepted jurisdiction in respect to the first half of the tax under such circumstances, was expressly not decided. <em>See </em>88 U.S.App.D.C. at 234, 188 F.2d at 47. We now hold that the failure of Taxpayers to pay <em>all </em>of the challenged taxes levied for the <em>entire </em>fiscal year in question, prior to the time their appeal was filed, deprived the Tax Court of jurisdiction over any and all of the taxes in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Under the applicable provisions of the D.C.Code, real estate assessments are calculated, and real estate taxes are levied, on an <em>annual </em>basis. <em>See </em>D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 47-501, 47-702, 47-708, and 47-709. They are not determined semi-annually. When the appropriate real estate tax has been calculated, section 47-1001a requires <em>annual </em>\u201cnotice of the amount of <em>such real estate tax\u201d </em>as has been \u201clevied\u201d to be sent to the taxpayer. The entire tax to be paid during the year is levied as a single sum. D.C. Form F.P.-176A (Rev. 3-68), which was sent to Taxpayers pursuant to section 47-1001a, expressly indicated that the bill covered the <em>entire tax year. </em>Although it indicated that, pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 47-1209 (1967), the tax obligation was payable in two equal installments, the first half by September 30, 1968, and the second half by March 31, 1969, this did not detract from the clear implication, expressed in the relevant statutory provisions, that the tax debt established by the levy covered the entire 1969 fiscal year. The \u201csuch tax\u201d which section 47-2403 required to be paid before a taxpayer could protest the \u201cassessment . . . against him\u201d referred to the tax covered by the assessment. That was the total tax for the entire fiscal year because that was the only way any real estate tax was levied, <em>i. e., </em>\u201clevied for [the] fiscal year.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Also, the rate of taxation was an annual rate, <em>i. e., </em>required to be fixed \u201cannually.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The delinquency dates provided by section 47-1209 did not in any way affect the amount of tax that was to be paid. Section 47-1209 merely established optional grace periods which a taxpayer could utilize without incurring any delinquent liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">While there is no legislative history concerning the prepayment provision in D.C.Code \u00a7 47-2403 (1967),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it is quite apparent that the language of section 47-1001a referring to <em>\u201csuch real estate tax\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>to clearly cover the entire fiscal year\u2019s tax obligation, corresponds to the pertinent language contained in section 47-2403 (1967) requiring that a taxpayer \u201cfirst pay <em>such tax\" </em>before an appeal thereunder could be filed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It necessarily follows that this jurisdictional requirement of section 47-2403 (1967) required the prepayment of the <em>entire </em>fiscal year\u2019s challenged tax, before an appeal involving the underlying assessment could properly be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Other relevant revenue provisions of the D.C.Code support our interpretation. While section 47-2407 authorizes the Tax Court (now the Superior Court) to order the refund by the District of Columbia of any sum found to have been erroneously paid by the appealing taxpayer, section 47-2410 provides that \u201cNo suit shall be filed to enjoin the assessment or collection by the District of Columbia or any of its officers, agents, or employees of any tax.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> An action to cancel the tax assessed against certain real estate is, in actuality, one effectively seeking the enjoining of the assessment or collection of the tax in contravention of section 47-2410\u2019s prohibition. If a taxpayer were permitted to appeal his tax assessment before paying <em>all </em>of the tax levied for the entire year, any decision concerning the unpaid portion would intuitively involve the cancellation of the determined over-assessment with respect to that portion. Any other result would clearly promote multiple litigation concerning each part of the challenged tax as it was paid.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Such multifarious litigation involving a non-economical utilization of judicial time could not have been reasonably intended by Congress.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">Court decisions involving closely related tax areas also support the decision we have reached. In Suhr v. United States, 18 F.2d 81 (3rd Cir. 1927), the court was called upon to determine whether a taxpayer could seek the refund of income tax payments claimed to have been erroneously paid, before payment of the entire amount of tax due for the tax year in question had been made. In finding that the taxpayer\u2019s action had been prematurely prosecuted, the Third Circuit Court concluded that \u201c[t]he payment of a part does not confer jurisdiction upon the courts. . . . There is no provision for refund to the taxpayer of any excess payment of any installment or part of his tax, if the whole tax for the year has not been paid.\u201d 18 F.2d at 83. A similar result was obtained in Flora v. United States, 357 U.S. 63, 78 S.Ct. 1079, 2 L.Ed.2d 1165 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>(1958), affd on rehg., 362 U.S. 145, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed.2d 623 (1960), wherein the Supreme Court held that a taxpayer must pay the full amount of an assessed income tax deficiency before he may challenge its correctness in a refund suit. <em>See also </em>Cheatham v. United States, 92 U.S. 85, 88-89, 23 L.Ed. 561 (1876). As was determined in these analogous decisions, since Taxpayers failed to pay <em>all of </em>the challenged taxes owed for the 1969 fiscal year, prior to the time they filed their appeal, the District of Columbia Tax Court was wholly without jurisdiction over any of the appeal. It therefore should have dismissed the entire action for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">A final point should be noted, concerning Taxpayers\u2019 contention that our interpretation of section 47-2403 (1967) effectively deprives them of the right of appeal, in violation of the Constitution\u2019s Due Process Clause. Before Taxpayers elected to invoke the appeal procedure provided for in sections 47-709, 47-2405, and 47-2403, they could have chosen to utilize the common law remedies which were expressly available under D.C.Code \u00a7 47-2413(c) (1967).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, once they elected to file an appeal pursuant to sections 47-709, 47-2405, and 47-2403, they apparently lost their right to invoke the otherwise available common law remedies. <em>See </em>D.C. Code \u00a7 47-2413(c) (1967). <em>See also </em>District of Columbia v. Brady, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 324, 288 F.2d 108 (1960). While the Taxpayers may now be without a remedy, it is due to their own failure to comply with the jurisdictional requirements of section 47-2403 (1967), and <em>not </em>due to any deprivation occasioned by the statutory scheme itself.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the prepayment requirement of D.C. Code \u00a7 47-2403 (1967) visited any undue hardship upon Taxpayers. <em>See </em>Flora v. United States, <em>supra, </em>362 U.S. at 175, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed.2d 623. As we noted in District of Columbia v. McFall, <em>supra, </em>88 U.S.App.D.C. at 219, 188 F.2d at 993, \u201c[ajlthough the provision appears to be harsh, we do not see how we can avoid giving it effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The decision of the District of Columbia Tax Court is reversed, and the ease is remanded to the Tax Court with instructions for it to dismiss the petition for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-13\">.
