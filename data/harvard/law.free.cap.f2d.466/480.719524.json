The Board of Education did not renew his contract for the ensuing school year and Crabtree filed this action under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985(3), alleging that the non-renewal of his contract was in furtherance of an unlawful conspiracy between school officials and others to deprive him of his livelihood and to force him and his family to leave the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">District Judge Joseph P. Kinneary granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that the facts alleged in the verified complaint gave rise to no federal cause of action. Crab-tree appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\"> Official conduct under color of law is actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 only where plaintiff is thereby subjected to \u201cthe deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution.\u201d The Constitution confers no right to be employed as a secondary school teacher by a particular school system. <em>See </em>Board of Regents of State. Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (June 29, 1972); Orr v. Trinter, 444 F.2d 128 (6th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 408 U.S. 943, 92 S.Ct. 2847, 33 L.Ed.2d 767 (June 29, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Turning next to liability predicated on allegations of conspiracy, we note that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) is limited by its terms to the redress of damages inflicted by conspiracies whose purpose is \u201cdepriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws.\u201d It was not \u201cintended to apply to all tortious conspiratorial interferences with the rights of others . . . [Tjhere must be some racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators\u2019 action. Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 101-102, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 1798, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Grounds for relief under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 have not been shown. Accordingly, the decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
