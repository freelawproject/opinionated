His allegations in substance were that defendant, an attorney whom plaintiff had retained, failed to render him reasonable assistance during a state criminal trial, to plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-23\">But this Circuit, in common with others, has held that such a claim is not within the purview of the Civil Rights Act, the reason being that an attorney, whether retained or appointed, does not act \u201cunder color of\u201d state law. Hence, the claim is not one coming within the jurisdiction of the district court. Dyer v. Rosenberg, 434 F.2d 648 (9th Cir. 1970); Fletcher v. Hook, 446. F.2d 14 (3rd Cir. 1971); Mulligan v. Schlachter, 389 F.2d 231 (6th Cir. 1968); and see French v. Corrigan, 432 F.2d 1211 (7th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
