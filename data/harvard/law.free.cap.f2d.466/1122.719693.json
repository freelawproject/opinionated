M\u2019Clary, a California state prisoner, seeks release from penal custody on the ground that respondent California Adult Authority (Authority) revoked his parole in proceedings which denied him his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, M\u2019Clary urges that the Authority: (1) acted upon the basis of false and insubstantial information; and (2) denied him the right to be represented by retained counsel and to present and confront witnesses at the revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-9\">M\u2019Clary was convicted of armed robbery on September 25, 1958, and was sentenced to state prison for the term prescribed by law (five years to life). The Authority paroled M\u2019Clary on September 19, 1966. On June 21, 1968, acting upon recommendations of its Parole and Community Services Division, the Authority cancelled M\u2019Clary\u2019s parole and ordered him returned to state prison. The Authority further ordered that M\u2019Clary\u2019s term be refixed at the maximum until further order of the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-10\">On August 16, 1968, a hearing was held at which M\u2019Clary\u2019s parole was revoked. He had previously been notified of the charges against him, and his privately retained counsel had available to him copies of the parole agent\u2019s report and other documents to support the charges. M\u2019Clary was present at the hearing and was offered the opportunity to submit evidence at the hearing. His counsel was not permitted to be present, nor was he permitted to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-12\">The charges which led to the revocation of parole were that: (1) on February 28, 1968, M\u2019Clary, who had been drinking, had gone \u201cberserk\u201d and had threatened his girl friend, Mrs. Leilani Anderson, (2) on April 21, 1968, he had kicked in the door of Mrs. Anderson\u2019s home, and (3) on May 11, 1968, M\u2019Clary had threatened Mrs. Anderson and her children. With regard to the first two of these charges the revocation was supported by admissions made by M\u2019Clary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-13\">The third charge was supported primarily by a handwritten statement by Mrs. Anderson. In subsequent state habeas corpus proceedings, Mrs. Anderson gave testimony tending to undermine the allegations in her previous handwritten statement. She said she wrote the statement from an outline prepared by a parole agent, that it contained \u201ca lot of exaggeration,\u201d was \u201cpretty hysterical,\u201d and that she had lied in stating that M\u2019Clary threatened her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-14\">The district court denied the petition for habeas corpus now before us on January 25, 1972, for the reasons stated at length in an opinion reported in M\u2019Clary v. Department of Corrections (N.D.Cal. 1972). The district court opinion correctly states the law applicable in this circuit as established at the time that opinion was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-15\">Thereafter, in Dennis v. California Adult Authority, 456 F.2d 1240 (9th Cir. 1972), this court held that, in parole revocation proceedings due process requires, at the least, that the parolee be given, first, notice of the grounds asserted as a basis for revocation, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>second, an opportunity to deny the factual contentions on which revocation would rest and to be heard in support of his own factual contentions. As noted above, petitioner was accorded these rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">But <em>Dennis, </em>and the later decision of this court in Wilburn v. Nelson, 458 F.2d 502 (9th Cir. 1972), also announced a broad principle the application of which may, in individual cases, require more procedural safeguards for a parolee in revocation proceedings than the minimal safeguards referred to above. Said the court, in <em>Dennis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-5\">\u201cIt remains to be determined in each case whether the procedures followed by the Adult Authority were reasonably and fairly designed to enable it to ascertain whether issues existed concerning the asserted violation and to make an informed decision upon such issues.\u201d 456 F.2d, at 1241.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\"> Under this principle it is possible that, under the circumstances of a particular case, a parolee might be entitled to the additional procedural safeguard M\u2019Clary here urges, namely the right to confront the witnesses against him. In <em>Wilburn </em>we stated the same principle with reference to the contention that the Adult Authority had failed to provide the parolee with assistance of counsel at his parole revocation hearing. <em>See also, </em>Griffin v. California Adult Authority, 464 F.2d 602 (9th Cir. 1972); Mays v. Nelson, 464 F.2d 585 (9th Cir. 1972). The burden is upon the parolee to allege facts demonstrating that the failure to provide a particular procedural safeguard was, under the circumstances of the case, an essential element of due process. <em>See Wilburn, supra; Dennis, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-9\">While the district court\u2019s scholarly opinion of January 25, 1972 thoroughly reviewed and correctly analyzed the law of this circuit as it existed on that date, that court has had no opportunity to evaluate petitioner\u2019s contention in the light of our more recent <em>Dennis </em>and <em>Wilburn </em>decisions. Since we regard those decisions as applicable to any proceeding pending in this court on or after January 25, 1972, we think it would be appropriate appellate procedure to afford the district court the first opportunity to consider M\u2019Clary\u2019s petition in the light of <em>Dennis </em>and <em>Wilburn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-10\">It may be added that in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), the Supreme Court has announced principles pertaining to parole revocation proceedings, other than the right to counsel, which were not complied with in the August 16, 1968 parole revocation proceeding here in question.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In our view, however, <em>Morrissey </em>is not to be applied retroactively. The Supreme Court there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-11\">\u201cThe few basic requirements set out above, <em>which are applicable to future revocations of parole, </em>should not impose a great burden on any State\u2019s parole system.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-12\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">. In <em>Morrissey, </em>the Supreme Court expressly reserved the question of whether a parolee is entitled to the assistance of counsel in revocation jiroceedings. The right to the assistance of counsel in probation revocation proceedings is now before the Supreme Court in a case in which certiorari lias been granted. Scarpelli v. Gagnon, 454 F.2d 416 (7th Cir. 1971), cert. granted 408 U.S. 921, 92 S.Ct. 2490, 33 L.Ed.2d 33,1 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
