FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF OMAHA, Omaha, Nebraska, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b583-6\">Nos. 72-1213, 72-1214.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b583-7\">United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b583-8\">Submitted July 25, 1972.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b583-9\">Decided Sept. 5, 1972.</decisiondate>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b583-10\">Rehearing Denied Oct. 16, 1972.</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-18\">Everett Meeker, Livingston, Day, Kehoe, Meeker &amp; Bates, Washington, Iowa, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-19\">William E.

The District Court found the venue improper and transferred both actions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) to the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska. Fischer v. First National Bank of Omaha, 338 F. Supp. 525, 531 (S.D.Iowa 1972). The instant consolidated appeal seeks review of the transfer orders. This Court <em>sm sponte </em>has examined the question of whether we have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-23\">The order sought to be reviewed here is a transfer order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An order by a District Court transferring an action to another district is an interlocutory order and is nonappealable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Stelly v. Employers National Insurance Co., 431 F.2d 1251, 1253 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>U.S. 908, 91 S.Ct. 866, 27 L.Ed.2d 806 (1971); Pacific Car and Foundry Co. v. Pence, 403 F.2d 949, 951 &amp; n.5 (9th Cir. 1968); 9 J. Moore, Federal Practice fj 110.13[6], at 173 (2nd ed. 1970). Therefore, we hold that the order in the instant case, being interlocutory, is nonappealable at this time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AYt\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-15\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-16\">\u201c(a) The district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such ease to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b583-17\">. The Ninth Circuit has speculated that perhaps the rule announced in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 545-547, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), might cast doubt on the rule against appealability of \u00a7 1406(a) orders. Pacific Car and Foundry Co. v. Pence, 403 F.2d 949, 952 n. 8 (9th Cir. 1969). See also, 9 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 110.13 [6], at 174 (2nd ed. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-25\">The rule among the Court of Appeals, however, remains that a \u00a7 1406(a) order is not a final decision reviewable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. There is one case in which the Third Circuit allowed \u00a7 1291 review for a denial of a transfer order, United States v. Berkowitz, 328 F.2d 358, 360 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 821, 85 S.Ct. 42, 13 L.Ed.2d 32 (1964), but that case can be considered unique on its facts in that the denial of the transfer order effectively terminated the civil law suit since the defendant codld not be properly served in the district where the suit was instituted and the defendant could assert the statute of limitations as a defense to a new suit elsewhere.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-12\">. No attempt has been made to bring this interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
