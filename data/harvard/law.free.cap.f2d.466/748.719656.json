The National Labor Relations Board has filed a cross-petition seeking enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">For some years, the employees of Cascade\u2019s Springfield, Ohio, plant were represented by an independnt local, Employee\u2019s Independent Union of Cascade Corporation. On September 25,1969, the independent local served notice that it did not intend to review the existing contract which had been negotiated in 1966 and was due to expire December 1, 1969. Bargaining ensued. Apparently there was little progress. On December 1, 1969, the intervenor, UAW, submitted a written demand that it and not the independent be recognized as bargaining agent for the unit. The company did not respond. On December 18, 1969, the UAW petitioned the Board for certification. Cascade and the two unions agreed to a consent election to determine whether Cascade\u2019s Springfield employees would be represented by the UAW, by the Employee\u2019s Independent Union or by no union at all. On December 16, 1969, the Acting Regional Director approved a \u201cStipulation for Certification Upon Consent Election\u201d which formally provided for the conduct of the election. The elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>tion was held on December 31,1969. 247 of 250 eligible ballots were cast. Of these 131 voted for the UAW and 116 for the independent local. On January 8, 1970, the company filed objections to union conduct which allegedly affected the outcome of the election. Pursuant to Board Rules and Regulations [29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(c)] the Regional Director conducted an investigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Of the three matters investigated by the Regional Director Cascade relies here on only one\u2014 the alleged \u201csubstantial and material misrepresentation of facts\u201d \u2014 in asserting the invalidity of the certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The company grounds this objection on two circulars, one distributed by UAW on December 29 and the other on December 31. The first purported to compare the provisions of the expired contract with those of contracts negotiated by the UAW at other comparable area plants. The company before the Regional Director pointed to certain factual errors, and material omissions in the comparison. The union replied that the circular was prepared in response to a letter distributed by the employer on December 26 and that it represented the most accurate comparison that could be developed in the limited period available.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The second circular (the only one in our view raising a substantial issue) was distributed on the eve and morning of the election. It read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-6\">MESSAGE FROM PORTLAND, OREGON:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">Larry Vance, Secretary-Treasurer of Teamster Autotive Csic.D Local 255 reports the following.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-8\">After many years of Independent Union representation employees In Portland, Oregon voted to affiliate with an International Union.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-9\">The following Is a sample of negotiated rates of pay for certain classifications In the Portland plant: Labor Grade 2 \u2014 Tool Maker ....$3.85 to $4.60 Experimental Mechanic Maintenance Mechanic A which includes such classifications as electrician, etc.......3.50 to 4.25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-13\">Labor Grade 4 \u2014 Assembler <em>A ... . </em>3.45 to 4.10 Automatic Lathe Operator A</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-14\">Labor Grade 5 \u2014 Burner . .\u201e..... 3.25 to 4.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-15\">Labor Grade 6</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-16\">Grinder-Storekeeper ........... 3.15 to 3.75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-17\">Labor Grade 7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-18\">Post Drill Operator ........... 2.95 to 3.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-19\">Labor Grade 8</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-20\">Lift Truck Operator ........... 2.90 to 3.40</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-21\">Labor Grade 9</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-22\">Maintenance Helper ........... 2.70 to 3.20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-23\">Labor Grade 10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-24\">Janitor ...................... 2.50 to 3.05</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-25\">Effective 8-1-70 fifteen (15i0 cents will be added to the minimum and maximum of each of the classifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-26\">Effective 8-1-71 fifteen (15(9 cents will be added to the minimum and maximum of each of the classifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-27\">An example Is a tool maker who would make $4.90 per hour while the janitor would make $3.35 per hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-28\">Teamsters Automotive Local 255 extends fraternal greetings and urges your sincere consideration in joining the mainstream of the American labor movement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-29\">LARRY VANCE SECRETARY-TREASURER TEAMSTERS AUTOMOTIVE LOCAL 255 12/31/69\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-30\">Cascade\u2019s assertions before the Regional Director regarding this letter were set forth in the affidavit of its attorney, Verne W. Newcomb, submitted on January 19, 1970. First, Cascade characterized as \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d the statement \u201cafter many years of Independent Union representation employees in Portland, Oregon, voted to affiliate with an International Union.\u201d The company pointed out that the Portland employees had never been represented by an independent union, admitting, however, that, prior to organization by the teamsters, a \u201cshop committee\u201d had served as a sounding board and device for communication at the Portland plant. The union responded that the committee had performed certain of the functions normally performed by a bargaining agent, had been reorganized as an independent un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>ion, and appeared on the ballot as such in the representation election held at the employer\u2019s plant on February 12, 1969. Second, Cascade objected to the \u201cletter\u2019s treatment of \u2018rates of pay\u2019 \u201d, pointing out that labor Grade 4 received $3.45 per hour rather than $3.35 as stated in the circular and asserting that the union had significantly distorted the comparison by carefully selecting the positions discussed and by failing to note differences in the manner of classifying jobs at the two plants. The union acknowledged the $.10 per hour error 'but stated that the error had been corrected as soon as it was brought to the union\u2019s attention and that only approximately thirty uneorrected circulars were actually distributed to Cascade employees. Third, the company asserted that the \u201cletter\u201d was a \u201cforgery,\u201d neither authored nor authorized by Larry Vance, secretary-treasurer of the teamster local at the Portland plant, whose name appeared in printed form at the bottom of the circular. This assertion was made on the basis of the Newcomb affidavit to the effect that he had talked with Vance, who had assured him that \u201che did not write the letter and that he did not in any way authorize the UAW to use his name or that of his local union.\u201d The union responded in its non-sworn statement of position that the circular was prepared pursuant to a December 30, 1969, conversation between C. J. Hyde, UAW regional official, and Vance, and that its contents reflect the substance of that conversation. The union argued that the circular did not purport to be a direct communication, observing that the name at the bottom was printed not signed and that the circular opened with the sentence: \u201cLarry Vance, Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters Automotive Local 255 reports the following.\u201d According to the union\u2019s unverified statement, Vance indicated to Hyde that \u201che would be happy to help and support\u201d the union in any way and that it had used this offer by printing a \u201cMessage from Portland, Oregon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In conducting his investigation the Regional Director requested the parties to submit statements of their respective positions \u201ctogether with evidence in support thereof.\" As far as his report indicates, nothing was submitted to him that could in any way be characterized as \u201cevidence\u201d other than the Newcomb affidavit submitted on January 19, 1970, which, as indicated, recited a conversation with Vance to the effect that he did not write the \u201cletter\u201d nor authorize the UAW to use his name or that of his local union. Although this affidavit was before him the Regional Director made no mention of it in his report to the Board. He simply relied upon the union\u2019s unverified assertion that its representative, C. J. Hyde, had telephoned Vance on December 30, 1969, and that the circular was prepared \u201cpursuant to Hyde\u2019s conversation with Vance.\u201d The Regional Director apparently found from such unverified assertion of the union that Vance had told Hyde in the telephone conversation that he would be happy to help and support the petitioner in any way \u201cand that the petitioner decided to utilize this offer by printing a \u2018Message from Portland, Oregon.\u2019 \u201d It is noteworthy that aside from the Regional Director\u2019s reliance upon unsupported assertions as refuting the statements made in an affidavit, the so-called Hyde conversation, even if taken at face value, could hardly be said to constitute authorization on the part of Vance for the use of his name or that of his Local on a circular to be distributed to the Springfield employees. Moreover, the Regional Director\u2019s conclusion in effect that a shop committee is substantially the equivalent of an independent union is highly questionable, at least in the absence of a factual showing to this effect \u2014 a showing wholly lacking in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">It may be of course that Vance did actually either expressly or impliedly authorize the use of his name to be appended in the circular, but if he did not it is manifest that the circular was indeed a \u201cforgery,\u201d or at least a deceptive piece of campaign propaganda which conceivably could have influenced the election. Both forgeries and deceptive campaign propaganda have frequently been condemned by the Board and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>courts alike in connection with representation elections. A forgery has been defined as \u201c[t]he fabrication or counterfeiting of evidence. The artful and fraudulent manipulation of physical objects, or the deceitful arrangement of genuine facts or things, in such a manner as to create an erroneous impression or a false inference in the minds of those, who may observe them. See Burrill, Circ.Ev. 131, 420.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 779 (4th Ed. 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">We cannot agree with the Regional Director\u2019s cavalier assumption that in any event the circular is innocuous and raises no substantial factual issue. If Vance\u2019s name and that of his Local were used without his authority this fact alone may be sufficient to invalidate the election considering the consistency with which forgeries and other deceptive campaign tactics have been condemned. <em>See </em>N.L.R.B. v. Trancoa Chemical Corp., 303 F.2d 456, 461 (1st Cir. 1962). In the first place it is clear from the record that the Regional Director was incorrect in concluding that the circular was distributed at a time when the company had a reasonable opportunity to make a reply to any false or misleading statements. The distribution was made in the waning minutes before the election was to begin and there was no opportunity either properly to evaluate the contents of the circular or to check on any statement contained in it. The Regional Director\u2019s finding that the Vance statement contained no departure from the truth is also difficult to comprehend on the basis of the present record. He concedes that the statement in the circular that the Portland employees had been represented for many years by an independent union is false, but he concludes that since the employees had been represented by a \u201cso-called shop committee\u201d the statement was immaterial and did not exceed the bounds of permissible campaign propaganda, a finding, as already pointed out, lacking in evidentiary support. He brushes this misstatement off as \u201ca distinction without a difference.\u201d Without facts, this appears to us to be an arbitrary conclusion. In the absence of evidence in a particular case it would appear that there could very well be many important differences between an informal shop committee and an independent union. An independent union requires employee membership, the payment of dues, and a governing constitution and by-laws, whereas a shop committee is simply an informal group having none of these basic characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">In reviewing the Regional Director\u2019s report in which he recommended certification of UAW as the bargaining representative of the Springfield employees, the Board simply adopted the findings and conclusions of the Regional Director upon the ground that the exceptions to his report raised no material issue of fact or of law which would warrant reversal or require a hearing. We are aware of the fact that there are decisions of this Court indicating that in cases involving consent elections the exceptions to the Regional Director\u2019s report should specify the findings that are controverted, and show what evidence will be presented to support a contrary finding or conclusion. <em>See </em>N.L.R.B. v. Louisville Chair Co., 385 F.2d 922 (6th Cir. 1967); N.L.R.B. v. Tennessee Packers, Inc., etc., 379 F.2d 172 (6th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">It is also true that the exceptions to the report in this case on their face do not perhaps literally comply with this strict standard. Nevertheless, it is clear upon examination of the exceptions in the context of the objections filed to the election and considered by the Regional Director, that they do raise factual issues primarily going to the circulars.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3 Many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>reasons suggest themselves why the rule to its fullest extent as stated in <em>Louisville Chair Company </em>and <em>Tennessee Packers </em>should not be applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The court in the <em>Tennessee Packers </em>case while giving lip service to the rule just stated inferred that the rule applies to cases where the exceptions merely dispute the Regional Director\u2019s reasoning and conclusion. 379 F.2d at 179. In contrast, in the context of this case the exceptions go primarily to factual issues and not to the reasoning processes of the Regional Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In the <em>Louisville Chair </em>case the court specifically found that the so-called misleading campaign propaganda was not disseminated at a time or in a manner calculated to deprive the company of an opportunity to reply, whereas the exact opposite is true here as to the Vance circular.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">While the formal exceptions in the present case do not refer to the Vance circular or proffer specific evidence on the forgery issue, it is significant that the Newcomb affidavit was submitted to the Regional Director and was presumably also before the Board as a part of the record on review. The Regional Director\u2019s report demonstrates that he accepted without question the unverified and unsupported statements of the union although he had called upon both parties to submit \u201cevidence\u201d to support their respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">Further the Regional Director\u2019s report made no specific finding on the issue of whether the Vance circular was forged or whether the use of Vance\u2019s name had been authorized. Had he made a specific finding that the circular was not a forgery or that Vance had authorized the use of his name, either expressly or impliedly, there would be more reason to require the strict application of the rule requiring specific exceptions and a proffer of proof to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">In regard to the December 29th circular we find no material issue of fact to have been raised nor do we quarrel with the finding that this particular circular does not exceed the permissible limits of campaign propaganda. It should be pointed out that this circular was distributed within sufficient time for the company to make an adequate investigation and response. We have also reviewed the evidence in the record in regard to the Trial Examiner\u2019s findings that the alleged picket line misconduct was not of such proportions as to justify the company in refusing to bargain. We think it is clear that there was substantial evidence to support the Trial Examiner\u2019s finding in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">It is our conclusion that the equities of this case can be resolved only by remanding the case to the Board with directions that it conduct or authorize in an appropriate way an evidentiary hearing to determine all of the issues pertaining to the Vance circular. The hearing should embrace not only the forgery issue but also the question as to whether any material misrepresentations of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>were made in the circular itself so as to have had an impact upon the election. This latter aspect of the inquiry should be addressed particularly to the issue whether the statement in the circular with respect to the employees having been represented by an independent union was false, and if so, what effect such misstatement had upon the election itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The petition of Cascade Corporation for review is therefore granted, the cross petition of the Board seeking enforcement of its order is denied, and the action is remanded to the National Labor Relations Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-10\">.
