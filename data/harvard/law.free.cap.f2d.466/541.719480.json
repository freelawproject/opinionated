On August 25, 1969, EEOC formally served a demand for access to evidence and compliance to give testimony under oath, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-9 (a). On September 12, 1969, the Company filed a petition in the trial court for an order quashing the demand. The EEOC filed a cross-petition for an order of enforcement. The trial court granted the Company's petition to quash, for the reason that the Commissioner\u2019s charge was insufficient in that it did not set forth the facts upon which it was based. The issue before this Court is thus whether the Commissioner\u2019s charge herein satisfies the requirement of 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>\u00a7 2000e-5(a) that such charge set forth the facts upon which it is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">This Court has recently dealt with a closely analogous question in Sparton Southwest, Inc. v. EEOC, 461 F.2d 1055 (10th Cir. 1972). The issue therein was whether a charge such as that in the instant case was alone sufficient to activate discovery or whether supporting evidence must be particularly laid out. This Court found the charge in Sparton to be sufficient, and held that the trial court erred in dismissing the EEOC\u2019s petition for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Based on the rationale of Sparton and the authorities cited therein, we hold that the charge in the instant case satisfies the requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(a) that such charge set forth the facts upon which it is based. Accordingly, the order appealed from is set aside; the cause is remanded with instructions to the district court to enforce the demand for access to evidence and compliance to give testimony under oath, and for other further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-11\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(a) Whenever it is charged in writing under oath by a person claiming to be aggrieved, or a written charge has been filed by a member of the Commission where he has reasonable cause to believe a violation of this sub-chapter has occurred (and such charge sets forth the facts upon which it is based) that an employer, employment agency, or labor organization has engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the Commission shall furnish such employer, employment agency, or labor organization (hereinafter referred to as the \u201crespondent\u201d) with a copy of such charge and shall make an investigation of such charge, provided that such charge shall not be made public by the Commission</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
