The notes had been taken from the person of Fachini at the time he was arrested at his home pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by a District Court judge upon a complaint. On November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>5, 1971, prior to Fachini\u2019s second trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the District Court sustained a motion to suppress these counterfeit notes as evidence on the ground that the complaint was invalid. The Government, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, appealed to this court. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The warrant for the arrest of Faehini was issued by District Judge Fred W. Kaess<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> upon the basis of the following complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">\"United States District Court for the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">United States of America v. Dominic Henry Fachini Complaint for Violation of U.S.C. Title 18 Section 1001</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">\u201cBefore the Honorable Fred W. Kaess, U. S. District Judge, Detroit, Michigan, The undersigned complainant being duly sworn states: That on or about October 16, 1967, at Detroit, Michigan, in the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, Dominic Henry Faehini did in a matter within the jurisdiction of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service make and use a false writing knowing the same to contain false, fictitious and fraudulent statements; in violation of Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">\u201cAnd the complainant states that this complaint is based on the personal knowledge of the complainant Raymond J. Tallia, Special Agent, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and upon information supplied by Allen Wardowski, Notary Public, Macomb County, James Killeen, General Investigator, United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, and Julius Toth that Dominic Henry Faehini submitted to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service a false, fieititious and fraudulent statement representing that he was employed by R. J. Engineering Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-17\">\u201cAnd the complainant further states that he believes that Raymond J. Tallia, Allen Wardowski and Julius Toth are material witnesses in relation to this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-18\">/s/ Raymond J. Tallia</p>\n<p id=\"Au4h\">Raymond J. Tallia</p>\n<p id=\"AZz\"><em>Special Agent, </em>Federal Bureau of Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b127-19\">\u201cSworn to before me, and subscribed in my presence, May 16, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-20\">/s/ Fred W. Kaess</p>\n<p id=\"A_c\">Fred W. Kaess</p>\n<p id=\"AcZ\">\n<em>United, States Judge\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b127-21\">Before filing this complaint, FBI Agent Tallia, in the course of an investigation with Agent James Killeen of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, had learned that when Faehini had applied to bring his wife into the United States, he had furnished information to the Immigration and Naturalization Service that he was employed by the R. J. Engineering Company. Julius Toth, the owner of this firm, had told the FBI Agent that he had never employed Fachini and could not identify his photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-22\">On May 17, 1968, Tallia and other FBI agents executed the arrest warrant and arrested Faehini at his home. Incident to the arrest they searched his person and found and seized the five ten dollar counterfeit notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-23\">Two questions are presented on this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b127-24\">(1) Was the complaint upon which the arrest warrant was based adequate to show probable cause ? and</p>\n<p id=\"b127-25\">(2) If the complaint was insufficient, was the search of the person of Faehini and the seizure of the counterfeit notes valid as incident to a lawful arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In his order suppressing the evidence, the District Court held that the complaint was insufficient under Giordenello v. United States, 357 U.S. 480, 78 S.Ct. 1245, 2 L.Ed.2d 1503 (1958), and Rule 4, Fed.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The complaint filed before Judge Kaess states that on October 16, 1967, Fachini made a false statement in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. This offense is punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment of not more than five years or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The complaint states that it is based \u201con the personal knowledge of the complainant,\u201d an FBI agent, and upon information supplied by a named investigator of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and by Julius Toth, that Fachini had submitted a false statement to the Immigration and Naturalization Service representing that he was employed by R. J. Engineering Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">In granting the motion to suppress, the District Court laid emphasis upon the fact that the complaint does not identify Julius Toth. Certainly the FBI agent would have been more prudent if he had identified Mr. Toth in the complaint as the owner of R. J. Engineering Company. Although the complaint does not so state, the record discloses that Mr. Toth was owner of this firm, which Fachini had claimed under oath to be his employer. The record is silent as to whether the identity of Mr. Toth was disclosed orally to Judge Kaess at the time the arrest warrant was issued. Even without the identification of Mr. Toth, we hold that the complaint was sufficient for Judge Kaess to conclude that there was \u201cprobable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant has committed it.\u201d Rule 4, Fed.R.Crim.P. The complaint contained more than a mere conclusion that Fachini had committed a crime, which was the deficiency found by the Supreme Court in the complaint in <em>Giordenello.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\"> Mr. Justice Harlan, author of the majority opinion in <em>Giordenello, </em>also wrote the subsequent opinion in Jaben v. United States, 381 U.S. 214, 85 S.Ct. 1365, 14 L.Ed.2d 345 (1967). In this later case the Court sustained the sufficiency of a complaint, distinguishing and explaining <em>Giordenello. </em>Under the requirement of <em>Jaben, </em>Judge Kaess was required \u201cto make a neutral judgment that resort to further criminal process is justified.\u201d The complaint had to be sufficient to \u201cprovide a foundation for that judgment.\u201d It had to provide the affiant\u2019s answer to the hypothetical question, \u201cWhat makes you think that the defendant committed the offense charged?\u201d It is not required that \u201cevery factual allegation which the affiant puts forth must be independently documented, or that each and every fact which contributed to his conclusion be spelled out in the complaint.\u201d The complaint simply had to be sufficient to enable Judge Kaess \u201cto make the judgment that the charges are not capricious and are sufficiently supported to justify bringing into play the further steps of the criminal process.\u201d 381 U.S. at 224-225, 85 S.Ct. at 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Based upon the information set forth in the complaint, Judge Kaess could have concluded that a reasonable reading of the affidavit showed that the facts were obtained by Government investigation, rather than tips from unnamed informants. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Moore, 452 F.2d 569, 572 (6th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">We therefore conclude that the complaint was sufficient under the standards of <em>Giordenello </em>and <em>Jaben.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">After determining that the complaint was invalid, the District Court heard evidence on the question of whether the FBI agents had independent probable cause to arrest Fachini, notwithstanding the invalidity of the complaint. The District Court found, on the basis of uneontradicted testimony, that \u201cprobable cause did exist at the time of the arrest to believe that Fachini had com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>mitted a felony in violation of federal law.\u201d This conclusion is well supported by the testimony, which is made an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The factual basis for a conclusion of probable cause supporting a warrantless arrest is at least as stringent as the standards applied for the issuance of an arrest warrant. Whiteley v. Warden, 401 U.S. 560, 566, 91 S.Ct. 1031, 28 L. Ed.2d 306 (1971). If this standard is met, a showing of probable cause that a felony has been committed has long been deemed sufficient to justify arrest, even if the arrest warrant is invalid. United States v. Wilson, 451 F.2d 209, 214 (5th Cir. 1971); United States ex rel. Gockley v. Myers, 450 F.2d 232, 234 (3rd Cir. 1971); Chrisman v. Field, 448 F.2d 175, 176 (9th Cir. 1971); Ferganchick v. United States, 374 F.2d 559, 560 (9th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 947, 87 S.Ct. 2085, 18 L.Ed.2d 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">After ruling that probable cause existed at the time of the arrest to believe that Fachini had committed a felony in violation of federal law, the District Court held that FBI agents were not authorized to arrest Fachini in his private residence without a valid warrant supported by a valid complaint, relying on language in Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971). That decision involved a search warrant issued by a State Attorney General. After holding the search warrant to be invalid, the court examined and rejected three alternate theories urged by New Hampshire to bring the facts of that case within one of the exceptions to the search warrant requirement. Applying a basic maxim for the interpretation of judicial opinions, we read the language of <em>Coolidge, </em>\u201cin connection with the case in which those expressions are used.\u201d Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat) 264, 398, 5 L.Ed. 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In the present case, no search was made of the private residence of Fachini. The five counterfeit notes were found on his person as an incident to his arrest. We.do not agree with the District Court that the incidental search of Fachini\u2019s person became invalid because he was arrested in his home rather than on the street. The only objects seized were from his person, and the same incidental search of his person would have occurred regardless of the site of the arrest. See United States v. Baratta, 397 F.2d 215, 222-223 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 939, 89 S.Ct. 293, 21 L.Ed.2d 276; Hagans v. United States, 315 F.2d 67, 69 (5th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 826, 84 S.Ct. 68, 11 L.Ed.2d 58. Compare, United States v. Simpson, 453 F.2d 1028 (10th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">It is to be emphasized that this is not a case where arresting officers undertook an arrest by illegal police action. The FBI agent sought out judicial process and was issued a warrant. Any error that may have occurred was in failing to state a sufficient factual basis upon which to issue the arrest warrant, i. e., the identity of Julius Toth. Nevertheless, the warrant was issued and signed by a federal judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">We hold: (1) that the complaint and arrest warrant were valid; and (2) in any event the search of the person of Fachini was incident to a lawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">Raymond J.
