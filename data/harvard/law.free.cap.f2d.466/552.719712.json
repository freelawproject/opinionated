(49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301 et seq.) The district court granted a preliminary injunction, and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The corporate and individual appellants are closely associated with one another in the conduct of their business; we will refer to them collectively as \u201cACCI.\u201d The appellees will be called \u201cMonarch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Although ACCI is nominally a social club, its real business is selling to the general public tours and air transportation between Southern California and Europe, on aircraft it charters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It hires planes from direct air carriers, solicits members of the general public to purchase tickets on the flights it arranges, and consolidates groups of passengers to fill the space it purchases. ACCI does not strictly enforce the rule that passengers on its flights be members of ACCI for six months prior to the flight.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ACCI makes a substantial profit derived from the excess of the price of the tickets it sells over its cost in hiring the aircraft. The price of the tickets on ACCI flights is less than the legal tariff for nonchartered flights. ACCI is not an agent for airlines nor for its customers; it is an entrepreneur. It has no certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Civil Aeronautics Board or any exemption from the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act authorizing it to engage in air transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-19\">Monarch acts as an agent, not a principal, in booking passage on air carriers and in arranging tours for its clients. Monarch\u2019s money is earned from commissions. Monarch lost commissions from clients whose custom was diverted by ACCI\u2019s competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-20\">Three contentions on appeal require discussion: (1) Is Monarch \u201cany party in interest\u201d within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1487(a) and thus endowed with standing to maintain the suit? (2) Is ACCI operating as an \u201cindirect air carrier\u201d within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(3) and thus acting in violation of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1371(a)? (3) Are \u00a7\u00a7 1301(3) and 1371(a) and the pertinent CAB regulations defining \u201ccharter\u201d unconstitutional restrictions on the right to travel? '</p>\n<p id=\"b625-22\">Section 1487(a) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ***authorizes the Civil Aeronautics Board (\u201cCAB\u201d), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency, their agents, or \u201cany party in interest\u201d to bring suit against a person who violates section 1371(a) of the Act. The district court found that Monarch had suffered economic loss from ACCI\u2019s acts in violation of section 1371(a) because some clients who otherwise would have patronized Monarch were diverted to ACCI. The finding is not clearly erroneous. Is one who suffers such loss a \u201cparty in interest\u201d? We answer affirmatively. (Northeast Airlines, Inc. v. Nationwide Charters and Conventions, Inc. (1st Cir. 1969) 413 F.2d 335; <em>cf. </em>Sierra Club v. Morton (1972) 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636; Arnold Tours, Inc. v. Camp (1970) 400 U. S. 45, 46, 91 S.Ct. 158, 27 L.Ed.2d 179; Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp (1970) 397 U.S. 150, 152, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184.) Accordingly, Monarch has standing to bring the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">ACCI did not have a CAB certificate to engage in air transportation or an exemption. It acted in violation of section 1371(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> if it is an indirect air carrier. Section 1301(a) defines \u201cair carrier\u201d as used in \u00a7 1371(a) as \u201cany citizen of the United States who undertakes, whether directly or indirectly or by a lease or any other arrangement, to engage in air transportation: <em>Provided, </em>That the Board may by order relieve air carriers who are not directly engaged in the operation of aircraft in air transportation from the provisions of this chapter to the extent and for such periods as may be in the public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">When an organization arranging charter flights operates very much like a carrier, it should be treated as a carrier, regardless of the labels it applies to its business or the existence of incidental features of its program not shared by ordinary carriers. (Educational Student Exchange Program, Inc. (1971)-CAB - (Order 71-5-39); United European American Club (1971) - CAB - (Order 71-2-33); <em>cf. </em>Las Vegas Hacienda, Inc. v. C. A. B. (9th Cir. 1962) 298 F.2d 430; American Airlines v. C. A. B. (7th Cir. 1949) 178 F. 2d 903; Hacienda Hotels-U. S. Aircoach, Enforcement Proceeding (1958) 26 CAB 372.)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">ACCIVwas in the transporation business thinly disguised as a club. The district court correctly decided that it was an indirect carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">ACCI argues that the statutes and regulations it violated are unconstitutional restrictions on the right to travel because not everyone can afford to pay the higher fares on regular flights to Europe. No unconstitutional restraints on anyone\u2019s right to travel is imposed by the challenged statutes and regulations. The persons regulated are carriers. Of course, higher air tariffs will limit travel of those who cannot pay the price. A rich man can choose to drive a limousine; a poor man may have to walk. The poor man\u2019s lack of choice in his mode of travel may be unfortunate, but it is not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">ACCI\u2019s remaining contentions do not have sufficient merit to warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\">. The United States filed a brief <em>amicus curiae </em>in support of the district court\u2019s holding that appellants are indirect air carriers under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(3) and that appellant violated 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1371 (a) by operating as indirect air carriers without Civil Aeronautics Board authorization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\">.
