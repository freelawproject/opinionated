In October, 1965, he emigrated to the United States and thereafter registered with the Illinois Selective Service System. He was subsequently ordered to report for induction on March 28, 1968. Schaack reported as ordered, but refused to submit, and his indictment, trial and conviction followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">After close of the evidence at the trial, Schaack\u2019s attorney moved for an acquittal on the ground of denial of due process because of alleged discrimination and arbitrariness in the eighteen month requirement of \u00a7 456(a) (1) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and because that requirement was not reasonably related to any legitimate congressional purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-17\">The district court denied the motion, finding that the congressional purpose in the eighteen month limitation was \u201cundoubtedly the maintenance of our defense capabilities\u201d by strengthening the military force of our allies without subjecting their military veterans emigrating to this country to undue \u201cdouble obligation of service;\u201d and that some \u201cminimum length of service was necessary.\u201d The court found no invidious discrimination in Congress\u2019 setting the limitation at eighteen instead of nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-18\">Schaack argues that the \u201ceighteen months\u201d provision is an arbitrary classification and in violation of his Fifth Amendment due process right. He argues here that the eighteen month requirement is not supported by \u201cany demonstrable\u201d legitimate congressional objective. He states that neither Congress in enacting \u00a7 456(a) (1) nor the President in promulgating the implementary regulation 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.-40(a) (4) has made a fair distinction between the eighteen month limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>and his nine month Luxembourg Army-service and that the distinction is invidiously discriminatory. No case deciding the precise question before us has been cited or found, but we find no merit in Sehaaek\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">We hold that the classification has a rational basis and is not invidiously discriminatory. We agree with the district court finding of the congressional goals. The congressional intentions were to implement our own defenses by strengthening the defenses of our allies, to maintain friendship with our allies, and to further prudent diplomacy in our foreign affairs. We think that these goals are of high legislative priority and are clear from the enactment, and terms, of the statute. How to achieve the appropriate balance in serving these vital national interests clearly called for legislative expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">\u201cThe power of Congress to classify and conscript manpower for military service is \u2018beyond question.\u2019 \u201d United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968). This power extends to establishment of a \u201csystem of registration for individuals liable for training and service\u201d and to requiring cooperation of individuals within the registration system. And the promulgation of regulations by the President<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with respect to registration and eligibility classification is \u201ca legitimate and substantial\u201d aid in making the system work. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">It is true that discrimination \u201cmay be so unjustifiable\u201d as to violate the Fifth Amendment due process right. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954). The Ninth Circuit, however, in Smith v. United States, 424 F.2d 267, 269 (9th Cir.1970), relied, <em>inter alia, </em>upon Bolling v. Sharpe, <em>supra, </em>in rejecting a contention that the Selective Service Act violated the Fifth Amendment due process clause in exempting \u201cmen under 18 % and over age 26\u201d from the draft. The court stated that the Fifth Amendment \u201cmerely requires\u201d that all legislative classifications have a reasonable basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.40 has a wide range of Class IV-A categories, with varying periods of prior service requirements which qualify registrants for exemption from future service.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">The exemption provision of \u00a7 456(a) (1) before us is limited as follows: \u201cexcept that no such exemption shall be granted to any person who is a national of a country which does not grant reciprocal privileges to citizens of the United States.\u201d The reciprocal qualification is specified in this way: \u201c. . .a nation with which the United States is associated in mutual defense activities and which grants exemption from training and service in its armed forces to citizens of the United States who have served ... in the armed forces of the United States . . . for a period of not less than eighteen months.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.40(a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">It is not disputed that until 1955, when the pertinent provision of \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>456(a) was enacted,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> there was no exception or credit given for any person who had already served in the armed forces of a foreign ally. In 1955 only Great Britain and Turkey, of our fifty-nine associates in mutual defense, required, as we do, twenty-four months of military service. The range of service then required in most of the other fifty-seven associate nations was from fourteen to eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">We think that, for the reasons, given, it was clearly within the political function of Congress to require that a person serve eighteen months in the armed forces of a foreign ally in order to qualify for the exemption under \u00a7 456(a) (1). We cannot say that the congressional classification did not have a rational basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">We hold therefore that neither the relevant provisions in \u00a7 456(a) (1) nor those in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.40(a) (4) violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-13\">. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b835-14\">. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 456(a) (1) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-15\">Any person who subsequent to June 24, 1948, serves on active duty for a period of not less than eighteen months in the armed forces of a nation with which the United States is associated in mutual defense activities as defined by the President, may be exempted from training and service, but not from registration, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the President, except that no such exemption shall be granted to any person who is a national of a country which do\u00e9s not grant reciprocal privileges to citizens of the United States: <em>Provided, </em>That any active duty performed prior to June 24, 1948, by a person in the armed forces of a country allied with the United States during World War II and with which the United States is associated in such mutual defense activities, shall be credited in the computation of such eighteen month period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-20\">The statute was amended in 1971 and the eighteen month period was reduced to a twelve month period.
