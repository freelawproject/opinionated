Because it uses the accrual system of accounting, taxpayer employs inventories in determining its annual net income. The method chosen to allocate production costs between inventory and current or \u201cperiodic\u201d expenses is important, because those costs assigned to inventory are not deducted from gross income until the respective goods are sold. Thus, if the production costs allotted to inventory are too low, curreet expenses are overstated and net income is a lower figure than a more accurate accounting system would produce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-19\">There are three components of inventory costs; two of them, direct labor and direct materials, are not at issue in this case. The third, indirect manufacturing expenses or \u201cburden,\u201d is the source of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-20\">During the period in question, the fiscal years ending July 31, 1953, through July 31, 1958, taxpayer employed the \u201cpractical capacity\u201d method of allocating burden between inventory and current expenses. The aim of the practical capacity method is to identify that portion of indirect manufacturing expenses attributable to \u201cidle capacity;\u201d in other words, to ascertain the cost of running a factory at less than its \u201cnormal\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>\u201cpractical\u201d capacity. The theory is that only those burden expenses directly relating to goods produced should be charged to inventory, that otherwise an item produced when the factory is operating at low capacity will be improperly inflated by \u201cidle capacity\u201d expenses and will be valued higher than an item produced at full capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The practical capacity method is implemented in two steps, first by estimating the practical capacity of a plant or department. Practical capacity is maximum capacity, usually based on a 5-day, 8-hour shift, reduced by factors of downtime such as setup, lost time, cleanup, engineering changes, parts conversion and training. A \u201cburden rate\u201d is then established by dividing the estimated indirect manufacturing expenses at practical capacity by the number of labor hours or machine hours at practical capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">The second step comes at the end of the accounting period, when the burden rate is multiplied by the number of man-hours and machine-hours actually attained (actual earned hours) during the period. This amount is charged to inventory. If there is any excess of actual expense over the calculated amount, it is deducted as a current expense since it represents \u201cidle capacity\u201d cost. This excess is called \u201cunabsorbed burden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">The following is an illustration of the practical capacity method, taken from one of taxpayer\u2019s charts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-7\">1. <em>At beginning of period:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agc\">Anticipated burden expense $20,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ays\">Anticipated production stated</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANA\">in earned hours 10,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHR\">Normal burden rate ($20,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AurN\">-H 10,000) $ 2/hour</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4n\">2. <em>At end of period:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfTM\">Actual burden expense $19,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANAk\">Actual earned hours 9,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A697\">Burden charged to inventory</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyM\">($2 X 9,000) $18,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbX\">Unabsorbed burden ($19,000 \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMk0\">$18,000) $ 1,000</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-22\">During the years in question, taxpayer deducted the following amounts of unabsorbed burden from its gross income:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-23\">1953 $ 1,593,906</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACn\">1954 2,231,674</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj5\">1955 1,568,916</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_so\">1956 990,007</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgZ\">1957 2,113,078</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUf\">1958 2,440,070</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoW\">Total $10,937,651</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-32\">The government disallowed these deductions because of alleged errors in the use of the practical capacity method and adjusted taxpayer\u2019s accounts for costs of goods sold and ending inventory so that the full amount of burden was charged to inventory. The taxpayer sued for refund of some $400,000 in excess profits tax. The district judge upheld the government and the taxpayer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-33\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-34\">The standard used by the Internal Revenue Service in inventory accounting is a method \u201cconforming as nearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the trade or business and as most clearly reflecting the income.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 471 (1967). Cost of inventory must include \u201cindirect expenses incident to and necessary for the production of the particular article.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.-471-3 (c). The government\u2019s theory of the case is that taxpayer\u2019s misapplication of the practical capacity method invalidates it as a \u201cbest accounting practice\u201d and prevents taxpayer\u2019s accounts from \u201cclearly reflecting the income.\u201d The government challenged a number of taxpayer\u2019s practices in applying the practical capacity method; the district court found evidence to support several of the challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-35\">A. The first of taxpayer\u2019s errors occurred in the 1953-1956 computations of the burden rates for four categories of indirect expenses called the \u201cfixed-four.\u201d Indirect expenses are the costs of operating some 60 support departments. These costs are allocated to the production departments through 12 allocation pools. The fixed-four pools, floor space area, machine cost, factory equipment cost, and tools, jigs and factory cost, consist of primarily fixed expenses. These expenses theoretically should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>vary greatly according to production levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The district court used the following figures to illustrate taxpayer\u2019s mistake:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-6\">1952 1952 1953</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap6s\">Hours Budget Actual Actual</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHK\">Regular 100 100 100</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQMc\">Overtime 80</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajb\">Total 100 180 100</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuBD\">Fixed expenses $100 $100 100</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-7\">Burden rate $ l/hour</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">At the end of 1952 a new burden rate was computed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-9\">Anticipated fixed expenses $100</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-10\">Anticipated production stated</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-11\">in earned hours 180</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-12\">New burden rate ($100 -F180) $ .56/hour</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">Rather than retaining the previous estimate of normal production hours, taxpayer in 1953 recalculated burden rates for the fixed-four by estimating the next year\u2019s production as the higher of the normal hours (100) or the actual production of the previous year (180). This computation violated the theory of the practical capacity method because it used overtime hours to increase the anticipated hours of production beyond a normal 40-hour week. Meanwhile, anticipated expense remained at the 40-hour-week level. As a result, the burden rate dropped after each year of over-capacity production.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">The consequence of this error is shown when the unabsorbed burden for 1953 is computed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-15\">Actual expenses $100</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH2\">Actual earned hours 100</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH9F\">Burden charged to inventory</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqr\">($.56 X 100) $ 56</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aht\">Unabsorbed burden ($100 \u2014 $56) $ 44</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-16\">The company would then deduct 44 percent of its fixed-four expenses as the cost of \u201cidle capacity\u201d in a year when production equaled the original estimate of full practical capacity. The district court characterized this application of the. practical capacity method as \u201cnonsense;\u201d we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-17\">The illustration parallels the actual experience of the taxpayer, which had an enormous amount of overtime in 1952 plus a second shift of 35 men. Production dropped substantially in the next four years, but the burden rate continued to include anticipated production based on the exceptional number of hours recorded in 1952. A taxpayer abuses the practical capacity method and understates its income if it deducts as a current expense the purported cost of \u201cidle capacity,\u201d which turns out to be the cost of not operating on a heavy overtime schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-19\">B. Further distortion in taxpayer\u2019s application of the practical capacity method occurred when the 1954 burden rates were revised. An unidentified employee of taxpayer increased the burden rate for each department by 20 cents per hour. There is nothing in the record to show the basis for this increase except speculation about accelerated depreciation and higher labor costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-20\">Assuming an increase in burden rates could be justified without a study and analysis of cost factors, a percentage increase would have caused less distortion in taxpayer\u2019s inventory than did the 20-cent across-the-board increase. The 20-eent raise resulted in high percentage increases in departments with relatively low burden rates, such as the assembly departments, and in low percentage increases in high-burden departments such as the machine shops.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-21\">C. Taxpayer\u2019s burden rates were substantially revised in 1956; the erroneous practices outlined above were corrected. In computing rates for its \u201cother indirect\u201d expenses, however, taxpayer made another critical mistake. These other indirect expenses are the eight allocation pools besides the fixed-four. They are primarily variable expenses and should be substantially absorbed under the practical capacity method since their amount varies with volume of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-22\">Taxpayer estimates its anticipated other indirect expenses for 1956 by using the actual totals for 1955. These totals were in most cases revised slightly upward. But they did not approach a reasonable estimate for expenses at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>practical capacity because the plant in 1955 was operating at about 70 percent of practical capacity. The burden rate was then figured by dividing the understated anticipated expenses by the normal hours; the result was a much lower burden rate than correct usage of the practical capacity method would have produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">The district court used the following illustration to show the effect of this error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-6\">1955 figures</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2Q-\">Anticipated production</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATN\">(normal standard hours) 25,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApZ\">Actual earned hours</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmH3\">(70% of 25,000) 17,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxJK\">Indirect expenses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjrK\">Fixed-four $ 50,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6B\">Other (variable) $100,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdW\">Total $150,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7BU\">Correct method for 1956 burden rate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdD\">Actual fixed-four expenses $ 50,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvQ\">Normal standard hours 25,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APqC\">Burden rate for fixed-four</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABd\">($50,000-F 25,000) $2.00/hour</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHP\">Actual other indirect expenses $100,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ4\">Actual earned hours 17,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amd\">Burden rate for other indirect</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A34r\">expenses ($100,000 -f-17,500) $5.70/hour</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGIN\">Burden rate for indirect expenses $7.70/hour</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_Ts\">Taxpayer's method for 1956 burden rate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqiN\">Total indirect expenses $150,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anq\">Normal standard hours 25,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq0I\">Burden rate for indirect</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtV\">expenses ($150,000 -H 25,000) $6.00/hour</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYF\">The difference in unabsorbed burden is then computed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcA\">Correct T axpayer's</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG3\">method method</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUm\">Total indirect</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aep\">expenses $150,000 $150,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYs\">Actual earned hours 17,500 17,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMSY\">Burden rate X $7.70 X $6.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYpo\">Absorbed burden $134,750 $105,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD6W\">Unabsorbed burden $ 15,250 $ 45,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aev\">Difference \u2014$ 15,250</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKtR\">$ 29,750</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-46\">When the burden rate for other indirect expenses is derived correctly, the unabsorbed burden almost exactly represents the cost of idle capacity for fixed expenses. Experience conforms to the theory of the practical capacity method. But under taxpayer\u2019s method, almost twice as much burden is unabsorbed; it cannot be labeled idle capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-47\">The district court cited other errors, mostly errors of omission, that further interfered with the accuracy of taxpayer\u2019s accounting system; it is unnecessary to review them since we have already concluded that taxpayer\u2019s system did not reflect income accurately and was not a \u201cbest accounting practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7O\">Taxpayer argues that its erroneous practices had no material effect on its reported income. The basis of its argument is a chart purporting to show that the company absorbed more burden than theoretically required in most years. But this chart was designed using the erroneously high figures for production capacity described in part A above. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>are satisfied that the record provides ample support for the district court\u2019s conclusion that taxpayer\u2019s practices materially distorted its income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">Taxpayer next contends that the government\u2019s substitution of the full-absorption method of accounting for inventory was improper. Taxpayer\u2019s contention depends on its assertion that the method it used accurately reflected income, which assertion we have rejected. When the method used by taxpayer is unacceptable, \u201cthe computation of taxable income shall be made under such method as, in the opinion of the Secretary or his delegate, does clearly reflect income.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 446 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Under this statute, plaintiff in a suit for refund has the heavy burden of proving that the government\u2019s assessment is arbitrary or an abuse of discretion. Lucas v. Kansas City Structural Steel Co., 281 U.S. 264, 50 S.Ct. 263, 74 L.Ed. 848 (1930); Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Joseph E. Seagram <em>&amp; </em>Sons, Inc., 394 F.2d 738 (2d Cir. 1968); F. &amp; D. Rentals, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 365 F.2d 34 (7th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1004, 87 S. Ct. 707, 17 L.Ed.2d 543 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Furthermore, the taxpayer must produce evidence from which another and proper calculation can be made before it is entitled to any refund. Compton v. United States, 334 F.2d 212 (4th Cir. 1964); United States v. Pfister, 205 F.2d 538 (8th Cir. 1953); Roy-bark v. United States, 104 F.Supp. 759 (S.D.Calif.1952), aff\u2019d, 218 F.2d 164 (9th Cir. 1954). We agree with the district court that the taxpayer here failed to provide the kind of evidence that would allow a recalculation of its inventory cost under a correct application of the practical capacity method. Under these circumstances, substitution of the full-absorption method is appropriate. Photo-Sonics, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 42 T.C. 926 (1964), aff\u2019d, 357 F.2d 656 (9th Cir. 1966); Frank G. Wikstrom &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 20 T.C. 359 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">In regard to the government\u2019s computation of inventory cost, taxpayer raises one objection for the first time on appeal. It complains that the government has charged to inventory items of depreciation, taxes and losses that are deductible from gross income under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 164, 165 and 167 (1967). Taxpayer cites All-Steel Equipment, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 54 T.C. 1749 (1970), in which- similar items were not charged to inventory under the full-absorption method.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">We believe this case falls under United States v. Tyrrell, 329 F.2d 341 (7th Cir. 1964). In <em>Tyrrell </em>this court held that only an exceptional case should be reopened to consider recomputations urged for the first time on appeal. Sections 164, 165 and 167 have been part of the Internal Revenue Code at least since 1954; they were available as a basis for objection during the entire ten-year pendency of this case in the district court. <em>All-Steel\u2019s </em>deduction of those items was not a startling development. Even if it had been, the opinion in <em>All-Steel </em>was published several months before the district judge\u2019s opinion was issued without its being called to his attention. This is not the extraordinary case that merits a recalculation of the government\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">Having decided taxpayer was not entitled to a refund because of its misapplication of the practical capacity method, the district court proceeded to consider a contention first raised by the government in its posttrial brief. This argument, which was not presented in the pleadings, in the pretrial briefs nor dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>ing the taking of evidence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3 is that the practical capacity method \u2014 even used correctly \u2014 is not appropriate for valuing taxpayer\u2019s inventory. The district judge accepted the government\u2019s reasoning, that the complex and ever-shifting nature of taxpayer\u2019s manufacturing operations made inaccuracy in computation of practical capacity inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">Because neither party addressed itself to this issue during the trial, there is no testimony directed to the question whether taxpayer\u2019s operations precluded use of the practical capacity method. While there is evidence of taxpayer\u2019s variances in production levels, there is no evidence that the theory of practical capacity requires steady production to function accurately. The tardy emergence of this issue and the lack of support in the record for the government\u2019s position oblige us to reject this holding of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Resolution of this issue did not affect the outcome of the case; in fact, the holding was so irrelevant to the issues at trial as to constitute an advisory opinion on a hypothetical question. We believe the taxpayer should not be precluded from showing in future years that proper application of the practical capacity method will result in a reasonably accurate division of inventory costs and periodic expenses. This is especially so in light of the government\u2019s recent steps seemingly in the direction of officially approving use of the practical capacity method to allocate fixed burden costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint is affirmed as modified in part II.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">. <em>All-Steel </em>is now on appeal in this court (Nos. 71-1664 and 71-1665). The government\u2019s brief in <em>All-Steel </em>does not question the current deductibility of those items.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">. The only relevant discussion was the response of a government attorney to a question by the judge before the first witness was called. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-8\">As a general proposition, ... I do not think practical capacity can be used in cost accounting to clearly reflect income. Whatever the general proposition may be, we certainly think in this specific case with this volume capacity, it cannot be used here to clearly reflect income. But this is not our threshold defense. This is clear back in the room. Our main defense, main concern at this trial, . . . what they did here is not the best accounting practice. What they did here does not reflect income.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1008-25\">.
