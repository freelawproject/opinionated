United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Compare Schneble v. Florida, 405 U.S. 427, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 31 L.E.2d 340 (1972). We, however, think it unnecessary to express an opinion regarding the question of the retroactive application of the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1428,18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">On the record before us the question of the retroactivity of <em>Gault </em>is simply not presented. The record shows that appellant at the time of his confession was a juvenile. The consequences of his criminal act, however, had not jelled at the time he made his oral confession. The offense charged did not become murder until shortly after his verbal confession when the victim of the assault died. Under Florida law juvenile authorities were bound to treat appellant as an adult as of that time. F. S.A. \u00a7 39.02(6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *****8 Consequently and unlike Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541, 86 S.Ct. 1045, 16 L.Ed.2d 84 (1966), there was no element of discretion in the decision of the juvenile authorities to certify appellant for trial as an adult. In such circumstances, without regard to whether <em>Gault </em>is retroactive, it is clear that appellant has no greater substantive claim than would an adult tried at the same time. Cf. Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966). The hearing which certified appellant as an adult was akin to a preliminary hearing. Counsel at preliminary hearings is now required for adults, Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970), and in the related proceeding for juveniles, Kent v. United States, supra, but since the <em>Coleman </em>decision has recently been held non-retroactive, Adams v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 278, 92 S.Ct. 916, 31 L.Ed.2d 202 (1972), we can perceive no reason for the result to differ as regards a juvenile proceeding which was both <em>^re-Gault </em>and <em>pre-Miranda </em>[Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602,16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)].</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-13\">.
