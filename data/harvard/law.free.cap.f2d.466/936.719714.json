On April 15, 1971, the bankrupt filed an answer denying that he had obtained a loan from Commonwealth under false pretenses or false representations and demanding a jury trial as to whether his indebtedness was discharged under Section 17 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">The bankruptcy referee denied the request for a jury trial, holding that the bankrupt had neither a constitutional nor statutory right thereto. In a brief, unreported opinion the district court upheld the denial of a jury trial, holding that when Congress amended Section 17 in 1970, it did not intend \u201cto create a right to a jury trial * * * when none existed there before.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-17\">To support his right to a jury trial, the bankrupt relies upon the 1970 amendments of Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Inter alia, </em>those amendments provided for the first time that a bankrupt or any creditor could file an application with the bankruptcy court for the determination of the dischargeability of any debt. The amendments also added Section 17(c) (3) and (5), which provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-18\">\u201c(3) After hearing upon notice, the court shall determine the discharge-ability of any debt for which an application for such determination has been filed, shall make such orders as are necessary to protect or effectuate a determination that any debt is dis-chargeable and, if any debt is determined to be nondischargeable, shall determine the remaining issues, render judgment, and make all orders necessary for the enforcement thereof. A creditor who files such application does not submit himself to the jurisdiction of the court for any purposes other than those specified in this subdivision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-19\">\u2022x- * * -X- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-20\">\u201c(5) Nothing in this subdivision shall be deemed to affect the right of any party, upon timely demand, to a trial by jury where such right exists.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(c) (3) and (5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsEz\">Prior to the 1970 amendments, the matter of dischargeability was often passed upon in a state court action, triable before a jury, on the debt in which the discharge was raised as a defense. The bankrupt asserts that Section 17(c) (5) preserves the right to a jury trial. We disagree. As Referee Covey pointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>out below, there was no right to a jury-trial when dischargeability was determined in bankruptcy courts, and Congress, he thought, did not see fit to change that rule when it enacted Section 17(c) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Professor Vern Countryman, one of the architects of the 1970 legislation, has stated in more detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-5\">\u201c[T]here is no constitutional or statutory right to jury trial on the issue of dischargeability as such. If there is a right to jury trial, it is because of other issues involved in the case. In the present context, that proposition means that a right to jury trial exists only if it is accorded because of the nature of the creditor\u2019s claim. There frequently will be a right to jury trial on issues of the existence and amount of liability. There is at present no [federal or state] right to jury trial, constitutional or statutory, on the issue of dischargeability. * * * there is no right to jury trial on the issue of dischargeability regardless of how, or in what tribunal, the issue arises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-6\">Countryman, The Dischargeability Law, 45 Am.Bankr.L.J. 1, 35, 36 (1971).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">Professor Lawrence King, one of the principal draftsmen of the 1970 amendments, has come to the same conclusion in editing Collier on Bankruptcy, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-8\">\u201c[P]rior to this legislation, the suit would be in the state court <em>on the debt. </em>When the affirmative defense of discharge was pleaded, the elements of false financial statement and reliance (usually a \u00a7 17a(2) type of lawsuit), would be raised by the plaintiff in response to the affirmative defense, <em>i. e., </em>that the defense was not valid because the debt was nondischargeable under the Bankruptcy Act. If a jury trial had been demanded, the jury would consider all of the facts, including the falsity of the financial statement and the reliance. Granted that there may well have been a right to jury trial in the action on the debt, did that right encompass the issue of dischargeability necessitating additional facts? It seems not. Now, in the bankruptcy court the issue is strictly one of dischargeability, a Bankruptcy Act issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-11\">1A Collier on Bankruptcy, 14th ed., j[ 17.28A[6], p. 1742.3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\"> The legislative history of the 1970 amendments affords bankrupt no solace. In Section 17(c) (5) Congress only preserved the right to a jury trial \u201cas it presently exists.\u201d 2 U.S.Code Congressional and Administrative News, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 1970, pp. 4156-4157; see <em>id., </em>pp. 4158, 4164. We agree with Professor Countryman\u2019s analysis that such right has heretofore been recognized and presently exists only with respect to factual issues subsidiary to the question of dischargeability, but not for determination of the dischargeability question itself. Countryman, <em>supra </em>at 36-40. Since ours is the narrow problem of whether the latter question requires summoning a jury, we resolve only that it does not. Accordingly, the bankrupt\u2019s jury demand was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1009-15\">. Bankrupt does not contend that he has a federal constitutional right to a jury trial. Bather his contention is that the 1970 amendments of Section 17 preserved all rights the bankrupt had in the state courts, including the right to jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">. Professor Countryman\u2019s views were deemed \u201cpersuasive\u201d in Abramson, Basic Bankruptcy, Alternatives, Proeesship and Discharges, Institute of Continuing Legal Education, Michigan, 1971, but were not adopted by Referee Herzog, who awarded a jury trial, in his unreviewed decision in In the Matter of Law Research Service, Inc. No. 71-E-598 (S.D.N.Y. decided December 9, 1971). His decision acknowledges that several other referees have held to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1010-15\">. We realize that this treatise later states that a respectable argument could be made to the contrary. <em>Idem.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
