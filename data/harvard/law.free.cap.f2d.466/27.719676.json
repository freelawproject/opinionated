MILLER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b100-26\">This is a direct appeal from the conviction of William B. Langley for having possessed chattels which he knew to have been stolen from an interstate shipment in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 659.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant advances two issues on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>appeal, asserting that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from his dwelling, and that the prosecution failed to establish the interstate nature of the allegedly stolen goods.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The following facts were adduced at trial and at the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. Appellant does not challenge the facts relied upon by the Government as such but rather the legal conclusions and factual inferences drawn therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">At approximately 3:30 A.M. on the morning of November 19, 1970, the police of Madison Heights, Michigan, received a call from a woman who reported that a large Avis Rental truck was parked in the driveway of a nearby house, 26574 Park Court, and that she believed a burglary to be in progress. At 4:10 A.M. a patrol ear was dispatched to the premises.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon arrival, the policemen got out of their car; Officer Petit proceeded to the rear of the dwelling and his partner to the front. As reported, the Avis truck was parked in the driveway. Additionally, it was seen that \u201cthe windows of the house were all taped with newspaper and tape and the drapes pulled tightly shut.\u201d \u201cBanging on the door\u201d brought no response from within the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Officer Petit testified that, walking back from the rear of the house, he noticed that the vertically sliding door of the truck was open \u201capproximately a foot, foot and a half.\u201d He further \u201cobserved . . . what appeared to be large packing crates on this truck.\u201d He testified that he \u201cfigured someone could be in this truck hiding.\u201d In order to investigate this suspicion he \u201cpushed the door open the rest of the way, entered this vehicle to check for any occupants. . . .\" Finding no one, Petit observed more closely the \u201cfive large packing crates\u201d which were loaded near the rear of the truck. He made note of the markings on the sides of the boxes, testifying: \u201cI took down all the numbers off the different boxes, on my pad, and I climbed out of the back of the vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>His immediate suspicions allayed, Pet-it proceeded to the front of the house where he found another officer<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> conversing with one of the neighbors. Petit listened to the conversation momentarily and then \u201cwent back to knock on the house to try to get some response.\u201d His subsequent observations were described thusly:</p>\n<p id=\"A7d\">At this time, one window that would be on the northwest side of the home \u2014 the drapes on all the windows were taped up with newspaper or the drapes were heavily pulled \u2014 on one window the drapes had slightly parted down at the bottom I would say maybe an inch. I peered into this to try to see into the house. I saw a figure dart from the living room, towards the kitchen, which would be from the north \u2014 that would be from the west to the east, I believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-23\">And at the same time, I also observed a box sitting on the dresser, that was open. This box and so forth was very similar, the same as what I found in the truck in these large packing crates.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-24\">He returned to the back of the house to knock. Again there was no response from within. Petit went back to the window through which he had observed the crouched figure and, seeing no one, checked out the front of the house where \u201cthere were no signs of forcible entry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">At this point the police decided to \u201cclear the scene\u201d but continue to \u201cwatch the house.\u201d As the two police cars departed, a later model Ford arrived, stopping one house north of the house under investigation. Lieutenant Badgley conferred with its driver, who indicated that he did not live in the house, did not know its occupant, and, in fact, \u201cdidn\u2019t belong in the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>As the police cars drove off, Petit observed a party get out of the Ford. In order \u201cto observe where this party was going\u201d he circled the block. He saw the party disappear into the house, reappear, and begin work on the truck for a moment. Almost immediately he observed the truck pull out of the driveway and proceed down the street. He followed. When the truck exceeded the speed limit, Petit, \u201cusing the flashers and the siren of the police vehicle . pulled him over.\u201d The truck finally stopped; Petit proceeded to the driver\u2019s side and \u201crequested the driver\u2019s license and registration for the vehicle of the driver.\u201d The driver produced his license but no registration. Petit asked for a \u201crental receipt or something\u201d that would demonstrate that the driver had rightful possession of the vehicle. None was produced. Petit \u201casked him if he had anything in the way of a bill of sale or shipping orders for the equipment in the back of the vehicle.\u201d According to Petit, \u201che [the driver] stated to me that there was nothing in the back of the vehicle. He said the vehicle was empty and he was going to haul potatoes.\u201d Petit advised the party that he \u201cwould have to take him into the station for investigation of possession of this truck,\u201d placing him in effect under arrest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">Subsequent to Langley\u2019s arrest, a search warrant was issued authorizing search of the house in question, a one-story brick and frame residence, and adjacent two-car garage situated at 26574 Park Court, Madison Heights, Michigan. Prior to the application for this warrant, Petit had been apprised by Agent Lewis Vernazza of the FBI that a shipment of Autolite Automobile Electrical Points had been stolen.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Based on the information supplied by Agent Vernazza, the information obtained during investigation of the suspected burglary at 26574 Park Court, and finally on the conduct of Langley at the time of his arrest, an affidavit was filed by Officer Petit in support of his application to search Langley\u2019s dwelling. The affida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>vit described briefly the circumstances which led the police to investigate the house which Langley rented from his neighbor. Of special note is the statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">C) Your affiant observed a large Avis rent-a-truck bearing 1970 Michigan license 2976CB with the rear sliding door open parked in the driveway of the said address. Inside the storage area were five large packing cartons with Autolite, Ford Parts Division, Dallas Parts Depot, Ford Marketing Corporation, 2405 Belt Line Road, Carrollton, Texas, stenciled on the carton closest to the door opening. The other four boxes all appeared to be identical in size and markings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The affidavit set forth Petit\u2019s observations through the parted drapery: the crouched figure and \u201can open carton with the same size and color as the ear-tons which were found inside of the five large packing crates in the truck.\u201d Further, the affidavit set forth the above-noted information supplied by FBI Agent Yernazza and concluded by describing Langley\u2019s arrival at the premises in question and his subsequent arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Upon execution of the search warrant, Officer Petit located one carton of Auto-lite points on the dresser in the bedroom on the southwest side of the house. This carton was confiscated and subsequently introduced in evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">On December 2, 1970, Langley was indicted for the offense of possessing chattels stolen from an interstate shipment. On May 3, 1971, appellant filed a motion to suppress and dismiss the indictment challenging both his arrest and the search of his dwelling. On May 12, 1971, an evidentiary hearing was held on the motion to suppress. Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence which had been seized was denied and trial before a jury commenced on May 18,1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">On May 19, 1971, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Appellant was committed to the custody of the Attorney General for a period of three years. From the judgment below appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">Appellant contends that the Government did not introduce sufficient evidence that the Autolite points were stolen from a shipment moving in interstate commerce. Essentially, appellant\u2019s argument, as we understand it, advances the contention that the Government failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence found in appellant\u2019s possession and introduced at trial was identical to the Autolite points whose history as goods shipped in interstate commerce was established by documents introduced at trial and from testimony of those involved in the transportation of the goods described in the documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">Our role as a reviewing court is, of course, well established. It is not for this Court to \u201cweigh the evidence\u201d nor \u201cto determine the credibility of witnesses.\u201d Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). That a verdict may be based on circumstantial evidence does not alter the standard of review. A jury is permitted to draw reasonable inferences in arriving at a verdict of guilty. That other inferences might have been drawn does not mandate reversal. It is not the function of the court of appeals to substitute its judgment for that of the jury in the evaluation of circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">It is our view that the Government introduced sufficient evidence from which the jury might infer that the Autolite points found in Langley\u2019s possession were stolen from an interstate shipment. Photographs of the Avis truck showing crates of points clearly visible, the crates and cartons of points introduced at trial and Officer Petit\u2019s oral testimony, established appellant\u2019s possession of approximately 40,000 Autolite points which were boxed in cartons packaged in five crates, which bore the addresses of the Long Island, New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>York consignor and the Carrollton, Texas consignee, as well as the reference number B8Q1217A, DP-12. Three invoices supported by oral testimony established that 40,000 Autolite point sets, bearing a reference number B8Q1217A, DP-12, were shipped to Autolite Ford Parts Division, Dallas Parts Depot, Ford Marketing Corp., 2405 Belt Line Road, Carrollton, Texas, by the P. &amp; D. Manufacturing Company. It was further established that these goods never reached their destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Challenging the sufficiency of the Government\u2019s proof, appellant focuses upon the failure of the Government to demonstrate directly that the parts in appellant\u2019s possession were the same points that were described in the invoices. He points out, for example, that the reference number B8Q1217A was a general one referring to the kind of goods and not any specific shipment. In consequence, it is argued that the identifying number did not necessarily refer to the goods found in Langley\u2019s possession. The district court responded to this contention in the following fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqC\">But I think that there can be drawn a reasonable inference that when we have a description that matches exactly as to number, type and packaging, and the proximity in time involved, then I think that the Government has established enough of a case to go to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">I think, without question, that the Court must make reasonable inferences. And when we have these similarities and coincidences, it is hardly enough to explain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">It think that I would agree with Mr. Stoorman if these were loose parts or in smaller cartons or something of that sort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The coincidence of time, the number of points and mode of packing, constitute adequate proof upon which a jury might reasonably infer that the points in Langley\u2019s possession were stolen from an interstate shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">We turn to the validity of the warrant authorizing the search of appellant\u2019s rented dwelling. Challenging the warrant, the appellant focuses upon the initial police investigation of the reported burglary. He asserts that information which formed a crucial portion of the affidavit was the fruit of illegal Searches. Because the investigation of the reported burglary did provide information which was critical in the affidavit supporting the application for a warrant, the validity of the warrant turns in part upon the legitimacy of the conduct which produced that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\">At the outset, it must be acknowledged that the police investigation of the reported burglary at 26574 Park Court did constitute a \u201csearch\u201d and must therefore be subjected to scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment. The police did go onto the immediate premises of Langley\u2019s dwelling. Further, Officer Petit stated at the suppression hearing, at trial and in his affidavit supporting the application for a warrant, that he entered the back of the Avis truck and that he looked through the window of the dwelling. Such acts constitute invasions of \u201cprivacy.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ABg\">Of warrantless searches, Mr. Justice Stewart in Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 454, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2032, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-15\">Thus the most basic constitutional rule in this area is that \u201csearches conducted outside the judicial process without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>ver se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment \u2014 subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d The exceptions are \u201cjealously and carefully drawn,\u201d and there must be \u201ca showing by those who seek exemption . . . that the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative.\u201d \u201c[T]he burden is on those seeking the exemption to show the need for it.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Warrantless searches have been held to be \u201creasonable\u201d in various circumstances.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such a search must pass a highly restrictive two-pronged test of reasonability. A heavy burden must be borne by the Government in demonstrating the need for an exception to the warrant requirement. United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 51, 72 S. Ct. 93, 96 L.Ed. 59 (1951). First, the Court must determine the presence of circumstances sufficiently exigent to warrant disregard of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s ban against invasions of privacy. Second, and equally important, the court must examine with care the manner and scope of the search that was conducted in response to the purportedly \u201cexigent circumstances.\u201d Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 28, 29, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1881, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). In <em>Terry, </em>the Court made clear that \u201c[t]he manner in which the seizure and search were conducted is ... as vital a part of the inquiry as whether they were warranted at all\u201d and that \u201cevidence may not be introduced if it was discovered by means of a seizure and search which were not reasonably related in scope to the justification for their initiation.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Applying this test to the case before us, we find that, with one exception, the action taken by Officer Petit and his colleagues investigating the purported burglary at the Langley dwelling was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The police were dispatched to the Langley residence in response to a report that a burglary was in process. At that time of the morning it was still dark. The police were told that an Avis truck was parked in the driveway. Upon arrival, they found the truck there and further discovered that the windows of the house were covered either by drapery or paper taped upon them. There is no suggestion in the record that Officer Petit and those with him acted out of any motive other than the suspicion that a burglary was in process. We think that such circumstances not only warrant but mandate police action which may involve limited intrusions of the \u201cprivacy\u201d of the premises. Here the intrusions upon the Langley premises were geared to protect the privacy and security of the premises; they were directed not at Langley or other occupants of the house but rather at suspected burglars.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">Thus, we find that the police acted reasonably in going upon the premises immediately surrounding the dwelling at 26574 Park Court. Further, we find that the circumstances justified Officer Petit\u2019s looking into the house through the window and in looking into the Avis truck which was parked in the driveway. Such acts are limited in scope and we think analogous to the \u201cfrisk\u201d sanctioned in Terry v. Ohio, <em>supra. </em>However, it is our view that Officer Petit did go a step beyond that which was sanctioned by the circumstances by entering the Avis truck and copying down the markings and numerals on the boxes. As Petit described the situation, the presence of an intruder might have been easily ascertained by means other than entering the truck. And certainly, while Petit could not help noticing the markings on the box and recall them in a general way, it cannot plausibly be contended that such careful scrutiny of the boxes was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">We have set forth above the information which was contained in the affidavit which Langley challenges on this appeal. Because we find that the limited intrusions upon the Langley premises were \u201creasonable\u201d in light of the circumstances, excepting the entry of the truck, all of the information contained in the affidavit must be said to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>have been legally obtained other than the detailed references to the markings on the boxes. It must be emphasized that where such tainted information comprises more than a <em>very minor portion </em>of that found in an affidavit supporting a warrant to search, the warrant must be held invalid. Here the details provided by Petit\u2019s entry into the truck were not significant. The other information contained in the affidavit and set forth above certainly constituted probable cause to search Langley\u2019s dwelling. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Langley\u2019s motion to suppress the carton of Autolite points seized from the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">It is our view that appellant\u2019s contentions are without merit and that the judgment of the district court should be and it is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-14\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 659 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-15\">Whoever embezzles, steals, or unlawfully takes, carries away, or conceals, or by fraud or deception obtains from any railroad car, wagon, motortruck, or other vehicle, or from any station, station house, platform or depot or from any steamboat, vessel, or wharf, or from any aircraft, air terminal, airport, aircraft terminal or air navigation facility with intent to convert to his own use any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>goods or chattels moving as or which are a part of or which constitute an interstate or foreign shipment of freight or express; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA\">Whoever buys or receives or has in his possession any such goods or chattels, knowing the same to have been embezzled or stolen,; ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\">. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, appellant also challenged his arrest on the ground that the arresting officer did not have probable cause. On appeal, appellant does not challenge his arrest nor the seizure of evidence pursuant thereto. While we do not discuss this issue, we have considered the question and are of the opinion that the recitation of facts that follows amply reveals that Officer Petit had probable cause to arrest Langley.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-10\">. One of the two policemen dispatched, Officer Max Michael Petit, testified at the suppression hearing and at trial regarding the early morning investigation and the arrest of Langley.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b101-11\">. The following colloquy occurred at trial regarding Officer Petit\u2019s observations while in the Avis truck and his identifieation of evidence pertaining to the truck and crates.</p>\n<p id=\"Alf\">Let me show you Government Exhibit.

By this time another patrol car had arrived. A Lieutenant Badgley who was in the second patrol car was interviewing the neighbor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b103-5\">. The following dialogue reflects Petit\u2019s representations as to his perceptions at this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">When you arrived at the premises that you were told by radio to investigate, did you believe any type of crime to having been made or in the process of being made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">A.

What kind of offense is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">A. That would be breaking and entering. It would be a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">Q. Now, when you pulled the truck over, then, subsequently, did you still believe that this individual was involved in any type of violation of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">A. Yes, sir, I did. I believe that he was in the process of something at this home, either a breakin or stealing, a larceny, from this home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-12\">Q. When you pulled the truck over, Officer Petit, was it your intention to arrest the individual involved regardless of what was said by this individual to you upon investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-13\">A. No, sir. At that time, I didn\u2019t have any real sufficient grounds to arrest this party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfT\">Q.

He was arrested on the basis that he did not have ownership of this vehicle or shipping orders or ownership of the parts in the back of this vehicle.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b103-18\">. In the affidavit filed in support of the application for a search warrant Officer Petit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-19\">At this time it was reported to your affiant by Special Agent Louis Vernazza, F.B.I., Detroit, that Mr. Frank Gamaro, President, P &amp; D Manufacturing Company, Long Island City, New York, had been reached by telephone and reported that 40,000 Autolite Automobile Electrical Points had been stolen from a derailed box car in Allentown, Pennsylvania on November 14, 1970.
