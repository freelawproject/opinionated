Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b577-15\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b577-16\">In this trademark and unfair competition case, Holinone, Inc. appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction, 341 F.Supp.1241, D.C. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-17\">Holinone began using the name \u201cThe Hole-in-One Club\u201d in connection with sponsoring golfing events and related services for members. The name was subsequently registered as a trademark. It has also been used to identify golf balls, playing cards and other goods promoted and distributed by Holinone. On July 21, 1971 International Hole-In-One Club, Inc. was organized and began offering services similar to those offered by Holinone.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Holinone brought suit for infringement of its trademark and for unfair competition by International. The district court denied a motion for preliminary injunction holding that the trademark was descriptive and therefore incapable of being exclusively owned. The court also found that Holinone would not suffer irreparable injury and concluded that the evidence was insufficient to prove unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\"> On an appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction our scope of review is limited to a determination of whether there was a clear abuse of discretion by the district court. Johnson v. Radford, 5 Cir. 1971, 449 F.2d 115, 116; Allen v. Mississippi Commission of Law Enforcement, 5 Cir. 1970, 424 F.2d 285, 290; United States v. Edwards, 5 Cir. 1964, 333 F.2d 575, 578-579. We find no such abuse present here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-18\">. We expressly disclaim any intention of now passing upon the correctness <em>vel non </em>of the district court\u2019s ruling that \u201cthe Hole-In-One Club\u201d was invalidly admitted to trademark registration because it was descriptive and had not acquired a secondary meaning. We make this explicit because we recognize that this preliminary determination could have influenced the decision of the district court not to grant preliminary injunctive relief. This affirmance is based solely upon the breadth of the district court\u2019s discretion in this type of matter. The plaintiff should in no wise be limited upon remand in its development of this point in connection with seeking permanent relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
