We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Viewed most favorably to the government, the evidence shows that in February, 1968 Bruekman paid Captain Vivian of the Illinois National Guard a $300 bribe for a promise to provide Bruckman with membership in the Guard so as to avoid the draft. Captain Vivian thereafter sent a false report to Bruckman\u2019s Local Board, indicating that Bruekman was a member of the Guard. The Board sent notice of the I-D classification (Member of Reserve) to Bruckman on April 11, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Further: Bruekman never received clothing or an identification card from the National Guard unit. He never attended a meeting, never heard from anyone connected with the Guard, and never inquired of the Guard concerning his status. On June 18, 1968 Bruekman\u2019s friend Krumhorn, who had also bribed Captain Vivian prior to Bruekman\u2019s doing so, was told by the FBI that the Guard unit in which both had anticipated membership was not in existence. Krumhorn told this to Bruekman that same day. At no time up to his November, 1969 I-A reclassification did Bruckman ever inform his Local Board that he was not a member of the Guard unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">'Bruekman was indicted September 24, 1970, and his trial and conviction followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">The indictment charges Bruekman with commission of the offense \u201con or about March 28, 1968.\u201d The offense specified was that he did \u201cknowingly and wilfully fail, neglect and refuse\u201d to give notice to his Local Board of a change in his military status (i. <em>e., </em>that he was not a member of the Illinois National Guard).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">The first question raised is whether Bruekman had a continuing duty to report to the Board that he was not a member of the National Guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">The question rises upon Bruckman\u2019s contention that the government did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he \u201cknowingly and wilfully\u201d failed to notify the Board of his non-membership in the Guard, since at the time he received his I-D classification he thought he was a member, by virtue of the bribe, and accordingly was unaware of any breach of duty to report the change of military status under 32 C.F. R. 1641.7(a). But the government argues that under 1641.7(a) and 1642.2 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the offense charged was a \u201ccontinuing\u201d one. It claims that proof of Bruckman\u2019s violation of duty at any time between his I-D classification (April, 1968) and his I-A reclassification (November, 1969) supports the conviction. We hold that Bruekman had a continuing duty to report the change in his military status, commencing at the time he first learned that he was not a member of the Guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-16\">In Silverman v. United States, 220 F.2d 36, 39 (8th Cir. 1955), the defendant was indicted in September, 1953 for failure to report for induction June 6, 1951. On appeal the court found no error in the district court\u2019s instruction to the jury that \u2014 although the indictment charged failure to report June 6, 1951 \u2014the offense was a continuing one under 32 C.F.R. 1642.2, and that Silverman could be convicted of knowingly failing to report any time thereafter of the date of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-17\">Subsequent to <em>Silverman </em>numerous courts have held that a registrant who <em>fails to report for induction </em>as ordered is under a continuing duty thereafter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>report. United States v. Williams, 433 F.2d 1305, 1306 (9th Cir. 1970); United States v. Preston, 420 F.2d 60 (5th Cir. 1969); Simmons v. United States, 406 F.2d 456, 463 (5th Cir. 1969); White v. United States, 403 F.2d 1005, 1007 (8th Cir. 1968). Other courts have held that a potential inductee who <em>fails to register </em>within five days of his eighteenth birthday is under a continuing duty to register (32 C.F.R. 1611.7(c), 1642.2) with his Board, United States v. Owens, 431 F.2'd 349, 351 (5th Cir. 1970); that a registrant who <em>fails to report for his physical examination </em>as ordered is under a continuing duty to report once he is aware of the outstanding order, United States v. De Narvaez, 407 F.2d 185, 187 (2nd Cir. 1969); and that a registrant who <em>fails to advise his Local Board of a change of address </em>is thereafter under a continuing duty to notify the Board of an address where he can be reached, Venus v. United States, 287 F.2d 304, 309 (9th Cir. 1960), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 368 U.S. 345, 82 S.Ct. 384, 7 L.Ed.2d 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Bruckman has not persuaded us that the line of cases noted above has been overcome in Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S. 112, 90 S.Ct. 858, 25 L.Ed.2d 156 (1970); see <em>Owens, supra; Williams, supra. </em>In <em>Toussie </em>the defendant failed to register with his Local Board within five days of his eighteenth birthday (June 23, 1959). The government argued that since he failed to register up to his twenty-sixth birthday (June 23, 1967), the offense was \u201ccontinuing\u201d so that he could be indicted any time after that birthday within the five year statute of limitations. \u201cThe [Supreme] Court disagreed and held that the statute began to run on all possible violations five days after the defendant\u2019s eighteenth birthday. This was squarely based upon reasoning that the continuing duty regulation could not be construed to have the effect of varying the congressional policy of barring any prosecution for this offense five years after it was first committed.\u201d <em>Owens, supra, </em>431 F.2d at 351. The Supreme Court in <em>Toussie </em>thought that in the light of the history of presidential proclamations setting specific dates for registration, of its own decisions and of congressional policy the \u201cdoctrine of continuing offenses should be applied in only limited circumstances\u201d and should not be applied to the offense of failure to register unless explicitly required in the statute involved or by the nature of the crime itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">In the case before us, however, there is no statute of limitations problem. We are not presented with the \u201ccompounding of a single offense into a multitude for purposes of avoiding the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>433 F.2d at 1306. Furthermore, the Court in <em>Toussie </em>did not, as Bruckman contends, invalidate the continuing duty regulation. As the court in <em>Owens </em>stated, 431 F.2d at 351:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-9\">The Court did not . . . outlaw the continuing duty regulation; rather, it explicitly excepted it from the sweep of the opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">The exception referred to was footnote 17 in <em>Toussie:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-12\">We do not hold, as the dissent seems to imply . . . that the continuing duty regulation is unauthorized by the Act. All we hold is that neither the regulation nor the Act itself requires that failure to register be treated as the type of offense that effectively extends the statute of limitations. 397 U.S. at 121, n. 17, 90 S.Ct. at 864.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">\u2019B.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">Bruckman contends that the government failed to prove that he violated \u00a7 462(a) \u201con or about March 28, 1968\u201d as charged in the indictment, and that proof of the offense on another date was a fatal variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">It was not necessary that the indictment charge Bruckman with failure to fulfill his continuing duty to notify his Board. <em>Preston, supra, </em>420 F.2d at 62. It was sufficient that it charged him with knowing failure to report his changed military status \u201con or about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>March 28, 1968\u201d in violation of \u00a7 462(a), which provides a penalty for violation of the continuing duty regulation here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">We cannot see that Bruckman was prejudiced in any way by the date alleged in the indictment. The specific date was not of the essence of the offense, and was within the statute of limitations. <em>Owens, supra, </em>431 F.2d at 350; Ledbetter v. United States, 170 U.S. 606, 613, 18 S.Ct. 774, 42 L.Ed. 1162 (1898); Lelies v. United States, 241 F.2d 21, 25 (9th Cir. 1957); Whiteside v. United States, 346 F.2d 500, 503-504 (8th Cir. 1965); United States v. Covington, 411 F.2d 1087 (4th Cir. 1969) (6 month variance) ; United States v. Kerr, 439 F.2d 689 (9th Cir. 1971) (2 month variance) ; United States v. Roberts, 466 F.2d 193 (7th Cir., decided August 3, 1972); see 1 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 125 at 247 (1969); Moore, Federal Practice \u00a7 7.05 [1] at 7-25 (1972). Bruckman was not misled and could prepare his defense for any date after that alleged in the indictment until the date of the indictment. <em>Silver-man, supra-, </em>see also <em>Whiteside, supra. </em>And we see no possible double jeopardy danger to Bruckman.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">We hold there was no fatal variance between the charge in the indictment and the proof at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">We see no merit in Bruckman\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew he was not a member of the National Guard. On June 18, 1968 Krumhorn learned from the FBI that there was no Guard unit in which they had been promised membership by Vivian, and that both he and Bruckman had been hoaxed. Krumhorn told this to Bruckman the same day and Bruckman exclaimed: \u201cOh my God, what am I going to do.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Furthermore, the judge was entitled to determine that it was unlikely that Bruckman and Krumhorn\u2014 sophisticated enough to bribe Vivian\u2014 could be so naive as to rely, without checking, on Vivian\u2019s vague statements and assertions of their membership in the Guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Finally, we see no merit in Bruckman\u2019s argument that the court erred in not dismissing the indictment on the ground that had he informed the Board that he was not a member of the Guard he would have risked incriminating himself in violation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">The district court decided, and we agree, that the scope of Bruckman\u2019s duty was simply to report that his military status was changed since he was not a member of the Guard. Bruckman was under no need or coercion to make reference to his bribery of Vivian. The information he was required to give, therefore, would not per se \u201cconfront [Bruckman] with \u2018substantial hazards of self-incrimination.\u2019 \u201d California v. Byers, 402 U.S. 424, 429, 91 S.Ct. 1535, 29 L.Ed.2d 9 (1971). The decisions in Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968); and Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968), cited by Bruckman, are distinguished from his case. In each of those cases the \u201cprivilege was applied only in \u2018an area permeated with criminal statutes\u2019 \u2014 not in an \u2018essentially non-criminal and regulatory area of inquiry.\u2019 \u201d <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. at 430, 91 S.Ct. at 1539. The Selective Service System is essentially noncriminal and regulatory. Bruckman\u2019s duty to inform the Board of change in his military status is an essential burden on all registrants in order to facilitate administration of the Act to achieve a necessary national purpose. It is \u201cessentially a neutral act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 91 S.Ct. 1535. The \u201cpossibilities\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>of incrimination arising from performance of duty by Bruckman cannot defeat the \u201cstrong policies in favor of a disclosure\u201d of the information called for by the authorized regulation before us. <em>Id. </em>at 428, 91 S.Ct. at 1538.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The district court did not err in denying Bruckman\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on the Fifth Amendment ground urged in the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b827-9\">. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 451, et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b827-10\">. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462(a) punishes with a maximum of five years imprisonment and a fine of not more than $10,000 \u201cany person charged . . . with the duty of carrying out any of the provisions of this title [III] or the rules or regulations . . . thereunder, who shall knowingly fail or neglect to perform such duty, . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b827-22\">. 32 C.F.R. 1641.7(a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-23\">\n<em>Reporting by Registrants of Their Current Status.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-24\">It shall be the duty of every classified registrant to keep his local board currently informed of his . . . military status. . . .
