He complains of the failure of prison officials to meet minimum medical needs <em>subsequent </em>to his discharge from hospitalization. His present life expectancy is alleged to be less than two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\"> The district court treated petitioner\u2019s pleadings as an application for habeas corpus relief (28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254) and as an action to secure civil rights (42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983). After considering the written response of the State of Alabama, the court dismissed the cause without a hearing. To the extent that the petitioner sought habeastype relief in the form of a court compelled transfer to a particular prison institution, the action of the court is affirmed. However, to the extent that the petitioner alleges a <em>present </em>daily lack of medical attention and medication which both produces intolerable pain and further shortens his life expectancy, dismissal on the pleadings was improper regardless of the medical strength of the showing made by the State as to <em>past </em>medical efforts. The proper disposition of this part of this case is controlled by Campbell v. Beto, 460 F.2d 765 (5th Cir. 1972) and Williams v. Wainwright, 460 F.2d 1080 (5th Cir. 1972), rather than by Flint v. Wainwright, 433 F.2d 961 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">Affirmed in part, and in part vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-11\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this case summarily. See Groendyke Transport, Inc. v. Davis, 5 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d <em>1158.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
