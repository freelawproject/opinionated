ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">The question for decision is whether' the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission erred in conditioning further consideration of a fare increase for a financially ailing carrier upon satisfaction of requirements designed to improve its service. We hold that, in the circumstances presented, the Commission\u2019s action is legally unobjectionable. We accordingly affirm the orders under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-21\">I. BACKGROUND OF THE LITIGATION</p>\n<p id=\"b468-22\">\n<em>The Administrative Proceeding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-23\">On December 28, 1971, D.C. Transit System, Inc. (Transit), filed two tariffs <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2with the Commission which alternatively designated changes in its fares for regular-route transportation of passengers in the District of Columbia and its Maryland and Virginia suburbs. The filings were accompanied by data indicating a net operating loss during an historical twelve-month period ending September 30, 1971, and forecasting another loss during a corresponding period ending April 30, 1973. To enable a suitable return in the future annual period, Transit proposed a variety of fare increases, notably for its intra-District cash and token patrons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Transit designated January 27, 1972, as the date on which the new fares would take effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-24\">Transit submitted with the tariffs a motion for fare raise pending determination by the Commission of the general increment it sought. The Commission denied the motion, holding that an interim advance would not serve the public interest, and set hearings to begin at an early date. On January 26, 1972, the Commission suspended Transit\u2019s newly-filed tariffs through April 26, and on April 25 further suspended them until May 26. The hearings commenced in mid-February and, with numerous parties participating extended well into May.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ****On May 19, the Commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>with one member dissenting,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> promulgated its primary order, No. 1216,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> denying a fare increase, and by Order No. 1219,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> issued on June 16, denied reconsideration of that ruling. These are the principal orders now under review.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Since we later examine the Commission\u2019s orders closely, we confine our recitation at this stage to their highlights. The Commission, on preliminary examination of the financial data submitted by Transit, discerned a probable need for additional revenues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission found, however, that management decisions over the years had left Transit with an unstable financial structure which in turn had contributed substantially to an operation presently uneconomical and inefficient and a service seriously deteriorated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the Commission\u2019s view, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> required it to insure not only the reasonableness of rates permitted regulated carriers but also the economy, efficiency and adequacy of their service to the public.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Commission concluded that it could not discharge its responsibilities by granting Transit a fare raise without prior demonstration of Transit\u2019s willingness to ameliorate its financial situation by capital funding from sources other than its fareboxes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Attributing Transit\u2019s financial plight more largely to management than to insufficient revenues,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and recounting a nine-year history of recalcitrance despite exhortation to remedy its ills,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Commission found a lack of assurance that corrective measures would be adopted even if it established funding requirements concurrently with an award of higher fares.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The sole alternative, the Commission decided, was the company\u2019s acquisition of new capital as a precondition to any such addition<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-21\">On these grounds, the Commission, in Order No. 1216, found that the fare increases set forth in Transit\u2019s tariff filings were unjust and unreasonable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It ruled that, as a condition precedent to any elevation of fares, Transit must generate $6.4 million in new capital and allocate it to debt retirement and bus purchases in designated amounts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It directed that, pending compliance, Transit continue to charge the regular-route fares then in effect.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As already men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>tioned, Transit subsequently<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> applied for reconsideration,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which by Order No. 1219 the Commission denied,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and the proceeding before us is for review of those orders.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We denied a motion by Transit for extraordinary relief pending review<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and, with excellent cooperation from counsel, have expedited our consideration on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\n<em>The Loconto Reports</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A43\">In reaching its conclusions, the Commission drew heavily upon the results of an in-depth study of Transit\u2019s financial condition. The Commission had ordered the study made with a view to assessing the full implications and isolating the underlying causes of Transit\u2019s condition.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The study was made by Pasquale A. Loconto, a partner in a consulting firm employed by the Commission for the purpose. Loconto probed into Transit\u2019s financial history, analyzed its capital and debt structures, reached conclusions as to the need for improvements and formulated recommendations as to the steps by which financial stability might be achieved.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Loconto prepared a report, which was placed in the administrative record, and he also appeared as an expert witness in the proceeding and stood cross-examination on the conclusions and recommendations of his report.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> What we now summarize are the Commission\u2019s discussions of the report, and the findings it based thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">Loconto called attention to substantial increases in Transit\u2019s current and long-term liabilities and' accompanying declines in reserves and retained earnings.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> He also identified, as concomitants of steadily growing operating revenues, heightening operating revenue deductions, fluctuating operating income, and constantly rising interest ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>pense <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u2014 the latter, by the Commission\u2019s appraisal, \u201ca major contributing factor in Transit\u2019s poor profit picture.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> A drop in Transit\u2019s current ratio \u2014 the relationship of current assets to current liabilities \u2014 \u201cindicates an extreme lack of liquidity,\u201d said Loconto, and \u201clittle provision for unevenness in the flow of funds available to meet current liabilities.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> \u201cIf,\u201d Loconto continued, \u201cthat flow should decline even temporarily, a condition of insolvency could conceivably result.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The ratio of Transit\u2019s debt to stockholder\u2019s equity, the relationship of funds generated by operations to interest coverage and long-term debt, and the percentage of stockholders' equity to total assets, as well as other relationships examined by Loconto, \u201csimilarly indicated a worsening financial picture for D. C. Transit.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In Loconto\u2019s opinion, \u201c[t]he combination of trends presented . . . indicates that the financial condition of the company has been steadily declining during recent years.\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">Loeonto\u2019s analysis of capital structure included a comparison with ten other privately-owned transit companies on a number of financial aspects.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>comparisons led to Loconto\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat the structure of the company is quite different from other companies in the industry\u201d and that \u201c[b]y all means, the differences are toward a structure that is more risky and less financially sound.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Loconto pointed out that a relatively large portion of Transit\u2019s assets were fixed and primarily nonoperating, generally yielding comparatively little return to Transit.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Loconto also noted that debt servicing requirements had increased with increasing debt, and that Transit, lacking sufficient funds from operations to meet those requirements, had been driven to \u201crefinancing debt rather than paying it off.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> \u201cThis refinancing practice,\u201d said the Commission, \u201cin turn creates what Loconto called a \u2018high risk\u2019 situation because there is the chance that the creditors will be unwilling to refinance the debt, will call it instead, and there will not be funds available to pay it.\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> There was also a mixture of short- and long-term debt disclosing the financing of long-term assets with short-term and intermediate-term financing \u2014 by the Commission\u2019s characterization, \u201ca poor business practice.\u201d <footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">On the basis of his analysis, Loconto identified four problems fundamental to achieving financial stability in Transit\u2019s case. These the Commission described thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">First, he said some correction must be made in the fact of excessive short-term debt in relation to long-term debt. Also requiring correction was the problem of the excessive debt in relation to stockholders\u2019 equity. Since debt service demands are fixed and must be met, while there is discretion in whether stockholders will receive return when earnings are insufficient, the debt-equity ratio should be reduced. The third area of concern was the fact of the excessive non-earning assets. The consultant noted that the earnings of these assets, largely subsidiary real estate corporations, were very small in relation to their value. He also noted that there are on the books of those subsidiaries $3.1 million in accounts receivable in the form of loans to affiliates and former affiliates. These loans apparently are non-interest bearing. Thus, there appear to be assets in the form of receivables of the subsidiary corporations which could be recalled and made available to the parent operating company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">The fourth problem is the inadequacy of funds provided by operations. This problem obviously can only be cured by increased farebox revenues of subsidization of farebox revenues from the taxpayer. However, the consultant points out that even a considerable increase in net income from this source would not be adequate to make principal payments due within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the coming year, which are in excess . of $5 million.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Loconto also submitted specific recommendations designed to strengthen Transit\u2019s ailing financial situation: reduction of current liabilities by $5 million during the first future annual period and eventually by $11 million; reduction of long-term debt by $4 million during the future annual period and ultimately by $8 million; and the acquisition of $3 million for the purchase of new buses.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> He suggested, as potential sources for the needed funds, the calling of $3 million lent by Transit\u2019s subsidiaries,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> possible sale of properties classified as operating properties but actually nonoperating <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and an increase of paid-in capital.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The latter step, it was said, \u201cmight well be justified because the initial capitalization was \u2018exceedingly small\u2019 and dividends of $4.4 million were paid out despite the fact that Transit had a low level of stockholders\u2019 equity.\u201d <footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\n<em>The Commission\u2019s Orders</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">By the Commission\u2019s assessment, \u201cthe record show[ed] clearly and in great detail Transit\u2019s seriously unstable and risky financial condition,\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and this, the Commission found, bred an uneconomical and inefficient transportation operation and a resulting deterioration in service.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The Commission summarized :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-14\">The record here shows that the present capital structure and debt structure of Transit do not reflect economic and efficient management. Non-operating assets have not been employed as advantageously to the parent operating company as prudent management practice would dictate. Under its current capital and debt structures, Transit is unable to provide and replenish the basic tools of its trade, its rolling stock. Its chronic cash-short condition results in too few drivers, too few mechanics, too few bus cleaners, and too high an incidence of failure to provide basic service. We consider' that less than efficient management. The unnecessarily high debt service requirement is uneconomic. Operating on the brink of insolvency is surely not efficient and economic.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-15\">The Commission further elucidated the connection between Transit\u2019s financial instability and its mediocre operation and service by adverting to specific examples. Two years previously, the Commission had granted Transit a 25 percent increase <footnotemark>50</footnotemark> in the basic District of Columbia fare, and had concurrently ordered Transit to escrow $620,000 over a six-month period as a 20 percent down-payment on the purchase of 85 new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>buses.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Transit never acquired the buses, admittedly for the reason that it was unable to obtain an 80 percent extension of credit.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> While some financing was available with a downpayment approaching 50 percent, the escrow fund would have enabled acquisition of only 35 buses on those terms.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> In the meantime, Transit\u2019s bus fleet aged considerably, with the adverse consequences inevitably attendant upon operation of antiquated buses.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> As previously stated,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> the Commission noted that Transit\u2019s too-small working capital has resulted in too few drivers, mechanics and bus cleaners, and consequent shortcomings in its service.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Overall, the Commission found that \u201cthe continued deterioration of the company\u2019s cash position has already caused a substantial deterioration in the service which it offers the public,\u201d <footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and \u201cthat unless this situation [is] remedied, service will continue to deteriorate to <em>unacceptable </em>levels.\u201d <footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The Commission further found that Transit\u2019s \u201cuneconomical and inefficient method of operation, and the resulting deterioration in service, could not be remedied merely with a fare increase,\u201d <footnotemark>59</footnotemark> and its orders delineated justifications. As it said on reconsideration,</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Transit\u2019s financial instability is due largely to management decisions which are the critical factors in creating the present unsatisfactory financial structure. The Loeonto report and testimony identified corporate decisions, not inadequate fare revenues, as the major factor in Transit\u2019s present financial instability. We concluded that additional funds, not increased fares alone, were required to remedy this situation. Here again, the expert testimony showed that the company\u2019s major need was additional funding from sources other than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>farebox, and, as we made clear in Order 1216, we agree.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKM\">The Commission also discovered that its efforts to set fares which would meet the Compact\u2019s guidelines<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> \u201chas produced only frustration. For any fare that would cover reasonable expenses and provide a reasonable return would clearly not provide either the form or the substance of financial stability.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The Commission further concluded that it could not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">assure, simply by adjusting the fare, the continued adequacy of the company\u2019s service. Experience, particularly since the last fare increase of July 1970, and the facts of record submitted in this case, demonstrate that even if the fare were to be increased in the full amount requested by D.C. Transit, little if any improvement could be expected in what has been shown to be the very unstable financial condition of this company.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">This state of affairs, Transit\u2019s application for higher fares, posed something of a dilemma for the Commission. In its words,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">What we see in the future if we increase the fare and do nothing more, is continued instability and a deterioration in the level and quality of service offered. In these circumstances, raising the fare would be asking the ratepayer to meet his obligation to the company without requiring the company to meet its obligation to the ratepayer. We do not perceive the Compact or the Constitution as imposing a unilateral obligation on the ratepayer. Rather, we believe that the ratepayer and the company have a reciprocal obligation. We believe that obligation requires that the company give evidence that it can perform the services expected of it so that the ratepayer, in return for his contribution, will receive full value in the <em>form </em>of full services.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-17\">The Commission then arrived at what it believed to be \u201cthe overriding and threshold question that we face in this case[:] can financial stability be restored to this company so that we may establish a rate which is \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 to all concerned ?\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> In the Commission\u2019s judgment, \u201cthe answer lies in the willingness of the company to alter the capital and debt structures of the company in the manner suggested by the Loconto report, i. e. through the application of funds needed to correct the financial imbalance Loconto identified.\u201d <footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-18\">Thus the Commission came to frame directives to achieve the solution it deemed appropriate. Referring to the Loconto recommendation that $12 million be infused into Transit\u2019s capital structure during the future annual period,<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> the Commission was \u201cfully agree [d] that debt must be reduced, not increased, and therefore new buses should be purchased for cash.\u201d It accordingly set $3 million for that purpose.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Because Transit already held $620,000 in escrow for bus purchases, this meant a net of $2.4 million.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Additionally, the Commission specified $4 million for reduction of outstanding debt.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> The aggregate of $6.4 million, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the Commission ruled, will be a precondition to any increase in fares.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> It explained :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">In the past, when we have directed the company to take certain actions, performance has not always been forthcoming. This is most notably true in the bus purchase program.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> We have no confidence that if we were to require the company to produce new revenue as a concurrent .condition with granting a fare increase the new capital would be produced. Transit\u2019s attempt to assure us that they are taking some steps to correct the capital and debt situation are not sufficient. We will require assurances in the form of actual performance.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\n<em>The Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In succeeding parts of this opinion, we deal with the issues Transit tenders for decision. We have arranged them in a logical progression of inquiries, grouped in three categories. Those in the first group relate to the procedural regularity of the Commission\u2019s action. Was the Commission compelled to establish a lawful fare for the future, or was it free to promulgate an order of another type, within the period for which it suspended Transit\u2019s tariffs? Could the Commission, in exercising its ratemaking powers, permissibly investigate the economy and efficiency of Transit\u2019s operation and the adequacy of its service?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">Could the Commission, upon finding that economical, efficient and adequate transportation was not being afforded, direct corrective measures as a condition precedent to further consideration of a fare increase? We examine these problems in Part II. The next several issues involve the substantive validity of the orders. Do the reasons assigned for the Commission\u2019s directives survive claims that they lack evidentiary support? Do the Commission\u2019s findings pass muster? Were the Commission\u2019s preconditions legally warranted by the circumstances proven and found? We treat these matters in Part III. The last issue concerns the constitutional validity of the orders. Does due process of law require a regulatory agency to grant at least a break-even fare to a carrier found to be in default of its obligation to provide economical, efficient and adequate transportation ? We resolve that question in Part IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">II. PROCEDURAL VALIDITY OF THE ORDERS</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">\n<em>Responsibility for Action Within Suspension Period</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">The Compact specifies mechanics for Commission consideration of fare changes proposed by regulated carriers. The process commences with the carrier\u2019s filing of a new tariff showing the changes it contemplates.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The tariff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>must state the date on which it will take effect, which cannot be less than 30 days after the date of filing without authorization by the Commission.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Prior to the effective date of the change, however, the Commission may suspend the new fares for an initial period terminating 90 days after the date on which those fares would otherwise have gone into effect.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The Commission may also extend the suspension period to a maximum of 120 days from the original suspension date.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> The Compact provides that \u201c[i]f, after hearing held on reasonable notice, the Commission finds that any fare ... so suspended is unjust, unreasonable, or unduly preferential or unduly discriminatory either between riders or sections of the Metropolitan District, it shall issue an order prescribing the lawful fare . . . to be in effect.\u201d <footnotemark>78</footnotemark> The Compact further provides that \u201c[i]f no such order is issued within the suspension period (including any extension thereof) the fare, involved shall take effect at the termination of such period.\u201d <footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">As we have mentioned, the Commission suspended Transit\u2019s alternate new-fare proposals for the full 120-day period permitted by the Compact. The parties are agreed, as are we, that the Compact then required the Commission to promulgate, within that period, an order which either (1) approved the new fares or which (2) appropriately (a) found these fares to be unlawful because \u201cunjust, unreasonable, or unduly preferential or unduly discriminatory\u201d and, in the latter event, which (b) proceeded to prescribe the \u201clawful rate.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Transit contends that the orders under review are invalid because they do not establish a \u201clawful fare\u201d to be put into effect by the end of the authorized suspension period. The consequence, Transit argues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>is that as a matter of law \u201cthe fare involved\u201d \u2014 the fare proposed by Transit<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> \u2014 automatically went into effect upon the expiration of that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">We cannot accept Transit\u2019s theory. Within the suspension period indulged by the Compact, the Commission conducted and completed large-scale hearings on the new tariffs submitted by Transit and, by Order No. 1216, announced its decision as to those tariffs. In that order, the Commission found that Transit was derogating from its Compact obligation to furnish economical, efficient and adequate transportation service,<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> and that, for that reason, Transit was not entitled to an adjustment of its fares upward unless and until it remedied the deficiencies.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> As Order No. 1216 expressly states, the Commission thus found that, under those circumstances, \u201cthe fares proposed . by D.C. Transit System, Inc., [are] unjust and unreasonable.\u201d <footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Beyond that, the Commission not only turned down the increases sought by Transit but also specified the conditions which Transit must satisfy as a prerequisite to further consideration of any increase;<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> and Order No. 1216 directs \u201c[t]hat D.C. Transit System, Inc., shall continue to charge the regular route fares presently in effect.\u201d <footnotemark>86</footnotemark> That, we think, was necessarily a conclusion that the existing fare \u2014 that previously established by the Commission \u2014 was the \u201clawful fare\u201d that must continue in force until those conditions are met and a further fare order is promulgated.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">That disposition accords with what we believe the Compact signatories had in mind when they formulated the scheme for Commission handling of new-fare applications. It seems clear that the time limitations on suspensions were designed to assure that the Commission would act on the carrier\u2019s proposals in some appropriate fashion within the 120-day period. It appears equally obvious that those limitations do not afford a guaranty that the rate-making process will necessarily run its full course during that period.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> The Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>mission is required to complete its investigation of proposals and to render its decision within the Compact period. Where the hearings on the proposals develop satisfactorily the basis for outright approval or disapproval of new fares, the Commission is obligated to so decide, and to do so within the time the Compact specifies.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Where, however, the hearings firmly establish the need for action by the carrier as a precondition to a fare change, it becomes the Commission\u2019s responsibility to make, within the mandated period, an order to that effect. The Compact empowers the Commission not only to unconditionally grant or deny requests for new fares, but also \u201cto issue . . . such orders . as it may find necessary or appropriate to carry out [the Compact\u2019s] provisions. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> That authorization imparts to the Commission\u2019s rate-making process more than enough flexibility to accommodate needs to implement the specific demands of the Compact by orders tailored to the exigencies of particular cases.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Here, by the Commission\u2019s analysis, improved service and higher fares were interrelated problems demanding contemporaneous treatment,<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> and as is evident could not possibly be accommodated within the suspension period. Furthermore, the Commission found that \u201cuntil a new capital structure and debt structure are established, we cannot determine certain elements in the ratemaking formula. . \u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> We hold that where, as here, the Commission had found a carrier remiss in its obligations to the traveling public, the Compact does not interpose an inexorable barrier to promulgation, within the time limits fixed, of an appropriate remedial order, nor does it automatically put proposed new fares into operation upon expiration of the period for which they were suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">\n<em>Interrelationship of Service and Rate-making Obligations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AZx\">Interpreting pertinent provisions of the Compact,<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> the Commission held that it is \u201crequired, in passing upon a rate application, to consider and weigh not only the interests of the company, including its right to a reasonable return on its investment, but also the interests of the public, including the public\u2019s right to economical, efficient and adequate transportation services.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> This construction by the Commission of its own authorizing legislation would in any event command substantial deference in the courts<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> In our view, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>rived upon independent investigation, it is eminently correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The Compact directs and empowers the Commission to proscribe \u201cjust and reasonable fares,\u201d <footnotemark>96</footnotemark> an entitlement immensely valuable to the carriers it regulates.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> But the Compact also specifies that \u201c[i]n the exercise of its power to prescribe [such] fares, . . . the Commission shall give due consideration\u201d to four enumerated factors, among others,<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> two of which have special relevance to the issue at hand. One is \u201cthe need, in the public interest, of adequate and efficient transportation service by [regulated] carriers at the lowest cost consistent with the furnishing of such service.\u201d <footnotemark>99</footnotemark> The other is \u201cthe need of revenues sufficient to enable such carriers, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to provide, such service.\u201d <footnotemark>100</footnotemark> The parties to the Compact could hardly have more plainly mandated the well settled principle that ratemaking appropriately encompasses an examination and evaluation of the economy and efficiency of a public utility\u2019s operations<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> and the adequacy of its service.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>It is equally clear that the obligations of carrier and rider here at stake are interrelated and reciprocal. The carrier\u2019s responsibility is \u201cadequate and efficient transportation service at the cheapest fares feasible,<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> and the rider\u2019s is to pay no more.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> The carrier is entitled to revenues enabling provision of that service, but only to the ex-tent needed under \u201chonest, economical, and efficient management.\u201d <footnotemark>105</footnotemark> It is not entitled under the Compact to a fare . . \u201e raise ^respective of the quality of its operation and service. As the Commission, consistently with the weight of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>administrative<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> and judicial<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> authority elsewhere, declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">Upon a showing that it is now providing, and may in the future reasonably be expected to continue to provide, the economical, efficient and adequate transportation service to which the public is entitled, the carrier, in turn, is normally entitled to a fare which will produce a reasonable return. But where, as in this case, the record demonstrates that the carrier is in default with respect to its obligations under Section 6(a)(3) of the Compact, it is not entitled to a fare increase as a matter of law.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The Commission has both the authority and the duty to assure that this reciprocity is maintained in practice. We have had occasion in the past to point out that the mandate that \u201cjust and reasonable fares\u201d be set is itself \u201ca standard which has invariably imposed an obligation to balance the interests of both the utility and the consumers.\u201d <footnotemark>109</footnotemark> As the Compact makes evident, the Commission\u2019s charge extends to the caliber of the carrier\u2019s operation and service as well as to the financial reasonableness of the fares it collects.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> In the Commission\u2019s view, its \u201cresponsibility to protect the public interest is at least equal to [its] obligation to consider [the carrier\u2019s] interest.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> In our own view, it is certainly no less.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">\n<em>Authority to Precondition Fare Increase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">The Commission is amply authorized to take action reasonably necessary to insure the performance of obligations which the Compact imposes on carriers. The Compact provides that it \u201cshall be liberally construed to eliminate the evils described therein and to effectuate the purposes thereof.\u201d <footnotemark>113</footnotemark> As we have noted, the Compact also confers upon the Commission \u201cpower to . . . issue . . such orders . . . as it may find necessary or appropriate to carry out\u201d its provisions.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> Like the Commission, we find within the Compact a positive mandate, applicable to ratemaking proceedings as well as others, that carriers provide, economically and efficiently, adequate transportation for the traveling public.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">The orders under attack precondition further Commission consideration of any new fare increase for Transit upon the latter\u2019s acquisition of new capital in substantial amount.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> Satisfaction of that precondition, in the Commission\u2019s judgment, is essential to the economical and efficient provision of adequate trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>portation to Transit\u2019s patrons.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> Transit argues that nonetheless a precondition order was beyond its regulatory authority. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Nobody seems to doubt the Commission\u2019s power to promulgate an order which simply directs a carrier to take measures necessary and appropriate to fulfillment of the Commission\u2019s responsibilities.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> Nor is there room for doubting the validity of an order which gives such a direction concurrently with a grant of a fare increase;<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> indeed, the Commission has frequently issued orders of that type.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> The sole question at this point is whether the Commission can insist upon compliance with such a condition prior to further treatment of an application for approval of higher fares. We answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">Preconditions to fare increases designed to assure quality of service have long been recognized. More than a half-century ago, the Commission\u2019s predecessor, the Public Utilities Commission of the District of Columbia, turned down an otherwise justified fare increase on a showing of inadequacy of the Carrier\u2019s service notwithstanding that operating losses were inevitable without the increase.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> Since then, commentators have advocated such preconditions,<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> and regulatory agencies have imposed<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> and courts have sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>them.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> Sometimes the order has set new rates and simultaneously suspended them pending demonstration of satisfactory compliance with the condition ;<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> at other times, the order, as those here, has withheld consideration of the request for increase until the condition has been met.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> That the order assumes one or the other form is obviously without consequence insofar as its essential validity is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">We perceive no legal barrier to an order by the Commission, securely founded upon an evidentiary record, preconditioning a fare raise upon terms, calculated to safeguard the public interest in economical, efficient and adequate transportation.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> The legislative imposition of a grave responsibility ordinarily carries with it, as a matter of necessary implication, power to employ the means by which it may be discharged.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> In this, instance, the signatories to the Compact incorporated that thesis in an express grant of administrative authority.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> By our measure, that authority \u2014 to take action \u201cnecessary or appropriate to carry out\u201d the Compact\u2019s provisions<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> \u2014 is broad enough to enable the Commission to meet its regulatory responsibilities in this case. As the Commission said:</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">We construe the Compact as vesting us with the necessary tools to enable us to discharge our responsibility to the public and insure that it obtains from carriers subject to our jurisdiction economic, efficient and adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>service. Surely, Congress and the Compact signatories did not impose upon us a duty to consider and protect the public interest, on the one hand, and then fetter us with a statutory scheme so rigid and unyielding as to make impossible the responsible discharge of that duty, on the other hand.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">III. SUBSTANTIVE VALIDITY OF THE ORDERS</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The Commission found inefficiency in Transit\u2019s management, inadequacies in its service, and a relation of cause and effect between the two.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> These findings, as we have indicated, were based principally on data and analyses presented in the Loconto report and elucidated by Loconto as a witness at the hearings.<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> Transit asserts that the findings lack substantial support in the evidence considered as a whole<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> and, in that connection, that the Commission erred in crediting the evidence Loconto supplied. We deem these arguments unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Transit did not object to admission of Loconto\u2019s report in evidence, nor to his competence as a witness. It did not move to strike either the report or the testimony. For these reasons, the Commission, on Transit\u2019s application for reconsideration, felt that Transit\u2019s credibility objection came too late.<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> It nonetheless examined the reasons in support of Transit\u2019s arguments and concluded that they were \u201cwholly inadequate.\u201d <footnotemark>136</footnotemark> Transit did not include among the numerous assignments of error in its application for reconsideration any other specification that the findings on managment inefficiency and service inadequacy were not sufficiently supported by the vidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">The Compact confers upon those affected by final Commission orders the privilege of requesting reconsideration.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> The process is inaugurated by \u201can application in writing requesting a reconsideration of the matter's involved, and stating specifically the errors claimed as grounds for such reconsideration.\u201d <footnotemark>138</footnotemark> The Compact provides, however, that \u201c[n]o person shall in any court urge or rely on aiiy ground not so set forth in such application.\u201d<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> We search Transit\u2019s application for reconsideration in vain for anything \u201cstating specifically\u201d an insufficiency of supporting evidence as a ground for disturbing the Commission\u2019s findings on the caliber of Transit\u2019s management and service.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">The Compact requirement that errors charged on reconsideration be pinpointed is not an empty formality. It subserves the same considerations fostered by the companion rule that contentions to be urged on appellate review of judicial proceedings be properly raised and preserved in the trial court.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark> Not the least of those considerations is the opportunity, through precise identification of the errors alleged, for administrative reexamination and correction prior to judicial intervention in the regulatory process.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> We have long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>admonished that points not subjected to agency scrutiny during administrative proceedings will not normally be entertained on judicial review.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> That admonition, we have held, extends to claims that administrative findings are unsupported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> Transit\u2019s insufficiency-of-evidenee argument is properly before us only on the challenge to Loconto,<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"> No less in administrative than in judicial tribunals is it the factfinder\u2019s function to make the primary assessment as to the weight to be accorded particular items of evidence. Credibility determinations within the agency\u2019s sphere of expertise are peculiarly within its province, and courts will upset them only if made irrationally.<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> Our canvass of Transit\u2019s objections to Loconto\u2019s report and testimony gives us no cause to overrule the Commission on that score. We are mindful that there was evidence from which the Commission arguably might have concluded that Transit\u2019s operations are economically and efficiently conducted and its transportation service adequate, but \u201cit is not a valid objection that conflicts in the evidence might conceivably have been resolved differently, or other inferences drawn from the same record.\u201d<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> We sustain the Commission\u2019s findings on this branch of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-16\">\n<em>Basis for Imposition of Precondition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-17\">Transit argues strenuously that the Commission erred in constructing its funding requirement as a condition precedent to further consideration of fare increases rather than as a condition to be met concurrently with the enjoyment of higher fares. We do not agree. We have already satisfied ourselves that the Commission has power to impose preconditions as well as concurrent conditions in fare proceedings.<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> We are also satisfied that the Commission was well within its regulatory province, after diagnosing Transit\u2019s financial sickness,<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> in prescribing an effective rather than a doubtful cure.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> Our function as a reviewing tribunal is limited to determining whether the remedy selected by the Commission is arbitrary or unreasonable.<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s prescription easily survives that test.<footnotemark>151</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Order No. 1216 reflects the mature consideration the Commission gave the question whether a fare-increase order with concurrent conditions would sufficiently safeguard the public interest in economical, efficient and adequate transportation.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark> For four reasons, enlarged upon in its order on reconsideration, the Commission was persuaded that it would not.<footnotemark>153</footnotemark> The first was the Commission\u2019s conclusion, predicated on the results of the Loeonto investigation, that \u201ccorporate decisions, not inadequate fare revenues, [were] the major factor in Transit\u2019s present financial instability,\u201d with the consequence \u201cthat additional funds, not increased fares alone, were required to remedy this situation.\u201d <footnotemark>154</footnotemark> The second was the documented history of Transit\u2019s unwillingness over the years despite the Commission\u2019s urgings, to firm up its shaky financial structure,<footnotemark>155</footnotemark> a \u201chistory [which] forced us to conclude that Transit cannot be relied upon voluntarily to remedy its own financial ills.\u201d<footnotemark>156</footnotemark> Thirdly, with Transit\u2019s failures to comply with prior Commission orders, particularly \u201c[the] outstanding bus' purchase order [which] has directly affected the adequacy of the company\u2019s service,\u201d<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> the Commission could find \u201cno basis to believe that Transit would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>comply with concurrent conditions<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> instead, the Commission \u201cdetermined that [its] precondition order was the only method by which we could assure the public that the company would deliver its part of the reciprocal obligations imposed upon it by the Compact.\u201d <footnotemark>159</footnotemark> Fourthly, the Commission cited its lack of power to insure compliance with a concurrent-condition order by requiring bond indemnifying the public <footnotemark>160</footnotemark> or by ordering reparations in the event of noncompliance<footnotemark>161</footnotemark> as additional factors supporting an order establishing preconditions.<footnotemark>162</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">These reasons, in our view, amply sustain the Commission\u2019s decision to address the problem by conditions precedent to a far adjustment rather than conditions concurrent therewith. The Commission was called upon \u201cto look into the future and determine whether, if rates were adjusted, the public could be reasonably assured that the company would correct the inefficient and uneconomic method of operation which we had identified and provide the adequate service which is the riders\u2019 due.\u201d<footnotemark>163</footnotemark> By the Commission\u2019s appraisal, \u201c[t]he record clearly showed that a fare adjustment alone would not remedy the situation and that if our only order was an adjustment in fares, the result would be continued financial instability and a deterioration in the level and quality of transportation service afforded the pub-lie.\u201d <footnotemark>164</footnotemark> \u201cMere exhortation had not been productive,\u201d the Commission felt, and \u201cdrastic remedial action was required to bring the company\u2019s capital structure into balance to provide the stability necessary to achieve an efficient and economical transit operation.\u201d <footnotemark>165</footnotemark> We find no fault with the Commission's disposition of this aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">To be sure, as Transit says, the Commission might have resorted to some other method of seeking compliance with the Compact\u2019s specifications respecting the quality of Transit\u2019s service. The Commission might, as Transit suggests, have ordered the capital changes it felt necessary and in the event of disobedience have gone to court to enjoin compliance.<footnotemark>166</footnotemark> It might have set the debt-equity ratio it deemed appropriate and then established fares hypothetically on that basis;<footnotemark>167</footnotemark> or it might have granted a fare increase with an accompanying requirement that Transit hold the disputed increment in a special reserve pending fulfillment of its Compact duties.<footnotemark>168</footnotemark> Undoubtedly other techniques in the Commission\u2019s regulatory arsenal were available to ameliorate, in some degree at least, Transit\u2019s current fare plight consistently with an improved response to its service obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-16\">These considerations, however are largely beside the point. The relevant inquiries relate not to the availability of alternatives or the wisdom of shunning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>them, but solely to the legal propriety of the sanction the Commission selected.<footnotemark>169</footnotemark> The Compact, we repeat, empowers the Commission to take such action \u201cas it may find necessary or appropriate to\u201d achieve its objectives.<footnotemark>170</footnotemark> The choice is initially the Commission\u2019s, and we may upset it only if it is unlawful or was capriciously derived.<footnotemark>171</footnotemark> Here the Commission concluded that concurrent conditions would not effectuate the Compact\u2019s goals in terms of Transit\u2019s service. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">Mindful of the fact that our responsibility to protect the public interest is at least equal to our obligation to consider Transit\u2019s interests, we hold that while we may grant a fare increase, and condition that increase on a carrier\u2019s satisfaction of the steps we have found necessary to insure future performance of its statutory obligation to provide economical, efficient and adequate transportation, we are not compelled to do so if we conclude, as we have in this case, that such an order will not provide sufficient assurance that the public will be protected.<footnotemark>172</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Referring to the precondition specified in Order No. 1216, the Commission added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoz\">We were forced to conclude that if fares were adjusted <em>before </em>the company produced the required funds, we would have no basis for insuring that they, in fact, would be forthcoming. This, we held, would be calling upon the bus rider to pay a fare to an inefficiently and uneconomically operated transit company without any assurance that the company would remedy those defects and fulfill its obligation to the rider by providing, in the future, efficient, economical, and adequate transportation. We declined to impose such a one-sided and unjust burden on the bus-riding public.<footnotemark>173</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">We discern no basis for reversing the Commission in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-17\">We are not confronted on this review with any question as to the validity of the Commission\u2019s precondition arising from the carrier\u2019s inability to meet it. Transit did not contest Loconto\u2019s recommendation of preconditions during the hearings, and although Transit\u2019s application for reconsideration alleged a multitude of errors, it nowhere claimed impossibility of compliance. The Commission took note of that circumstance,<footnotemark>174</footnotemark> as we take care to do now. Transit does state in its briefs, not that it cannot raise the $6.4 million which the precondition set, but that it cannot do so within a 90-day period<footnotemark>175</footnotemark> without liquidation or sale of assets at prices below fair market value,<footnotemark>176</footnotemark> but the statement assumes an erroneous premise. Order No. 1216 does not require performance within 90 days. It simply admonishes that performance more than 90 days removed might necessitate the making of a fresh administrative record to enable disposition of Transit\u2019s application for a fare increase.<footnotemark>177</footnotemark> Indeed, Order No. 1219 explicates that \u201c[i]n the event Transit elects not to comply with our precondition during the 90-day period following issuance of our main order, it is nevertheless free to apply for a rate adjustment whenever it does so comply, and to then ask us to use whatever portion of the present record may remain sufficiently fresh as to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>proper disposition of its application.\u201d <footnotemark>178</footnotemark> We have every confidence that, once compliance is forthcoming, the Commission will maximize its use of the present administrative record, and will proceed expeditiously to a resolution of Transit\u2019s request for a fare increase.<footnotemark>179</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">IV. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE COMMISSION\u2019S ACTION</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Asserting that at existing fares it will be operating at a substantial loss in the future, Transit lays claim, as a matter of constitutional right,<footnotemark>180</footnotemark> to fares increased to a point which would enable the company to earn a fair return. The Commission recognized a probable need for additional revenues to achieve that level,<footnotemark>181</footnotemark> but concluded that a demonstration of Transit\u2019s willingness and ability to provide, economically and efficiently, adequate transportation to the traveling public was a prerequisite to invocation of that doctrine.<footnotemark>182</footnotemark> We are thus brought to the question whether the orders under consideration can stand consistently with the requirements of due process of law.<footnotemark>183</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">It is, of course, well settled that a governmentally-fixed rate confining a public utility\u2019s return from operations to an amount below the point of confiscation violates due process.<footnotemark>184</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Transit\u2019s past rate litigation, both the Commission<footnotemark>185</footnotemark> and this court<footnotemark>186</footnotemark> have been keenly sensitive to that principle. It is important to note, however, that the eases forging that limitation have dealt with situations wherein the quality of the utility\u2019s service to the public was not in issue.<footnotemark>187</footnotemark> The inquiry we are now summoned to make is whether an established inferiority in service makes for a difference in constitutional precept.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Our thoroughgoing research discloses that instances of denials or curtailments of rate increases because of poor service have been considered but infrequently problems reaching constitutional proportions. Where, however, the objection has been framed in terms of confiscation, quite uniformly it has been rejected.<footnotemark>188</footnotemark> A similar position is evident from the more numerous decisions leaving increases ineffective pending service improvements notwithstanding that the utility was left at or below the breakeven point in the meantime.<footnotemark>189</footnotemark> In a real sense, then, these decisions incorporate the view, expressed or implicit, that the utility\u2019s fulfillment of its service commitments is a <em>sine qua non </em>to constitutional protection under confiscation principles. Like the Commission, we would be hard put \u201cto assume that regulatory agencies, both in this jurisdiction and elsewhere, have engaged in unconstitutional proceedings for over a half century.\u201d<footnotemark>190</footnotemark> For reasons now to be explained, we believe that they have not.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">It has long been recognized that the caliber of a utility\u2019s service need not remain a neutral factor in determinations as to its allowable return. The cases have consistently said that superior service commands a higher rate of return as a reward for management efficiency;<footnotemark>191</footnotemark> more importantly for present purposes, they have also maintained that inefficiency and inferior service service deserve less return than normally would be forthcoming.<footnotemark>192</footnotemark> Much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the same rationale undergirds the universal rule that expenditures incompatible with economical and efficient management are to be disallowed.<footnotemark>193</footnotemark> Eighty years ago, the Supreme Court, while acknowledging the unconstitutionality of unreasonable rates,<footnotemark>194</footnotemark> made these observations :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">It is agreed that the defendant\u2019s operating expenses for 1888 were $2,-404,516.54. Of what do these operating expenses consist? Are they made up partially of extravagant salaries, \u2014fifty to one hundred thousand dollars to the president, and in like proportion to subordinate officers ? Surely, before the courts are called upon to adjudge an act of the legislature fixing the maximum passenger rates for railroad companies to be unconstitutional, on the ground that its enforcement would prevent the stockholders from receiving any dividends on their investments, or the bondholders any interest on their loans, they should be fully advised as to what is done with the receipts and earnings of the company; for if so advised, it might clearly appear that a prudent and honest management would, within the rates prescribed, secure to the bondholders their interest, and to the stockholders reasonable dividends. While the protection of vested rights of property is a supreme duty of the courts, it has not come to this: that the legislative power rests subservient to the discretion of any railroad corporation which may, by exorbitant and unreasonable salaries, or in some other improper way, transfer its earnings into what it is pleased to call \u201coperating expenses.\u201d <footnotemark>195</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuO\">So, in Reagan v. Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Company,<footnotemark>196</footnotemark> the Court took pains to make clear that it was not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aam\">laying down as an absolute rule, that in every case a failure to produce some profit to those who have invested their money in the building of a road is conclusive that the tariff is unjust and unreasonable. And yet justice demands that every one should receive some compensation for the use of his money or property, if it be possible without prejudice to the rights of others. There may be circumstances which would justify such a tariff. There may have been extravagance and a needless expenditure of money. There may be waste in the management of the road, enormous salaries, .... The road may have been unwisely built, in localities where there is no sufficient business to sustain a road.

Ames,<footnotemark>198</footnotemark> the Court put the point succinctly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">[W]hat the public is entitled to demand is that no more be exacted from it for the use of a public highway than the services rendered by it are reasonably worth.<footnotemark>199</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">Not surprisingly, then, the Court, in Bluefield Water Works and Improvement Company v. Public Service Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>mission,<footnotemark>200</footnotemark> spoke of adequacy of return \u201cunder efficient and economical management.\u201d <footnotemark>201</footnotemark> Throughout the almost 50 years since <em>Bluefield </em>was decided, that standard has been gospel in the rate-making field.<footnotemark>202</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">We believe the constitutionality of governmental recognition of the interrelationship between fair return and quality service can hardly be doubted today. \u201cCertainly,\u201d as the Supreme Court has said, \u201cthe due process clause of the Constitution is not violated when a Commission takes into consideration practical results to the public of advances which it has allowed in rates.\u201d <footnotemark>203</footnotemark> The context of that declaration was a rate proceeding which had culminated in a reduction of street railway fares from seven cents to six cents.<footnotemark>204</footnotemark> The seven-cent fare had been achieved by an experimental increase from a previously existing five-cent charge for the same transportation.<footnotemark>205</footnotemark> The regulatory agency had found that the six-cent rate afforded a reasonable return on the carrier\u2019s rate base and that it was \u201call or more than the reasonable value of the services being rendered to patrons.\u201d<footnotemark>206</footnotemark> The Court pointed out that \u201c[t]he consideration of service as a justification for rates\u201d had arisen \u201cupon a comparison of the service of the Company under the five-cent rate and under the seven-cent rate,\u201d <footnotemark>207</footnotemark> and that the agency had \u201cfound that the 40 per cent increase of rate had been accompanied by a deterioration of service.\u201d <footnotemark>208</footnotemark> The Court also pointed out that \u201c[s]ome factors in the bad service were beyond the Company\u2019s control\u201d but that \u201cothers were found not to be without remedy by good management.\u201d <footnotemark>209</footnotemark> \u201cThat higher rates failed to improve, failed even to maintain, service\u201d said the Court, \u201ccertainly removed one of the justifications for the increase which the Company was enjoying.\u201d<footnotemark>210</footnotemark> \u201cSo far as the public was concerned,\u201d the Court added, \u201cthe experiment with the seven-cent rate yielded them no better immediate service and, because of the Company\u2019s policies, gave them no prospect of more permanent service.\u201d<footnotemark>211</footnotemark> The Court held that \u201c[t]o the extent that the [agency] was influenced by considerations of the value of service in this case, we find nothing that denies the Company any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>rights possessed under the Federal Constitution.\u201d <footnotemark>212</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">That holding, in our view, solidly supports the thesis that the caliber of a utility\u2019s service may constitutionally qualify as a prominent and even decisive factor in the regulation of its rates. We do not suggest that the case discussed and the one at bar are close parallels,<footnotemark>213</footnotemark> nor do we intimate a view as to whether, irrespective of other considerations, rates may lawfully be scaled in proportion to the public worth of the utility\u2019s service.<footnotemark>214</footnotemark> We. do think, however, that the likely effect of a sought-after rate increase upon the quality of the service is one of the \u201cpractical results to the public\u201d <footnotemark>215</footnotemark> to which due process indulges reasonable regulatory consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The precise constitutional issue before us is whether the Commission exceeded the limits of due process when it made a fare raise contingent upon steps calculated to rectify serious deficiencies in the service Transit furnishes the busriding public. Transit\u2019s argument has one central theme: its revenues cannot be permitted to fall below the level of fair return, and surely not below the breakeven point, no matter what the circumstances, and even if its management is uneconomical and inefficient and its service inadequate. If Transit is correct, the Commission is powerless to sanction corrective measures by deferring further consideration of a fare increase. If Transit is correct, it may disregard its public responsibilities at will \u2014 as the Commission found that it has frequently done \u2014 <footnotemark>216</footnotemark> and yet insist that the public respond to its demands for higher fares. We cannot accept that position. We do not believe the Constitution left the Commission impotent to deal with the situation confronting it in a sensible manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">The Due .Process Clause strikes a balance between competing governmental and private interests at the point of reasonableness. Action rationally subserving a substantial governmental concern draws condemnation on due process grounds only if it is arbitrary or unreasonable.<footnotemark>217</footnotemark> The importance of the interests of three cooperating sovereigns in the quality of Transit\u2019s operations and service is manifest.<footnotemark>218</footnotemark> On the record before us, it must be concluded that Transit has not met its public responsibilities in those areas.<footnotemark>219</footnotemark> It must be accepted, too, that Transit can measure up if only it will,<footnotemark>220</footnotemark> and that preconditioning further consideration of a fare increase upon remedial steps by Transit is the only method of assuring that the public interest will be protected.<footnotemark>221</footnotemark> We cannot say that, in the circumstances here, the Commission\u2019s action in pursuing that course is either arbitrary or unreasonable.<footnotemark>222</footnotemark> By the same token, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>do not perceive any due process violation occasioned by the Commission\u2019s orders. As the Commission said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">If, indeed, the company temporarily sustains a loss while it complies with our precondition order, it will not be because we have ordered it to do so, but because the effects of the company\u2019s past decisions have now impacted so seriously upon its statutory obligation to provide the public with efficient, economical and adequate transportation service as to require us to direct remedial measures as a precondition to any fare adjustment. The Constitution does not guarantee a public utility immunity from loss occasioned by uneconomic and inefficient management decisions, and we do not believe that it bars a regulatory agency on a record such as this from taking adequate steps to protect the public interest even if the short term effect of such an order is a temporary loss to the company. We made clear in our main order, and we take this occasion to reiterate, that as soon as Transit indicates its willingness to fulfill its statutory obligations to the public, we stand ready to insure that the public fulfills its reciprocal obligations to Transit.<footnotemark>223</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In our view, the Constitution does not require more.

Operating revenue deductions have also increased, that total increase being $23.3 million. Operating income during-the period has ranged from a high of $2.3 million in .one year to a low of a $48,000 loss in another. Interest expense has increased from $384,000 in 1957 to $1.4 million in 1970.

Loconto explained that \u201c[c]urrent ratio is a measure of the liquidity of a company, or its ability to meet its current obligations. A ratio greater than one generally indicates the availability of current resources larger than current demands.\u201d Quoting R. Anthony, Management Accounting 300 (3d ed. 1964), he added that \u201c[t]he current ratio \u2018is not only a measure of liquidity but also is a measure of the margin of safety that management maintains in order to-allow for the inevitable unevenness in the flow of funds through the current asset and liability accounts.\u2019 \u201d In Transit\u2019s case, the drop was from 1.5 in 1957 to .2 in 1970. See D.C. Transit Sys., Inc.

This illustrates the relationship between the creditors\u2019 and the owner\u2019s investments in the assets of the company. This ratio has increased from 5.9 in 1961 to 18.1 in 1970. That degree of creditor interest in the assets of the company indicates, according to the report, a high degree of risk. Another test, interest coverage, was used to illustrate the ability of the company to meet interest payments with income operations. In 1957, funds generated were 4.2 times the rate of interest expense; in 1970 this had decreased to .7 times. From the point of view of a- potential lender, this level was considered by Loconto to be very low. Finally, the comparison was made between funds generated by operations, after interest and taxes, to long-term debt not currently due and payable. This ratio has declined in Transit due largely to the increase in long-term debt. It has ranged from a high of 60.2 percent in 1961 to a low of 3.7 percent in 1968 and was 14.9 percent in 1970. \u2018This means,\u2019 said Loconto, \u2018that at the current level of funds generation, it would take more than seven years to retire all the existing debt if all available funds were applied to this pux-pose.\u2019 . . . Another meaningful test presented was stockholders\u2019 equity as a percent of total assets. This ratio has decreased from a high of 14.4 percent in 1961 to 5.2 percent in 1970. This, again, was considered quite low. Other ratios and tests made by Loconto similarly indicated a worsening-financial picture for D.O. Transit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b471-16\">. <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b471-17\">. \u201cWith respect first to current ratio, the average of the comparison companies was 1.4, the lowest of the comparison companies being .5.

Stockholders\u2019 equity as a percent of total assets indicated a much greater reliance on financing from sources other than the owners of D.C. Transit than in the comparison companies.

Since 1957 the debt servicing requirements have grown from under $1.3 million to $6.7 million annually.

Transit counters the Commission with the argument that since the latter foresaw a probable need for some fare increase after Transit\u2019s compliance with the Commission\u2019s precondition, the existing fares could not be the \u201clawful fare\u201d to continue in effect. If this position is correct, the Commission could never precondition consideration of higher fares unless the precondition is satisfied within the suspension period. As will appear, we reject that reading of the Compact. See text <em>infra </em>at notes 89-91. And as we later hold, neither the Compact nor the Constitution compels an award of a fare increase to a carrier seriously defaulting in performance of its obligations to the public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"88\">\n<p id=\"b478-14\">. So much is immediately apparent from the fact that Commission orders emanating within a suspension period may be and frequently are subjected to judicial review. This Court has never felt that the ratemaking proceeding was so far ended that the fares proposed became automatically operative during a period consumed either by judicial review or by further Commission consideration necessitated by the decision on review. The Compact, <em>supra </em>note 1, tit. II, art. XII, \u00a7 17, makes it perfectly plain that the period for judicial review is not part of the restricted period of permissible Commission suspension, and the same conclusion must follow as to the period covered by any ensuing remand. When, in the past, we have found Commission error, we have pointed it out and remanded to the Commission for appropriate Commission action. <em>E. g., </em>D.C. Transit Sys., Inc. v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Comm\u2019n, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 375, 350 F.2d 753 (en banc 1965) ; Williams v.

That, of course, is because we tlo not sit to fix fares, but rather to pass on the procedural and substantive propriety of Commission orders. Williams v.

The instant case summons no different principle. If Transit were to prevail on the merits, it would become entitled only to an order remanding the case to the Commission with directions that identified error be rectified and a \u201clawful fare\u201d be then established.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"89\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\">. \u201cThe Commission shall have power to perform any and all acts and to prescribe, issue, make, amend, and rescind such orders, rules, and regulations as it may find necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this Act. . . . \u201d Compact, su<em>pra </em>note 1, tit.

The Commission summarized as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">In the first case which this Commission processed with regard to Transit\u2019s fares, we noted our concern \u201cabout the need for [Transit] to increase its equity in the business in order to insure the financial stability\u201d of the carrier. [D.C. Transit Sys., Inc. (Order No. 245), 48 P.U.R.3d 385, 412 (1963)] In 1966, we reiterated this concern and again called upon Transit\u2019s management to remedy the situation. [D.C. Transit Sys., Inc. (Order No. 563), 63 P.U.R.3d 32, 42 (1966) ; D.C. Transit Sys. Inc. (Order No. 564), 63 P.U.R.3d 45, 65-67 (1966)]. At that time, however, we were able to conclude from the record then before us that Transit\u2019s financial structure had not interfered with its responsibilities \u201cfor rendering good service to the public.\u201d <em>lid. </em>at 65.] Even with that finding, however, we stated that \u201cTransit\u2019s debt-equity ratio should not be allowed to deteriorate further.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 66.] Two years later, we had occasion to disapprove two management decisions which resulted in a siphoning of cash into two subsidiary corporations, and we noted that \u201cin the management of its cash working capital, the company\u2019s guiding principle must be the maximum protection of its ability to meet its obligations under its franchise, the Compact, and Commission orders.\u201d [D.C. Transit Sys., Inc. (Order No. 773), 72 P.U.R.3d 113, 133 (1968) ] In that same order, we concluded that management\u2019s decisions had not seriously affected the adequacy of the company\u2019s service, and we found reason to believe that the company had recognized its obligations to the public and would take action to meet those responsibilities in the future. [Id.] Even so, we urged Transit \u201cto raise the cash needed for transit operations through their nonoperating properties, if no other sources are available.\u201d <em>[Id.] </em>The next year, a similar exhortation was contained in our Order 984. [D.C. Transit Sys., Inc. (Order No. 984), 81 P.U.R.3d 417, 435 (1969)] Transit has thus been on notice of our concern for more than nine years during which, instead of taking steps to remedy the situation, it has deliberately allowed it to deteriorate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">D.C.

We could not in any event deal with a question of impossibility of compliance on this review. As we have observed, the Compact precludes us from entertaining issues not previously raised before the Commission by an application for reconsideration. See text <em>supra </em>at notes 137-144. Transit has never presented any such claim to the Commission. Even apart from the Compact, its nature plainly demands that it be given initial consideration by the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"180\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\">. It seems clear that the Commission, established by Congress for the District of Columbia and by two adjoining states, is subject to the prohibitions of both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.

Co., 302 U.S. 388 401, 58 S.Ct. 334, 82 L.Ed. 319 (1938), the Commission points out that Transit\u2019s financial and statistical statements reveal operation at a profit during March and April, 1972, and argues that Transit cannot benefit from the constitutional rule it invokes. Transit, on the other hand, claims operating losses during January and February, 1972, and projects losses even more substantial during the remainder of the year. Since the orders under review are in no wise dependent upon Transit\u2019s operating gains or losses for the time being, the financial facts which the parties aver were not made subjects of findings. But Transit\u2019s predictions of losses from operation at existing fares during the future annual period are not seriously questioned, and the Commission\u2019s orders consistently reflect the opinion that once Transit complies with the precondition imposed, a fare increase is a very likely probability.

(Order No. 1219), <em>supra </em>note 6, at 13-14.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b495-6\">MacKINNON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AqNL\">concurring specially:</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">While I concur in the result here, I believe that the Commission, and to a certain extent our opinion, overstates the deficiencies of D.C. Transit. The overall situation has degenerated to the point where many blame Transit completely for the financial ills that have befallen it. Transit, in response, blames the Commission, encouraged by a vocal and irresponsible segment of the public, for refusing to provide the revenue needed for survival. To my view the responsibility for Transit\u2019s condition must be widely shared \u2014 there is merit to the contentions of all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">It is indeed true that Transit is presently in poor financial condition; and certainly the Commission, acting on behalf of the public interest it is bound to serve, is justified in seeking a capital structure for Transit that will reduce debt service expense and improve the overall financial stability of the company. But <em>ordering </em>Transit, in its ailing condition, to attract such large sums of new money may be analogous to a doctor ordering a patient who has just suffered a severe heart attack to get up and run a marathon. It may be possible to acquire new capital \u2014 I hope it is. But if Transit actually is as deficient in its operations as the Commission now contends, it may not be possible \u2014 investors are not generally attracted to poorly operated or failing ventures. I can join in the opinion of the majority affirming the Commission\u2019s decision here only because there is no basis <em>on this record for </em>concluding that it would be impossible for Transit to comply with the conditions imposed by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">It seems to me that the Commission could have been more helpful to Transit in attracting additional capital if it had determined the new fare (the Commission admits a fare increase is justifiable) and simultaneously suspended that fare pending satisfactory compliance with the conditions imposed here. Midwest Tel. Co., 23 P.U.R.3d 26, 31 (Ind. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n 1958); Riverside Grove Water Co., 20 P.U.R.3d 117, 120 (Calif. Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n 1957). That course of action would have provided potential investors assurance of a fare increase of pre-determined magnitude rather than having the question left to the vagaries of future Commission action. As Vice-Chairman Sullivan noted in his dissent to the Commission\u2019s order, that order leaves the Company\u2014 and potential investors \u2014 \u201cdangling\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>mid-air. This is hardly an attractive situation for attempting to raise \u25a0 substantial amounts of new capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Finally, I believe that the Commission\u2019s disposition of this matter is only temporarily valid because of the uncertainties left open by the present, inadequate, record. I do not consider that the Commission has fully faced the entire problem. It must eventually face up to the present need for more operating revenue, and it must eventually confront the issue of whether the conditions imposed by its order are possible of accomplishment or unreasonable by virtue of being impossible to meet. But these issues must be fully litigated before the Commission before they may be considered by us. While I thus believe that certain of the Commission\u2019s requirements appear to be somewhat unreasonable, there must be a fully developed record from the Commission before we could properly so find. Subject to these reservations I-concur in the result reached by the majority opinion here. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
