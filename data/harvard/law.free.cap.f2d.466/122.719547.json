The district court found that the test is job-related.

Allen v. City of Mobile, S.D.Ala.1971, 331 F.Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>1134. Despite the innovations and courage implicit in the trial judge\u2019s reformation of the hiring practices of the police force of Mobile, however, I am convinced that he stopped just short of this case\u2019s Rubicon by failing to wade into the deeper waters and to seine for a more optimal test for police promotions. In addition, I am compelled to conclude from the findings of fact of the able district judge that the traditional requirements of equity mandate more immediate relief than that afforded in the decree affirmed by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The area of occupational and promotional testing is both new and confusing to the courts. So-called \u201cobjective\u201d tests were once hailed as the definitive answer to \u201csubjective,\u201d often discriminatory, hiring or promotion procedures. But it has become increasingly clear as analysis becomes more sophisticated that there can be other, much more subtle, forms of discrimination lurking in \u201cobjective\u201d testing. It is now recognized that a test can be impeccably \u201cobjective\u201d in the manner in which the questions are asked, the test administered, and the answers graded, and still be grossly \u201csubjective\u201d in the educational or social milieu in which the test is set. <em>See generally </em>U. S. Comm, on Civil Rights, <em>For ALL the People ... By ALL the People </em>(1969); Comment, \u201cLegal Implications of the Use of Standardized Ability Tests in Employment and Education,\u201d 68 Colum.L.Rev. 691 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">I am persuaded that neither the able district judge nor the majority of this panel has applied an appropriate standard of review when a court is confronted with the admittedly difficult problem of reviewing tests. I do not know that I can provide here a more appropriate standard, but I can suggest some guidelines in the context of this case that seem to me to confront the deeper issues regarding testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">A test alone is not talismanic; it should, in my opinion, be placed in its own context of valid predicative force for the appropriate position of skill and, in some circumstances, of its discriminatory effect. This Court has already concluded that promotional tests, as well as hiring tests, are subject to judicial scrutiny. <em>See </em>United States v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 5 Cir. 1971, 451 F.2d 418. It is beyond question at this point in the nation\u2019s history that discriminatory state employment practices are constitutionally invalid, save for those rare cases in which the state can show a substantial interest in maintaining a practice shown to be discriminatory. Appellants have, to paraphrase Mr. Justice Holmes\u2019 now diluted dictum, no constitutional right to be policemen. But they do have a constitutional right to \u201cbe free from unreasonable discriminatory practices with respect to such employment.\u201d Whitner v. Davis, 9 Cir. 1969, 410 F.2d 24, 30. <em>See also </em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 1971, 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158; Castro v. Beecher, 1 Cir. 1972, 459 F.2d 725; Chance v. Board of Examiners, 2 Cir. 1972, 458 F.2d 1167; Carter v. Gallagher, 8 Cir. 1971, 452 F.2d 315; Rolfe v. County Board of Education of Lincoln County, Tennessee, 6 Cir. 1968, 391 F.2d 77; Wall v.

Norwalk Redevelopment Agency, 2 Cir. 1968, 395 F.2d 920. And of course even though police work is unquestionably sensitive, that sensitivity cannot ipso facto justify an unconstitutional procedure. <em>See </em>Washington v. Lee, M.D.Ala.1966, 263 F.Supp. 327 (three-judge court); aff\u2019d per curiam, 1968, 390 U.S. 333, 88 S.Ct. 994, 19 L.Ed.2d 1212; Morrow v. Crisler, S.D. Miss.1971, No. 4716 [Feb. 12, 1971, Oct. 4, 1971], appeal pending, No. 72-1139 (written test for highway patrol enjoined as unvalidated); Baker v. City of St. Petersburg, 5 Cir. 1968, 400 F.2d 294; Castro v. Beecher, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">The patrolman in the instant case demonstrated beyond question that the Mobile police department was rife with discriminatory procedures, discrimination that the trial judge specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>found and that the majority accepts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since the Mobile police department was wrenched from its \u201cwhites only\u201d status in 1954, only one black patrolman has been promoted to sergeant (in 1962) in a force in which 12.4% of the officers are black and in a city approximately one-third black. It appears from the record that this one sergeant was placed in positions within the department that precluded him from ever supervising any white officers. In addition, the one black sergeant twice took and passed the test for lieutenant, but had not been promoted at the time of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">It is in the context of these findings that this Court must, in my opinion, view the testing issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record demonstrates that a significantly larger percentage of black applicants failed the test than did white applicants. Of 94 white applicants, over 60% passed; of 14 black applicants, about 14% passed. It is acknowledged by all parties that the test has a critical impact upon promotion and that failure to achieve a passing grade of 70 precludes promotion altogether. Statistics, of course, are usually not conclusive of a proposition of fact, but \u201c[i]n the problem of racial discrimination, statistics tell much, and Courts listen.\u201d State of Alabama v. United States, 5 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 583, aff\u2019d per curiam, 371 U.S. 37, 83 S.Ct. 145, 9 L.Ed.2d 112; <em>see also </em>Turner v. Fouche, 1970, 396 U.S. 346, 90 S.Ct. 532, 24 L.Ed.2d 567; Hawkins v. Town of Shaw, 5 Cir. 1971, 437 F.2d 1286, modified <em>en banc, </em>5 Cir. 1972, 461 F.2d 1171 [1972]. Although it is not noted in the district court\u2019s opinion, the record also shows that the police department\u2019s promotion sheets record the race of the applicant alongside the test scores.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court and this panel are in agreement that the appellants produced during the trial a prima facie ease that there was clear racial discrimination in the Mobile police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">The other circuits have found racial discrimination in testing situations where there is not the history and existing milieu of racial discrimination that there is in the instant case. These circuits place more emphasis upon the bare statistics regarding substantial racial difference in rates of passing and promotion than I would find necessary in this case. <em>See </em>Castro v. Beecher, <em>supra; </em>Chance v. Board of Examiners, <em>supra; </em>Carter v. Gallagher, <em>supra. </em>Given the pronounced racial effect in the sergeants\u2019 test, accompanied by the findings of the district court that the majority now upholds regarding the long and deep history of racial practices in the police department, I would conclude that appellants have made a prima facie case that the sergeants\u2019 test is a part of the department\u2019s unconstitutional action. And if a prima facie constitutional violation is demonstrated, it is unnecessary, as a general proposition, that the plaintiff also establish a discriminatory intent on the part of the offending persons. <em>See </em>Whirl v. Kern, 5 Cir. 1969, 407 F.2d 781, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 901, 90 S.Ct. 210, 24 L.Ed.2d 177; Hawkins v. Town of Shaw, <em>supra; </em>Daniels v. Van de Venter, 10 Cir. 1967, 382 F.2d 29; Pierson v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Ray, 5 Cir. 1965, 352 F.2d 213, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 386 U.S. 547, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288; <em>cf. </em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 1961, 365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45. I would also argue, however, that the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and decree evince some conviction that the police department\u2019s procedures were, at least in part, discriminatory by intent. <em>See, e. g., </em>Allen v. City of Mobile, 331 F.Supp. at 1138. I do not, however, base my dissent upon a specific finding of so-called \u201cintentional\u201d discrimination by the department.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">The real issue of this case with regard to testing becomes one of establishing a standard of review to be applied to a test when the issue of racial discrimination is adequately and substantively raised. I am guided in my analysis by cases decided under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000a et seq., although Title VII is not specifically applicable to a local police department, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e. It appears to me, however, that the rationale of Title VII, as elucidated in Griggs v. Duke Power, <em>supra, </em>provides a strong analogy to similar issues that are raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>under the aegis of the Constitution and 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 with regard to actions by state or local employees. <em>Accord, </em>Allen v. City of Mobile, <em>swpra; </em>Chance v. Board of Examiners, supra; Carter v. Gallagher, supra; Castro v. Beecher, <em>supra. </em>I cannot conclude that constitutional rights litigable under section 1983 would be entitled to significantly less thorough examination than rights founded upon congressional statute. In addition, I note that the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 has amended Title VII to include, among others, precisely the employees in question in the instant ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The district judge should first examine the passing spread of the test, as the able district judge in this case did. If there is a substantial difference between black and white applicants in the rates of passing in the context of other evidence of racial discrimination, then the offending person or persons should be required to establish reasons for utilizing the tests. Put another way, when a prima facie case for unconstitutional action on the basis of race has been made, the burden should be upon the police department to justify its reasons for continuing actions that have been adequately called into constitutional question. <em>See, e. g., </em>Chance v. Board of Examiners, <em>supra; </em>Castro v. Beecher, <em>supra; </em>Carter v. Gallagher, <em>supra. A </em>peculiar result would ensue if a private defendant in a case alleging racial discrimination in employment or promotional practices were required to assume the burden of demonstrating the validity of suspect practices, and a public defendant allegedly engaging in precisely the same practices were not. <em>See </em>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000a et seq., and amendments to Title VII by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972. In addition, it is the police department that, presumably, readily has the necessary information to justify its own procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">It is at this point in the review of a test that my divergence with the majority is greatest. I am of the opinion that the district court and the majority applied a standard of \u201cjustification\u201d that required much too little of the police department. The district court required only that the sergeants\u2019 test be <em>rationally </em>\u201cjob related,\u201d citing Griggs v. Duke Power Co., <em>supra. </em>Allen v. City of Mobile, 331 F.Supp. at 1146. I too am of the opinion that the rationale of <em>Griggs </em>should apply to a discrimination case brought under section 1983 with force at least equal to its application to Title VII cases, but I believe that the district court and the majority have misconstrued the thrust of that seminal decision and, by analogy, the constitutional requirements regarding promotional practices. If \u201c . . . the jobs in question formerly had been filled only by white employees as part of a long-standing practice of giving preference to whites . . .\u201d and the test operates \u201c . . .to disqualify Negroes at a substantially higher rate than white applicants,\u201d Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. at 426, 91 S.Ct. at 850, 28 L. Ed.2d at 161, then the police department should have to prove that the test bears \u201c. . . <em>a manifest relationship . . </em>. \u201d to the position of police sergeant. Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. at 432, 91 S.Ct. at 849, 28 L.Ed. 2d at 165 [emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">Like the district court and the majority, I entertain no doubt that the sergeants\u2019 test was \u201crationally related\u201d to the job of being a sergeant. In fact, I would find it difficult to envision a test that was not somehow \u201crationally related\u201d to the task of being a police sergeant. But to stop at this low denominator seems to me to ignore both any sort of purposive analysis of testing and the thrust of <em>Griggs. </em>Because the racially discriminatory context and effect of the instant test have been established, I am of the opinion that the state must demonstrate a <em>substantial </em>interest in maintaining the use of such a test. The First and Second Circuits have recently adopted standards very similar to those I propose here. <em>See </em>Castro v. Beecher, <em>supra, </em>(also a police department case); Chance v. Board of Examiners, <em>supra </em>(supervisory positions in a school system) ; <em>see also </em>Carter v. Gallagher, <em>supra, </em>(firemen). While the standard I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>propose approaches the \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d test often appropriate in cases of racial discrimination, <em>compare </em>McGowan v. Maryland, 1960, 366 U.S. 420, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393, <em>with </em>Loving v. Virginia, 1967, 388 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (intentional discrimination ease), in terms of the degree of proof required to justify continuing the discriminatory impact of a test, I am in agreement with the First Circuit that the test is inappropriate \u201c[t]o the extent . . . that [\u201ccompelling state interest\u201d] connote[s] a lack of alternative means\u201d under the facts of this case. Castro v. Beecher, 459 F.2d at 733; <em>see also </em>Carter v. Gallagher, supra; Chance v. Board of Examiners, <em>supra; </em>Penn v. Stumpf, N.D. Cal.1970, 308 F.Supp. 1238; <em>supra </em>note 4. The police department should not be required to select an \u201coptimal\u201d test so as to erect some form of racial balance in its sergeants\u2019 staff. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-2(j). However, the department should be required to make a <em>substantial </em>showing of job-relatedness, which it was clearly not required to do by the district judge or by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">It appears that there are a number of methods available by which to evaluate substantial job-relatedness, <em>see generally, </em>Cooper &amp; Sobol, \u201cSeniority and Testing Under Fair Employment Laws: A General Approach to Objective Criteria of Hiring and Promotion,\u201d 82 Harv.L. Rev. 1598 (1969); Chance v. Board of Examiners, <em>supra, </em>but there appear to be two major methods:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">\u201cOne is \u2018content validation,\u2019 which requires the examiners to demonstrate that they have formulated examination questions and procedures based on an analysis of the job\u2019s requirements, usually determined through empirical studies conducted by experts. . . . The other method of evaluating job-relatedness is \u2018predictive validation,\u2019 which requires a showing that there is a correlation between a candidate\u2019s performance on the test and his actual performance on the job.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">Chance v. Board of Examiners, 458 F.2d at 1174. It appears that the district court attempted to utilize a \u201ccontent validity\u201d examination, for the opinion looks only to the questions themselves. The court below was faced with contrasting expert testimony, as is becoming usual in cases requiring any sort of expert opinion. Neither expert witness had any actual knowledge of the Mobile police department itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The state\u2019s expert witness, however, was also the originator of the test. Allen v. City of Mobile, 331 F.Supp. at 1141. Under cross-examination he testified that no studies whatsoever had been made by his firm with regard to the possible racially discriminatory effect of the sergeants\u2019 test. In the context of demonstrated racial prejudice in other facets of the department\u2019s procedures and a prima facie case that the test itself is racially discriminatory, I would require that the authority offering the test at least conduct studies regarding racial impact before that authority could convincingly insist that the test has \u201ccontent validity.\u201d In addition, it appears that the test was based entirely upon a so-called \u201cjob description\u201d prepared in 1959 by an outside consulting agency\" that was not called to testify at the trial below. I fail to understand how a test that is based upon a \u201cdescription\u201d of thirteen years ago, which description the testing agency itself neither prepared nor updated, can have \u201ccontent validity\u201d sufficient to pass muster under the facts of this case in the absence of much more substantial \u201ccontent\u201d analysis than appears in the transcript. Moreover, appellants dispute whether the \u201cjob description\u201d itself was adequate, even independent of the fact that it was made quite some time ago. There is no finding with regard to the adequacy of that description upon which the questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>test was based, nor does it appear that any examination of the \u201cjob description\u201d ever took place at the trial below. Finally, the testing agency that prepared the tests has not itself made any studies regarding the comparative performance of officers with high and low test scores so as to examine the efficacy of their own test. In sum, I contend that the analysis of \u201ccontent\u201d in the instant case was completely superficial and wholly insufficient as a matter of law to constitute \u201ccontent validity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">I do not intimate in any way that validation must be particularized to the local community by an expert organization. Such a requirement would be a great financial and time burden, impossible to fulfill in some smaller communities. <em>But see </em>NAACP v. Allen, M.D. Ala.1972, 340 F.Supp. 703 [1972], where the district judge himself \u201clocalized\u201d a challenged test to some extent by removing some questions and altering others. I do urge, however, that, in addition to those factors that I have just outlined, any so-called \u201ccontent validation\u201d should be demonstrated by some organization other than that which drew up the test. Without disparaging the expertise or the opinions of test originators in any way whatsoever, the originators do have an interest in maintaining the public integrity of their own inventions. After all, if a reputable organization proffers a test, it is obviously convinced in its own mind that the test is sufficiently valid as to content. That opinion, however well-intentioned, should not provide the sole evidence of validity to a court, for the question presented is simply too important and subtle for such an examination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Castro v. Beecher, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>supra; </em>Chance v. Board of Education, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Moreover, in the context of a showing of substantial racial bias in the police department and in the absence of sufficient \u201ccontent validation\u201d to explain obvious racial effect, I am of the opinion that any test used to exclude patrolmen from becoming sergeants must be validated by a comparison of performances under a \u201cpredictive validation\u201d scheme. The testimony of police officials in the transcript reveals clearly that the department is seeking a <em>predictive </em>effect when it administers tests and other procedures for promotion. The department does not seek only or even primarily to reward past performance or seniority. The district judge, in fact, agreed with this general approach to testing. With regard to written tests the district court\u2019s decree ordered that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\u201c[n]ot less than once each year hereafter from the date of this decree the defendants are to submit a written report to the court which consists of a statistical study of promoted officers which will show a comparison between their examination grade and their regular service or performance ratings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Thus the district court concluded that there should be some empirical relationship between test scores and performance actually demonstrated, and the majority agrees with that conclusion. While I disagree with the district judge and the majority with regard to the quantum of \u201crelationship\u201d that should be required under the facts of this case, I am in agreement with the thrust of this approach. However, once again I am convinced that the district court and the majority have overlooked the nature of a cut-off test. The decree entered below and affirmed here acknowledges that there may be substantial inverse differences in performance between, for example, a sergeant promoted with a test score of 71 and a sergeant promoted with a test score of 90. By the same reasoning, I am compelled to conclude on the basis of this record that there might also be substantial inverse differences in performance between applicants who had test scores of 69 and 71, or for that matter between applicants with test scores of 50 and 90. Without some such empirical study of racial effect and/or performance, I am wholly unable to conclude that the test is \u201cvalid\u201d under any validation theory and under the Fourteenth Amendment and the rationale of Griggs v. Duke Power, <em>supra. See </em>United States v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 5 Cir. 1971, 451 F.2d 418, cert. denied, 406 U.S. 906, 92 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Ct. 1607, 31 L.Ed.2d 815 [1972]. There is a set of guidelines already iq existence prepared by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1607.1-1607.9. In addition, that same organization apparently evaluates large numbers of specific employment and promotion tests. This Court concluded in another employment context that \u201c . . . the safest validation method is that which conforms with the EEOC Guidelines.\u201d United States v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 451 F.2d at 456; <em>see also </em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. at 433, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In addition to my great doubts regarding the legal standard applied by the district court and the majority to determine a lack of unconstitutional discrimination in the test in question, I am also convinced that the district judge should have employed immediately effective injunctive relief. It is reasonably well settled at this point that so called \u201caffirmative\u201d hiring measures are sometimes required to offset the effects of past discrimination. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., <em>supra; </em>Carter v. Gallagher, supra; United States v. Ironworkers Local 86, 9 Cir. 1971, 443 F.2d 544, cert. denied, 404 U. S. 984, 92 S.Ct. 447, 30 L.Ed.2d 367; Local 53 of Int. Ass\u2019n of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers v. Vogler, 5 Cir. 1969, 407 F.2d 1047; United States v. Central Motor Lines, Inc., W. D.N.C.1970, 325 F.Supp. 478; Contractors Ass\u2019n of Eastern Pa. v. Secretary of Labor, 3 Cir. 1971, 442 F.2d 159, cert. denied, 404 U.S. 854, 92 S.Ct. 98, 30 L. Ed.2d 95.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There are a number of ways to accomplish immediate relief. <em>See, e. g., </em>Cooper &amp; Sobol, 82 Harv.L.Rev. at 1132. I would leave the precise formulation of any methodology of promoting a reasonably flexible number of black patrolmen to the rank of sergeant to the district judge, who has demonstrated clearly both his ability and his objectivity in his determinations of this case, despite my disagreements on these two points of law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I would propose, however, that the immediate promotions that would take place during the interim period (prior to the time that a validated test and other corrective procedures ordered by the district judge could be established) should be made roughly in approximation to the percentage of black patrolmen on the force. I emphasize, however, that this would be only interim hiring and that my proposed rough percentages for promotion should be flexi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>ble to meet the circumstances and would be utilized only for purposes of interim reference. <em>See </em>Swann v. Charlotte Mecklenburg Board of Education, 1971, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554. My conclusion that more immediate equitable relief is compelled in the instant case is based upon the district court\u2019s own findings regarding the Mobile' police department, which has been generally immobile in matters of discrimination. Simply stated, no black man has ever been allowed to be placed in a supervisory position over white patrolmen, even the one black patrolman who managed to pass the sergeants\u2019 test.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">I would propose, finally, that this interim promotion scheme also be employed to test empirically the predictive validity of the test in question. The performance of officers promoted partially by means of the test could be compared with the performance of officers promoted on other factors and without reference to the questioned test. Nothing I have stated in dissent should be construed to forbid the department\u2019s employment of another test, one more appropriately and thoroughly validated as to predictive force and to content (including racial/cultural analysis). And, of course, any performance testing by the department is subject to review by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">An attempt is now under way to equalize substantially educational opportunities for all the nation\u2019s children. If and until that effort reaches some reasonable degree of fruition, the Constitution cannot stand immobile while a generation of working police officers suffers from the continuing operations and effects of racially discriminatory procedures, however subtle. While the majority would require no immediate pruning of the foliated discrimination, and while I would not require immediate scything of every \u201croot and branch,\u201d I would commit to the judicious husbandry of the able trial judge some immediate defoliation of the poisonous trees of discrimination so deeply rooted in the Mobile police department. I would reverse and remand to the district court on the two points of law that I have raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING AND PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<author id=\"b203-9\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">The Petition for Rehearing is denied and the Court having been polled at the request of one of the members of the Court and a majority of the Circuit Judges who are in regular active service not having voted in favor of it, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12) the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">GOLDBERG, Circuit Judge, dissents from the denial of the Petition for Rehearing and the Petition for Rehearing En Banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-5\">. As a particularly sad example, the trial judge found it necessary from the evidence presented to him to enjoin the use of the epithet \u201cnigger\u201d <em>in the police force; </em>in addition, he found that there was assignment of police beats by race in open defiance of this Court\u2019s decision in Baker v. St. Petersburg, <em>supra, </em>and various other overtly racial acts by the police department, all of which are delineated in the district court\u2019s opinion. We acknowledge also the district court\u2019s observation that a new administration appears to have decreased somewhat the more blatant discrimination in the department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">. The test in question is described by the district court. Allen v. City of Mobile, 331 F.Supp. at 1141. It is prepared by the National Public Personnel Association of Chicago, a cooperative organization of local and state civil service officers. However, I have examined the record, and I must conclude that the district judge was incorrect when he stated that Dean O. W. Wilson of the University of California, a renowned expert in the field, aided in the preparation of the test in question. The record demonstrates only that Dean Wilson\u2019s materials were read by those preparing the test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b196-11\">.

I realize that the \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d test in all of its ramifications has not yet been applied to situations involving so-called \u201cunintentional\u201d discrimination, and I do not analytically approach this dissent with the idea that this is a so-called \u201cintent\u201d ease. Nevertheless, I do not fully agree with distinctions often drawn in similar cases between \u201cintentional\u201d and \u201cunintentional\u201d racial discrimination. <em>See, e. g., </em>Chance v. Board of Examiners, <em>supra-, </em>Castro v. Beecher, <em>supra. </em>It appears to me that \u201cmotive\u201d is often simply another way of stating that the statistical evidence and the context in which the statistics are set are sufficient to allow, if not compel, a prima facie inference of \u201cintent.\u201d <em>See </em>Swain v. Alabama, 1965, 380 U.S. 202, 85 S.Ct. 824, 13 L.Ed.2d 759. Similarly, one who employs a test that unerringly produces greatly divergent results among applicants of different races and who makes no attempt whatsoever to study or to justify the reasons for that divergence can reasonably be said to employ a discriminatory test with \u201cintent.\u201d His \u201cintent\u201d need not necessarily be the less for purposes of enforcing the Constitution simply because he continues to use a device with known discriminatory effect rather than choosing to announce openly his discriminatory employment devices or to couch such devices in methods less subtle than testing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">\u201c[W]e now firmly recognize that the arbitrary quality of thoughtlessness can be as disastrous and unfair to private rights and the public interest as the perversity of a willful scheme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Hobson v. Hansen, D.D.C. 1967, 269 F. Supp. 401, 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The degree of \u201cjustification\u201d by the state to maintain a process or device discriminatory in fact cannot turn simply upon the fact that one practice might have been transcribed into statute and another practice followed unerringly in fact. <em>See </em>Johnson v. State of Virginia, 1963, 373 U.S. 61, 83 S.Ct. 1053, 10 L.Ed.2d 195; Lombard v. State of Louisiana, 1963, 373 U.S. 267, 83 S.Ct. 1122, 10 L.Ed.2d 338; Cisneros v. Corpus Christi Independent School Dist., 5 Cir. 1972, 459 F.2d 13 [1972] (en banc) ; United States v. Texas Education Agency, 5 Cir. 1972, 467 F.2d 848 [1972] (en banc); cf. Hawkins v. North Carolina Dental Society, 4 Cir. 1965, 355 F.2d 718; Cypress v. Newport News Gen. and Nonsectarian Hosp. Ass\u2019n, 4 Cir. 1967, 375 F.2d 648. Enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s prohibitions against racial discrimination is not a matter of \u201cpunishing\u201d those \u201cguilty\u201d of discrimination, and accordingly the degree of justification required in discrimination cases should not turn upon the relative degree of \u201coffensiveness\u201d among perpetrators of racially discriminatory acts. If the prohibition of racially discriminatory acts is far from \u201cpunishment\u201d but is rather the enforcement of constitutional rights and responsibilities under the Fourteenth Amendment, then perhaps \u201cintent\u201d should mean nothing more than the knowing perpetration of a racially discriminatory act or practice. To attempt to differentiate the burden of proof that is required to justify a discriminatory act upon the existence or degree of bad motive on the part of the perpetrator of the act seems to me to focus upon an unworkable issue and to ignore the entire thrust and purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, I note again that the lack of a specific finding of so-called \u201cintent\u201d either by the trial judge or by this panel does not reflect in any way the substance of my dissent. I have approached the department\u2019s action as \u201cunintentional,\u201d in the previously discussed meaning of that term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b199-10\">.

The state argues that United States v. Jacksonville Terminal, <em>supra, </em>is inapposite to the instant case because the <em>Jacksonville Terminal </em>case involved an aptitude test for unskilled workers, while the instant case deals with admittedly very skilled work. I agree that police work is, of course, substantially more sensitive and skilled than unskilled baggage carrying, but I do not agree that this factor decreases the force of the excellent opinion in <em>Jacksonville Terminal </em>regarding immediate relief. The \u201clabor pool\u201d from which the Mobile police department draws for its sergeants consists of its own patrolmen, whose qualifications as police officers have never been questioned during the course of this case. I agree that the rationale of <em>Jacksonville Terminal </em>might be inapposite to the instant case if the potential \u201clabor pool\u201d from which police-sergeants were to be promoted for purposes of immediate relief were only the general pool of available labor. However, the pool consists of men already very skilled in the task of being police officers, presumably very much the same skills required of a police sergeant. The rationale of <em>Jacksonville Terminal </em>is correct for the potential baggage-carriers of that case and for the potential police sergeants of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b202-10\">.
