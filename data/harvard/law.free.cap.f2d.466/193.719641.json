App. \u00a7 462.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">During the period between his original and final I-A classifications, Roberts had been successively classified as I-S-H (high school student); I-A (ex-student) ; and III-A (husband and father). When Roberts registered with his Local Board in 1965 he gave his address as 2304 Saratoga Avenue, Kokomo, Indiana. The cover sheet of his SSS file shows his subsequent addresses: on October 4, 1967 as 1810 North Washington, Kokomo; on June 11, 1968 as Village Green, Lot 74, Kokomo; and on August 11, 1969 as 5022 East Jackson, Elkhart, Indiana. Roberts\u2019 wife on April 14, 1969 reported to the Board that he left her in March, 1969, that she had filed divorce proceedings, and that his \u201cpresent\u201d address was 3059 Hammond, Elkhart, Indiana. The \u201c3059 Hammond\u201d address, however, was never entered on his SSS file cover sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-21\">At the trial Roberts contended, inter alia, that his Kokomo, Indiana Local Board denied him procedural due process by erroneously mailing notices to the wrong addresses. Roberts argued that the order to report for induction was invalid since he had never received either a notice of his Right to a Personal Appearance and Appeal (SSS Form 217) or a statement of his Physical Acceptability for Service in the Armed Forces (DD Form 62).</p>\n<p id=\"A3Cg\">The district judge, relying on the presumption of regularity of selective service proceedings and on the testimony at trial, made specific findings of fact. The judge concluded that Roberts was charged with receiving the notice and statement under 32 C.F.R. 1641.3.2 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-24\">A. <em>Notice of Right to Personal Appearance and Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-25\">Roberts was classified I-A for the third time on April 30, 1969. On May 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the Board mailed his notice of classification (SSS Form 110) and notice of Right to a Personal Appearance and Appeal (SSS Form 217) to the Village Green address in Kokomo.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Roberts claims that he never received the notice, since at the time of the mailing he was living at the \u201c3059 Hammond\u201d address.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">We agree with the district judge\u2019s conclusion that Roberts was charged with receiving the notice. The mail was never returned to the Board as undeliverable. And the record shows that Roberts did receive other mail sent to the same Kokomo address. Roberts received both a May 1 notice of classification (SSS Form 110) <em>(i. e., </em>new draft card) and a May 6 Order to Report for a Physical Examination (SSS Form 223).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Furthermore, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Roberts did not in fact receive the Notice of Right to a Personal Appearance and Appeal (SSS Form 217), we can see no prejudice to him. He admitted that after his final reclassifica-. tion from III-A to I-A he received a new draft card dated May 1 which expressly informed him of his right to a personal appearance and appeal. We therefore see no merit in Roberts\u2019 claim that he was denied due process by an erroneous mailing of the notice of right to a personal appearance and appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">B. <em>Statement of Physical Acceptability</em></p>\n<p id=\"AbP\">On August 11, 1969 Roberts notified his Local Board in Kokomo of a change of address to 5022 East Jackson, Elk-hart. On August 12, 1969 he took a delayed preinduction physical examination through the Goshen Local Board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On August 26, 1969 the Kokomo Board received the statement of Roberts\u2019 physical acceptability (DD Form 62) from the Goshen Board and sent a copy to him that same day. The form itself showed his Kokomo address rather than the newly reported Elkhart address.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">We see no merit to Roberts\u2019 claim that he did not receive the statement of physical acceptability (DD Form 62), that he was deprived of the chance to challenge his acceptability, and that the subsequent induction order was invalid under 32 C.F.R. 1631.7(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district judge did not err in deciding that Roberts was charged with receiving notice of his physical acceptability.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">At the time of the August 26 mailing, Roberts\u2019 new Elkhart address had been entered on his SSS file cover sheet. And the Executive Secretary of the Kokomo Local Board effectually testified that in the ordinary course of business the Board takes its envelope address from the last address noted on the file cover sheet. The court could correctly rely on the presumption of regularity to conclude that the statement was sent\u2019 to the proper address.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">Furthermore, even if the statement of acceptability were sent to the Kokomo address, the evidence is still sufficient to support the court\u2019s finding. The record shows that Roberts received other Selective Service mail sent to the Kokomo address. No mail was ever returned to the Board. There was one envelope which Roberts received but which he never opened. And the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>was not compelled to credit Roberts\u2019 self-serving testimony of the non-receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Assuming <em>arguendo, </em>however, that Roberts did not receive the statement of Physical Acceptability (DD Form 62) we see no prejudice to him. Eleven weeks prior to the date of his physical examination, Roberts had been notified to bring a doctor\u2019s certificate of any physical condition which might disqualify him from the armed forces. His file does not show any medical certificates. Furthermore, the order to report for induction should have put Roberts on notice that he had been found physically qualified. And Roberts had ample time \u2014more than twenty-one days \u2014 during the postponement of his induction to question his physical qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">On September 11, 1969 the Board ordered Roberts to report for induction on October 20. This order was subsequently postponed \u201cuntil further notice\u201d by authority of the Indiana State Director under 32 C.F.R. 1632.2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On October 17 the Board sent notice of the termination of postponement and notified Roberts to report for induction November 21, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Roberts claims that since his file contains no authority from the State Director to terminate the postponement, the Board was without authority to do so under 32 C.F.R. 1632.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\"> We see no merit to the claim. We agree with the district court that general \u201corders\u201d are not required to be placed in each registrant\u2019s file. We think that the district court correctly relied upon the presumption of regularity of Selective Service proceedings \u2014 absent any showing by Roberts to the contrary \u2014for concluding that the termination of postponement notice was authorized, and that the Board\u2019s action was proper under 32 C.F.R. 1632.2(c). See United States v. Isenring, 419 F.2d 975, 979 (7th Cir. 1969).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-16\">We reject Roberts\u2019 suggestion that the Board\u2019s termination of postponement was unauthorized and a \u201cpossible vindictive\u201d action so as to render Gutknecht v. United States, 396 U.S. 295, 90 S.Ct. 506, 24 L.Ed.2d 532 (1970), applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-18\">Subsequent to the termination of the postponement of the induction order, Roberts filed an application for change of classification to C-0 on the basis that he was a conscientious objector.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-19\">There is no merit in his contention that the Board wrongfully refused to reopen his classification to consider the conscientious objector claim, after the induction order had issued. The argument is squarely foreclosed under Ehlert v. United States, 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (1971); United States v. Jones, 447 F.2d 589, 592 (7th Cir. 1971); Wright v. Ingold, 445 F.2d 109 (7th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-20\">For the reasons given, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-13\">. The parties filed trial briefs which, inter alia, presented the issue of a fatal variance between the indictment which charged failure to report September 11, 1969, and proof of the failure on November 21, 1969. The district judge decided there was no fatal variance. Roberts does not argue the point here. We agree however with the district judge that there was no fatal variance. The date was not an essential element of the crime, the indictment was returned within the statute of limitations, there was no showing that Roberts was misled in preparing his defense, and we see no possible jeopardy problem.

Roberts\u2019 reliance on United States v. Bellmer, 404 F.2d 132 (3rd Cir. 1968), is misplaced. There the question was whether a letter written by defendant had been in his file at the time the State Director refused defendant\u2019s request for a Presidential appeal. The court decided that since the government did not carry its burden \u2014 in the face of contrary evidence \u2014 of showing that the letter had been in the file, the defendant was denied procedural fairness, and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
