The note was given by appellants to evidence a federally insured home improvement loan made to them pursuant to Title I of the National Housing Act. (48 Stat. 1246, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701 et seq.) Payment was initially secured by a second deed of trust on real property situated in Los Angeles, California; but the security was lost when the subject property was sold upon a foreclosure by the holder of the first deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-18\">Defendants contend that the record discloses the existence of a genuine issue of material fact, hence the entry of summary judgment was error. This issue, they say, is whether or not the second deed of trust was given as security for the payment of part of the purchase price of the subject real property. The issue is material, they argue, because if the loan constituting the debt was for purchase money, then California law, particularly Cal.C.C.P. \u00a7 580b, prohibits entry of a deficiency judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>We must disagree. Whether the note reflects a purchase money loan or not is immaterial. In United States v. View Crest Garden Apts. Inc., 268 F.2d 380, 383 (9th Cir. 1959), this court declared, \u201cLocal rules limiting the effectiveness of the remedies available to the United States for breach of a federal duty cannot be adopted.\u201d Our opinions in United States v. Stadium Apartments, Inc., 425 F.2d 358 (9th Cir. 1970) (which contains a thorough discussion of the subject), and Herlong-Sierra Homes, Inc. v. United States, 358 F.2d 300 (9th Cir. 1966), are to the same effect. True, those decisions treat of the government\u2019s remedial rights with respect to loans governed by sections of the Federal Housing Act, other than Section 1; but the same underlying policy declared and applied in all of them is common to Section 1 loans.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1267-12\">. \u201c580b.
