Wollenberg, United States District Judge, Northern District of California, San Francisco, California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1264-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1264-8\">Defendant and one Breese were charged in one count with transporting a stolen motor vehicle across a state border (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312). The trials were severed, and Breese was <em>convicted </em>by a jury on February 16, 1972. His judgment of conviction was <em>entered </em>on February 18, 1972. Defendant\u2019s trial commenced on February 17, 1972. He was convicted. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-9\">Defendant put Breese on the stand as his witness. He had been warned Breese might be impeached by his \u201cday before\u201d conviction. (R.T. 26) Defendant\u2019s own counsel brought out the fact that Breese had suffered one previous conviction for burglary. Breese then told how he had been given permission to take the involved motor vehicle on a trip from Long Beach to Santa Barbara, but decided to drive to \u201cSan Antone\u201d Texas, and then to Biloxi, Mississippi. This was done without the owner\u2019s permission. (R.T. 134) The defendants were apprehended in Arizona on the way back to California. Both defendants drove the vehicle on the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-12\">On cross-examination, Breese was asked if he had been tried for the offense of transporting the involved auto (owned by a Mr. Buss) in interstate commerce knowing it was stolen. There was no objection made to this question (R.T. 138), and Mr. Breese admitted he had, by reason of his conviction on the previous day. Defense counsel now urges this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-13\">The question was proper, for purposes of impeachment (among others), and it has been so held in this Circuit, <em>whether the conviction was final or not. </em>The jury\u2019s verdict requires nothing more than a ministerial act (its entry) to constitute a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-14\">In United States v. Allen, 457 F.2d 1361, decided April 12, 1972, this Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-15\">\u201cIt is the majority view and the law in this circuit that until the judgment of the lower court is reversed, the conviction will stand and the defendant may be questioned regarding that conviction for purposes of impeachment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1264-16\">United States v. Griffin, 434 F.2d 978 (9th Cir. 1971), cert. denied <em>sub nomine; </em>Andrews v. United States, 402 U.S. 995, 91 S.Ct. 2170, 29 L.Ed.2d 160 (1971); Bloch v. United States, 226 F.2d 185 (9th Cir. 1955), cert. denied 350 U.S. 948, 76 S.Ct. 323, 100 L.Ed. 826 (1956); United States v. Empire Packing Co., 174 F.2d 16 (7th Cir. 1949) cert. denied 337 U.S. 959, 69 S.Ct. 1534, 93 L.Ed. 1758 (1949). See also State v. Reyes, 99 Ariz. 257, 408 P.2d 400, 404-406, and Rule 306, Ariz. Rules of Crim.Proc., 17 A.R.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-17\">The defendant further urges that while the question as to Breese\u2019s conviction on the previous day was \u201cparticularly prejudicial\u201d, it was also error to ask the witness Breese the following further questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-18\">(1) \u201cNow when you were arrested, did you stay in jail during the 30th of November in Benson, Arizona?</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>(2) \u201cWere you and Canaday together?</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">(3) \u201cWere you in the same cell?</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">(4) \u201cWere you there overnight?</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">(5) \u201cIn the same cell?\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Brief, p. 6)</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">Appellant relies on the statement in McCormick on Evidence that, after questioning as to the fact of conviction, where and when it occurred and the punishment therefor,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-9\">\u201c. . . further details such as the name of the victim and the aggravating circumstances may not be enquired into.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-11\">The short answer is that the name of the \u201cvictim\u201d was already before the jury, for he (Buss) had testified on the Government\u2019s case in chief; and that no questions regarding \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d were asked of Breese.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-12\">We find no error on this second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AOY\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
