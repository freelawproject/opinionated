Using \u201cnet worth statements\u201d to demonstrate an unexplained flowering of taxpayers\u2019 wealth, the government sought to show that the luxuriating of financial seedlings into larger plants was attributable to the receipt of unreported monetary nutrients.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to avoid a statute of limitations barrier to tax liability, the government was required to prove fraud in the understatement of income. The trial judge was unpersuaded as to that threshold point and accordingly entered judgment for taxpayers. At the government\u2019s urging, however, we have unearthed indications that the trial judge misconceived some of the evidence and misapprehended its effect, and we therefore remand the case for reconsideration of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Taxpayers, Kenneth Poy Lee and his wife, Chow Joy Lee, are American citizens of Chinese ancestry. During the taxable years in question, 1962 through 1964, they operated a grocery store that Mr. Lee owned, the Acme Food Mart in Greenwood, Mississippi. They conducted the business as a partnership, with Mr. Lee acting as business manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Mr. Lee personally maintained all business records, basically utilizing a cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and reporting income. He recorded sales and expenses by a single-entry bookkeeping method. When customers made cash purchases, the total was computed on an adding machine and then punched into a cash register. Credit transactions were treated as cash sales at the time of collection. At the end of each day, the cash register total would be recorded in the taxpayers\u2019 books, typically without further verification. Annual inventories were made by estimating the amount of goods on hand after January 1 of each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">Taxpayers were not familiar with the preparation of federal income tax returns although Mr. Lee regularly prepared state sales tax returns. Each year Mr. Lee took his records to a certified public accountant, who prepared his individual and partnership federal tax returns for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">On January 1, 1966, William J. Sykes, an agent of the Internal Revenue Service, visited taxpayers in the hope of obtaining their consent to extending the three-year statute of limitations for taxable year 1962.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On that and several subsequent occasions, Sykes observed that some sales were not recorded on the cash register, which Mrs. Lee admits occasionally happened.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">On February 1, 1966, Sykes and Eugene Fortenberry, a special agent of the IRS, began an extensive examination of taxpayers\u2019 records and returns for the taxable years in issue. Fortenberry was later replaced by special agent Donald L. Mann, who completed the investigation of taxpayers\u2019 returns. In May, 1966 Mann prepared a \u201cnet worth statement\u201d for the taxable years in issue and submitted it to taxpayers for their inspection. Taxpayers registered no objections to the net worth statement at that time, and on January 15, 1970, the District Director of the IRS assessed additional income taxes, penalties, and interest for the taxable years 1962, 1963, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>1964.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Taxpayers paid the additional assessments under protest and filed this suit for refund in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Because the three-year statute of limitations had already run for each of the taxable years in question, the government\u2019s case depended upon proof by clear and convincing evidence that the returns were fraudulent with the intent to evade tax. <em>See </em>Jenkins v. United States, 5 Cir. 1963, 313 F.2d 624. Whenever such fraud is shown, there is no limitations period, <em>id; </em>26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6501(c)(1), but the government\u2019s burden is heavy indeed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The proof of fraud offered in the instant case consisted of government computations revealing that the taxpayers\u2019 \u201cnet worth\" during the three years in question increased by $71,637.45 while taxpayers only reported adjusted gross income for the same period approximately totalling $8,000. Based upon the evidence adduced at trial, the district judge made findings of fact that there were several inaccuracies in the government\u2019s computations. The following errors were thought to be particularly prejudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>cial to taxpayers: (1) understating the amount of \u201ccash on hand\u201d at the beginning of taxable year 1962; (2) overstating the inventory figures for each taxable year; and (3) failure of the government to account for any loans, gifts, inheritances, recoveries for damages, or any other source of income by taxpayers. The district judge concluded that the government\u2019s figures were too inaccurate to allow determination of how much understatement of income, if any, occurred. Based upon this reasoning and upon his finding that taxpayers had used no improper or illegitimate bookkeeping procedures, the trial judge concluded that the returns had been filed in good faith and that the government had failed to show the fraud that would avoid the statute of limitations. Accordingly, the trial judge entered judgment for taxpayers for the full amount of the refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The court below recognized that the government may sometimes use unreported and unexplained growth in net worth figures to infer fraud. <em>See, e. g., </em>Sasser v. United States, 5 Cir. 1953, 208 F.2d 535. But the trial judge also held that countervailing circumstances may be sufficiently strong to offset the \u201cbadge of fraud\u201d inferable from unreported growth in net worth. The district judge cited the following factors as here outweighing any inference of fraud: the government\u2019s inaccuracies in computing taxpayers\u2019 net worth growth; taxpayers\u2019 limited educational backgrounds ;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> taxpayers\u2019 inadvertent use of record-keeping methods that can unintentionally cause errors to be made; taxpayers\u2019 good-faith efforts to keep meticulous records; and taxpayers\u2019 industrious, family-oriented life style. The trial judge then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">\u201cWhen all of these matters are taken into account, the Court is persuaded that the Commissioner has not carried the burden of proof here that these taxpayers filed these returns with intent to defraud the Government. It is not enough to show, as there has been proof abundant, that there were inadvertent errors, there were miscalculations, there were wrong procedures used. But when all of the evidence is weighed, the Court is driven to the conclusion that the facts here permit only one fair outcome \u2014 namely, the [taxpayers] are entitled to recover the taxes they have paid under protest in full.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">We agree that all the surrounding circumstances must be considered when fraud is sought to be proved by use of net worth statements. <em>See, e. g., </em>Webb v. Commissioner, 5 Cir. 1968, 394 F.2d 366, 379 (lack of education); Anderson v. Commissioner, 5 Cir. 1957, 250 F.2d 242, 250 (attitude of taxpayer). Additionally, we are aware that the conclusion that the government failed to sustain its burden of proving fraud is a finding of fact that ordinarily will not be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">\u201cOur review of the lower court\u2019s findings is, of course, governed by Fed.R.Civ. P. 52(a), and this court cannot set aside those findings unless they are clearly erroneous. A trial court\u2019s finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is without substantial evidence to support it, or the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence. Lentz v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 428 F.2d 36, 39 (5th Cir., 1970); Gibbs v. Tomlinson, 362 F.2d 394, 397 (5th Cir., 1966).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">Rewis v. United States, 5 Cir. 1971, 445 F.2d 1303, 1304. Nevertheless, on the instant record we are convinced that in reaching his decision the able district judge misconceived the effect of some of the evidence and that a remand for reconsideration and for expanded fact findings is needed in order to \u201cavoid any chance of an unjust result.\u201d Gibbs v. Tomlinson, 5 Cir. 1966, 362 F.2d 394, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>398. <em>See also </em>Mladinich v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 371 F.2d 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Confusion when using the \u201cnet worth statements\u201d technique to show the existence of unreported income is perhaps to be expected.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The technique requires a two-step process in civil cases. First, the issue of fraud is determined by using the net worth figures. Secondly, the issue of additional tax liability is determined by using the net worth figures. The nuances of tax law regarding use of the net worth technique to show both fraud and tax liability are variegated and sometimes convoluted, but it seems clear that when inaccuracies in the net worth statements are discovered, the proper procedure is to recompute the net worth of the taxpayer at the relevant times. Findings of fact should be made at the outset to determine as precisely as possible how much income, if any, went unreported. Then, using those figures, the district court should determine whether in the light of all surrounding circumstances \u201cfraudulent intent to evade tax liability\u201d can be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">It appears from the instant record that in applying this method the trial judge was led astray by the three evidentiary inaccuracies of the government\u2019s computations. We set out in a footnote the specific misconceptions of evidence that we believe were made,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and we conclude that precision in determining the amount of income understatement is not essential at the first step of the inquiry. Merely demonstrating that substantial amounts of income not found to be tax-exempt were unreported can be enough to establish fraud. <em>See </em>Sasser v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Brame v. Commissioner, 25 T.C. 824 (1956), aff\u2019d per curiam, 5 Cir. 1958, 256 F.2d 343. This is particularly true when the taxpayer\u2019s own record-keeping deficiencies cause the government to rely on approximations of opening net worth, <em>see </em>Veino v. Fahs, 5 Cir. 1958, 257 F.2d 364, and approximations of inventory levels, <em>see </em>Banks v. Commissioner, 8 Cir. 1963, 322 F.2d 530, 546. Precise figures are needed only when computing tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">The general misapprehension of evidence we have here discerned was the giving of almost controlling weight to the discovery of errors in the government\u2019s computations. The presence of accounting or mathematical errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>should lead to readjustment of the figures but should not lead ipso facto to the conclusion that the government cannot prevail. Failure to prove the full amount of unreported income alleged to exist does not preclude a finding that there may be a lesser amount of unreported income, which might support .an inference of fraud by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">Finally, it should be remembered that although a \u201cmere omission of reportable income is not of itself sufficient to warrant a finding of fraud in an income tax ease . . . [a]s we clearly implied in Bryan v. Commissioner, 5 Cir. 1954, 209 F.2d 822, and in Anderson [v. Commissioner, 5 Cir. 1957, 250 F.2d 242], the <em>repeated </em>omission of reportable income is not a <em>mere </em>omission. Moreover, an exceptionally large omission is not a <em>mere </em>omission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Kalil v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 271 F.2d 550, 551 (emphasis original).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Although the government\u2019s burden is a heavy one, it is not a millstone of impossible carriage. The extent of the understatement of income may be a mystery, but this is not synonymous with insolvability. We believe the trial court donned the robes of a mathematician and operated under a mistaken theory that he had to find computerized certainty in the understatement before he could conclude fraud. While he must discern a plot, he need not reconstruct every line of the scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">On remand the learned trial judge should not expect the government to weigh with exactitude every stone in the lode or account for every penny in the hoard. Substantiality, albeit imprecise, in the understatement of income is sufficient to carry the day. We remand this case to allow the court below to reconsider the evidence in the light of the directions herein contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\">. \u201cWhatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\u201d <em>Galatians 6:7.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-10\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6501(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b85-11\">.

entails unique, though not exclusive, dualistic frustrations. To affirm for the Commissioner, we must agree that he has proved fraud by \u2018clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 Moreover, what he has proved must be fraud, not mere negligence or even gross negligence. Judge Brown has analyzed the tests in Carter v. Campbell, 5 Cir. 1959, 264 F.2d 930, 935-936:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">\u2018There is first the matter of what is and what is not fraud. We have recently given our approval, Olinger v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir. 1956, 234 F.2d 823, 824, to the strong language of Davis v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 10 Cir. 1950, 184 F.2d 86, 87, 22 A.L.R.2d 967. \u201cFraud implies bad faith, intentional wrongdoing and a sinister motive. It is never imputed or presumed and the court should not sustain findings of fraud upon circumstances which at most create only suspicion.\u201d Equally emphatic is that stated for us by Judge Sibley in Mitchell v. Commissioner, 5 Cir. 1941, 118 F.2d 308, 310. \u201cNegligence, whether slight or great, is not equivalent to the fraud with intent to evade tax named in the statute. The fraud meant is actual, intentional wrongdoing, and the intent required is the specific purpose to evade a tax believed to be owing. Mere negligence does not establish either.\u201d These principles have been restated frequently and recently with no recession either from emphatic language or like application. Goldberg v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir. 1956, 239 F.2d 316, 321; Fairchild v. United States, 5 Cir. 1957, 240 F.2d 944, 947; Eagle v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir. 1957, 242 F.2d 635, 638; Jones v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir. 1958, 259 F.2d 300. See also 10 Mertens, Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 55.10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-13\">\u2018Added to this is the burden placed upon the Commissioner. The Code places it expressly upon the Commissioner. 10 Mertens, Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 55.18. \u201cThe burden is upon the Commissioner to prove affirmatively by clear and convincing evidence actual and intentional wrongdoing on the part of the petitioner with a specific intent to evade the tax.\u201d Eagle v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir. 1957, 242 F.2d 635, 637. 10 Mertens, supra, at \u00a7 55.16.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">Webb v.

In permitting the use of net worth statements to prove criminal tax fraud, the Supreme Court stated that \u201ccareful study indicates that [the method] is so fraught with danger for the innocent that the courts must closely scrutinize its use.\u201d Holland v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 121, 125, 75 S.Ct. 127, 130, 99 L.Ed. 150, 159.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b88-7\">. <em>(1) Understanding cash on hand at the beginning of 1962: </em>Because there was evidence that taxpayer kept a large cash hoard at his store and at his home, the trial judge concluded that the opening figures for cash on hand were understated. As discussed in the body of this opinion, upon concluding that such an error exists, the trial judge should make as precise as possible a factual finding of what the correct figure should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\"><em>(2) Overstating the inventory figures for each taxable year: </em>Because taxpayers\u2019 inventory estimates were apparently based upon retail resale value, rather than cost (here approximately equal to retail minus 20%), the trial judge concluded that the amounts were overstated. Logically, however, a 20% reduction for <em>each year\u2019s </em>inventory estimates would likely produce little <em>net </em>effect. Also, the next step should again have been to calculate the correct amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"AtO\"><em>(3) Failure of the government to show taxable character of income sources: </em>The trial judge concluded that lack of government evidence as to the sources of the income inferred weighed against any inference of fraud in failing to report income. But the government does not bear the burden of negativing such an inference. It is up to the taxpayer at least to raise the issue of the exempt character of income that is shown to have been received <em>after </em>the opening of the net worth computation period. Cf. Holland v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
