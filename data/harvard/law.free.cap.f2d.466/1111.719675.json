MATTHEW BYRNE, Jr., District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Defendants Roth and Kephart appeal from a conviction in a jury trial for conspiracy, transportation and smuggling of marihuana under Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a, and concealment and transportation of illegally smuggled dangerous drugs in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545. Roth also appeals his conviction for concealing and transporting heroin in violation of Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">Appellants contend that prejudicial error resulted from the Government attorney\u2019s improper and incorrect statement of the law in closing argument and the court\u2019s refusal to give a corrective instruction as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">The Government presented evidence to establish that the defendants and two other co-conspirators were engaged in smuggling marihuana, dangerous drugs and narcotics into the United States from Mexico and subsequently transporting them from Southern California to Oregon. In their testimony, Roth and Kephart each admitted possession and sale of the marihuana and dangerous drugs in Oregon during the time alleged in the indictment. They both acknowledged awareness that they had violated the criminal laws of Oregon. However, each defendant testified that he did not know that the marihuana or drugs had been illegally imported into this country and denied any knowledge of their foreign origin. Both defendants disavowed participation in any conspiracy to smuggle marihuana. Roth denied knowingly dealing in heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-13\">While testifying, Roth pointed to the presence in the courtroom of two peace officers from the State of Oregon whom he believed were \u201cmonitoring\u201d his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-14\">In closing argument, Roth\u2019s attorney referred to the presence of the Oregon officers and stated that as a result of defendants\u2019 testimony, both Roth and Kephart had incriminated themselves under Oregon law and would undoubtedly be prosecuted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counsel then suggested that if the defendants were acquitted, they would not be \u201cgetting away with something\u201d because whatever happened in the federal case, they would be prosecuted and convicted for the Oregon offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-15\">Kephart\u2019s counsel argued that his client\u2019s testimony should be believed since in order to testify to the truth about this case, he had been willing to incriminate himself and be subjected to prosecution in Oregon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>In rebuttal to this line of argument initiated by the defendants, Government counsel stated, \u201cYou know, let nie tell you sosnething, don\u2019t be buffaloed by Defense Counsel telling you that they stood up here, and they took the stand, and that they admitted State offenses, and, therefore, if you acquit them of the Federal offenses, they\u2019re going to be prosecuted in the State. There\u2019s no guarantee that\u2019s going to happen. There\u2019s no guarantee that\u2019s going to happen. First, of all they\u2019ve got to beat the Federal rap, see, and if they do beat the Federal offense, then their legal defense is double jeopardy. \u2018We were tried for these Federal offenses in San Diego, you can\u2019t prosecute us.\u2019 There may be other legal defenses that they raise that you don\u2019t know about, like \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">Defendants\u2019 objection to the statement concerning double jeopardy was overruled by the trial judge who was of the opinion that the prosecutor was merely suggesting possibilities other than the certainty of prosecution and conviction in Oregon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A subsequent motion for mistrial upon the same grounds was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">In D\u2019Aquino v. United States, 192 F.2d 338, 367 (9th Cir. 1951), this court said, \u201cThe trial judge had an opportunity far superior to that afforded us to judge whether the remarks of counsel in the setting in which they were given constituted such misconduct as to require a more emphatic admonition or instruction to the jury to disregard. Our system of jurisprudence properly makes it a matter primarily for the discretion of the trial court to determine whether prejudicial misconduct has occurred. An appellate court will not review the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion in such a matter unless the misconduct and prejudice is so clear that it can be said that the trial judge has been guilty of an abuse of discretion.\u201d We find no such abuse of discretion in this case. The record indicates that any possible error was planned and invited by Roth and counsel for each defendant. The defendants were not prejudiced by these invited and peripheral remarks of the prosecutor. <em>See </em>Ochoa v. United States, 167 F.2d 341 (9th Cir. 1948); United States v. Horne, 423 F.2d 630 (9th Cir. 1970); Keeble v. United States, 347 F.2d 951 (8th Cir. 1965). It was not error to refuse the defendants\u2019 requested jury instruction to the effect that double jeopardy was not a bar to successive state and federal prosecutions. The court clarified the matter for the jury by properly instructing them that they were not to be concerned in any way whether a defendant might be subject to prosecution in a state court. The judge who heard what was said and saw what was done is better qualified than we to prescribe adequate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-13\">Appellants make a further contention that the court order requiring them to provide handwriting exemplars under threat of contempt citations violated their rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>After indictment, the Government moved for an order compelling the execution of handwriting and handprinting exemplars by each defendant. Following a hearing, the motion was granted and Roth and Kephart, who were in Oregon, were ordered to execute the exemplars in the office of the United States Attorney in Portland. Defendants appeared but refused to complete the exemplars. Their refusals resulted in their being found in contempt by the United States District Court in Oregon. Thereupon, the defendants agreed to execute the exemplars and the finding of contempt was vacated. During trial, the exemplars were admitted into evidence over defendants\u2019 \u2022 objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">Securing exemplars of handwriting or handprinting from a defendant does not violate his right against self-incrimination. Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 266, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 1953, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967); United States v. Beshers, 437 F.2d 450, 451 (9th Cir. 1971) (handwriting); United States v. Rudy, 429 F.2d 993, 994 (9th Cir. 1970) (hand-printing). The post-indictment procedures used to obtain these exemplars, which included a court hearing, do not constitute an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of defendants\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights. United States v. De Palma, 414 F.2d 394 (9th Cir. 1969); <em>See </em>Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721, 727, 89 S.Ct. 1394, 22 L.Ed. 2d 676 (1969); United States v. Long, 325 F.Supp. 583 (W.D., Mo. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">. \u201cNow, there is no question in this case that Mr. Roth is going to be prosecuted and convicted of his activity with regard to the State of Oregon. The Officers sat and listened to the sworn testimony, it was transcribed by the reporter and there is no question that this will occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">\u201cBut the question here is : Has he been guilty of violations that fall within the terms of this case, the charges in this case?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">. \u201cWe know, also, that whatever happens, here, Mr. Kephart and Mr. Roth will be prosecuted, and, undoubtedly, convicted. They don\u2019t have any defense, their own sworn statements convict them of violating State offenses. There\u2019s no question of that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">\u201cAnd I submit that it isn\u2019t a situation of someone getting away with something.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1184-11\">. \u201cChris [Kephart] took the stand, he told you, candidly, that he broke the law. He told you that he knew he was violating state law, and you remember from something Mr. McOrea [counsel for Roth] asked just a few moments later, there was a couple of peace officers from the State of Oregon present in the courtroom. I think you can reasonably conclude that Oliris knew that he was subjecting himself to a serious state prosecution for possession and sale of marijuana in the State of Oregon. But he took the stand and he testified, I submit to you, truthfully and candidly, you will find, as to the extend [sic] of his participation in this alleged conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-17\">\u201c . . . Chris Kephart took the stand and he explained to you his role in this enterprise, and he did so at great cost to himself, but that was his defense, that\u2019s the truth, and if the truth means he\u2019s going to be subjected to a serious State prosecution, lie\u2019s willing to pay that price, he\u2019s willing to pay that price to tell you the truth here.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">. \u201cTI-IE COURT: Well, it is a legal question, but this is argument, and Counsel has merely suggested possibilities, and I think it should be \u2014 a certain amount of latitude in the matter of argument, and it has been allowed in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">The counsel for the Government continued :</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">\u201cThere may be other reasons. There may be rules of law which would prevent a successful State conviction for the same offenses that they admitted. So, I mean, don\u2019t think \u2014 don\u2019t let that enter your consideration that they\u2019ve really\u2014 look they\u2019ve exposed themselves to tell you the truth because they may not have exposed themselves at all for all you know.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-15\">There is no guarantee that the State authorities are going to prosecute this case if you cut them loose and find that they didn\u2019t \u2014 that the Federal elements have not been proven.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1186-6\">MERRILL, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aq-\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">I disagree with the majority on the matter of the Government\u2019s closing argument. To me it was not invited, was clearly improper, misleading and wholly prejudicial. There was no opportunity to respond to it. In my judgment it demanded a clarifying instruction. I would reverse and remand for new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
