BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AmU\">Following an arrangement proceeding under Chapter XI of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 701 et seq., the District Court (i) dissolved an injunction entered by the referee to restrain Schokbeton Products Corp. (Products) from terminating an exclusive licensing agreement with the debtor in possession, Schokbeton Industries, Inc. (Debtor),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (ii) affirmed the referee\u2019s confirmation of the plan of arrangement. Debtor and Arcrete, Inc., an intervenor which proposes to operate Debtor as a corporate subsidiary after acquiring all of its capital stock, appeal from the dissolution of the referee\u2019s injunction. Products cross appeals from the order approving the plan of arrangement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-19\">On December 26, 1964 Products granted Debtor an exclusive franchise to manufacture and sell precast concrete construction materials in Texas and parts of Louisiana, utilizing Products\u2019 unique dry concrete production method (\u201cthe Schokbeton process\u201d). The licensing agreement required Debtor to make periodic royalty payments in return for the exclusive franchise and also provided that any default in the payment of such royalties for a period of sixty days following receipt of written notice from Products would justify termination of the contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>On November 13,1970 Products mailed written notice of default for nonpayment of royalties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 8, 1970, before expiration of the sixty-day grace period for curing the default, Debtor filed a petition for an arrangement under Chapter XI. On January 16, 1971 Debtor was still in default and Products mailed a second written notice purporting to terminate the agreement. More than four months later, discovering that Products was attempting to grant its exclusive franchise to another licensee, Debtor sought injunctive relief from the referee on the theory that the Schokbeton process was its most valuable asset and that it would suffer irreparable financial damage if Products were permitted to disregard its license. The referee agreed and granted the injunction after concluding that the licensing agreement still subsisted as an asset of Debtor, that the filing of the arrangement petition postponed Debtor\u2019s obligation to cure the default in royalty payments, and that. such default would be corrected \u201cduring an extended period as may be determined by this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALJ\">\n<em>Debtor\u2019s Appeal: The Validity of the Injunction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">We concede as indisputable the abstract assertion that the referee in a Chapter XI proceeding possesses plenary authority to protect the assets of a debt- or in possession by means of an injunction. The jurisdiction is derived from a variety of sources \u2014 sections 2(a) (15) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 372<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Bankruptcy Act itself, the All Writs Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the inherent equity powers of a court of bankruptcy. Continental Illinois National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Chicago v. Chicago, Rock Island, &amp; Pacific Railway Co., 1935, 294 U.S. 648, 675-676, 55 S.Ct. 595, 605-606, 79 L.Ed. 1110, 1128; 1 Collier, Bankruptcy, \u00b6 2.61 (14th ed. 1970). No one disputes the general proposition that the power is there and that it may be exercised in an appropriate situation.</p>\n<p id=\"AP1\">But generalizations seldom provide satisfactory solutions to specific problems. The facts of this case present two sharply defined and interrelated questions. First, did the concededly pervasive authority of the referee permit him to preserve Debtor\u2019s contractual rights by indefinitely postponing the performance required by the terms of the contract (i. e. the payment of past due royalties) ? We hold that it did not. Second, did the filing of the petition for an arrangement automatically extend the sixty-day period for curing the default? We hold that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\"> Our conclusions are predicated upon the manifest Congressional policy that proceedings under Chapter XI incorporate, except where inconsistent, the principles applicable in bankruptcy proceedings generally, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 702. A debtor in possession is thus the practical equivalent of a trustee in bankrupt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>cy, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 742, and so like the trustee usually acquires only those rights and assumes only those liabilities in existence when the petition is filed, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 110(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">In the present context the most significant example of this parallelism is the statutory option afforded both trustees in 'bankruptcy 7<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and debtors in posssession<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to reject executory contracts. Given their identicality in this respect, the result here is almost foreordained because of the universally recognized rule that a trustee cannot accept the benefits of an executory contract without accepting the burdens as well. Hurley v. Atchison, Topeka, &amp; Sante Fe Railway Co., 1909, 213 U.S. 126, 29 S.Ct. 466, 53 L.Ed. 729; Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association v. Smith, 9 Cir., 1964, 336 F.2d 528, 529; In re Italian Cook Oil Corp., 3 Cir., 1951, 190 F.2d 994, 997; 8 Collier, Bankruptcy, \u00b63.15 [6]. As a logical result, a trustee\u2019s decision to adopt such a contract following the filing of a bankruptcy petition does not preclude the exercise of the other party\u2019s pre-existing right to terminate the agreement. Thompson v. Texas Mexican Railway Co., 1946, 328 U.S. 134, 141, 66 S.Ct. 937, 942, 90 L.Ed. 1132, 1137; Finn v. Meighan, 1945, 325 U.S. 300, 301, 65 S.Ct. 1147, 1148, 89 L.Ed. 1624, 1626; Hewit v. Berlin Machine Works, 1904, 194 U.S. 296, 24 S.Ct. 690, 48 L. Ed. 986; Kirby v. United States, 10 Cir., 1964, 329 F.2d 735, 737; Urban Properties Corp. v. Benson, 9 Cir., 1940, 11&amp; F.2d 321; In re Lindy-Friedman Clothing Co., 5 Cir., 1922, 285 F. 22; Empress Theatre Co. v. Horton, 8 Cir., 1920, 266 F. 657; Greif Bros. Cooperage Co. v. Mullinix, 8 Cir., 1920, 264 F. 391, 397; Lindeke v. Associates Realty Co., 8 Cir., 1906, 146 F. 630, 640; In re Little &amp; Ives Co., S.D.N.Y., 1966, 262 F.Supp. 719; 8 Collier, Bankruptcy, \u00b6 3.15 [4].<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">Debtor attempts to distinguish these decisions by pointing out the fact that many of them <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> involved contracts that were by their own terms subject to termination upon the filing of a petition in bankruptcy. Since its agreement with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Products explicitly provided that the mere filing of a Chapter XI petition would not terminate the contract (see note 2, <em>supra), </em>Debtor reasons that here contractual rights existed, were subject to the referee\u2019s equitable jurisdiction and were therefore enforceable on Debt- or\u2019s behalf, whereas in the other cases the debtor could not change the fact that the petition had been filed (i. e. the defect was \u201cnon-eurable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">We find the suggested distinction unpersuasive. In the first place the principle is in all instances the same \u2014 a contractual termination provision is unaffected by the filing of a petition in -bankruptcy and may be enforced against the trustee or debtor in-possession. In the second place there is no logical basis for distinguishing between the asserted authority of the referee to modify a contract by indefinitely extending the time for curing a default under it and equivalent authority to modify or nullify any other contractual provision. If a referee could grant relief,on equitable grounds from compliance with a sixty-day grace period for paying past due royalties, he might as easily find it \u201cinequitable\u201d to enforce a forfeiture arising from the filing of a bankruptcy petition. In the third place, absent a concession of the referee\u2019s power to rewrite the contract between the parties, the grounds for termination here were as irreversible as those in each of the other cases. The sixty days elapsed. The royalties remained unpaid. Debtor\u2019s rights under the licensing agreement evaporated upon receipt of the written notice of termination, and neither the mere filing of the arrangement petition nor the referee\u2019s order purporting to \u201cextend\u201d the grace period for cure of the default nor a mystical combination of both could effect their recondensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Debtor\u2019s reliance on section 11(e) of the Bankruptcy Act is misplaced.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Obviously that statute permits a trustee, receiver or debtor in possession to avoid a statutory (and perhaps a contractual) <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> time limitation that would otherwise bar a claim <em>asserted on behalf of the debtor. </em>United States v. Paul Hardeman, Inc., M.D. Fla., 1966, 260 F.Supp. 723; Henkin v. Rockower Bros., Inc., S.D.N.Y., 1966, 259 F.Supp. 202. It provides no basis for suspending the debtor\u2019s obligations under an executory contract while simultaneously holding the other party to the bargain.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Debtor\u2019s reliance on In the Matter of Lane Foods, Inc., S.D.N.Y., 1963, 213 F. Supp. 133 is grossly misplaced. That decision and others like it <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> stand for no more than the proposition that upon termination of a lease the referee may order that the debtor <em>temporarily </em>retain possession pending confirmation of the arrangement in order to avert the radical dislocation that would otherwise result from a forced eviction from the premises. More importantly, the Court in <em>Lane Foods </em>cites In re Walker, 2 Cir., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>1937, 93 F.2d 281 to reaffirm the obvious fact that such an extraordinary holdover tenant has no more than equitable possession of the building. There is no contractual <em>right </em>to occupancy because the lease has already been terminated. Since the debtor was in possession, and since possession \u2014 rather than ownership or legal title \u2014 underlies the exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the temporary continuation of possession, contingent upon payment for such occupancy, 213 F.Supp. at 137, n. 12, was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">But the facts of the present case cannot be molded to fit within the <em>Lane Foods </em>doctrine. We do not doubt that in some circumstances intangible property rights are subject to \u201cpossession\u201d by the debtor and therefore fall within the equitable jurisdiction of the referee. Katchen v. Landy, 1966, 382 U.S. 323, 86 S.Ct. 467, 15 L.Ed.2d 391; 2 Collier, Bankruptcy, \u00b6 23.05 [4], However, here it is plain that after January 16, 1971 Debtor had <em>no </em>rights in the franchise \u2014 intangible, contractual or otherwise \u2014 and hence could have \u201cpossessed\u201d nothing when it applied to the referee four months later for protection of its \u201crights\u201d under the licensing agreement. Even if the referee had acted earlier he still could not have given Debtor indefinite \u201ctemporary possession\u201d of the franchise, with no more than a bare promise of some speculative future compensation for it. The filing of an arrangement petition under Chapter XI does not divest the debtor in pos-session of its contractual rights, but it likewise does not provide a blanket exemption from contractual obligations. Debtor\u2019s failure to satisfy those obligations justified Products\u2019 termination of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">Besides directly contradicting its position in the District Court (App. 172), Debtor\u2019s theory that Products\u2019 action was equivalent to the foreclosure of a lien subject to injunction under section 314 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 714, requires only two short answers: (i) the \u201cforeclosure\u201d was not enjoined until after it took place, and (ii) there was no \u201cforeclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">Finally, Debtor places great faith in our previous order reinstating the referee\u2019s injunction pending appeal (see note 1, <em>supra). </em>Obviously such interim relief was designed only to preserve the <em>status quo </em>pending final disposition of the .issues by an appeal on the merits. This is it.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">We do not overlook the fact that in addition to providing a swift and economical method for facilitating simple compositions among relatively sophisticated unsecured creditors,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> a Chapter XI arrangement is even more vitally concerned with the ultimate rehabilitation of the debtor.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Nor do we disregard the referee\u2019s findings of fact that the loss of the exclusive franchise will seriously jeopardize Debtor\u2019s competitive position and cause it irreparable injury. We conclude that this is simply not a case for the invocation of high equity. Products\u2019 contractual right to terminate the contract clearly survived both the filing of the arrangement petition \u00e1nd the referee\u2019s belated attempt to resurrect an already moribund agreement. In such circumstances Debtor must live with its forfeiture.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\n<em>Products\u2019 Cross Appeal: Confirmation of the Arrangement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Debtor strenuously argues that Products\u2019 cross appeal from the District Court\u2019s affirmance of the refereee\u2019s confirmation of the arrangement is merely a sham designed to delay implementation of the plan and to provide Products with a competitive advantage. In fact, Debt- or is so firmly convinced of the frivolity of the appeal that it seeks the extraordinary relief of money damages and double costs provided by F.R.A.P. 38.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> For several reasons we reject this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In the first place Products\u2019 cross appeal is not altogether meritless. Debtor limits its attack almost exclusively to Products\u2019 argument challenging the voting procedure by which the creditors approved the plan of arrangement, correctly pointing out that Products apparently conceded the legitimacy of this procedure in a letter to the District Court.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> But Products <em>also </em>contends that confirmation of the plan was intimately related to the continuing vitality of the licensing agreement, inasmuch as the arrangement contemplated extending Debt- or\u2019s franchise for an indefinite period of time. Since the District Court\u2019s second order merely affirmed the referee\u2019s confirmation without specifically referring to the earlier dissolution of the injunetion, Products had ample reason for initiating a protective cross appeal, particularly after Debtor sought review and reinstatement of the referee\u2019s injunctive order, which was granted (note 1, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">In the second place the disposition of these proceedings by means of two separate orders in the District Court may very well have left Products genuinely uncertain with respect to its legal obligation and liability under the licensing agreement. Any lingering doubts on that score may now be resolved because both orders have been appealed. Proceeding on the premise that the District Court\u2019s judgment is to be interpreted in light of its opinions, findings, and conclusions of law,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we hold that the most reasonable interpretation is also the correct one: the Court approved confirmation of the arrangement in all respects except as it provided for a perpetuation of the exclusive licensing agreement, which the Court held had been lawfully terminated by Products. That decision nullified anything to the contrary in the referee\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">The injunction granted by this Court\u2019s order of September 27, 1971 is dissolved. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\">. This Court reinstated the injunction pending appeal.

Investors Commercial Corp., 9 Cir., 1949, 172 F.2d 800; McCray v. Sapulpa Petroleum Co., 8 Cir., 1929, 31 F.2d 437.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b250-9\">. We do not consider Products\u2019 theory that the method of securing voting acceptances was defective, not because it is frivolous or because Products misrepresented its position before the District Court, but because it obviously has no <em>standing to </em>raise the point. Products\u2019 argument is that one member of a separate .class of unsecured creditors may eventually recover a larger pro rata share of its claim than creditors generally. Even so, Products is not aggrieved, since it is not a member of that class. Cf. In re Michigan Ohio Building Corp., 7 Cir., 1941, 117 F.2d 191; Milgram. v. Loew\u2019s, Inc., 3 Cir., 1951, 192 F.2d 579, 586.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b250-15\">. Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v.
