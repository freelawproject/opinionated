The plaintiff is a disabled veteran within the meaning of the civil service statute, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 26,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and claims that discharge<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on abolition of his position contravenes the statutory preference accorded disabled veterans. Specifically, he objects to the retention of five employees who were not disabled veterans, and who had been provisionally promoted to positions that he alleges were functionally the same as his own. In the alternative, he argues that the employer improperly denied his right, in lieu of discharge, to transfer to a lower position outside the unit to which he was directly assigned. We allowed the plaintiff\u2019s application for direct appellate review and conclude that the relevant positions were not equivalent, the provisional nature of the promotions of the other employees was irrelevant here, and the right to request demotion in lieu of discharge encompassed only lower positions in the plaintiff\u2019s departmental unit. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\"><em>Background. </em>We recite the relevant facts. The Bureau of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Special Investigations (BSI) was formed as a subdivision of the Department of Revenue (department) by St. 1999, c. 127, \u00a7 26.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The BSI was one of several such subdivisions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 14, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 1A. Its purpose was, among other things, to \u201cinitiate investigations and review procedures in order to discover any fraudulent claim or wrongful receipt under any assistance program administered by the department of transitional assistance or . . . the department of social services.\u201d St. 1999, c. 27, \u00a7 26. To this end, the BSI employed numerous special investigators who were subject to the protection of the civil service statute. See <em>id. </em>See also G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The special investigators occupied three positions: Special Investigator A/B (SI-A/B), Special Investigator C (SI-C), and Special Investigator D (SI-D). The plaintiff, a disabled veteran, was employed and tenured in the SI-A/B position. A tenured employee in the civil service system is one who initially occupied a position by original appointment pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 6, and has completed the probationary period, or one who has received a \u201cpromotional appointment\u201d on a permanent basis as provided in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In 2002, the BSI faced a serious budgetary shortfall and initiated a reduction of its workforce. The BSI abolished all SI-A/B positions and all but five SI-C positions,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and accordingly discharged the incumbents, including the plaintiff. Five employees were retained to staff the SI-C positions, none of whom was a disabled veteran.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Like the plaintiff, each of these individuals was tenured in the SI-A/B position, but unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>the plaintiff, each had also previously served in the SI-C position pursuant to a provisional promotion. A provisional promotion differs from an original appointment or \u201cpromotional appointment\u201d (resulting in permanent or tenured status) in that it avoids use of the civil service \u201celigible list\u201d and ends automatically on \u201ccertification ... of the names of three persons eligible for and willing to accept promotion to [the] position.\u201d See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 15. The plaintiff received a hearing after which the department determined that a lack of funding justified discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The plaintiff then appealed to the commission pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 43. Both parties presented evidence to a hearing officer, see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2, regarding the nature of the SI-A/B and SI-C positions. The BSI submitted written \u201cclass specifications\u201d for the positions that had been promulgated by the human resources division of the Executive Office for Administration and Finance, see G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4A. According to the specifications, the SI-A/B position was \u201cnonsupervisory,\u201d while the SI-C position consisted of \u201cfirst-level supervisors\u201d who \u201ctypically supervise\u201d employees in the SI-A/B position, \u201cand/or non-supervisory employees performing the most complex assignments\u201d who have \u201cexceptional mastery of technical job content beyond the usual competency level.\u201d The salary range for the SIA/B position was $43,274.40 to $58,215.82, while the range for the SI-C position was $47,493.16 to $63,954.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The acting director of the BSI testified that employees in the SI-C position performed \u201cmore complex\u201d assignments, \u201cand at times [] could supervise over individuals in the \u2018A/B\u2019 status.\u201d The more \u201cdetailed\u201d or \u201ccomplex\u201d SI-C assignments, according to the acting director, included \u201cdrug diversion type cases or the Department of Medical Assistance type cases where there is a lot of analysis of data, evidence, those type[s] of investigations.\u201d In contrast, the plaintiff\u2019s duties, which were typical of employees in the SI-A/B position, generally encompassed \u201clooking] for people who defaulted on warrants . . . knocking] on doors . . . sending] [out] letters. ...\u201d The acting director admitted that the BSI had suffered from a \u201ccase backlog\u201d that compelled it to utilize employees in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>SI-C position to perform \u201cA/B\u201d duties, but he maintained that employees in the SI-A/B position never performed \u201ccomplex\u201d SI-C duties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The plaintiff testified that he had never been supervised by an employee in the SI-C position and that the only difference between the positions was in the level of compensation. He testified: \u201cI worked with \u2018A/Bs\u2019 and \u2018Cs.\u2019 We did the exact same cases [szc]. The cases were assigned randomly. . . . We all did the exact same job.\u201d The plaintiff admitted that some employees in the SI-C position were assigned to \u201cspecial projects\u201d that were somewhat more complex than his normal assignments. He also stated that he had regularly been \u201cpartner [ed]\u201d with employees in the SI-C position who were not assigned to special projects.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">In findings of fact, the hearing officer cited the written job descriptions and credited the testimony of the acting director of the unit. The hearing officer concluded that the SI-C position generally entailed more complex duties or a higher level of responsibility than the SI-A/B position, and that the plaintiff had no right to be retained in employment in the SI-C position. The hearing officer also decided that the plaintiff had no statutory right to obtain a lower position outside the BSI. The commission adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. On appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44, a judge in the Superior Court affirmed, concluding that the findings were supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d and that there was no other error of law. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\"><em>Standard of review. A </em>party aggrieved by a final decision of the commission may seek judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44. Such review is governed by the provisions of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Review of conclusions of law is de nova. <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>364 Mass. 593, 595 (1974). The commission\u2019s factual determinations must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>be supported by substantial evidence, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), meaning \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6). See <em>Trustees of Forbes Library </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>384 Mass. 559, 568 (1981). A reviewing court must consider the entire administrative record and take into account whatever \u201cfairly detracts from its weight.\u201d <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981), quoting <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 253 (1966). We defer, however, to the credibility determinations made by the hearing officer. See <em>Guarino </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 89, 92 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>The plaintiff first argues that as a disabled veteran, he should not have been discharged before the five employees who were ultimately retained in the SI-C positions (who were not disabled veterans). General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 39, provides that when an appointing authority (e.g., the department) lays off employees, it must do so in order of seniority within the group of \u201cpermanent employees in positions having the same title.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 39 informs application of the disabled veteran retention preference contained in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 26.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Adoption of Marlene, </em>443 Mass. 494, 498 (2005), quoting <em>Telesetsky </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>395 Mass. 868, 873 (1985) (statute is read as whole to produce \u201can internal consistency\u201d). Section 39 makes clear that a retention preference, either by seniority or by status as a disabled veteran, does not operate against employees in higher titles.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The preference therefore applied only with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>respect to other BSI employees in the plaintiff\u2019s title.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The plaintiff does not suggest otherwise. Instead, he argues that the SI-A/B and SI-C positions were in the same title. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">\u201cTitle\u201d is defined by G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1, as \u201ca descriptive name applied to a position or to a group of positions having similar duties and the same general level of responsibility.\u201d While \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 39 clearly contemplate that different positions (such as SIA/B and SI-C) may be in the same title, the department introduced substantial evidence, which was credited by the hearing officer, to support that officer\u2019s conclusion that employees in the SI-C position had either \u201cmore complex\u201d duties or a higher degree of responsibility (i.e., a supervisory role) than did employees in the SI-A/B position.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The plaintiff maintains that the hearing officer\u2019s findings were unsupported by substantial evidence because the plaintiff testified that cases were assigned randomly and employees in the SI-C position were not supervisors. However, the hearing officer \u201cwas free to believe . . . testimony [of the acting director of the BSI and the written job classification] and to disbelieve [the testimony] of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Abramowitz </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>390 Mass. 168, 173 (1983). \u201cIf the [hearing officer\u2019s] findings are . . . supported [by evidence], it is not open to the [Superior] Court or to this court to substitute other views as to what should be the determination of the facts.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>347 Mass. 264, 268 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The plaintiff next contends that retention preference should have been allocated based on the positions in which the employees were tenured, not those to which they were provisionally promoted. Rule 15 of the Personnel Administration Rules promulgated by the office of legal counsel of the human resources division, effective May 3, 1999, provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\u201c[a]ll civil service rights of an employee rest in the position in which he holds tenure.\u201d Because, the plaintiff\u2019s argument continues, the five employees retained lacked tenure in the SI-C position, these employees should have been considered in the SI-A/B position for purposes of the layoff. Accordingly, \u00a7 26 required that the plaintiff be \u201cretained in employment\u201d until all of the five were discharged. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s argument fails because all SI-A/B positions were eliminated and the plaintiff\u2019s status did not entitle him to promotion to an open SI-C position. See <em>MacCarthy </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Serv., </em>319 Mass. 124 (1946) (no disabled veterans\u2019 preference for promotion). Even if the plaintiff were correct and G. L. c. 31 required discharge of all five employees before the plaintiff, their discharge would not have vacated a position that the plaintiff had a right to occupy. In short, while the argument might support discharge of the remaining employees, it does not support retention of the plaintiff. Cf. note 7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Nevertheless, because the issue has been fully briefed and public policy would benefit from the elimination of any uncertainty concerning whether a provisionally promoted employee is \u201cin\u201d a higher title for purposes of \u00a7 39, see <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943), we address the issue, which is one of law, <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 595, and conclude that the commission was correct to consider the provisional promotions when contemplating layoffs. Provisional promotion pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 15, effects a real change from \u201cone title to the next higher title.\u201d A provisionally promoted employee ceases to be \u201cin\u201d the original title for purposes of \u00a7 39, and does not return to the lower title until the provisional promotion ceases to have effect. General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 15, provides only one exception to this rule, relating to calculation of eligibility for a promotional examination. \u201c[T]he fact that the Legislature specified one exception . . . strengthens the inference that no other exception was intended.\u201d <em>Protective Life Ins Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 620 (1997), quoting <em>LaBranche </em>v. <em>A.J. Lane &amp; Co., </em>404 Mass. 725, 729 (1989). Regardless whether the five employees provisionally promoted to the SI-C position possessed or lacked rights in the SI-C position pursuant to rule 15, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>that was the position in which they were employed for purposes of \u00a7 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Finally, the plaintiff claims that the commission erred in deciding that he could not \u201cbump\u201d to a lower position outside the BSI. An employee may elect to be demoted to a position in a lower title in lieu of discharge, provided that there is a less-senior employee in the lower title for the demoted employee to replace, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 39, a practice known as \u201cbumping.\u201d See <em>Herlihy </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 835, 835 (1998). The plaintiff argues that the BSI was not the controlling \u201cdepartmental unit,\u201d but instead was part of the larger departmental unit of the department, and he should therefore have been able to bump to any lower titles within the entire department. See <em>id. </em>at 838-840. This is not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">A \u201cdepartmental unit\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1, as a \u201cdepartment, or any division, institutional component or other component of a department established by law, ordinance, or by-law.\u201d The BSI was created by statute, St. 1999, c. 127, \u00a7 26, and therefore qualified under the definition. <em>Herlihy </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>is not to the contrary. There, the Appeals Court decided only that the applicable unit was not the facility in which the employee worked because the facility had been established by administrative regulations rather than by \u201claw, ordinance, or by-law.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 839. Here, the plaintiff has also failed to demonstrate any substantial similarity between his functions in the BSI and those of the larger organization. Thus, we agree with the judge, and the commission, whose interpretation is entitled to substantial deference, <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993), that the relevant \u201cdepartmental unit\u201d is the BSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b630-9\">General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 1, defines a \u201cdisabled veteran\u201d as a veteran within the meaning of G.

A unit performing similar functions was simultaneously created in the office of the State Auditor. See St. 2002, c. 184, \u00a7 12. It is unclear from the record whether the remaining employees in the SI-C position were reassigned to the unit. Approximately one year after discharge, the plaintiff returned to State service in a different agency at a substantially diminished salary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The acting director nonetheless could not identify specific work performed by particular employees in the SI-C position that was not also performed by employees in the SI-A/B position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The department conceded in its brief to the commission that the plaintiff \u201cparticipated in some front end detection cases, but was always paired with Special Investigators (C).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b634-5\">General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 39, states in pertinent part: \u201cIf permanent employees in positions having the same title in a departmental unit are to be separated from such positions because of lack of work or lack of money or abolition of positions, they shall ... be separated from employment\u201d in reverse order of seniority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b634-6\">General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 26, states in pertinent part that \u201c[a] disabled veteran shall be retained in employment in preference to all other persons, including veterans.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b634-7\">To read the statute otherwise would transform the preference into a right to be promoted whenever a lower title is eliminated.

See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 6B, 7, 8, 9. Such a reading would also be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>inconsistent with our prior decisions holding that the disabled veterans\u2019 preference does not apply to promotion.
