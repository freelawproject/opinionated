L. c. 269, \u00a7 14A,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and two counts of accosting a person of the opposite sex, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The charges arose from the defendant\u2019s random dialing of telephone numbers. When he reached young girls, he lured them into indecent conversation and asked them, among other things, to make pictures and videotape for him, presumably of themselves. The defendant was placed on probation for four three-month terms and two six-months terms, all to be served consecutively.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition to other conditions imposed, the defendant was ordered to have no \u201cunsupervised contact with anyone under the age of 16,\u201d except his family. Court supervision was to continue until May 14, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Just after midnight on July 19, 2002, Officer Clayton Carter of the Pawtucket, Rhode Island, police department responded to a report of a suspicious man in a white sports car. His interviews with those involved revealed the following. The previous day, \u201cthe car\u201d appeared to be following a young girl home from summer school. The girl was identified in the report as \u201cK.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Later that day, the man with the white car again leered at \u201cK\u201d inside a convenience store the girl was visiting with two friends, minors whom police identified as \u201cJ\u201d and \u201cB.\u201d The man followed \u201cK\u201d and her companions \u201chome.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The children provided a detailed description of the man to the police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"A3y\">Between 10 p.m. and midnight that evening, two women, one of whom was apparently the mother of some or all of the children, observed the \u201csame vehicle,\u201d \u201ccirculating the neighborhood\u201d while the women were sitting on \u201cthe front steps.\u201d The women described the vehicle as a white Mitsubishi Eclipse automobile bearing Massachusetts registration number 9929S. One of the women stated she told the driver, \u201cStop driving by here, you have been doing it all night.\u201d The man answered, \u201cI\u2019m looking for a friend, I\u2019m sorry[,] I did not mean anything by it.\u201d The same woman reported that she informed the operator she would contact the police and the driver said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"A7L\">Another Pawtucket police officer, Lance Trafford, traced the car to a Massachusetts company. A representative of the company confirmed ownership of the car and reported that it was being used by the defendant, who was an employee. The officer then contacted the defendant, who agreed to an interview.</p>\n<p id=\"AJB\">During the interview, the defendant made damaging admissions. He recalled the children with whom the detective was concerned. He related that he \u201csaw the girls when they left\u201d apparently referring to the store, \u201clooked at them\u201d and \u201cdrove by them,\u201d but \u201cdidn\u2019t see what road\u201d they took, and after losing track of them, \u201cjust drove around and around the block.\u201d Later, he appeared to admit to having followed the girls briefly after \u201cchecking them out.\u201d He said that was the first occasion on which he saw the girls. He also admitted that he had been chased away by a woman late that night. He assured the officer that he did not \u201cintend to go near them again or be around there [again].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aut\">The probation officer issued a notice of probation violation, in part for the defendant\u2019s \u201c[u]nsupervised contact\u201d with children under sixteen years of age.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A probation revocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>hearing was held at the Wrentham District Court. The probation officer and Officer Trafford testified. Officer Trafford did not have personal knowledge of the ages of the girls or the events of July 18, and he relied on Officer Carter\u2019s police report for portions of his testimony. Neither \u201cK,\u201d her companions, the two women, or Officer Carter testified. Relying in part on the hearsay statements in the police report, the judge found that the defendant had been in \u201ccontact\u201d with persons under sixteen years of age, revoked probation, and imposed the suspended sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The defendant sought a stay of execution of the sentences from a single justice of the Appeals Court. The single justice denied the stay, finding there was \u201ca substantial basis for the revocation of probation.\u201d The defendant appealed from the revocation to the Appeals Court, which affirmed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 131 (2005). This court granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review limited to the question whether <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>applies in probation violation hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Probation is a creature of statute, see G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 87, 87A; G. L. c. 279, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, with deep roots in the Commonwealth. See <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Quincy Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>395 Mass. 815, 817-818 n.2 (1985) (tracing history to Boston shoemaker who in 1841 began supplying to drunkards \u201cbail and rudimentary counseling\u201d). The purpose of probation rather than immediate execution of a term of imprisonment \u201cin large part is to enable the [convicted] person to get on his feet, to become law abiding and to lead a useful and upright life under the fostering influence of the probation officer.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Mariano </em>v. <em>Judge of Dist. Ct. of Cent. Berkshire, </em>243 Mass. 90, 93 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">A probationer has only a conditional liberty interest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olsen, </em>405 Mass. 491, 493 (1989); G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 3. He or she must comply with \u201csuch conditions\u201d as the sentencing judge \u201cdeems proper,\u201d G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>regularly report to a probation officer or otherwise submit to court supervision, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>428 Mass. 623, 626 (1999), and pay a monthly \u201cprobation fee,\u201d G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87A. A breach of a condition of probation constitutes a violation. <em>Rubera </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>371 Mass. 177, 180-181 (1976). If the probation officer receives information tending to show that the probationer has breached, the officer may \u201csurrender\u201d the probationer to the court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra </em>at 111. Inherent in a court\u2019s power to grant probation is the power to revoke it. <em>Jake J. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>433 Mass. 70, 77-78 (2000). The judge determines whether a violation in fact occurred and, in the court\u2019s discretion, whether the probationer\u2019s conduct warrants imposition of the original suspended sentence, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holmgren, </em>421 Mass. 224, 226, 228 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGovern, </em>183 Mass. 238, 240-241 (1903), or in the case of straight probation, imposition of a sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The probation revocation proceeding is not a new criminal prosecution. See <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olsen, supra. </em>The Commonwealth has already met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the person\u2019s guilt on the underlying crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holmgren, supra </em>at 225-226. The probationer escaped total loss of liberty only as a result of the trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 115 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">It follows that, at a revocation proceeding, \u201ca probationer need not be provided with the full panoply of constitutional protections applicable at a criminal trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112. The finding of a violation is not by a jury but by a judge, and is based only on a preponderance of the evidence, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holmgren, supra </em>at 226; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGovern, supra </em>at 240 (it is \u201cquestion of fact for the court ... to determine . . . whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>[defendant] had violated\u201d probation). The probationer lacks an absolute right to make a closing argument. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marvin, </em>417 Mass. 291, 295 (1994). Jeopardy does not attach at a probation revocation hearing, <em>Krochta </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>429 Mass. 711, 713-714 (1999), and a violation may be found even if the defendant has been acquitted of the same conduct after a criminal trial, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holmgren, supra </em>at 226-228. Decisions mandating suppression of evidence also do not apply, \u201cwhere the police who unlawfully obtained the evidence neither knew nor had reason to know of the probationary status of the person whose property was seized.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olsen, supra </em>at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In recognition that the probationer does have some liberty interest at stake in a revocation hearing, due process rights enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provide to the probationer: written notice of the claimed violation of probation, disclosure of the evidence against him or her, the opportunity to be heard in person and present witnesses and evidence, confrontation and cross-examination of adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds that there is good cause for not allowing confrontation or the hearsay evidence is reliable), a \u201cneutral and detached\u201d hearing body, and a written statement of the evidence relied on and the reasons for revoking probation. <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489 (1972) (parole). See <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, supra </em>at 786; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>441 Mass. 685, 690-691 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maggio, </em>414 Mass. 193, 196 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra </em>at 112-113; <em>Rubera </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 179-180 n.2. A judge cannot revoke probation arbitrarily or without a reason. <em>McHoul </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>365 Mass. 465, 470 (1974). In Massachusetts, a probationer has the right to counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>418 Mass. 352, 359-360 (1994), citing <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>350 Mass. 732, 736-737 (1966).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The defendant contends that, in addition, a right of confronta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>tian defined by <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004), is among the rights to which he is entitled at a revocation proceeding. In essence, he argues that a right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> applies to probation revocation hearings; the confrontation requirement of art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights applies, and the contours of the provision are defined by Crawford; or the limited right of confrontation arising from concepts of due process embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment and art. 12 are defined by Crawford.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">All the circuit courts of the United States Court of Appeals that have considered whether, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, the rule of <em>Crawford </em>applies to probation revocation hearings and similar proceedings, have decided in the negative.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>430 F.3d 44, 47-48 (1st Cir. 2005); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>419 F.3d 980, 985 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 838 (2005); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>418 F.3d 621, 627-628 (6th Cir. 2005); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Aspinall, </em>389 F.3d 332, 343 (2d Cir. 2004); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>382 F.3d 840, 844 (8th Cir. 2004).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See also <em>Ash </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>431 F.3d 826, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>829-830 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (parole).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These courts have all reasoned that the <em>Crawford </em>case interpreted only the Sixth Amendment, which by its terms applies solely to \u201ccriminal prosecutions,\u201d and that the right of confrontation ends on the determination of guilt and does not apply at sentencing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nunez, ante </em>54, 58 (2006); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1146 (11th Cir. 2005); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Luciano, </em>414 F.3d 174, 178-179 (1st Cir. 2005). Since a subsequent probation surrender proceeding is not a stage of a \u201ccriminal prosecution,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra </em>at 112, citing <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, supra </em>at 782, evidence is admissible at revocation proceedings \u201cthat would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\u201d <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, supra </em>at 489. See <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, supra </em>at 782 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The defendant\u2019s next argument concerns art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. That article provides an \u201cequivalent\u201d right of confrontation, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>413 Mass. 252, 260 (1992), applicable where a person is \u201cheld to answer for any crimes or offence.\u201d The Declaration of Rights does not define \u201coffence.\u201d The term is used in other portions of the document to encompass crimes generally. See Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 3, art. 11; Part II, c. 2, \u00a7 1, art. 8. Contemporary dictionaries defined the term somewhat more comprehensively than the word \u201ccrimes,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> a view endorsed in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>301 Mass. 615, 620 (1938). But we have never directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>answered the question reserved in <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>240 Mass. 264, 303 (1922), whether \u201cthe word \u2018offence\u2019 is used in our Constitution in a sense broad enough to include some matters not strictly criminal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">A subsequent decision provides useful guidance. Violation of prison rules by inmates subject to prison supervision is not considered an offense for art. 12 purposes, in part because the \u201cneed for fairness in disciplinary proceedings must be accommodated to the interest of maintaining prison security.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Cedar Junction, </em>396 Mass. 830, 832 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">A court may likewise summarily, and without confrontation, incarcerate a person pursuant to certain powers inherent in the courts. See art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>279 Mass. 607, 609 (1932) (each department of government \u201csupreme in its respective field\u201d). A judge has the inherent power to grant pretrial bail and compel the presence of a defendant at trial, and thus may deny or revoke bail summarily, thereby placing the defendant in custody without a \u201cfull-blown evidentiary hearing\u201d involving the confrontation of witnesses. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paquette, </em>440 Mass. 121, 128, 133 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1150 (2004) (bail revoked). <em>Querubin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>440 Mass. 108, 114-115, 118 (2003) (bail denied). Similarly, a judge has inherent authority to maintain the dignity necessary to execute judicial powers and preserve the authority of the court. See <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>304 Mass. 325, 340-341 (1939), quoting <em>Cartwright\u2019s Case, </em>114 Mass. 230, 238 (1873). Thus, art. 12\u2019s analogous jury trial provision does not diminish a judge\u2019s power to punish sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>marily a criminal contempt by incarceration, see <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>although other sources of authority now constrain a judge\u2019s discretion in such matters.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In the present case, the defendant was subject to the supervision and authority of the court, which had the inherent authority to revoke his probation. See <em>Jake J. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 78. We conclude, in accordance with these decisions, that art. 12 presents no impediment to summary procedure, and does not assure the probationer an absolute and inflexible right to confront the witnesses against him as described in the <em>Crawford </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Of course, concepts of due process embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment, see <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, supra </em>at 786, and art. 12, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Milton, 427 </em>Mass. 18, 22 (1998), do apply and give rise to the broader but more flexible right of confrontation described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra </em>at 117-119.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This due process right is less stringent than the right of confrontation in criminal prosecutions for several reasons. As discussed above, a probationer\u2019s liberty interest is not absolute. <em>Id. </em>at 115. At the time of the revocation hearing, the Commonwealth \u201chas already gone through the expense and effort of convicting\u201d the defendant and it \u201chas a strong interest in being able to revoke probation in appropriate cases without having to repeat its effort.\u201dId. at 116. In addition, unlike criminal prosecutions, probation revocation proceedings may be conducted in a location distant from the place of the violation, even, as here, in another State. Cf. art. 13 of the Massachusetts Declaration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Rights (vicinity requirement)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brogan, </em>415 Mass. 169, 173-174 (1993) (criminal contempt may be prosecuted in court whose order was violated when such court situated near locus of acts alleged).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">As a result, we are satisfied that due process is not offended by admission in a probation revocation hearing of hearsay evidence that a judge determines to be \u201csubstantially reliable,\u201d or for which \u201cgood cause\u201d is otherwise shown. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra </em>at 117-119. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>441 Mass. 685, 691 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The order of the District Court judge revoking probation is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-17\">The record reflects that the term of incarceration imposed as a result of revocation has expired, but we address the merits nonetheless because revoca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>tian of probation may have collateral consequences beyond the term of incarceration, see <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd., 369 </em>Mass. 701, 704 (1976) (distinguishing revocation of probation, denial of parole, and denial of early eligibility for parole), and the administration of justice would benefit from resolution of confusion and uncertainty on these issues.
