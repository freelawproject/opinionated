The board acted pursuant to G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 31,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22 <em>(j), </em>as appearing in St. 2004, c. 137, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In a verified complaint, the plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring that the board had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>exceeded its authority. The plaintiffs also alleged that a conflict of interest existed for one member of the board who voted in favor of the town regulation, rendering the vote null and void. They further alleged various constitutional and statutory claims: the regulation was vague and overbroad, infringed their members\u2019 right to privacy in violation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, unlawfully restricted their freedom of assembly, violated the free exercise of their members\u2019 religious beliefs, constituted a governmental taking of property without adequate compensation or due process of law, and constituted a violation of the Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on the basis of all these claims except the claim under the Civil Rights Act. They additionally argued that G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22, sometimes referred to as the smoke-free workplace law, preempts local restrictions of smoking in the premises of membership associations. At the suggestion of the judge in the Superior Court, who noted that there appeared to be no facts in dispute, the parties submitted the matter for final resolution on a statement of agreed facts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The judge concluded that the town regulation was \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary and capricious\u201d as applied to \u201cprivate clubs,\u201d exceeded the board\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 31, and was therefore \u201cvoid and unenforceable.\u201d Final judgment entered to that effect, and the judge permanently enjoined the defendants from enforcing the regulation. He stated that he did not need to reach the remaining claims of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The defendants appealed, and we granted their application for direct appellate review. We conclude that the board had the authority to promulgate the regulation pursuant to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 31, and that its authority to do so is not preempted by G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22, as rewritten in 2004. We further conclude that the regulation is not vague or overbroad, does not violate the rights of the plaintiffs or their members to privacy under G. L. c. 214, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u00a7 IB, to assembly under the United States Constitution, or to the free exercise of religion under the United States Constitution or the Massachusetts Constitution. In addition, the plaintiffs have not established a violation of the Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111. We remand the claim of deprivation of property without due process or adequate compensation because the town argues that there are insufficient uncontested facts in the record for us to resolve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>In 2004, the Legislature rewrote the then-existing antismoking legislation, G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22, substantially expanding the reach of that statute to \u201cprotect the health of the employees of the commonwealth.\u201d St. 2004, c. 137, preamble. Compare G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22, as appearing in St. 2004, c. 137, \u00a7 2, with G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22, as amended through St. 1997, c. 85. The 2004 smoke-free workplace law mandated a \u201csmoke free environment for all employees working in an enclosed workplace.\u201d G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22 <em>(b) </em>(1). To that end, the 2004 statute \u201cprohibited\u201d smoking in all workplaces, private<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and public.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The 2004 legislation further provided that smoking <em>\u201cmay </em>be permitted\u201d in nine specifically enumerated \u201cplaces and circumstances,\u201d G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22 (c), one of which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201cpremises occupied by a membership association\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> if the premises is owned or under lease for a term of not less than ninety consecutive days by the association, G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22 <em>(c) </em>(2) (i) (emphasis added). The statute also provided that smoking is <em>not </em>permitted in \u201can enclosed indoor space\u201d of a membership association during the time the space is \u201copen to the public,\u201d \u201coccupied by a non-member who is not an invited guest of a member or an employee of the association,\u201d or \u201crented from the association\u201d for compensation. G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22 (c) (2) (i) (A)-(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Of further relevance to this litigation is the provision of the 2004 legislation concerning preemption. Specifically, G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22 (/), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">\u201cNothing in this section shall permit smoking in an area in which smoking is or may hereafter be prohibited by law including, without limitation: any other law or ordinance or by-law or any fire, health or safety regulation. Nothing in this section shall preempt further limitation of smoking by the commonwealth or any department, agency or political subdivision of the commonwealth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">In the wake of the 2004 legislation, the board promulgated a local antismoking regulation to \u201cprotect and improve the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in membership associations.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The town regulation recites that \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d exists that tobacco smoke \u201ccauses cancer, respiratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>and cardiac diseases\u201d and other diseases and harmful health effects enumerated in the regulation, notes the harmful effects of smoking on smokers and nonsmokers alike, states that secondhand smoke has been classified as a \u201cknown human carcinogen\u201d by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among others, and recognizes \u201cthe right of those who wish to breathe smoke free air.\u201d The town regulation prohibits smoking at all times \u201cin the enclosed areas of membership associations, also known as private clubs,\u201d and declares it \u201cunlawful\u201d for any person having control of such premises to permit a violation of the regulation. Violation of the regulation \u201cmay\u201d result in either criminal or noncriminal consequences.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Subsequent to the adoption of the town regulation, the Department of Public Health (department) promulgated State-wide antismoking regulations, 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 661.000 (2005), to provide standards for the implementation of G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22. The department\u2019s regulations concern, among other things, smoking in membership associations. See 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 661.003 (adopting definition of membership associations utilized in G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22), 661.100.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The department\u2019s regulations contain an antipreemption provision directed to the local regulation of smoking. See 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 661.001 (\u201cNothing in [these regulations] shall be interpreted as limiting or preempting further restrictions on smoking by any local by-law, ordinance or regulation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Shortly after the board promulgated the town regulation, the plaintiffs, the American Lithuanian Naturalization Club, Athol, Mass., Inc. (Lithuanian Club); the Franco-American Naturalization Club, Inc. (Franco-American Club); and the American Legion Post #102, Inc. (American Legion), brought this action challenging the validity of the town regulation. The plaintiffs asserted that they are \u201cprivate clubs\u201d not generally open to the public and that the board had no authority to prohibit smoking in their premises when the public is excluded and only members are present. We briefly describe the plaintiffs, their organizational structures, and facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Each plaintiff is organized as a charitable corporation under G. L. c. 180,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and owns its building. Each has been licensed to serve alcoholic beverages. Only adults are permitted to become members; guests are permitted in each club at any time if accompanied by a member. Members perform all labor at the clubs, including bartending.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although the clubs are \u201cprivate,\u201d all three \u201cregularly\u201d conduct fund raising activities for local charities, consistent with their charters and their mission statements.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The premises of all three are also open to the public during \u201csanctioned\u201d social events. At such times each club prohibits all smoking in all parts of its premises. At all other times the doors to the buildings are locked and signs posted to indicate that only members may enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">2. <em>The authority of the board. </em>We consider first the town\u2019s authority to promulgate the regulation pursuant to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 31,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> before addressing the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that any local regulation of smoking in the premises of membership associa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>tians is preempted by the 2004 smoke-free workplace law, G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The judge concluded that the board did not have the authority to restrict smoking in \u201cprivate membership clubs\u201d under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 31, reasoning that membership associations \u201cdo not directly affect the public, except in very limited circumstances.\u201d He emphasized that the members of the clubs join voluntarily and choose to smoke or join the associations knowing that smoking is permitted, and that no smoking is permitted when the clubs are open to the public. The judge\u2019s reading of the statute is unduly restrictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">We have long recognized that the rule making authority of local boards of health is broad. See <em>Independence Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Barnstable, </em>403 Mass. 477, 480 (1988) (G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 31, provides boards of health with \u201cplenary power to promulgate reasonable health regulations that are general in application and take effect prospectively\u201d). See also <em>Brodbine </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>182 Mass. 598, 601 (1903) (\u201cthe making of roles and regulations for the preservation of the public health has been intrusted to boards of health in towns as well as in cities, and to a State board of health\u201d). Our standard of review of health regulations is settled: they \u201chave a strong presumption of validity,\u201d <em>Tri-Nel Mgt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Barnstable, </em>433 Mass. 217, 220 (2001), stand \u201con the same footing as would a statute,\u201d <em>Padden </em>v. <em>West Boylston, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 120, 124-125 (2005), quoting <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 138 (1949), and a reviewing court \u201cmust make all rational presumptions in favor of [their] validity.\u201d <em>Padden </em>v. <em>West Boylston, supra </em>at 125. A plaintiff challenging a health regulation must prove that the regulation \u201ccannot be supported upon any rational basis of fact that reasonably can be conceived to sustain it.\u201d <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The stated purpose of the health regulation at issue here is \u201cto protect and improve the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in membership associations.\u201d As noted earlier, the regulation recites the substantial health dangers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>caused by tobacco smoke to smokers and nonsmokers alike, and recognizes that second-hand smoke has been classified as a \u201cknown human carcinogen.\u201d See <em>Aspinall </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Cos., </em>442 Mass. 381, 388 n.16 (2004) (taking judicial notice of United States Surgeon General\u2019s 2004 report on health consequences of smoking). The plaintiffs acknowledge that smoking, including second-hand smoke, is harmful to health. Their claim is that any regulation of smoking must be limited to places and circumstances in which the general public is invited or present.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The focus of public health is to protect the health of every member of a community. See, e.g., <em>Service </em>v. <em>Newburyport Hous. Auth., </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 278, 283-284 (2005), quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 737 (8th ed. 2004) (public health is \u201c[t]he health of the community at large . . .[;] [t]he healthful or sanitary condition of the general body of people or the community en masse; especially] the methods of maintaining the health of the community . . .\u201d). Nothing in G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 31, or our prior case law warrants a conclusion that members of a community may be protected by health regulations only when they are in a location to which the public has access. Cf. <em>Arthur D. Little, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Cambridge, </em>395 Mass. 535, 537 (1985) (upholding municipal regulation prohibiting \u201ctesting, storage, transportation and disposal, within the city of Cambridge, of [certain] chemical warfare agents\u201d); <em>Padden </em>v. <em>West Boylston, supra </em>at 124-125 (upholding mandatory sewer connections regulation promulgated by town board of health).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The plaintiffs acknowledge that their premises are open to members of the public during fundraisers or when they are rented, and members of the Athol community (among others) are invited as guests to the premises even when the general public is not invited. Even if smoking members choose to disregard the overwhelming evidence of the serious health consequences of smoking, the board rationally could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>concerned about the exposure of nonsmokers to a \u201cknown human carcinogen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">We need not consider in this case whether smoking may be prohibited in a private residence. These membership associations are incorporated in, and receive the benefit of, Massachusetts laws and licenses. The general public has access to the premises from time to time, and nonsmoking members and their guests have access all of the time. Because there is a \u201crational connection between the regulation and the public purpose to be achieved,\u201d <em>Hamel </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Edgartown, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 420, 423 (1996), the board acted well within its authority pursuant to G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 31, in promulgating the town regulation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Tri-Nel Mgt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Barnstable, supra </em>at 221 (given dangers of environmental tobacco smoke, local board of health regulation prohibiting smoking in all food service establishments, lounges, and bars is \u201cwithin the standard of reasonableness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">3. <em>Preemption by G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22. </em>Turning to the 2004 smoke-free workplace law, G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22, the judge concluded that the town regulation was invalid because, in crafting the 2004 statute \u201cto prevent smoking in public buildings and workplaces,\u201d the Legislature focused on places \u201cwhere the <em>public </em>would congregate\u201d (emphasis in original). He pointed to the nine places and circumstances \u201cexempted\u201d (in his words) by the Legislature from the outright prohibition mandated by the 2004 statute, including \u201cmembership associations.\u201d See G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22 (c) (2) (ii). The judge reasoned that the Legislature could not have \u201cintended to grant a local [bjoard of [hjealth that broad an authority over smoking in private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>membership clubs.\u201d The judge misconstrues the specific language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Both the statute, G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22, and its implementing regulations, 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 661.000, define places and circumstances in which smoking <em>\u201cshall </em>be prohibited\u201d (or \u201cno smoking shall be permitted\u201d) and other places and circumstances in which smoking <em>\u201cmay </em>be permitted\u201d (emphasis added). Compare G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22 (c) (2) (i), and 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 661.100(A), with G.L. c. 270, \u00a7 22 (c) (2) (ii), and 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 661.100(B), (C). Neither the statute nor the implementing regulations provides that smoking <em>\u201cshall </em>be <em>permitted\u201d </em>in any place or circumstance. The enumerated circumstances in which smoking \u201cmay\u201d be permitted are not \u201cexempt\u201d from the statute, as the judge ruled.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To the contrary, these places and circumstances (including membership associations) \u201cmay\u201d be subject to stricter regulations on smoking by municipalities and their boards of health. See G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22 (j); 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 661.001. See also <em>Tri-Nel Mgt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Barnstable, supra </em>at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">There were sound reasons for the Legislature to conclude that further regulation of the nine \u201cplaces and circumstances\u201d specified in G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22 (c) (2) (ii), including the premises of membership associations, was better left to local regulatory entities. The range of membership associations is broad. Some may be employers, subjecting them to the smoke-free workplace statute and regulations. See G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22 (a) (defining \u201c[ejmployer\u201d for purposes of statute). Some, but not all, are licensed to sell alcohol. Some, but not all, invite members of the public or guests to their premises. Some, but not all, have members who are both smokers and nonsmokers. Recognizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the broad range of membership associations throughout the Commonwealth, the Legislature did not determine that smoking \u201cshall be prohibited\u201d in all such associations; it expressly left it to local boards of health to establish smoking restrictions, should they deem it appropriate. The intention of the Legislature could not be more clear: the language of the statute itself defeats any claim of preemption. See <em>Tri-Nel Mgt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Barnstable, supra </em>at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">That the 2004 smoke-free workplace law expressly permits further smoking regulation by local authorities does not end our inquiry. A town may not promulgate a regulation that is inconsistent with State law. See art. 2, \u00a7 6, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, as amended by art. 89 of the Amendments (\u201cAny city or town may, by the adoption, amendment, or repeal of local ordinances or by-laws, exercise any power or function which the general court has power to confer upon it, which is not inconsistent with the constitution or laws enacted by the general court . . .\u201d). The plaintiffs argue, and the judge agreed, that the town regulation restricting smoking in membership associations conflicts with the 2004 statute. We see no conflict. \u201cIn determining whether a local ordinance or bylaw is inconsistent with a State statute, we have given municipalities \u2018considerable latitude,\u2019 requiring a \u2018sharp conflict\u2019 between the ordinance or by-law and the statute before invalidating the local law.\u201d <em>Take Five Vending, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Provincetown, </em>415 Mass. 741, 744 (1993), quoting <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>363 Mass. 136, 154 (1973). See <em>Tri-Nel Mgt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Barnstable, supra </em>at 223 (applying same reasoning to board of health regulation). Where, as here, the Legislature expressly authorized local action, and where the statute was not \u201cso comprehensive that an inference would be justified that the Legislature intended to preempt the field,\u201d <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>394 Mass. 518, 524 (1985), a conflict appears only where \u201cthe purpose of the statute cannot be achieved in the face of the local [regulation].\u201d <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>379 Mass. 43, 54 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The purpose of the statute and the town regulation are complementary; the latter merely extends the reach of the former to membership associations. The purpose of the 2004 revision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>to G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22, is to \u201cprotect the health of the employees of the commonwealth.\u201d St. 2004, c. 137, preamble. The purpose of the town regulation is \u201cto protect and improve the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in membership associations.\u201d The legislative purpose can certainly be achieved \u201cin the face of [the] local [regulation] on the same subject.\u201d <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">4. <em>Constitutional issues. </em>As noted earlier, in the Superior Court the plaintiffs submitted all their claims except their claim under the Civil Rights Act, see note 29, <em>infra. </em>All questions of law and fact are therefore open to our decision on review. See <em>Gulf Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Auth., </em>364 Mass. 492, 493 (1974). Cf. <em>Loyal Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Indemn. &amp; Life Ins. Co., 362 </em>Mass. 484, 485 (1972) (deciding issues of fact and law, on appeal on report of material facts and transcript of evidence). On appeal, the town addresses all but the takings claim. The plaintiffs, however, make no argument concerning their constitutional or conflict claims, noting only that, if this court considers those claims, \u201cin the interests of economy\u201d the plaintiffs \u201cincorporate the arguments made in favor of those claims before the lower court.\u201d We \u201cneed not pass upon questions or issues not argued in the brief,\u201d Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, <em>367 </em>Mass. 921 (1975). Cf. <em>Drain </em>v. <em>Brookline Sav. Bank, </em>327 Mass. 435, 438 (1951) (reliance on errors asserted in trial court not argued on appeal but incorporated in brief by reference is of \u201cno effect\u201d). We nevertheless address the constitutional claims likely to arise in similar challenges to local antismoking regulations.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943) (issue \u201cnot properly presented for discussion\u201d addressed \u201cin view of the public interest involved and the uncertainty and confusion now existing\u201d). We may dispose of these claims summarily. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The town regulation, insofar as it contains criminal penalties,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><footnotemark>23</footnotemark> is neither vague nor overbroad. A statute must \u201cdefine the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>395 Mass. 302, 304 (1985), quoting <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983). The town regulation defines \u201c[m]embership association\u201d with clarity, incorporating the definition that appears in G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22. It also describes in detail the circumstances in which smoking is prohibited.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The town regulation is sufficiently explicit to inform the plaintiffs of conduct that could subject them to criminal penalties. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spano, </em>414 Mass. 178, 180 (1993) (\u201ccriminal statutes [must] be defined in terms that are sufficiently clear to permit a person of average intelligence to comprehend what conduct is prohibited\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The town regulation is not an \u201cunreasonable, substantial and serious interference\u201d with the right of privacy of the associations and their members in violation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Because their premises are \u201clocked and not open to the public,\u201d the plaintiffs claim that the regulation of activities that occur inside the buildings constitutes an invasion of privacy. The statute does not sound in trespass; it protects the invasion of some personal aspect of an individual, not a location. See, e.g., <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Bus. Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 518 (1984) (disclosure of employee\u2019s private medical information may constitute violation of privacy under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B); <em>Galdauckas </em>v. <em>Interstate Hotels Corp., </em>901 F. Supp. 454, 470 (D. Mass. 1995) (disclosure of plaintiff\u2019s age does not constitute serious or unreasonable interference with privacy rights under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The regulation does not infringe the plaintiffs\u2019 right to free assembly under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The freedom of association encompasses \u201cthe right \u2018to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships,\u2019 and a right \u2018to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment \u2014 speech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the exercise of religion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Concord Rod &amp; Gun Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>402 Mass. 716, 721 (1988), quoting <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 617-618 (1984). Although some members \u201chave threatened that they will no longer socialize at the clubs if smoking is not permitted,\u201d there has been no showing that enforcement of the town regulation will infringe the members\u2019 right to maintain relationships with each other or to engage in First Amendment activities.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The free exercise clause of the United States Constitution protects the \u201cfreedom to believe and freedom to act,\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>386 Mass. 367, 375, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 970 (1982), quoting <em>Cantwell </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940). Article 2 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights protects both religious beliefs and religious practices. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Desilets, </em>418 Mass. 316, 332-333 (1994). There is no claim that \u201csmoking\u201d is any aspect of any \u201cbelief\u201d of the association members or that smoking is related to any religious practices that take place on the plaintiffs\u2019 premises. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra. </em>The town regulation does not infringe any rights the plaintiffs may have under the freedom of religion clause of the Federal or State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The plaintiffs claim that the regulation improperly deprives them of their property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in two respects. Observing that the board is required to publish notice of the regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>after its adoption, the plaintiffs claim both that the required publication has not \u201cbeen verified\u201d and that they were deprived of due process because they were not provided with notice before the regulation was promulgated. Second, they claim that the town regulation \u201cseverely curtail[s]\u201d their use or enjoyment of their property, without adequately compensating them. The town did not challenge these factual assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">With one exception not relevant,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> neither G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 31, nor principles of due process require a hearing or findings to support the exercise of a board of health\u2019s rule making authority. See <em>Arthur D. Little, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Cambridge, </em>395 Mass. 535, 540-541 (1985). The plaintiffs have no basis on which to claim a right to a hearing. See <em>id. </em>The board is required to give notice by publication after adoption of a regulation. G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 31.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> While we cannot determine whether the defendants complied with this requirement, the plaintiffs have not alleged that they were harmed in any respect by any failure of the board to publish the town regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The town argues on appeal that whether the town regulation constituted a deprivation of property without adequate compensation cannot be resolved on the record before us. We therefore remand only this aspect of the plaintiffs\u2019 takings claim to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs claim that the defendants violated the Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It is not resolved whether the Civil Rights Act applies to municipalities. Cf. <em>Swanset Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>423 Mass. 390, 396 (1996) (\u201cEven if we as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>sume that the Act applies to municipalities . . .\u201d). Even if the Civil Rights Act applies, to succeed in their claim under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111, \u201cthe plaintiffs must prove that (1) their exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of either the United States or of the Commonwealth, (2) have been interfered with, or attempted to be interfered with, and (3) that the interference or attempted interference was by \u2018threats, intimidation or coercion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395. With the exception of their takings claim, the plaintiffs have not established that the town regulation interferes with, or attempts to interfere with, any of their constitutional rights. There is no basis for recovery under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>We vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court for consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the town regulation constitutes a deprivation of property without adequate compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\n<em>REGULATION PROHIBITING SMOKING IN MEMBERSHIP ASSOCIATIONS IN ATHOL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">\u201cA. Statement of Purpose:</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Whereas conclusive evidence exists that tobacco smoke causes cancer, respiratory and cardiac diseases, negative birth outcomes, irritations to the eyes, nose, and throat; and whereas the harmful effects of tobacco smoke are not confined to smokers but also cause severe discomfort and illness to nonsmokers; and whereas environmental tobacco smoke [hereinafter ETS], which includes both exhaled smoke and the side stream smoke from burning tobacco products, causes the death of 53,000 Americans each year (McGinnis JM, Foege W, \u2018Actual Causes of Death in the United States\u2019, JAMA 1993 270:2207-2212); and whereas the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classified secondhand smoke as a known human carcinogen and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization also classified secondhand smoke as a known human carcinogen (IARCWHO, 2002); now, therefore, the Board of Health of the town of Athol recognizes the right of those who wish to breathe smoke free air and establishes this regulation to protect and improve the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoke in membership associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">\u201cB.

Nothing in this section shall preempt further limitation of smoking by the commonwealth ... or political subdivision of the commonwealth.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u201cC.

P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975), which is specific to the particular defendant in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The regulation provides for the filing of a criminal complaint as a possible consequence of its violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The plaintiffs argued that a \u201cperson of normal intelligence in Athol cannot know in advance whether one can smoke in a particular place or not\u201d because \u201cevery square inch of the Town of Athol could be a \u2018private club\u2019 if two or more people gather there, including private residences.\u201d The argument is frivolous. \u201cMembership association\u201d is defined in the town regulation as a not-for-profit entity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\">General Laws c. 214, \u00a7 IB, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA person shall have a right against unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with his privacy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The plaintiffs asserted, and we accept as undisputed, that \u201c[a]t their events and social gatherings, [the plaintiff associations] foster and communicate a common system of beliefs and values for members and others to follow, and engage to some extent in religious activities.\u201d The regulation does not prevent members from assembling for these purposes. There is no claim that smoking, or the promotion of tobacco products, is central to any expressive activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">General Laws c. 111, \u00a7 31, requires a hearing for regulations or amendments thereto that \u201crelatef] to the minimum requirements for subsurface disposal of sanitary sewage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\">General Laws c. 111, \u00a7 31, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA summary which shall describe the substance of any regulation made by a board of health under this chapter shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or town, and such publication shall be notice to all persons.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\">This claim is the only one for which the plaintiffs made no argument in their motion for preliminary injunction. We nevertheless address it because, to the extent that the plaintiffs cannot establish a violation of their constitutional rights, there is no recovery under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
