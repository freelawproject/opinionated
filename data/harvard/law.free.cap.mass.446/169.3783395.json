L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), John P. Bulger\u2019s convictions of two counts of perjury and two counts of obstruction of justice in Federal District Court involved \u201cviolation[s] of the laws applicable to his office or position\u201d as clerk-magistrate of the Boston Juvenile Court such that he forfeited his entitlement to a retirement allowance as a member of the State employees\u2019 retirement system. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Bulger did violate the laws applicable to his office and that, consequently, forfeiture of his pension was statutorily required.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">Bulger began his employment with the Commonwealth in 1964, when he was hired by the Metropolitan District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Commission. In June, 1982, Bulger was appointed to serve as clerk-magistrate of the Boston Juvenile Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When he was sworn into office, Bulger pledged to \u201cbear true faith and allegiance to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\u201d and to \u201csupport the constitution thereof.\u201d Part H, c. 6, art. 1, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, as amended by art. 6 of the Amendments. He further solemnly swore and affirmed that he would \u201cfaithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon [him] as [the Clerk-Magistrate of the Boston Juvenile Court]: according to the best of [his] abilities and understanding, agreeably, to the rules and regulations of the constitution, and the laws of [the] Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Last, Bulger solemnly swore that he would \u201csupport the Constitution of the United States.\u201d See art. VI, third par., of the United States Constitution. This appointment lasted for nearly nineteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Effective April 27, 2001, Bulger was granted a superannuation retirement from his position as clerk-magistrate. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5. He was credited with thirty-two years and nine months of service with the State, and the Commonwealth began to pay Bulger a monthly pension of $5,326.16.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Continued payment of Bulger\u2019s retirement allowance during his lifetime was subject to, among other things, the provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15, which pertain to dereliction of duty by a member of the contributory retirement system for public employees (member). See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12 (2). General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), in particular, provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">\u201cIn no event shall any member after final conviction of a criminal offense <em>involving violation of the laws applicable to his office or position, </em>be entitled to receive a retire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>ment allowance under the provisions of [\u00a7\u00a7 1-28], inclusive, nor shall any beneficiary be entitled to receive any benefits under such provisions on account of such member\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">On November 8, 2001, Bulger was indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on two counts of pequry, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 (2000), and two counts of obstruction of justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 (2000). A grand jury had been conducting an investigation into alleged money laundering, racketeering, and other criminal offenses committed by, among others, Bulger\u2019s brother, James Bulger. It was material to this investigation that the grand jury determine \u201cthe nature, location, source, form, and ownership of any properties, accounts, safe deposit boxes, cash, and other assets possessed, controlled, transferred and transacted\u201d by James Bulger. The indictment alleged that, on November 26, 1996, Bulger falsely testified, under oath, that he had no knowledge of any safe deposit box belonging to or controlled by James Bulger. According to the indictment, the purpose and effect of such testimony was to obstruct and impede the grand jury investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">A grand jury also had been conducting an investigation into persons involved in the commission of criminal offenses related to harboring and concealing James Bulger, who had been a fugitive from Federal criminal charges in Massachusetts since January, 1995. The November 8, 2001, indictment alleged that, on January 22, 1998, Bulger falsely testified, under oath, that, since January, 1995, he had received no direct or indirect communications from James Bulger, and that he was unaware of others who had received such communications. According to the indictment, the purpose and effect of this testimony was, once again, to obstruct and impede the grand jury investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">On April 10, 2003, Bulger pleaded guilty to the two counts of perjury and two counts of obstruction of justice set forth in the November 8, 2001, indictment. He was sentenced to serve a prison term of six months and three years of supervised release (with the first six months of the latter spent in home confinement), and to pay a fine of $3,000 and a mandatory assessment of $400.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The State Board of Retirement (board) notified Bulger that it was commencing a proceeding to determine whether it should take any action in connection with his retirement allowance. Additionally, the board informed Bulger that it intended to withhold the distribution of further pension payments to Bulger until final disposition of the matter. In response to Bulger\u2019s request for immediate resumption of his pension payments, the board voted at its August 28, 2003, meeting to deny his request. Bulger filed a petition in the South Boston Division of the Boston Municipal Court, see G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 1, seeking judicial review of the board\u2019s determination pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (3) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">On September 22, 2003, following a hearing at which Bulger was represented by counsel, a hearing officer recommended that, in light of Bulger\u2019s convictions, the board rescind his retirement allowance and commence collection efforts to recover the $69,874.28 previously paid by the board to Bulger as the part of his retirement allowance that exceeded the contributions he had made to the retirement system. The board adopted the hearing officer\u2019s recommendations at its meeting on September 25, 2003. Bulger then filed another petition in the Boston Municipal Court seeking judicial review of the board\u2019s final determination. In accordance with G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, the board filed a motion for summary judgment, limited to the board\u2019s administrative action against Bulger pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-29\">On September 29, 2004, a judge in the Boston Municipal Court denied the board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, reversed the board\u2019s determination permanently to rescind Bulger\u2019s retirement allowance, and ordered the board to reinstate Bulger\u2019s pension, retroactive to April 11, 2003. The judge concluded that while Bulger\u2019s convictions of perjury and obstruction of justice were serious, they did not constitute \u201cviolation[s] of the laws applicable to his office or position,\u201d within the purview of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), where \u201cthey were unrelated to Bulger\u2019s position as a Clerk Magistrate and where the facts and circumstances that gave rise to the convictions did not involve the administration of his duties and responsibilities as an appointed government official.\u201d The board filed a complaint seeking review in the nature of certiorari, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County, asserting that the judge had misinterpreted G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), and that Bulger had violated the laws applicable to his position as clerk-magistrate. A single justice reserved and reported the matter to the full court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">General Laws c. 249, \u00a7 4, provides for limited judicial review in the nature of certiorari to correct errors of law in administrative proceedings where judicial review is otherwise unavailable. See <em>Sheriff of Plymouth County </em>v. <em>Plymouth County Personnel Bd., </em>440 Mass. 708, 710 (2004); <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>403 Mass. 604, 605 (1988). Certiorari allows a court to \u201ccorrect only a substantial error of law, evidenced by the record, which adversely affects a material right of the plaintiff. ... In its review, the court may rectify only those errors of law which have resulted in manifest injustice to the plaintiff or which have adversely affected the real interests of the general public\u201d (quotations and citations omitted). <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Auditor of the Commonwealth, </em>430 Mass. 783, 790 (2000), quoting <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Springfield, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The thrust of the board\u2019s argument is that Bulger must forfeit his pension, pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), because his convictions of perjury and obstruction of justice constituted \u201cviolation[s] of the laws applicable to his office,\u201d namely the Code of Professional Responsibility for Clerks of the Courts (the code), S.J.C. Rule 3:12, as amended, 427 Mass. 1322 (1998). The board points out that the position of clerk-magistrate is one of public trust and that Bulger, when he was appointed to that position, took an oath of office to uphold the Federal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>State Constitutions and the laws of this Commonwealth. The board argues that the crimes committed by Bulger did not constitute mere personal transgressions wholly unrelated to the office of clerk-magistrate but, rather, were crimes that undermined the very essence of a clerk-magistrate\u2019s responsibility to facilitate the administration of justice. Because, in the board\u2019s opinion, there was a direct link between Bulger\u2019s convictions and the laws applicable to his office, Bulger forfeited his entitlement to his retirement allowance under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Our analysis of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), is guided by the familiar principle that \u201ca statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001). Courts must ascertain the intent of a statute from all its parts and from the subject matter to which it relates, and must interpret the statute so as to render the legislation effective, consonant with sound reason and common sense. See <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>422 Mass. 249, 251 (1996); <em>Pentucket Manor Chronic Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>394 Mass. 233, 240 (1985); <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>311 Mass. 572, 577-578 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Subsection (4) of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15, was inserted by St. 1987, c. 697, \u00a7 47, and, pursuant to \u00a7 135, was made applicable only to criminal offenses committed on or after its effective date, January 12, 1988.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For purposes of statutory construction, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), is considered to be penal and, therefore, its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>language must be construed narrowly, not stretched to accomplish an unexpressed result. See <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>423 Mass. 1, 3 n.3 (1996); <em>Collatos </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., 396 </em>Mass. 684, 686-687 (1986). Contrast <em>MacLean </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Retirement, </em>432 Mass. 339, 351 &amp; n.15 (2000) (concluding that revocation of pension benefits under \u00a7 15 [4] not \u201ccriminal punishment\u201d for purposes of double jeopardy); <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Medford, </em>425 Mass. 130, 136-137 (1997) (concluding that use of term \u201cforfeit\u201d in \u00a7 15 [1] did not render statute \u201cso punitive as to overcome its restitutionary purpose\u201d). A member who becomes subject to the mandates of \u00a7 15 (4) forfeits entitlement to a retirement allowance, but the member \u201cshall receive, unless otherwise prohibited by law, a return of his accumulated total deductions; provided, however, that the rate of regular interest for the purpose of calculating accumulated total deductions shall be zero.\u201d G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The scope of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), was enunciated in <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 4-5, where we stated that \u201c[t]he substantive touchstone intended by the General Court is criminal activity connected with the office or position. . . . [T]he General Court did not intend pension forfeiture to follow as a sequelae of any and all criminal convictions. Only those violations related to the member\u2019s official capacity were targeted. Looking to the facts of each case for a direct link between the criminal offense and the member\u2019s office or position best effectuates the legislative intent of \u00a7 15 (4).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">With these general principles in mind, we consider what laws are applicable to the office or position of clerk-magistrate and, then, whether Bulger violated those laws. We begin with an overview of the office of clerk-magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The position of clerk-magistrate is one created and defined by statute. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 33, 35A, 58; G. L. c. 221, \u00a7\u00a7 62B, 62C. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the W. Roxbury Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>439 Mass. 352, 354 (2003). \u201cA clerk of a court is \u2018a public officer clothed with official functions of a highly important nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Massachusetts Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>351 Mass. 321, 325-326 (1966), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Boston, </em>254 Mass. 404, 406 (1926). After being sworn into office, see G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 12, a clerk \u201cshall have responsibility for the internal administration of his office, including personnel, staff services and record keeping.\u201d G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 8. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 57A. Pursuant to G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 33, a clerk may, among other duties, \u201creceive complaints, administer to complainants the oath required thereto, and issue warrants, search warrants and summonses.\u201d See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 59. A clerk also administers oaths to witnesses. See <em>Massachusetts Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Cronin, supra </em>at 326. Further, the authority of a clerk includes \u201cthe power to grant continuances; to hear and rule on uncontested nonevidentiary motions; to hold pretrial conferences; to mediate, hear and decide small claims; to hold preliminary hearings to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a probationer has violated the terms of his probation; to conduct show cause hearings on certain applications for criminal complaints; to pass on the appropriateness of applications for warrants; and to set bail in certain circumstances. See G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 62C; G. L. c. 218, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 22, 33, 35A; G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 57, 58.\u201d <em>First Justice of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t, </em>438 Mass. 387, 398 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u201c[T]he responsibilities of a clerk-magistrate, while largely ministerial, are inextricably related and essential to the effective functioning of the courts in this Commonwealth. \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the W. Roxbury Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 359. See <em>First Justice of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 398-399. The function of every court \u201cis to ensure the integrity of the judicial system, which must not only be beyond suspicion but must appear to be so. The duties of a clerk of a court are performed, for the most part, under public scrutiny. He is a conspicuous figure in the court room. He is seated prominently near the judge, where he is in frequent consultation with him as well as with various lawyers. He administers oaths to witnesses. . . . [I]t would be incongruous to hold out as clerk one who has not conformed to the standards essential to every court.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Cronin, supra </em>at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The high standards to which clerks are held are plainly enunciated in the code, which was adopted on February 9, 1990, as S.J.C. Rule 3:12, as amended, 427 Mass. 1322 (1998).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Opinion of the </em>Justices, 375 Mass. 795, 813 (1978) (Supreme Judicial Court has \u201cthe authority by rule to establish standards of conduct for judicial employees and officials\u201d). \u201cRules of court have the force of law . . . .\u201d <em>Empire Apartments, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>353 Mass. 333, 337 (1967). See <em>Berkwitz, petitioner, </em>323 Mass. 41, 47 (1948) (rules of court \u201chave the force of law and are just as binding on the court and the parties as would be a statute\u201d). \u201c[Rjules of court are designed primarily to accomplish the ends of justice, protect rights, serve the convenience of litigants and implement the substantive law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>395 Mass. 604, 606 (1985), quoting <em>Albermont Petroleum, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>186 Cal. App. 2d 84, 91 (1960). In accordance with these purposes, the code imposes on a clerk-magistrate a significant responsibility for upholding the integrity of the judicial system, for promoting public confidence in the administration of justice, for honoring the public trust placed in such office, for avoiding the appearance of any impropriety in his activities, and for fulfilling the mandates of the oath of office.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The \u201claws\u201d applicable to the office or position of clerk-magistrate include the code because it establishes the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>standards governing the norms of conduct and practice associated with such office. That said, the language of the code enunciating the high standards to which clerks are held is broad, whereas the language of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), is narrower, no doubt due to the severity of pension forfeiture as a sanction for dereliction of duty by a member. Accordingly, for our purposes, the general mandates of the code must be viewed in the context of the more specific language of \u00a7 15 (4). Here, the question becomes whether Bulger violated the laws applicable to his office or position when he was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in an arguably personal matter such that he was required to forfeit his retirement allowance pursuant to \u00a7 15 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The board asserts that, in order to make this determination, we should consider whether Bulger\u2019s criminal convictions, had they occurred when he still was employed as a clerk-magistrate, would have resulted in his removal from office.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that such an analysis is too broad, and it fails to recognize that the standards for a member\u2019s removal from office and for a member\u2019s forfeiture of a retirement allowance are different.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Statutory authority for removal of a clerk-magistrate is set forth in G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4. \u201cA majority of the Justices, upon a summary hearing or otherwise, may remove a clerk . . . upon a complaint \u2018if sufficient cause is shown therefor and it appears that the public good so requires.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matter of Dugan, </em>416 Mass. 461, 463 (1993), quoting G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4 (removal of clerk-magistrate for pervasive abuses of power in office). See <em>Massachusetts Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>351 Mass. 321, 324-326 (1966) (removing District Court clerk from office for committing perjury before grand jury in bribery matter unrelated to his duties as clerk). See also <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>331 Mass. 413, 414-415, 429-430 (1954) (removing district attorney from office for misconduct as trustee of charitable trust, unrelated to his official duties, where evidence disclosed \u201ca man lacking in the sound moral perceptions and in the steadfast moral character necessary for the exercise of the enormous powers of the office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>of district attorney . . . and for the creation and retention of public confidence in the administration of that great office\u201d); <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>239 Mass. 458, 498 (1921) (removing district attorney from office where \u201c[pjremeditated deception accompanied by the deliberate telling of lies\u201d demonstrated bad judgment, untrustworthiness, and \u201ca lamentable want of appreciation of moral values\u201d). Cf. G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 30 (convict holding office under Constitution or laws of Commonwealth at time of sentence to State prison or Federal penitentiary must vacate office).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">As enunciated by G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4, and by our case law, the standard for removing a clerk-magistrate from office, where required by the \u201cpublic good,\u201d is broad. In contrast, the standard for pension forfeiture based on dereliction of duty is more narrow and specific. A clerk-magistrate\u2019s pension is forfeited for misappropriation of governmental funds or property, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (1) and (3), after a final conviction of certain offenses set forth in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (3A), or after a final conviction of a criminal offense involving \u201cviolation of the laws applicable to his office or position,\u201d G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4). See <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>423 Mass. 1, 3 (1996). Depending on the misconduct at issue, there may be instances when removal of a clerk-magistrate from office is mandated by G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4, because it serves the public good, but pension benefits are not concomitantly terminated because the misconduct at issue does not fall within the purview of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15. For example, a member may be convicted of a criminal offense that does <em>not </em>involve any violation of the laws applicable to his office or position. In those circumstances, according to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), the member does not forfeit his entitlement to a retirement allowance. This is not one of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">At the heart of a clerk-magistrate\u2019s role is the unwavering obligation to tell the truth, to ensure that others do the same through the giving of oaths to complainants, and to promote the administration of justice. When Bulger committed the crimes of pequry and obstruction of justice, he violated the fundamental tenets of the code and of his oath of office, notwithstanding his contention that such misconduct occurred in the context of what was arguably a personal matter. We recognized in <em>Gaffney </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 3-4, that \u00a7 15 (4) was enacted in response to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Collatos </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>396 Mass. 684 (1986), and that the Legislature intended \u201cto avoid having the precise form of the criminal enforcement action make a difference with respect to the pension forfeiture issue.\u201d We concluded in the <em>Gaffney </em>case that \u00a7 15 (4) was not limited to violations of \u201chighly specialized crimes addressing official actions\u201d or even criminal conduct committed \u201cin the course of [official] duties,\u201d but encompassed \u201ccriminal activity connected with the office or position.\u201d <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 4. The nature of Bulger\u2019s particular crimes cannot be separated from the nature of his particular office when what is at stake is the integrity of our judicial system. We conclude that Bulger\u2019s convictions of perjury and obstruction of justice involved \u201cviolation[s] of the laws applicable to his office or position,\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (4), and mandated the forfeiture of his retirement allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">This case is to be remanded to the county court for entry of a judgment reversing the judgment of the Boston Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Since 1978, clerks of Juvenile Court \u201cshall hereafter also have the title of magistrate for their particular department, or division as the case may be, of the trial court.\u201d G.

All benefits cease on the member\u2019s death, except as otherwise provided by the option elected. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12 (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Bulger\u2019s petition for judicial review of the board\u2019s final determination raised both statutory and constitutional claims. Because the judge below reversed the board\u2019s decision permanently to rescind Bulger\u2019s retirement allowance and ordered reinstatement of his pension, the judge did not reach Bulger\u2019s claim that the forfeiture of his pension benefits constituted an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Citing <em>MacLean </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Retirement, </em>432 Mass. 339, 348 n.11 (2000), Bulger contends that proper consideration of his constitutional claim would require factual findings by the judge as to the total value of the pension forfeiture involved. He further asserts that questions of law are not considered de nova on certiorari review. See <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Auditor of the Commonwealth, </em>430 Mass. 783, 791 (2000). Bulger\u2019s constitutional claim has not been briefed by the parties and is not presently before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The board has never suggested that Bulger misappropriated funds or property from any government unit in which he was employed prior to his retirement. Therefore, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (1) and (3), are not implicated in this matter. Similarly, because the criminal proceedings against Bulger arose under Federal law, the provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (3A), setting forth the pension consequences of convictions of certain violations of Massachusetts law, namely G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 2 (corruption to influence official acts), and G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 25 (extortion in relation to police or licensing duties), are not applicable. See <em>Collatos </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>396 Mass. 684, 687-688 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Canon 1 of S.J.C.
