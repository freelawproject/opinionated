Christian Haufler and Thomas and Nancy Zotos (collectively, Zotos),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who own land adjacent to each other along the North River in Marshfield (town). At issue is whether an escrow agreement between Haufler and Zotos concerning transfer of title of a triangular portion of Haufler\u2019s land to Zotos is enforceable, and whether delivery of the deed effectively conveyed title to Zotos. Haufler claims that ownership of the triangular parcel is essential to his plans to construct a new house on his property under the town\u2019s applicable zoning bylaws,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the terms of the escrow agreement, executed by Zotos some fifteen months after Haufler had signed it, did not reflect their agreement. Also at issue is whether Zotos violated the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (act), G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H-11I,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by interfering through \u201cthreats, intimidation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>coercion\u201d with Haufler\u2019s right to use and enjoy his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">After a trial before a judge in the Superior Court, the judge ruled that the escrow agreement was enforceable, delivery of the deed was effective to convey title, and Zotos did not violate the act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We affirm the judge\u2019s order with respect to the escrow agreement and validity of the deed. We vacate his order with respect to the civil rights claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">1. <em>Procedural background. </em>In October, 1999, Haufler commenced an action in the Land Court against Zotos challenging the validity of a deed transferring title of a triangular portion of land he owned in Marshfield to Zotos. Haufler also claimed that Zotos interfered with his constitutional right to use and enjoy his property by threatening to \u201coppose construction on any portion\u201d of his land, and by recording the deed to the triangular parcel \u201cin order to defeat [Haufler\u2019s] ability to construct the proposed residences,\u201d in violation of the act. Haufler subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Zotos\u2019s \u201ccontinuing trespasses\u201d on his property, which was allowed by a judge in the Land Court in November, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">On Zotos\u2019s motion, the case was transferred to the Superior Court in October, 2000, pursuant to G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9. Some two years later, in September, 2002, Haufler filed a complaint for contempt, alleging that Thomas Zotos had violated the preliminary injunction entered in the Land Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In January, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>2003, a judge in the Superior Court held a two-day trial on the contempt complaint, vacated the preliminary injunction issued by the Land Court, and issued a new preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In March, 2003, the same judge held a bench trial on Haufler\u2019s remaining claims. In a comprehensive memorandum and order, the judge concluded that the escrow agreement was enforceable against Haufler and that the deed to the triangular parcel had been properly recorded by Zotos; he entered a declaratory judgment to that effect, stating that Haufler \u201cdoes not own or have any legal right, title or interest in the triangular parcel.\u201d The judge further concluded that Haufler\u2019s claim under the act failed because the collective conduct of the defendants did not constitute \u201cthreats, intimidation or coercion\u201d within the meaning of the act. Haufler appealed,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and we granted his application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">2. <em>Factual background. </em>We summarize the facts as found by the judge, supplemented by undisputed facts from the record. In May, 1995, Haufler purchased a 6.7-acre L-shaped parcel of land on Littles Lane in Marshfield (Lot C) from Ralph and Kathleen Campanelli (collectively Campanelli), and in September, 1995, Campanelli transferred to Haufler a building permit they had previously obtained for the lot. Lot C is heavily wooded and is bordered on the north by the North River and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>conservation land administered by the National Audubon Society. At the time of Haufler\u2019s purchase, no house had been built on Lot C, but there were two buildings on the lot, a \u201ccottage\u201d and a \u201cgarage.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The cottage is situated on a small triangular parcel that extends from the eastern border of Lot C into the adjacent lot, Lot D. The judge found that Haufler planned to obtain a new residential building permit for Lot C on the theory that the cottage located on the triangular parcel constituted a preexisting residential structure that would entitle him to such a permit. Haufler planned to obtain the permit, pour his foundation, and then demolish the cottage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Once this was accomplished, Haufler was prepared to convey the triangular parcel to the owner of Lot D.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">At some point Haufler, Campanelli, and the then-owner of Lot D, Aldro French, entered into an agreement (Campanelli agreement) concerning the triangular portion of Lot C.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Haufler (identified as \u201cthe buyer\u201d) agreed that \u201cupon obtaining a building permit to build which shall be applied for immediately,\u201d he would \u201cremove the existing cottage and shed within seventy-five (75) days of purchase\u201d and would convey to French \u201cthe triangular piece of property on which the [cottage] and [shed] presently exist.\u201d The stated purpose of the Campanelli agreement was \u201cto continue the easterly sideline of the premises to be sold [by French] in a straight line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Thereafter, on January 29, 1996, French executed a purchase and sale agreement with Zotos for the purchase of Lot D-l.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The premises described in the French-Zotos purchase and sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>agreement included the \u201ctriangular shaped parcel of land,\u201d although at the time Haufler had not conveyed title of that parcel to French as contemplated by the Campanelli agreement. Zotos retained an attorney, Steven Graham, to represent them at the closing, which was set for May 15, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">As the closing date approached, Haufler still had not conveyed the triangular parcel to French. Because Zotos did not wish to rescind the purchase and sale agreement with French, they authorized Graham, as the judge found, \u201cto make appropriate binding agreements on their behalf to obtain title to the triangle consistently with their purchase and sale agreement.\u201d Graham thereupon obtained for Zotos an assignment of French\u2019s rights under the Campanelli agreement. In anticipation of the French-Zotos closing, in early May, 1996, Graham telephoned Haufler to negotiate an agreement to the effect that Haufler would execute the deed to the triangular parcel, and Graham would hold the deed in escrow for Zotos. He then sent a letter to Haufler \u201cto confirm the agreement\u201d reached during the telephone conversation. The letter stated that Graham required from Haufler (in time for the closing still scheduled for May 15, 1996) a plan of the triangular parcel suitable for recording; a deed to the parcel; and a mortgage on the lot to be recorded at the time of closing \u201cfor the full performance of all undertakings in the agreement listed below.\u201d The letter further stated that Graham would prepare and send to Haufler for his signature: (1) an \u201cagreement to convey the [triangular] property upon the start of construction on [Haufler\u2019s] property and to move the [cottage] currently located on the property to my client\u2019s property\u201d; and (2) an agreement \u201cto [ejscrow the amount of $5,000 to cover the expenses of moving the [cottage<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] onto my Ghent\u2019s property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Graham then prepared and sent to Haufler an escrow agreement dated May 14, 1996, to be executed by Haufler and Zotos, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>which, the judge found, Graham drafted to accommodate the interests of both parties \u201cconsistently with his discussions\u201d with Haufler.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The escrow agreement began with a series of recitals concerning the rights of Zotos to the triangular parcel under the purchase and sale agreement with French, and Haufler\u2019s need for the triangular parcel to accomplish his building permit objectives. The agreement then provided that Haufler would execute a deed to Zotos for the triangular parcel to be held in escrow by Graham and not recorded \u201cuntil the occurrence of the events described in paragraphs 2 or 3, whichever occurs the earliest.\u201d Paragraph 2, in turn, stated that Zotos would record the deed on \u201cthe commencement of construction on the dwelling\u201d on Haufler\u2019s land.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Paragraph 3 stated that Zotos \u201cshall be entitled to record the deed . . . on or after August 30, 1996, notwithstanding the failure of Haufler to commence construction prior to that time.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Haufler signed the agreement, which had not yet been signed by Zotos, and had his signature notarized on May 14, 1996. The following day he sent the signed escrow agreement to Graham together with $5,000, the mortgage, and two signed and notarized deeds<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> for the triangular parcel of Lot C.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The closing occurred, Zotos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>obtained title to Lot D-l, but as we describe below, Zotos did not sign the escrow agreement until some fifteen months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Haufier encountered unanticipated delays because of his plans to subdivide Lot C, which in turn stalled commencement of any construction on his land. According to the town\u2019s zoning code enforcement officer, by subdividing Lot C into Lots \u201cC-l\u201d and \u201cC-2,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Lot C-l was essentially rendered \u201cnonconforming\u201d because it did not have sufficient frontage on Littles Lane. For this reason, on July 10, 1996, the town rescinded the original (Campanelli) building permit for Lot C.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">By August 30, 1996, the date provided in the escrow agreement, Haufier had not obtained a new building permit, much less started construction of his house. The date passed without Zotos pressing the matter, and Haufier continued to pursue his plans to subdivide Lot C and to build a house on each subdivided lot. In April, 1997, while his appeal from the town\u2019s rescission of the original building permit for Lot C was pending, see note 21, <em>supra, </em>Haufier applied for new building permits for Lots C-l and C-2, respectively. He also installed a well and had septic plans drawn up for each parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">It was during this period that Zotos began actively to oppose Haufier\u2019s building plans. Zotos came to believe that the original issuance of a building permit for Lot C had not been legal because the cottage on the triangular parcel had not been occupied and was therefore not a preexisting residential structure. Zotos\u2019s opposition to Haufier\u2019s plans for building two new houses on his property increased when the town indicated that this might require paving Littles Lane. During the spring or summer of 1997, Haufier\u2019s building permit applications for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Lots C-l and C-2 were denied, and Haufler appealed to the town\u2019s zoning board of appeals (board). As an abutter, Zotos was notified of the public hearing on Haufler\u2019s applications, scheduled for September, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In August, 1997, nearly one year after August 30, 1996, the date contained in the escrow agreement, Zotos signed the escrow agreement, and Graham, after some hesitation, gave Zotos the deed to the triangular portion of Lot C. Unbeknownst to Haufler the deed was recorded by Zotos on August 18, 1997. The following month at a hearing before the board on Haufler\u2019s building permit applications for Lots C-l and C-2, Nancy Zotos informed the board that Haufler no longer owned the triangular parcel. Because he then had no basis for obtaining his building permits, Haufler withdrew his applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">3. <em>Enforceability of the escrow agreement. </em>The judge concluded that the delivery by Haufler to Graham of the signed escrow agreement, two deeds to the triangular parcel, the mortgage, and the sum of $5,000 \u201camounted to acceptance\u201d by Haufler of Zotos\u2019s \u201coffer as expressed in the written contract.\u201d Accordingly, he ruled that the escrow agreement was enforceable against Haufler, and the deed conveyed title to Zotos.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">On appeal, Haufler disputes the enforceability of the escrow agreement for three reasons. First, Haufler contends that express authority was required for Graham to bind Zotos in contract, see <em>See </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>234 Mass. 345, 348-349 (1920), and that Graham was not so authorized.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Everett, </em>354 Mass. 461, 464 (1968). The argument fails. Author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ity is \u201cthe power of the agent to affect the legal relations of the principal by acts done in accordance with the principal\u2019s manifestations of consent to him.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 7 (1958). See Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 2.01 (Tent. Draft No. 2) (\u201cAn agent acts with actual authority when, at the time of taking action that has legal consequences for the principal, the agent reasonably believes, in accordance with the principal\u2019s manifestations to the agent, that the principal wishes the agent so to act\u201d). See also <em>Theos &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Mack Trucks, Inc., </em>431 Mass. 736, 743-744 &amp; n.13 (2000) (discussing express and implied authority). There is ample evidence in the record to support the judge\u2019s finding that Zotos gave Graham the authority to \u201cmake appropriate binding agreements on their behalf to obtain title to the triangle.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See Restatement (Second) of Agency, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 12 comment a, at 57 (exercise of agent\u2019s power to alter legal relations between principal and third persons \u201cmay result in binding the principal to a third person in contract\u201d). Certainly his finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Next, Haufler argues that the escrow agreement was not enforceable because Zotos did not manifest his acceptance of the agreement by signing it within a reasonable time.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> A written contract, signed by only one party, may be binding and enforceable even without the other party\u2019s signature if the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>party manifests acceptance. See <em>Putnam Mach. Co. </em>v. <em>Mustakangas, </em>236 Mass. 376, 378 (1920) (although only defendant signed contract, plaintiff could still recover for breach where plaintiff \u201cassented to and accepted\u201d contract). See also 2 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 6:43, at 467-469 (4th ed. 1991) (\u201cany written contract, though signed by only one party, will bind the other if he accepts the writing\u201d). Cf. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>182 Mass. 460, 462-463 (1903) (defendant city bound by terms of deed where there was evidence of acceptance of deed by city, although city commissioners who drew up and signed deed were not agents of city). The escrow agreement by its terms did not require Zotos\u2019s signature to be effective. Moreover, Graham assented to the escrow agreement on behalf of Zotos by holding the deeds, mortgage, and sum of $5,000 in escrow until the deadline specified in the escrow agreement had passed. See <em>Kaarela </em>v. <em>Birkhead, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 412-413 (1992) (in absence of formal escrow agreement, letters between attorneys established terms of escrow agreement, and escrow agent\u2019s deposit of funds constituted acceptance of terms recited in correspondence). By not recording the deed until one year after August 30, 1996, Zotos performed within the terms of the agreement. The judge was correct to conclude that the \u201cabsence of signatures by [Thomas and Nancy Zotos] did not prevent the formation of the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Finally, Haufler claims that his execution of the escrow agreement was an offer, not an acceptance. Haufler points to his trial testimony concerning a conversation he had with Graham after he had sent Graham the executed escrow agreement to the effect that they agreed the deed would not be recorded until Haufler had poured the foundation for a new house. This, he claims, amounted to a withdrawal of his original offer (the executed escrow agreement), which could no longer be accepted by Graham on behalf of Zotos.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This argument is also unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">An offer is a \u201cmanifestation of willingness to enter into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>bargain,\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 24 (1981), and is often a \u201cconditional promise dependent for its enforceability on the offeree giving in exchange the offeror\u2019s requested act,\u201d 1 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 4:4, at 266 (4th ed. 1991). On behalf of Zotos, Graham initiated discussions with Haufler and proposed the terms of an escrow agreement. As consideration, Zotos offered more time for Haufler to obtain a building permit in exchange for his executing a deed and placing it in escrow.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The delivery of the signed escrow agreement, together with two signed and notarized deeds, a mortgage on his property, and the sum of $5,000 to Graham belies any argument that Haufler was making an offer rather than accepting an offer. The judge correctly concluded that Haufler\u2019s performance of the conditions that conformed to the terms of the written escrow agreement \u201cwas convincing evidence\u201d of Haufler\u2019s acceptance of the agreement as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Haufler has maintained throughout the litigation that the escrow agreement he signed was but a draft, the terms of which had not been fully determined. See <em>Rosenfield </em>v. <em>United States Trust Co., </em>290 Mass. 210, 216 (1935) (failure to agree on material terms may be evidence that parties do not intend to be presently bound). He and Graham \u201cnever\u201d discussed \u201cany time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>requirements,\u201d he said, and the August 30, 1996, date contained in the escrow agreement was not a negotiated term: it would have been \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to start construction on his house by August 30, 1996, he argues, because of the building permit appeals process.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Haufler also testified, however, that he did not \u201creally\u201d read all of the provisions of the escrow agreement, but \u201cscannjed] the agreement\u201d before signing it and sending it back to Graham. Haufler may well have overlooked the August 30, 1996, date, but that provides him with no legal comfort. \u201cThe general rule is, that, in the absence of fraud, one who signs a written agreement is bound by its terms whether he reads and understands it or not.\u201d <em>Wilkisius </em>v. <em>Sheehan, </em>258 Mass. 240, 243 (1927). The inclusion of the August 30, 1996, date in the escrow agreement may have differed from Graham\u2019s May 9 letter to Haufler. But as the judge noted, Haufler is \u201can attorney of considerable experience and skill.\u201d Had he intended to reject the term providing for an August 30, 1996, cutoff date, \u201che would not have signed the written contract without making a written modification on the contract itself.\u201d The judge was correct to conclude that the escrow agreement was binding and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Our conclusion to this effect disposes of Haufler\u2019s claims that, if the escrow agreement is not enforceable, delivery of the deed to Zotos was ineffective to convey title. We now turn to Haufler\u2019s civil rights claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">4. <em>Civil rights claim. </em>We first describe the facts that form the basis of Haufler\u2019s claim under the act. At varying times after they recorded the deed, Zotos, as the judge found, engaged in a \u201clong train of complaints and objections\u201d about Haufler and other neighbors, including letters to local, State, and Federal officials, some of which, in the judge\u2019s words, \u201craised legitimate issues under applicable zoning laws\u201d and \u201c[mjany\u201d of which were \u201cfrivolous or of little merit.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Several of Zotos\u2019s letters were general complaints about land use and development on Littles Lane and did not target Haufler in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>In addition, the judge found that Thomas Zotos \u201cengaged in abusive conduct\u201d toward Haufler while Haufler was on his own property. The judge also found that Thomas Zotos \u201cintentionally followed and harassed\u201d a neighbor more than once while the neighbor was waiting with his young children on Haufler\u2019s property. On one occasion Thomas Zotos pulled next to the neighbor in his car in what the neighbor described as \u201ca threatening manner.\u201d On another, when Haufler arrived at his property, a sawhorse was blocking the dirt road on his land.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The driver of his automobile moved the sawhorse, whereupon Thomas Zotos \u201ccame running up the hill at the car and yelling\u201d in what Haufler described as a \u201cvery aggressive\u201d manner. When Haufler noted that he owned the property, Thomas Zotos responded that he did not care and that he was going to contact the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The judge also found that Thomas Zotos harassed individuals hired by Haufler to work on his land. In two separate incidents, Thomas Zotos \u201cverbally insulted and harassed\u201d a worker and later telephoned a police officer, falsely accusing the worker of trespassing on Haufler\u2019s land.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The judge also found that Thomas Zotos \u201cverbally harassed and abused\u201d a surveyor hired by Haufler to plot boundary lines and locate the stumps of cut trees. Thomas Zotos\u2019s abusive behavior continued even when the surveyor returned with a uniformed town police officer. At that point, Thomas Zotos called the surveyor and the officer \u201cperverts,\u201d jumped up and down, wrongfully claimed they were on Zotos\u2019s property, and ordered them off the property shouting epithets and profanities.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Haufler hired a real estate appraiser to document Zotos\u2019s encroachments on Haufler\u2019s property. As the appraiser approached Haufler\u2019s property, Thomas Zotos ran toward him with a rake, holding it \u201clike present arms style ... up in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>air.\u201d The appraiser described Thomas Zotos as \u201cvery belligerent, very aggressive.\u201d The appraiser returned later with a town police officer. Thomas Zotos confronted the appraiser and the police officer and was, in the appraiser\u2019s words, \u201cextremely aggravated, very insulting, and . . . talking at the top of his voice.\u201d All of these incidents resulted in the workers Haufler had hired leaving the property without completing the work they had been hired to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The judge further found that Thomas Zotos trespassed on Haufler\u2019s land when he removed lot line markers placed by the surveyor hired by Haufler. Thomas Zotos also placed \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs and birdhouses on trees on or near Haufler\u2019s property line. The judge found the birdhouses contained electronic equipment that \u201cmay have been surveillance or video equipment.\u201d He also found that Thomas Zotos had placed \u201c[njails and boards with nails in them\u201d on the dirt road on Haufler\u2019s land.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Finally, the judge found that Zotos \u201cunlawfully cut trees on [Haufler\u2019s] property near their common boundary in the area approaching the river front.\u201d Haufler claims, contrary to the judge\u2019s ruling, that all of this behavior, in addition to Zotos\u2019s recording of the deed, violated his civil rights under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">First, he argues that the judge \u201cincorrectly interpreted the act by focusing his analysis on the conduct of the defendant that was directed solely at [Haufler].\u201d The judge should, he says, have considered not only Zotos\u2019s actions directed at Haufler, but also Zotos\u2019s behavior toward third parties. Contrary to Haufler\u2019s claim, it is not at all clear that the judge concluded otherwise.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Threatening, intimidating, or coercive actions directed at third parties should be included in considering any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>conduct that forms the basis of a claim under the civil rights act. Cf. <em>Redgrave </em>v. <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc., </em>399 Mass. 93, 100 (1987) (no exemption for civil rights deprivations resulting from third-party pressure under the act); <em>Sarvis </em>v. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 86, 92 (1999) (in context of coercion, actual or potential physical confrontation \u201cmay involve third persons\u201d and \u201cthreat of harm need not be directed at the plaintiff\u201d). See also <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Mazza, </em>394 Mass. 176, 180 (1985) (threat to plaintiffs\u2019 contractor considered part of allegations supporting civil rights claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">To evaluate Haufler\u2019s claim we therefore consider Zotos\u2019s entire conduct, separating it for ease of reference into three categories: (1) the recording of the deed to the triangular parcel allegedly in order to prevent Haufler from constructing a house on his property; (2) Zotos\u2019s repeated complaints to local, State, and Federal officials about Haufler\u2019s use of his land; and (3) Zotos\u2019s repeated trespasses on Haufler\u2019s land and harassment of Haufler, his neighbors, and workers whom Haufler hired to work on his property. We conclude that the recording of the deed and Zotos\u2019s complaints to various officials did not violate the act, but that the aggregate conduct described in the third category did.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">To establish a claim under the act, Haufler \u201cmust prove that (1) his exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of either the United States or of the Commonwealth, (2) has been interfered with, or attempted to be interfered with, and (3) that the interference or attempted interference was by \u2018threats, intimidation or coercion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., </em>403 Mass. 713, <em>717 </em>(1989). Haufler easily establishes the first prong: the right to use and enjoy one\u2019s own property is constitutionally secured. See <em>Brett </em>v. <em>Building Comm\u2019r of Brookline, </em>250 Mass. 73, 77 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">As to the second and third prongs, the Legislature enacted the civil rights act to provide \u201cenhanced protection of civil rights\u201d under State law at a time when \u201c[deprivations of secured rights by private individuals using violence or threats of violence were prevalent . . . .\u201d <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., </em>393 Mass. 819, 821 (1985). We have recognized that the act was not intended to create a \u201cvast constitutional tort,\u201d <em>Bell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>v. <em>Mazza, supra </em>at 182, and that the remedies under the act were \u201cexplicitly limited\u201d to those situations \u201cwhere the derogation of secured rights occurs by threats, intimidation or coercion.\u201d <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., supra </em>at 718, citing <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Mazza, supra </em>at 182-183. Nonetheless, the act is \u201centitled to liberal construction of its terms.\u201d <em>Buster </em>v. <em>George W. Moore, Inc., </em>438 Mass. 635, 645 (2003), quoting <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., supra </em>at 822. See <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., supra, </em>quoting 2A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 54.04, at 570 (4th ed. 1984) (\u201ccases within the reason, though not within the letter, of a statute shall be embraced by its provisions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We use a reasonable person standard to determine whether Zotos\u2019s conduct constituted threats, intimidation, or coercion under the act. See <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Blake, 417 </em>Mass. 467, 474-475, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 868 (1994) . In the context of the act, a \u201cthreat\u201d consists of \u201cthe intentional exertion of pressure to make another fearful or apprehensive of injury or harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474. \u201cIntimidation\u201d involves \u201cputting in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCoercion\u201d is \u201cthe application to another of such force, either physical or moral, as to constrain him to do against his will something he would not otherwise have done.\u201d <em>Buster </em>v. <em>George W. Moore, Inc., supra </em>at 646, quoting <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass,, Inc. </em>v. <em>Blake, supra. </em>See also <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of W. Boylston, </em>419 Mass. 548, 565 (1995) , quoting Webster\u2019s New Third Int\u2019l Dictionary 439 (1981) (defining \u201c[cjoercion\u201d under the act as \u201cthe use of physical or moral force to compel [another] to act or assent\u201d). We clarified recently that the scope of coercion under the act is not limited to actual or attempted physical force. See <em>Buster </em>v. <em>George W. Moore, Inc., supra </em>at 646-648 (emphasizing \u201cmoral\u201d force as a possible form of coercion, and holding that economic coercion standing alone, in certain circumstances, may be actionable under the act).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Applying those principles here, the thrust of Haufler\u2019s claim with respect to the deed is that Zotos\u2019s recording of the deed was calculated to impede Haufler\u2019s plans for constructing a house on his property. This is an allegation of a deprivation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>rights that is not coercive \u201cbecause it is not an attempt to force someone to do something that person is not lawfully required to do.\u201d <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of W. Boylston, supra. </em>See <em>Swanset Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>423 Mass. 390, 396 (1996) (\u201cTo the extent that the plaintiffs allege that various delays were a deliberate attempt to frustrate their development plans, they have alleged a direct deprivation of rights rather than an attempt at coercion\u201d). Zotos did not deprive Haufler of his right to build a house on his property; he was lawfully entitled to record the deed. Cf. <em>Buster </em>v. <em>George W. Moore, Inc., supra </em>at 648 (no economic coercion where defendants \u201clawfully entitled to foreclose\u201d on plaintiffs\u2019 property). The town\u2019s zoning bylaws may prevent Haufler\u2019s development of his land; Zotos has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">As to Zotos\u2019s \u201clong train of complaints and objections\u201d to various officials, the judge was correct to conclude that these did not represent threats, intimidation, or coercion within the meaning of the act. Words reasonably understood to express an intention to use lawful means to block development \u201cwould not be a threat, intimidation, or coercion actionable under \u00a7 11I.\u201d <em>Pheasant Ridge Assocs. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>399 Mass. 771, 782 (1987). See <em>Sena </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>417 Mass. 250, 263 (1994) (\u201ca threat to use lawful means to reach an intended result is not actionable under \u00a7 111\u201d); <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Mazza, supra </em>at 183 (\u201callegations which merely indicate that a defendant petitioned for the redress of grievances, absent extraordinary circumstances, are not sufficient to state a claim under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I\u201d). The judge\u2019s finding that only some of Zotos\u2019s letters \u201craised legitimate issues under applicable zoning laws\u201d and that \u201c[mjany\u201d of them were \u201cfrivolous or of little merit\u201d is tempered by the fact that most of the letters concerned general complaints about land use and development on Littles Lane and did not target Haufler in particular.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Zotos\u2019s other conduct stands on different footing. A reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>able person could have felt threatened or intimidated by some of the conduct of Thomas Zotos. Several of Haufler\u2019s workers and Haufler\u2019s neighbor testified that the defendant\u2019s behavior was \u201cthreatening\u201d or that they felt \u201cthreatened\u201d by him. Haufler and another worker described Zotos\u2019s behavior as \u201cvery aggressive.\u201d Thomas Zotos ran at one worker with a rake in hand, and threatened to telephone the police when the saw horse was moved from the dirt road so Haufler could drive across his own property. Even the presence of a police officer did not deter Thomas Zotos, who showed no intention of retreating from any confrontation and, on two separate occasions, forced a worker accompanied by a police officer off Haufler\u2019s property, shouting epithets. Zotos also telephoned the police to have an authorized worker removed for trespassing.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The conduct here is similar, if not more egregious, than the conduct at issue in <em>Bell v. Mazza, </em>394 Mass. 176, 183-184 (1985), where we held that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were sufficient to withstand the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and <em>Ayasli </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 740, 753 (2002), where the Appeals Court held that the defendants\u2019 conduct violated the act. In <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Mazza, supra </em>at 179-180, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants, in opposition to the plaintiffs\u2019 plans to construct a tennis court on their property, threatened to do anything at any cost to prevent the construction of the tennis court, formed an association of neighbors to that end, threatened to sue the plaintiffs\u2019 contractor, attempted to induce the electric company to discontinue electric service to the plaintiffs, physically blocked a plaintiff\u2019s passage onto the land, responded to her greeting with epithets, and contacted the police and fire departments several times concerning the construction on the plaintiffs\u2019 property. In <em>Ayasli </em>v. <em>Armstrong, supra </em>at 743-746, in addition to opposing the plaintiffs\u2019 development plans before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>town boards, the defendants told the contractor working on the plaintiffs\u2019 house that they had a video camera and would be keeping track of the project, went onto the plaintiffs\u2019 property to take photographs, and had gates erected across the plaintiffs\u2019 deeded right of way over the defendants\u2019 land, forcing the plaintiffs to use an impassable route to access their property. In that case, the defendants\u2019 conduct \u201cconstitut[ed] persistent efforts to disturb the plaintiffs\u2019 enjoyment of their land, to impede access, limit use, and generally make [the plaintiffs] so uncomfortable . . . that they would abandon their plans for the house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 753. The same can be said of Zotos\u2019s conduct here.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The conduct on which we focus occurred after the recording of the deed, which was the key factor in thwarting Haufler\u2019s development plans. But the conduct did interfere with Haufler\u2019s right to use and enjoy his property. Haufler testified that he did not \u201cdrive down there much,\u201d had \u201cavoided\u201d going to his property in the latter part of 2002, and was \u201cafraid\u201d to go to his property. Zotos\u2019s abusive conduct also interfered with Haufler\u2019s ability to have workers (a surveyor, for example) come to his property. Zotos\u2019s conduct was persistent and antagonistic. Cf. <em>Rattigan </em>v. <em>Wile, </em>445 Mass. 850, 852-853, 856-861 (2006) (in residential property dispute, unpleasant odors, sounds, and visual conditions on defendant\u2019s property were substantial and unreasonable interference with neighboring plaintiff\u2019s use and enjoyment of property and therefore constituted nuisance). Their behavior escalated beyond a property dispute into threatening belligerence and unprovoked hostility. On balance, and in light of our earlier discussion, we conclude that Zotos did violate the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We now turn to the question of remedy. In his complaint and on appeal, Haufler sought damages for the violation of his civil rights. Under the act, Haufler is entitled to injunctive relief and compensatory damages. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>A comprehensive permanent injunction addressed to the conduct that constitutes violations of the act has already issued.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We therefore remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>the case to the Superior Court for a determination of the appropriate amount of compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Haufler initially filed suit against Thomas Zotos. His subsequent motion for compulsory joinder of a necessary party to add Nancy Zotos as a defendant was allowed.

Where necessary to the factual discussion, we refer to them by their individual names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b508-6\"><em>A </em>copy of the town\u2019s zoning bylaws is not included in the record.

On a contempt claim, the judge found for Haufler and entered a permanent injunction against Zotos, enjoining them from \u201cgoing upon or depositing anything upon\u201d Haufler\u2019s land and from \u201charassing, following, or in any way interfering with any person who is on\u201d Haufler\u2019s land.

References at trial to the \u201cshed,\u201d taken in context, appear to be references to the structure marked \u201ccottage\u201d on the plan. During his testimony Haufler clarified that his references to \u201cshed\u201d were to the structure on the plan labeled \u201ccottage,\u201d and that the plan\u2019s \u201cshed\u201d is a \u201csmall, little com bin.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Haufler had plans to subdivide Lot C into two parcels, build a house on each, and sell one to cover the cost of building his own house.

The escrow agreement further required Haufler to place $5,000 in escrow to ensure conveyance of the triangular parcel in accordance with the agreement, and permitted the use of the $5,000 to cover the cost of tearing down the cottage if necessary, and to cover up to $2,000 of the cost of moving the cottage if Zotos elected to move it rather than tear it down.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\">One deed \u201cwas just metes and bounds,\u201d and one \u201creferenced a plan to be recorded at the same time.\u201d Haufler testified that he did not send Graham a copy of the plan of the triangular parcel, which the deed referenced and which Graham had requested, because he claimed Graham had agreed that Haufler would complete the plan once he had poured the foundation for his house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Haufler testified that he sent the documents to Graham by facsimile and by courier.

On appeal, Haufler argues for the first time that Graham did not have either actual or apparent authority. There is no basis for a finding of apparent authority in this case, and the judge made no such ruling. Apparent authority involves \u201cwritten or spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes a third person to believe that the principal consents to have the act done on his behalf by the person purporting to act for him.\u201d <em>Neilson </em>v. <em>Malcolm Kenneth Co., </em>303 Mass. 437, 441 (1939).

Throughout the negotiation and execution of the escrow agreement, Haufler spoke only to Graham.

Moreover, Haufler\u2019s and Graham\u2019s testimony amply support his conclusion.

Contrary to Haufler\u2019s claim, Graham did not testify that a contract would be formed \u201conly\u201d when Zotos accepted the document by executing it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b517-7\">In the Superior Court Haufler argued that his notation on the facsimile cover sheet delivered with the escrow agreement and deeds, see note 19, <em>supra, </em>substantially varied the terms of the escrow agreement and, therefore, was not a binding acceptance but rather a counteroffer. See <em>Massachusetts Hous. Fin. Agency </em>v. <em>Whitney House Assocs., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 238, 241 (1994). See also <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Old Colony Trust Co., </em>246 Mass. 139, 148 (1923) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>(\u201ca conditional acceptance or one that varies from the offer in any substantial respect is in effect a rejection and is the equivalent of a new proposition\u201d). The judge rejected this claim, concluding that Haufler\u2019s notation on the facsimile cover sheet amounted to no more than a \u201chedged acceptance.\u201d See <em>Massachusetts Hous. Fin. Agency </em>v. <em>Whitney House Assocs., supra </em>(\u201cA comment, purported clarification, or expression of dissatisfaction appended to an endorsement of acceptance . . . [is] in the category of \u2018grumbling acceptances,\u2019 acceptances made without enthusiasm but acceptable nonetheless\u201d). The argument is not pursued on appeal and is waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\">There is no question, nor could there be, of consideration for the escrow agreement. When Zotos purchased Lot D-l from French, they acquired the right to enforce the Campanelli agreement as assignees, see Part 2, <em>supra. </em>It appears that Haufler might have been in breach of the Campanelli agreement, but the agreement is ambiguous. It gave Haufler seventy-five days after purchase of Lot C to convey the triangular parcel to French, but its language also implies that Haufler would convey the triangular parcel to French on obtaining a building permit, see note 12, <em>supra. </em>In any event, Zotos was willing to accommodate Haufler\u2019s need for the triangular parcel, see note 22, <em>supra, </em>rather than sue for specific performance. See <em>Currier </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>14 Gray 511, 513 (1860) (assignee of written contract to convey land entitled to maintain action for specific performance).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Nancy Zotos addressed complaints to the town\u2019s zoning board of appeals, the town\u2019s planning board, the town\u2019s board of health, the town\u2019s historical society, the town itself, the North River Commission, the State Department of Environmental Protection, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The judge found that Thomas Zotos left the sawhorse blocking the dirt road on Haufler\u2019s land.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The worker testified that he \u201cfelt that [Thomas Zotos] was trying to intimidate me into perhaps a physical altercation with him. ...
