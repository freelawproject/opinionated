Pardo, a radiation oncologist, appeals from a jury verdict in favor of the defendants, The General Hospital Corporation and Partners Healthcare System, Inc. (collectively the hospital), his former employer, on claims that he was discriminated against on the basis of his sexual orientation and that the hospital retaliated against him when he complained about the discrimination. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1), (4), and (4A). At issue is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>judge<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> erred in (1) denying the plaintiff discovery of certain documents the hospital claimed were privileged under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 204, the medical peer review privilege<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; (2) admitting in evidence certain documents that the plaintiff contends were inadmissible because they contained hearsay statements, and permitting testimony concerning them; and (3) instructing the jury on his retaliation claim. We transferred the case here on our own motion. For the reasons we discuss below, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts as the jury could have found them, see <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Silverstein, </em>320 Mass. 524, 525 (1946), identifying conflicting evidence where relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">Briefly stated, the plaintiff alleged that his career was derailed after he revealed his homosexuality to Dr. Herman D. Suit, at all relevant times chief of the hospital\u2019s department of radiation oncology (department). The hospital countered with evidence that Dr. Suit had supported the advancement of the plaintiff\u2019s career after the disclosure, as well as evidence that the department in general and Dr. Suit in particular had a history of recruiting, employing, and supporting homosexual employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>The hospital also proffered substantial evidence of the plaintiffs neglect in the performance of his duties and other substandard behavior. We describe the evidence in greater detail because it informs in particular our discussion of the medical peer review privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">In 1986 the plaintiff joined the department, beginning a three-year residency. Dividing his time between clinical and laboratory work, the plaintiff successfully completed his residency in 1989, receiving an award for excellence. Dr. Suit invited the plaintiff to remain on staff as a fellow for one year, during which time the plaintiff, with the support of Dr. Suit, received several competitive grants for research. In 1990, Dr. Suit recommended that the plaintiff join the medical staff of the department and be appointed an instructor at Harvard Medical School. Within two years the plaintiff had published several articles in academic publications. Dr. Suit agreed to increase the amount of clinical work undertaken by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">During his residency and fellowship years, the plaintiff did not disclose his sexual orientation to Dr. Suit or to other senior members of the hospital staff. In the spring of 1993, the plaintiff learned that his longtime partner was ill with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In October, 1993, the plaintiff informed Dr. Suit that he is \u201cgay,\u201d that his partner had AIDS, and that he might need to take some time off to care for his partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">After this discussion, the plaintiff continued to advance in his career and Dr. Suit continued to support him. In the summer of 1994, Dr. Suit recommended the plaintiff for promotions at the hospital and at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Suit also recommended the plaintiff for further grant funding for his research.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The promotion at the hospital was approved, and the plaintiff received the funding for his research from the National Cancer Institute. Dr. Suit continued to provide the plaintiff with salary support and additional office space to facilitate his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Sometime thereafter difficulties arose between Dr. Suit and the plaintiff. The jury learned that, in January, 1995, Dr. Suit reprimanded the plaintiff for removing certain laboratory research data books from Dr. Suit\u2019s laboratory<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; he ordered the plaintiff not to enter the laboratory without his permission. In March, 1995, Dr. Suit informed the plaintiff that he was placing his academic promotion on hold.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, Dr. Suit became concerned about the plaintiff\u2019s clinical teaching and patient care activities for the reasons we next discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">In April, 1995, Dr. Alan Hartford, a medical resident in the department, submitted a five-page memorandum to Dr. Suit (Hartford memorandum), in which he detailed numerous incidents over the course of the preceding three months to the effect that the plaintiff had not provided adequate supervision and training of residents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After receiving the Hartford memorandum, Dr. Suit spoke with Dr. Allan Thornton, who took care of the plaintiff\u2019s patients in his absence and who therefore interacted with some of the medical residents who worked with the plaintiff. In response, Dr. Thornton wrote a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>detailed letter (Thornton letter) discussing various shortcomings of the plaintiff. Dr. Thornton noted numerous areas of concern including \u201c[p]age availability,\u201d describing the plaintiff as \u201cdifficult to reach either by page or telephone\u201d; \u201c[c]linic accessibility,\u201d describing the plaintiff\u2019s repeated unavailability at the department\u2019s clinic, creating particular difficulties for new patients; the plaintiff\u2019s repeated failure to comply with certain protocols, which Dr. Thornton described as \u201can embarrassment to our group,\u201d which could \u201cnot continue\u201d; \u201c[rjecord keeping,\u201d in which Dr. Thornton said he \u201crarely [found] any notation in the charts of [the plaintiff\u2019s] patients by [the plaintiff] himself,\u201d even though these were \u201cextremely ill patients requiring careful monitoring\u201d; and the plaintiff\u2019s history of obtaining \u201cinadequate and spurious\u201d consents by patients, which, said Dr. Thornton, would negatively affect any \u201clitigation.\u201d Dr. Thornton also described with concern that patient care was \u201cleft to the resident\u201d and that the plaintiff was \u201crarely in attendance\u201d at departmental conferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">In late May, 1995, Dr. Suit informed the plaintiff that he was removing him from teaching and supervising residents, and would cease assigning residents to the plaintiff effective July 1, 1995.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further reductions in the plaintiff\u2019s privileges and responsibilities followed. Dr. Suit met with the executive committee of the department in late June, 1995.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The committee concluded it would no longer commit to funding the plaintiff\u2019s salary for his research beyond the next two years. In August, 1995, Dr. Suit removed the plaintiff from participating in an experimental radiation project because, as he testified, the plaintiff had failed to follow certain procedures concerning the use of an experimental machine to irradiate brain tumors.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">On August 17, 1995, the plaintiff filed a complaint with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD). The following month, a dispute arose in the department concerning the plaintiff\u2019s choice of treatment for one of his patients. While the plaintiff was on vacation, Dr. Suit and the department\u2019s clinical director changed the treatment plan ordered by the plaintiff. The clinical director and the plaintiff later disagreed over how the change had been handled. Dr. Suit recommended that the plaintiff discuss the matter with the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr. Peter Slavin. Based on a discussion with Dr. Slavin in late November, 1995, Dr. Suit came to believe that the plaintiff had lied about approvals he claimed to have secured before he had chosen the treatment plan. There was other evidence of what the hospital characterizes as the plaintiff\u2019s \u201ctruthfulness, clinical judgment and interpersonal interactions\u201d that ultimately resulted in Dr. Suit\u2019s recommendation that the plaintiff\u2019s clinical privileges be limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Dr. Suit testified that in light of his escalating concerns, in December, 1995, he recommended that the plaintiff\u2019s reappointment to the medical staff be limited to six months, and that his clinical work be supervised. The hospital\u2019s general executive committee (GEC) considered Dr. Suit\u2019s recommendation in January, 1996,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and voted unanimously to recommend that the plaintiff be reappointed for a six-month period without clinical privileges.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The hospital\u2019s board of trustees (board) adopted the recommendation on January 19, 1996. The plaintiff appealed from the decision to a staff review committee.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In June, 1996, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>when his temporary reappointment expired, the plaintiff\u2019s employment was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">In February, 1998, after a hearing, the staff review committee recommended that the board reverse its decision with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s clinical privileges. The staff review committee upheld the board\u2019s decision denying the plaintiff\u2019s application for reappointment in July, 1996. The board restored the plaintiffs clinical privileges nunc pro tune for the period January to June, 1996. The plaintiff filed suit against the hospital and others<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in May, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">2. <em>The medical peer review privilege. </em>The plaintiff challenges the judge\u2019s pretrial order denying his request for the discovery of certain documents the hospital claimed were privileged under the medical peer review statute, G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 204 (a), because, he asserts, his allegations of \u201cbad faith\u201d on the part of Dr. Suit, Dr. Slavin, and the clinical director triggered the statutory exception to the privilege. The exception permits discovery of medical peer review materials where a committee member did not act \u201cin good faith\u201d and \u201cin the reasonable belief\u201d that his actions were warranted. See G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 204 (b).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See also G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 203 (c).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The judge properly resolved the question in favor of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>In a discrimination action alleging disparate treatment, obtaining comparative information about an employer\u2019s treatment of similarly situated employees is often critical to the plaintiff\u2019s case. See, e.g., <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., </em>426 Mass. 122, 129 (1997), citing <em>Smith College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, 376 </em>Mass. 221, 228 (1978) (\u201cThe most probative means of establishing that the plaintiff s termination was a pretext for . . . discrimination is to demonstrate that similarly situated . . . employees were treated differently\u201d). Here, the plaintiff requested \u201call documents\u201d relating to patient care deficiencies by other members of the department\u2019s medical staff and the discipline of such staff,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> as well as \u201c[a]ll documents\u201d relating to other physicians denied clinical and research privileges or reappointment \u201cfrom 1986 to the present.\u201d In response to the hospital\u2019s invocation of the medical peer review privilege, the plaintiff cited the statutory exception to the privilege, arguing that the privilege yielded to any allegation of \u201cbad faith,\u201d in particular, any allegation of discriminatory conduct. After multiple submissions by the parties concerning the plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel, which the judge addressed with admirable attention to detail, see <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>426 Mass 514, 529 (1998), she ordered the hospital to produce a significant amount of the requested information,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to the extent it requested docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ments she concluded were covered by the medical peer review privilege.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The judge was correct to rule as she did. The Legislature has mandated that the medical profession regulate the quality of patient care by identifying and remedying instances of substandard care at least in part through internal medical peer review proceedings. See, e.g., G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 203 (a), <em>(d).</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See also <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 517-518 (discussing history and purpose of medical peer review process). To that end, the Legislature enacted the medical peer review privilege, insulating from discovery certain material submitted to or produced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>a medical peer review committee, G. L. c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 203-204, inserted by St. 1986, c. 351, \u00a7 9, a privilege not recognized at common law. See <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Strayer, supra </em>at 535 (common-law privilege not recognized for records of impaired physician committee of Massachusetts Medical Society). The obvious purpose of the statutory medical peer review privilege is to \u201cpromote candor and confidentiality\u201d in the peer review process, <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 518, and \u201cto foster aggressive critiquing of medical care by the provider\u2019s peers,\u201d <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>401 Mass. 172, 182 (1987). See <em>Ayash </em>v. <em>Dana-Farber Cancer Inst., </em>443 Mass. 367, 396 (2005) (\u201cPhysicians would be far less willing candidly to report, testify about, and investigate concerns of patient safety if their actions would be subject to later scrutiny and possible litigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The Legislature provided a single, narrow exception to the privilege \u201cto establish\u201d that a member of a peer review committee did not act \u201cin good faith and in the reasonable belief that based on all of the facts the action or inaction on his part was warranted\u201d during the peer review process. See G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 204 <em>(b); </em>G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85N.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Neither the language of the statute nor its legislative history elucidates the precise boundaries the Legislature sought to establish when abrogating the immunity from discovery in certain cases. Taking into account the compelling public policy the privilege was established to advance, we conclude that the privilege can only be invaded on some threshold showing that a member of a medical peer review committee did not act in good faith in connection with his activities as a member of the committee, for example did not provide the medical peer review committee with a full and honest disclosure of all of the relevant circumstances, but sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>to mislead the committee in some manner.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The focus must be on the committee member\u2019s actions within the peer review committee process itself, not on possible discriminatory reasons for initiating a review of the plaintiff\u2019s work. Cf. <em>Birbiglia </em>v. <em>Saint Vincent Hosp., Inc., </em>427 Mass. 80, 84-86 (1998) (no evidence warranting finding of \u201cbad faith\u201d in medical peer review process where plaintiff made no attempt to demonstrate what allegedly biased and knowingly false evidence hospital relied on, and where plaintiff did not point to specific evidence tending to prove that hospital\u2019s executive committee or board knew that any evidence was biased or knowingly false). See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Hosp. of Fort Wayne, </em>42 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) par. 36,973 (N.D. Ind. 1987) (in discrimination case, to overcome medical peer review privilege plaintiff must \u201callege facts which create more than a mere inference that the actions of the peer review committee were discriminatory, before the court will permit even an in camera inspection of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>munications to, records of or determination of the peer review committee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Here, Dr. Suit\u2019s concerns about the plaintiff\u2019s performance were initially triggered in substantial part by the complaint received from Dr. Hartford. His concerns were heightened when he received Dr. Thornton\u2019s comprehensive letter outlining numerous performance shortcomings of the plaintiff. There is no allegation by the plaintiff that either Dr. Hartford or Dr. Thornton harbored any animus toward him.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Their respective written complaints to Dr. Suit would give rise to the gravest concern of any supervising physician. Patients receiving treatment in the department are extremely ill, subjected to life-threatening treatments. Had the express concerns of Dr. Hartford and Dr. Thornton not been acted on, and had the scrutiny of the plaintiff\u2019s work not intensified, Dr. Suit could well have been viewed as derelict in his duties. In Massachusetts, as elsewhere, medical peer review is not a choice, but a legislative requirement. See G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 203. No physician is at liberty to avoid that mandate. Even assuming that Dr. Suit had treated the plaintiff \u201cdifferently\u201d in some respect because he is homosexual (by recommending to the GEC that the plaintiff\u2019s privileges be limited rather than merely reporting his concerns to the GEC, for example), the plaintiff has not pointed to evidence that discriminatory animus rather than a legitimate concern for patient care infected the actual medical peer review process.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See <em>Ayash </em>v. <em>Dana-Farber Cancer Inst., </em>443 Mass. 367, 399 (2005) (evidence did not warrant inference that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>supervising physician\u2019s \u201cmisplaced focus\u201d on plaintiff was \u201cdeliberate, or motivated by a \u2018spiteful, malignant purpose\u2019 to hurt the plaintiff that was unrelated to [supervising physician\u2019s] professional responsibilities\u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">We emphasize that, in the face of the hospital\u2019s opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s broad discovery requests, the judge ordered the hospital to produce substantial discovery. The plaintiff reviewed, among other items, the written materials that triggered Dr. Suit\u2019s concerns; the promotional files for other doctors considered for academic positions at Harvard Medical School; all residency teaching evaluations of medical staff members from 1990 to 1996; and the transcripts and other records of the staff review committee. The plaintiff deposed all of the key decisionmakers. The only information not ordered disclosed was the privileged materials of the peer review committees. We also note that the thrust of the plaintiff\u2019s challenge was to obtain not the materials of the GEC when it acted on Dr. Suit\u2019s complaint concerning the plaintiff himself, but the records of numerous other peer review proceedings that had nothing to do with the plaintiff. See notes 19 and 20, <em>supra. </em>That the plaintiff did not seek an interlocutory appeal from the small segment of documents not ordered produced speaks volumes of the lack of importance he attached to those documents before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The Legislature has made clear that, in this Commonwealth, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is against public policy and shall not be tolerated. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4. It has established and funded a special commission to investigate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>pass on complaints of unlawful discrimination. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 56. See also G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. The Legislature has also sought to eradicate \u201cconduct by a health care provider that indicates incompetency ... or conduct that might be inconsistent with or harmful to good patient care or safety.\u201d G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 203 <em>(a). </em>In balancing these two important societal goals, the Legislature did not provide a blanket exception to the medical peer review privilege where there is a claim that a physician\u2019s actions are motivated by discriminatory animus. The medical peer review privilege was enacted to promote \u201cthe uninhibited expression of professional opinions before a [peer review committee] and protects the [peer review committee\u2019s] work product.\u201d <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>401 Mass. 172, 183 (1987).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It is that work of the committee that the privilege protects, and unless the work can be shown to be tainted, then the privilege applies. See <em>id. </em>at 182 (\u201creading the exception to the [medical peer review] privilege narrowly is consistent with our cases where we have refused to add to the listed exceptions to a given statutory privilege\u201d). See also <em>Doe </em>v. <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Hosp. of Fort Wayne, </em>42 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) par. 36,973 at 46,737 (N.D. Ind. 1987) (in discrimination case statutory \u201cprivilege granted to the peer review committee ought to be sedulously fostered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The plaintiff relies on discrimination cases in which Federal courts have declined to recognize a Federal common-law medical peer review privilege. See, e.g., <em>Virmani </em>v. <em>Novant Health, Inc., 259 </em>F.3d 284, 289 (4th Cir. 2001) (refusing to recognize privilege under Federal common law for medical peer review records in Federal discrimination actions, because \u201cinterest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>facilitating the eradication of discrimination by providing perhaps the only evidence that can establish its occurrence outweighs the interest in promoting candor in the medical peer review process\u201d).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Those cases are irrelevant because our Legislature has created a statutory medical peer review privilege that we must effectuate. In any event, our decision is not inconsistent with the Federal holdings on which the plaintiff relies. In each case a judge must determine whether a medical peer review privilege exists. The judge must then, and only then, examine whether the privilege applies to a particular document, as the judge did here. See <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>426 Mass. 514, 529 (1998). Once the judge has made that determination, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to make a showing that the proceedings themselves (rather than the reasons for initiating the proceedings, which the plaintiff was free to discover) were not conducted \u201cin good faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">We have recognized that \u201cthe peer review privilege imposes some hardship on litigants seeking to discover information from hospital records, but the Legislature has clearly chosen to impose that burden on individual litigants in order to improve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the medical peer review process generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532. We have carefully reviewed all of the materials before the judge that are included in the record. We have no doubt that, in this case, the plaintiff did not meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">3. <em>Hearsay evidence. </em>The plaintiff claims that it was error for the judge to admit in evidence the Hartford memorandum, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>and the Thornton letter and to permit testimony concerning their contents. At trial he objected to the admission of the two documents and to Dr. Suit\u2019s testimony about the Hartford memorandum only.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We focus our discussion on those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">We first describe the circumstances in which the challenged evidence was admitted. The hospital sought to admit the Hartford memorandum during Dr. Suit\u2019s testimony. The plaintiff objected, and the judge held a sidebar conference and ruled that the document was \u201ccoming in to show, if believed, why Dr. Suit took the action that he took.\u201d The document was admitted, and the judge gave the jury an appropriate limiting instruction. Dr. Suit then testified that he had received the document and spoken with Dr. Hartford, and explained to the jury why he thought each concern mentioned in the document was important. The following day Dr. Suit continued testifying about the substance of the Hartford memorandum, the plaintiff again objected, and the judge gave a second detailed and entirely correct limiting instruction to the jury. Later Dr. Hartford testified about his reasons for writing the memorandum, and testified, without objection, about the \u201cessential problem\u201d he had with the plaintiff and about the substance of some of the specific concerns contained in his memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">During Dr. Suit\u2019s testimony, defense counsel also moved to admit the Thornton letter. The plaintiff objected on the ground of hearsay. The judge went through the letter paragraph by paragraph and ordered redaction of some of its contents. The redacted letter was admitted, and both Dr. Suit and Dr. Thornton were permitted to testify about its substance. The plaintiff did not object to Dr. Suit\u2019s testimony, nor did he raise any objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>while Dr. Thornton was testifying.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We now turn to the judge\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The admission of evidence is within the broad discretion of the judge. See <em>Zucco </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>439 Mass. 503, 507 (2003). Here, the plaintiff maintains that testimony concerning the Hartford memorandum and the Thornton letter was admissible to prove only that the person to whom these materials were addressed, Dr. Suit, had notice or knowledge of their contents. Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>430 Mass. 505, 509 (1999), the plaintiff argues that admission of the documents themselves, and the challenged testimony, should not have been permitted as this went \u201cfar beyond\u201d the notice and knowledge under the exception, creating unfair prejudice to him.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Both the Hartford memorandum and the Thornton letter were themselves properly admitted to show notice and knowledge on the part of Dr. Suit. See RJ. Liacos, M.S. Brodin, &amp; M. Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.2.2, at 466 (7th ed. 1999) (\u201cAn extrajudicial statement is not hearsay when offered to prove that the person to whom it was addressed had notice or knowledge of the contents of the statement\u201d). The documents and the related testimony also pertained directly to the hospital\u2019s lawful, nondiscriminatory reasons for its employment decisions concerning the plaintiff. See <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>432 Mass. 107, 117-118 (2000). Under the state of mind exception, both documents and the testimony concerning them were properly admitted to explain why Dr. Suit took the actions he did concerning the plaintiff. See P.J. Liacos, M.S. Brodin, &amp; M. Avery, Massachusetts Evidence, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 8.2.2, at 470-471 (\u201cWhere a statement is offered to prove the effect it had on the listener\u2019s state of mind, that state of mind must be relevant to an issue properly in the case\u201d). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bregoli, </em>431 Mass. 265, 273 (2000) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s knowledge of the contents of the statements must be directly relevant for them to be admissible on this basis,\u201d referring to notice and knowledge exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">All of the challenged evidence was relevant to Dr. Suit\u2019s state of mind insofar as it served as a basis for the adverse action he took against the plaintiff. The judge\u2019s two limiting instructions, one given when requested, ensured that the jury would not find that the underlying criticism of Dr. Hartford and Dr. Thornton was necessarily true.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">4. <em>Jury instructions on the retaliation claim. </em>The plaintiff argues that the judge should have instructed the jury on two points relating to his retaliation claim. First, he claims that the judge improperly refused to instruct the jury that the nearness in time between the protected activity<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and the adverse action permits an inference of retaliation. Next, he asserts that the judge should have informed the jury that, if the plaintiff reasonably and in good faith believed that the hospital had discriminated against him, filing a charge of discrimination with the MCAD was a per se reasonable activity. We turn first to the requested neamess-in-time instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The jury are permitted to infer retaliation from the \u201ctiming and sequence of events.\u201d <em>Mole </em>v. <em>University of Mass., </em>442 Mass. 582, 592 (2004). Such an inference may be drawn \u201cif adverse action is taken against a satisfactorily performing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>employee in the immediate aftermath of the employer\u2019s becoming aware of the employee\u2019s protected activity,\u201d or \u201c[w]here adverse employment actions follow close on the heels of protected activity . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592, 595. We cautioned that where \u201cadverse employment actions or other problems with an employee predate any knowledge that the employee has engaged in protected activity, it is not permissible to draw the inference that subsequent adverse actions, taken after the employer acquires such knowledge, are motivated by retaliation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594. Having reviewed the evidence in this case, we conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion in declining to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">It is the general rule that \u201c[t]he extent to which a judge shall discuss the evidence or the subsidiary facts is generally within [her] discretion.\u201d <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Berkshire St. Ry., </em>281 Mass. 47, 50-52 (1932). We recognize that in a retaliation case such as this, there is often no direct evidence of discrimination or retaliation, and a plaintiff\u2019s proof will often depend on circumstantial evidence. Because direct evidence of retaliation is rare, a neamess-in-time instruction may fall within an exception to the general mie just stated: \u201cSometimes the issue depends upon the existence of some fact, theoretically subsidiary but practically decisive if found. In such a case, for a judge to ignore the simple concrete test and submit the case upon abstract general instructions blurs the point and may mislead the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52. Cf. <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Reisman, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 118, 122-123 (1995) (instruction on possible inference not required where several inferences possible). Thus, although falling within a judge\u2019s discretion, in a discrimination or retaliation case based on circumstantial evidence, a neamess-in-time instruction should be given if the evidence supports it, and if requested. <em>Id. </em>Where there is conflicting evidence concerning the inference for which the instruction is requested, however, a judge retains her broad authority to decide whether to include the instmction. <em>Id. </em>at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">In this case there was sharply conflicting evidence regarding the sequence and timing of events. Specifically, there was conflicting evidence as to when the plaintiff first told Dr. Suit he was concerned about discrimination based on his sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>orientation. See note 8, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Moreover, by the time the plaintiff filed his MCAD complaint, Dr. Suit had already taken steps to limit the plaintiff\u2019s responsibilities based on Dr. Suit\u2019s concerns about the plaintiff\u2019s performance. See <em>Mole </em>v. <em>University of Mass., supra </em>at 594. Nothing precluded the plaintiff from arguing the point in his closing argument,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and the judge gave detailed instructions to the jury about their role in determining the credibility of the witnesses and the inferences the jury might draw from the circumstantial evidence presented at the trial on both the discrimination and retaliation claims. See <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Reisman, supra </em>at 123. Once a judge has instructed that retaliation may be proved by circumstantial evidence, she may, within her discretion, give a more specific instruction (retaliation may be inferred if the jury find adverse employment action taken soon after an expression of protected activity), but need not be so specific when there is conflicting evidence on the point. Here, it was not an abuse of discretion for the judge to decline to give the more specific instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The second claim of error concerns the judge\u2019s response to a jury question about the second element of a retaliation claim: that the plaintiff acted reasonably in response to his belief that his employer was discriminating against him. A retaliation claim requires proof that (1) the plaintiff reasonably and in good faith believed that the employer was engaged in wrongful discrimination; (2) that he acted reasonably in response to that belief; and (3) that there is a causal connection between the protected conduct and an adverse employment action. <em>Mole </em>v. <em>University of Mass., supra </em>at 591-592. On the second day of deliberations, the jury requested that the judge \u201cclearly\u201d define for them \u201cwhat actions would have been \u2018reasonable\u2019 in filing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>complaint with the MCAD,\u201d i.e., the second element. The judge advised the jury that this was a question for them to determine. Specifically, she instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\">\u201c[Wjhether the filing was reasonable is entirely up to you to decide from all of the evidence that you have in this case. A reasonable person is an ordinarily sensible, prudent person, one who is discerning in the management of practical affairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The judge further instructed: \u201cWhen I say \u2018reasonable person,\u2019 I mean a reasonable person in [the plaintiff\u2019s] position in all of the circumstances that you\u2019ve heard about in this case on the date in question.\u201d On appeal, the plaintiff argues that where an individual reasonably and in good faith believes that discrimination has occurred, filing a charge of discrimination with the MCAD is per se reasonable and that the jury should have been so instructed.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The judge properly instructed the jurors that the question of reasonableness was a question of fact for them to decide. To instruct the jury as the plaintiff requested would remove the is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>sue, a required element of establishing a claim of retaliation, from the jury. See <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>432 Mass. 107, 117-118 (2000) (jury instruction \u201cshould not have been given because it stripped the jury of its fact-finding role,\u201d where it informed jury that finding of pretext compelled finding of discrimination). It may be that in many cases, once the jury find that the plaintiff held a good faith and reasonable belief of discrimination, the jury will also find that the plaintiffs charge of discrimination with the MCAD was reasonable. But that is not the only possible outcome. As the judge noted, the filing of a charge can be used as \u201ca smokescreen in challenge to the supervisor\u2019s legitimate criticism.\u201d <em>Monteiro </em>v. <em>Poole Silver Co., </em>615 F.2d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 1980).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The judge properly determined that the jury should decide whether in this particular case the plaintiff\u2019s filing of a charge with the MCAD was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b21-7\">The judge in the Superior Court was assigned to handle all phases of the case, including all discovery matters and the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b21-9\">General Laws c. 111, \u00a7 204 <em>(a), </em>provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-10\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, the proceedings, reports and records of a medical peer review committee shall be confidential. . .

The first two examples do not pertain to activities of the peer review committee and are therefore irrelevant. As to the third, even if Dr. Slavin\u2019s deposition testimony did not accurately reflect what in fact occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>at the GEC, there is no claim by the plaintiff that the physician who may or may not have been present at the GEC (a peer review committee) harbored any bias toward the plaintiff or misled the GEC in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff asserts that he elicited testimony at trial to the effect that a staff review committee rarely recommends that the board revise a prior decision with respect to medical staff privileges, as it did here.

Md. 1995) (applying Maryland medical peer review privilege in Federal defamation action); <em>Mewborn </em>v. <em>Heckler, </em>101 F.R.D. 691 (D.D.C. 1984) (applying District of Columbia peer review privilege in Federal Tort Claims Act action).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The plaintiff did not object on hearsay grounds to Dr. Hartford\u2019s testimony about his own memorandum, Dr. Suit\u2019s testimony about the Thornton letter, or Dr. Thornton\u2019s testimony about his letter to Dr. Suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The plaintiff did object generally to Dr. Thornton\u2019s testimony before the letter was admitted. In response, the judge correctly told the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to register his specific objections when Dr. Thornton testified. During Dr. Thornton\u2019s testimony, the plaintiff did not raise any hearsay objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>430 Mass. 505, 508 n.3 (1999), we noted that \u201ca greater level of scrutiny of hearsay statements\u201d is required in \u201cthe case of criminal trials.\u201d This appeal involves a civil trial, so this exacting scrutiny is not required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\">If requested, the judge presumably would have given the jury a limiting instruction with respect to the admission of the Thornton letter and testimony concerning the content of that letter. Where the plaintiff failed to request a limiting instruction concerning this evidence, and failed to object to Dr. Suit\u2019s testimony concerning the content of the letter, the judge did not abuse her discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4), a plaintiff has engaged in a protected activity if \u201che has opposed any practices forbidden under this chapter or . . . has filed a complaint, testified or assisted in any proceeding under [G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5],\u201d which provides for filing of complaints of discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD). It is unlawful under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4A), \u201c[f]or any person to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with another person in the exercise or enjoyment of any right granted or protected by this chapter . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b39-6\">At trial, the plaintiff testified that in the summer of 1993, he spoke with Dr. Clyde Evans, director of the office for academic careers and associate dean for clinical affairs at the Harvard Medical School, regarding his concerns about his work environment. Dr. Evans testified that he could not recall the substance of that conversation. The plaintiff also testified that he spoke with Dr. Suit in the summer of 1993 about the clinical director\u2019s \u201cpoor attitude\u201d and his \u201cpoor approach to gay patients.\u201d Dr. Suit did not testify concerning this conversation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">In his closing argument, the plaintiff did not emphasize the nearness in time of the protected activity and the adverse action, suggesting that the issue was not as significant as the plaintiff now claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The plaintiff also argues that if a \u201creasonableness\u201d standard is applied \u2014 i.e., the test used to determine whether \u201coppositional activity\u201d is protected \u2014 the standard should not be objective reasonableness, as the judge instructed, but rather a \u201cnot unreasonable\u201d standard. The plaintiff did not object to the instruction on this basis. He requested that the standard be \u201ca reasonable person in [the plaintiff\u2019s] shoes.\u201d The judge gave the requested instruction. To the extent the issue of an objective standard of reasonableness has any validity, it is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The plaintiff also argues that upholding the jury instruction on retaliation will result in juries finding no retaliation whenever they find that the underlying discrimination claim has not been proved. The point has no merit. The judge specifically and correctly instructed the jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">\u201cIn proving a claim for retaliation, [the plaintiff] does not have to succeed on his underlying complaint of discrimination. Even if you find that [the plaintiff] does not prove that the hospital acted, actually discriminated against him because he [is] gay, you may still find that he has proven that the hospital retaliated against him for filing an internal complaint of discrimination against him or in initiating a legal proceeding at the [MCAD].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">As long as the jury are \u201c[p]roperly instructed and acting under those instructions, the jury\u2019s verdict on discrimination [cannot affect] their verdict on retaliation.\u201d <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>432 Mass. 107, 122 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The plaintiff argues that the question whether filing a charge of discrimination was a \u201cpreemptive strike\u201d (in the judge\u2019s term) or a \u201csmokescreen,\u201d <em>Monteiro </em>v. <em>Poole Silver Co., </em>615 F. 2d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 1980), is encompassed by the first element of a retaliation claim. We do not agree. The first prong of a retaliation claim requires that the finder of fact consider only the plaintiffs belief. The second prong of a retaliation claim directs the finder of fact to consider the plaintiff\u2019s actions: whether the plaintiff \u201cacted reasonably in response to [his] belief.\u201d <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, supra </em>at 121, quoting <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Health, </em>419 Mass. 356, 364 (1995). Although the filing of a charge of discrimination is a \u201cprotected\u201d activity under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4), it may not be \u201creasonable\u201d for purposes of proving retaliation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
