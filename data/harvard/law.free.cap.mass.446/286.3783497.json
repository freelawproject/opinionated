The Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (2000), is one such statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We transferred this case here on our own motion to consider whether counsel who represented the plaintiff, a mentally retarded and physically vulnerable man, may recover attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The underlying litigation has been pursued in the Superior Court for more than one decade, and was resolved only when essential services for the plaintiff were finally provided by the Department of Mental Retardation (department). A judge in the Superior Court concluded that the litigation spurred the department to provide the services long denied to the plaintiff: she noted that the plaintiff would \u201cnever\u201d have been provided the services \u201chad it not been for this litigation.\u201d The issue of the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees here is, however, one of Federal law. On a careful review of the voluminous record and with due regard for the legal services provided by counsel to their client to secure basic necessities for him, we conclude that under the command of <em>Buckhannon </em>and its progeny, attorney\u2019s fees may not be awarded in this case. We affirm the judge\u2019s order vacating her earlier award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Also at issue is the department\u2019s appeal challenging a ruling that statements made by the judge during a hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for injunctive relief constituted an order enforceable by contempt proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reverse the judge\u2019s order holding the department in contempt and awarding damages to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the judge\u2019s findings of fact, and describe the lengthy procedural history of this case. See <em>Palmetto Props., Inc. </em>v. <em>County of DuPage, </em>375 F.3d 542, 543 (7th Cir. 2004), quoting <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc., </em>356 F.3d 246, 253 (2d Cir. 2004) (to determine whether award of attorney\u2019s fees is appropriate under <em>Buckhannon, </em>\u201ca meticulous analysis of the particular judgments and orders entered in a case is necessary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The plaintiff is a sixty-six year old severely mentally retarded man with no family. He suffers from Fahr\u2019s Disease, a degenerative neurological disorder that causes him to have difficulty walking and maintaining his balance. He has been in the care of the Commonwealth since early childhood. In 1995, while in the department\u2019s custody,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff suffered serious injuries, including a head injury, resulting from a series of falls and an assault he suffered while living in a department-sponsored group home, Charles River Association for Retarded Citizens. He was hospitalized at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in June, 1995, and remained there for some six months. Eventually the plaintiff\u2019s guardian was required to move him from MGH. Believing that placement in the department-sponsored group home would not be safe for the plaintiff, the guardian transferred the plaintiff to a nursing home over which the department had no control.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">In November, 1995, while he was still a patient at MGH, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>plaintiff (through his guardian) commenced this action against the department.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff alleged that injuries suffered in 1994 and 1995 were caused by the department\u2019s failure to provide him with an individual service plan (ISP)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requiring one-to-one care and supervision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff asserted various State claims and claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and sought compensatory damages. He also sought injunctive relief ordering the department to place him in an appropriate facility that could provide one-to-one care and supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">A request for a preliminary injunction, filed when the action was commenced, was denied in March, 1996, after the department agreed to amend the plaintiff\u2019s ISP.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The case eventually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>went to trial in December, 1999. A directed verdict was entered in favor of the department on all claims, except one claim for negligence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on that count, and awarded damages in the amount of $482,600 for the injuries he had sustained. On August 29, 2000, the judge allowed the department\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, concluding that the department was immune from liability under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (/), and that the plaintiff failed to produce sufficient evidence to allow the jury to draw a reasonable inference that the department had been negligent. The plaintiff does not raise any issues related to that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">At the conclusion of the trial but before the judge\u2019s ruling on the department\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the plaintiff renewed his request for injunctive relief. See note 8, <em>supra. </em>He again sought an order that the department amend the plaintiff\u2019s ISP<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to require the provision of one-to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>one care and supervision, and added a claim that the department had violated his rights under a consent decree entered in a class action, <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Okin, </em>823 F. Supp. 984 (D. Mass. 1993) <em>(Ricci).</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is the 2000 injunctive relief sought by the plaintiff that forms in large part the basis of his <em>Buckhannon </em>claim. For purposes of resolving those claims, the critical events, which we describe in greater detail below, are as follows: (1) on February 10, February 17, and March 29, 2000, the judge, who had presided at the trial, held hearings on the plaintiff\u2019s renewed motion for injunctive relief, and on March 29, she allegedly issued an oral order that is the subject of the contempt claim; (2) on May 31, 2000, the plaintiff filed a complaint for contempt for noncompliance with the judge\u2019s March 29, 2000, order; (3) by order dated December 1, 2000, and entered on January 2, 2001, the judge dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s request for injunctive relief as moot, awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff, and held the department in contempt for failure to comply with one aspect of her March order; (4) on January 22 and 24, 2001, respectively, the department filed a notice of appeal, and the plaintiff cross-appealed<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>; (5) on December 31, 2001, the department filed a motion for reconsideration concerning the award of attorney\u2019s fees in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckhannon, </em>issued after the judge\u2019s order on attorney\u2019s fees; (6) on March 18, 2002, the judge vacated her award of attorney\u2019s fees; (7) on April 2, 2002, the plaintiff filed an amended notice of appeal regarding the vacation of the attorney\u2019s fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The focal point of our inquiry is the March 29, 2000, hearing for purposes of both our <em>Buckhannon </em>analysis and the contempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ruling. To place it in context, we review in greater detail the posttrial stages in the litigation, preceding and following that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">As noted earlier, in December, 1999, following the trial, the plaintiff renewed his request for injunctive relief that the department complete a new ISP to require \u201cin particular\u201d some form of one-to-one care and supervision to assure the plaintiff\u2019s safety and allow him to Uve \u201cin the most normal, least restrictive manner possible.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> At that time, the plaintiff continued to reside in the nursing home where his guardian had placed him after his discharge from MGH. He claimed in his renewed request that the services were required in part because he is a member of the class certified in <em>Ricci. </em>Three hearings on the plaintiffs motion then followed: February 10 and 17, and March 29, 2000. At the February 10 hearing, the department did not contest that an amended ISP was required, but informed the judge that an amended ISP had not been prepared. The judge \u201cordered\u201d that the department \u201cprepare and serve on the court and plaintiff\u2019s counsel the ISP ... by the end of business on [February] 15th.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At the February 17 hearing, the judge \u201corder[ed]\u201d the department to prepare a \u201cmore complete ISP\u201d within three weeks because she was not satisfied with the draft ISP presented to her. Between that date and the next hearing, the department focused on revising and finalizing a new ISP for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">We turn now to the hearing on March 29. By that time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>judge had rejected the initial revised ISP presented to her in February, had granted a three-week extension sought by the department, was aware that the department had met with the plaintiffs guardian, and had every expectation that the department would comply with her orders. The judge reviewed a copy of the new ISP prepared by the department, which the plaintiff\u2019s guardian had received but had not signed. The new ISP stated that \u201cby April 30th\u201d the plaintiff would have one-to-one care and supervision \u201cfor up to twenty-five horns each week.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The department\u2019s ISP service coordinator<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> testified that funding for the plaintiffs one-to-one care had been \u201capproved,\u201d and that although she did not know \u201chow the funding works,\u201d she had set an April 30 deadline. These represented substantial and important changes to the services the department would provide to the plaintiff. Some ambiguities in the revised ISP needed to be resolved, however. Specifically, the ISP did not provide for a private room for the plaintiff, and counsel expressed concern that the one-to-one care specified in the new ISP was only \u201cup to\u201d twenty-five hours per week when he was not participating in community activities and would therefore force the plaintiff to choose between community activities and one-to-one care. The judge then engaged in a colloquy with the ISP service coordinator who agreed that the plaintiff would receive \u201capproximately\u201d twenty-five hours of one-to-one care per week, and not just \u201cup to\u201d that amount. The judge \u201casked\u201d the department to amend the existing ISP to include that relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">\u201cI am going to ask that [the department] amend this ISP to include . . . that, at the present time, [the plaintiff] has a private room, that he will have his private room, at [the department\u2019s] expense, until an appropriate roommate is determined.....[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>] And I am \u00bfso asking that [the department] amend the [ISP] ... to just add a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>. . . that [the plaintiff] will have approximately twenty-five hours a week of one-to-one [care] . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">When the department objected on the grounds that the judge had no authority to determine the content of an ISP, citing <em>Matter of McKnight, </em>406 Mass. 787 (1990), the judge responded that she was \u201conly asking [the department] ... to put in the ISP, what [the department] has already agreed to.\u201d She then specifically inquired whether the department had agreed to provide one-to-one care for approximately twenty-five hours per week, to which counsel for the department responded: \u201cYes. The service coordinator has agreed to that.\u201d Following this exchange the judge then inquired of counsel whether he had any other concerns not addressed in the ISP, to which counsel responded, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">As to injunctive relief, because the department had agreed to provide one-to-one care and a private room by April 30, 2000, the judge inquired of plaintiff\u2019s counsel that \u201cwith the current ISP, you really don\u2019t need me to do anything.\u201d He responded that \u201cas the result of litigation\u201d counsel had \u201cgotten for [the plaintiff] what we want.\u201d He did request that the judge make findings of fact that the plaintiff is a member of the <em>Ricci </em>class, see note 11, <em>supra, </em>and that the department \u201cas a matter of law, [was] required to provide [the plaintiff] services in accordance with the ISP and in accordance with the i?zccz'-related [regulations].\u201d The judge did not issue a written order following the March 29 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">By April 30, 2000, the one-to-one services for the plaintiff had not been provided, nor apparently had he been moved to a private room in the nursing home. See note 19, <em>infra. </em>On May 31, 2000, the plaintiff filed a complaint for contempt, claiming that the department had failed to comply with the judge\u2019s March 29 order. The docket does not reflect any opposition from the department and we have been provided with none. On June 15, 2000, the judge held a hearing on the complaint for contempt, by which time the department had at last amended the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>ISP to provide for one-to-one care and a private room, the plaintiff had been moved to a private room, and while one-to-one care had not actually commenced, it \u201c[had] very recently been arranged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">At the June hearing, the judge discussed with the parties a date for scheduling a trial on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for contempt. She requested that plaintiff\u2019s counsel inform her whether the trial would consist solely of the claim for damages, in light of the fact that the department was, in the words of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, \u201c[c]lose to being\u201d in compliance with the judge\u2019s March 29 order, and likely would be fully in compliance by the time of trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">On September 6 and 8, 2000, the judge held hearings limited to the issue of contempt damages.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The department claimed that it was not in contempt of any \u201corder.\u201d The department\u2019s ISP service coordinator for the plaintiff testified.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The judge said she would order a transcript of the March 29 hearing in time for the September 8 hearing. The judge received only three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>pages of the March 29 transcript in time for the September 8 hearing,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> at which the ISP service coordinator again testified. She confirmed that she was the author of an electronic mail message sent to an attorney in the department after the March 29 hearing, informing the attorney that \u201cthe deadline for providing one-to-one services for [the plaintiff was] April 30.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">On December 1, 2000, the judge entered a written order on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for injunctive relief and his complaint for contempt. She dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s request for injunctive relief as moot. She awarded the plaintiff $215,965.80 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> She held the department in contempt, and awarded damages to the plaintiff in the amount of $10,837.68.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">As to the request for attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>the judge concluded that the plaintiff was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d entitled to fees based on the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d because \u201cthe plaintiff vindicated his rights without obtaining court-ordered relief\u201d and \u201cthe change in the legal relationship between [the department and the plaintiff] was the product of pressures exerted by the present lawsuit.\u201d See <em>Nadeau </em>v. <em>Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 279 (1st Cir. 1978) (\u201cwhen plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit acts as a \u2018catalyst\u2019 in prompting defendants to take action to meet plaintiff\u2019s claims, attorney\u2019s fees are justified despite the lack of judicial involvement in the result\u201d). The department appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">On May 29, 2001, the Supreme Court decided <em>Buckhannon. </em>On December 31, 2001, the department moved for reconsideration of the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff, relying on the holding in that case. After initially declining to rule on the motion because the parties had filed notices of appeal,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> on March 18, 2002, the judge vacated her award of attorney\u2019s fees stating: \u201cBased on the clear language of the [Buckhannon] decision, the legal basis for an award of attorney\u2019s fees no longer exists.\u201d The plaintiff amended his notice of appeal to include an appeal from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">2. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>We consider first the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judge\u2019s order vacating the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. In <em>Buckhannon, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that for a party to be considered a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under Federal fee-shifting statutes there must be a \u201cmaterial alteration of the legal relationship of the parties,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 604, quoting <em>Texas State Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>489 U.S. 782, 792 (1989), and there must be a \u201cjudicial imprimatur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>on the change,\u201d <em>Buckhannon, supra </em>at 605. The Court rejected the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d then used by most Circuit Courts of the United States Court of Appeals. <em>Id. </em>See, e.g., <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>Southern Berkshire Regional Sch. Dist., </em>197 F.3d 574, 577 &amp; n.2 (1st Cir. 1999); <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of Cleveland City Schs., </em>88 F.3d 392, 397-398 (6th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The plaintiff now insists that, even under <em>Buckhannon, </em>he is a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d He focuses on the \u201cjudicial imprimatur\u201d aspect of the <em>Buckhannon </em>ruling and points to (1) specific statements made by the judge during the February 10 and 17 and March 29, 2000, hearings on his posttrial motion for injunctive relief, and (2) the judge\u2019s finding that he is a class member under <em>Ricci. </em>See note 11, <em>supra</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">We review the judge\u2019s decision that the plaintiff is not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d de nova. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Pub. Sch., </em>401 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2005). Accord <em>Roberson </em>v. <em>Giuliani, </em>346 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir. 2003); <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>Rivero, </em>282 F.3d 268, 274 (4th Cir. 2002). Contrast <em>New England Regional Council of Carpenters </em>v. <em>Kinton, </em>284 F.3d 9, 30 (1st Cir. 2002) (reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>denial of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion where judge construed his own oral order). For the reasons we now explain, we affirm the judge\u2019s decision to vacate the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We consider first the \u201cjudicial imprimatur\u201d requirement of <em>Buckhannon. </em>The Supreme Court stated that a \u201cdefendant\u2019s voluntary change in conduct, although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur.\u201d <em>Buckhannon, supra </em>at 605. The Court then noted that it had \u201conly awarded attorney\u2019s fees where the plaintiff has received a judgment on the merits . . . or obtained a court-ordered consent decree.\u201d <em>Id., </em>and cases cited. It further noted that attorney\u2019s fees had previously not been awarded by the Court where the plaintiff had \u201csecured the reversal of a directed verdict ... or acquired a judicial pronouncement that the defendant has violated the Constitution unaccompanied by \u2018judicial relief\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 605-606. In the wake of <em>Buckhannon, </em>there has been some disagreement among Circuit Courts of the United States Court of Appeals whether a judgment on the merits and a court-ordered consent decree are the only forms of relief that meet the \u201cjudicial imprimatur\u201d requirement of <em>Buckhannon, </em>or whether these are merely examples of the types of relief that can confer prevailing party status. See, e.g., <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Pub. Schs., supra </em>at 23 (noting disagreement between Eighth Circuit\u2019s narrow reading and more expansive reading of Second, Fourth, and Seventh Circuits). Whatever the ultimate resolution of that question, no court has concluded that oral statements by a judge, sometimes couched in hortatory rather than directive terms, and not reduced to writing, are sufficient to satisfy the requirement of a \u201cjudicial imprimatur.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> To the extent a claim similar to the one the plaintiff makes here has been asserted, it has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>rejected. See, e.g., <em>New England Regional Council of Carpenters </em>v. <em>Kinton, supra </em>(judge\u2019s statements in \u201cextended colloquy\u201d with defendant were not \u201cfunctional equivalent of a judicial order\u201d where judge entered \u201cno explicit order compelling, or even leading to\u201d change in defendant\u2019s behavior).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"><em>Buckhannon </em>does not preclude an award of attorney\u2019s fees on the basis of settlement agreements that are incorporated into a consent decree. See, e.g., <em>Carbonell </em>v. <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>429 F.3d 894, 901 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201cwhen a court incorporates the terms of a voluntary agreement into an order, that order is stamped with sufficient \u2018judicial imprimatur\u2019 for the litigant to qualify as a prevailing party\u201d); <em>Truesdell </em>v. <em>Philadelphia Hous. Auth., </em>290 F.3d 159, 165 (3d Cir. 2002) (order incorporating terms of settlement reached during preliminary injunction hearing is \u201cproper vehicle for rendering one side a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 \u201d). See also <em>Rice Servs., Ltd. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 F.3d 1017, 1025-1026 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (same); <em>T.D. </em>v. <em>LaGrange Sch. Dist. No. 102, </em>349 F.3d 469, 478-479 (7th Cir. 2003) (same); <em>Roberson </em>v. <em>Giuliani, </em>346 F.3d 75, 81-82 (2d Cir. 2003) (same); <em>American Disability Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Chmielarz, </em>289 F.3d 1315, 1319 (11th Cir. 2002) (same); <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>Rivero, </em>282 F.3d 268, 280-282 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 825 (2002) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">There was no consent decree here. The judge resolved a dispute between the plaintiff and the department by cajoling (and sometimes ordering) the department to reach agreement with the plaintiff about the terms of the plaintiff\u2019s ISP and the services the plaintiff should and would receive. It is clear from our careful review of the February 10 and 17 hearing transcripts that the judge ordered the department to produce a new ISP for the plaintiff, but that there was no order from the judge with respect to the specific content of the ISP.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> That was the focus of the March 29 hearing. By March 29, the department had agreed in substantial measure to provide the plaintiff with a private room, had approved funding for up to twenty-five hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>of one-to-one care and supervision each week, and had incorporated the provision of one-to-one care into the plaintiff\u2019s ISP. Although the department challenged the judge\u2019s authority to order the department to provide specific services and include them in the plaintiff\u2019s ISP, by then the department\u2019s ISP service coordinator and other department officials had already agreed to the relief the plaintiff sought. The judge, therefore, saw no need to grant injunctive relief to the plaintiff. Cf. <em>Toms </em>v. <em>Taft, </em>338 F.3d 519, 528-529 (6th Cir. 2003) (although judge was involved in settlement conference, resulting settlement did not bear necessary judicial imprimatur where judge did not issue any order altering defendant\u2019s conduct and request for injunctive relief was rendered moot); <em>T.D. </em>v. <em>LaGrange Sch. Dist. No. 102, supra </em>at 478-479 (involvement in settlement negotiations, including conducting settlement conference in chambers and making certain settlement suggestions, not enough for judicial imprimatur). Contrast <em>Palmetto Props., Inc. </em>v. <em>County of DuPage, </em>375 F.3d 542, 549-551 (7th Cir. 2004) (upholding award of attorney\u2019s fees where court made substantive ruling on motion for summary judgment that ordinance was unconstitutional and county voluntarily \u201crepealed the ordinance only <em>after </em>that determination had been made and presumably <em>because of </em>it\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">This litigation was the catalyst for the department amending the plaintiff\u2019s ISP in the wake of the serious injuries he suffered in the department-sponsored group home, and for providing services to the plaintiff, in particular, the one-to-one services that the plaintiff needed. The judge\u2019s role in these hearings resulted in the department\u2019s amending the plaintiff\u2019s ISP to provide one-to-one care and a private room. The ISP was finally drafted to reflect those terms, but no settlement agreement was drafted or executed, and no order incorporating any such terms was entered. Cf. <em>John T. </em>v. <em>Delaware County Intermediate Unit, </em>318 F.3d 545, 558 (3d Cir. 2003) (settlement can confer prevailing party status where it is incorporated into court order and where it \u201c[1] contain[s] mandatory language, [2] [is] entitled \u2018Order,\u2019 [3] [bears] the signature of the . . . judge, not the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>ties\u2019 counsel, and [4] provide[s] for judicial enforcement\u201d).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> For all of these reasons we conclude that the requisite \u201cjudicial imprimatur\u201d is not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Even if the judge\u2019s statements at the February and March hearings could be construed to satisfy Buckhannon\u2019s judicial imprimatur requirement, it is doubtful that there was a \u201cmaterial alteration of the legal relationship,\u201d also required by <em>Buckhannon, supra </em>at 604. See <em>Carbonell </em>v. <em>Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>429 F.3d 894, 900 (9th Cir. 2005), quoting <em>Richard S. </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Servs. of Cal., </em>317 F.3d 1080, 1087 (9th Cir. 2003) (stipulation for stay of deportation materially altered legal relationship of parties \u201cbecause the defendants were required to do something directly benefitting the plaintiffi] that they otherwise would not have had to do\u201d). From the commencement of this litigation, the department has acknowledged that it has a statutory obligation to provide appropriate care for the plaintiff, and that the care must be reflected in an ISP, see notes 4 and 6, <em>supra. </em>Contrast <em>T.D. </em>v. <em>LaGrange Sch. Dist. No. 102, </em>349 F.3d 469, 480 (7th Cir. 2003) (order that school district conduct case-study evaluation to determine plaintiff\u2019s eligibility for special education services, which resulted in determination that plaintiff was eligible for such benefits, materially altered legal relationship of parties because school district had not acknowledged plaintiff\u2019s eligibility for such services prior to issuance of order). Although the continuing failure of the department to provide appropriate care in the wake of the plaintiff\u2019s serious injuries was at the heart of the plaintiff\u2019s repeated efforts to obtain injunctive relief, we find nothing in the record to the effect that the department ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>refused categorically to provide these services. Foot dragging by an agency, however inexcusable, is not refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">There is no claim that <em>Buckhannon </em>does not apply to this case; the plaintiff concedes the point.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We recognize that, throughout the litigation, counsel for the plaintiff were proceeding in good faith under then-existing law, which the judge correctly concluded permitted an award of attorney\u2019s fees based on the \u201ccatalyst theory.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Nadeau </em>v. <em>Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 279 (1st Cir. 1978). See also <em>Buckhannon, supra </em>at 626 n.4 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (collecting cases). In the future, counsel who undertake the representation of clients bringing claims under Federal statutes allowing fee shifting will be forewarned that in order to recover attorney\u2019s fees, any beneficial arrangements they secure for their clients must be reduced to a written agreement endorsed by a judge. The record in this case is replete with examples of the department and its counsel doing little, if anything, to provide in a timely manner the services to which the department ultimately agreed.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> While we are not willing to conclude that the department was \u201cbeing willfully obstructionist,\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Pub. Schs., </em>401 F.3d 16, 27 (1st Cir. 2005), the time and resources expended by plaintiff\u2019s counsel and the judge in obtaining an agreement by the department to provide essential services was greater than necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">We now address the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the judge\u2019s ruling that he is a <em>Ricci </em>class member is a sufficient basis under <em>Buckhannon </em>to confer \u201cprevailing party\u201d status on him.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> A finding of fact, unaccompanied by a conclusion of law, will usually not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>work a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties. Here, the finding by the judge that the plaintiff is a <em>Ricci </em>class member may have clarified the legal relationship between the plaintiff and the department; it did not <em>change </em>the relationship, which had been determined years earlier in the <em>Ricci </em>litigation itself.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> See note 11, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Buckhannon, supra </em>at 613-615 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\u201cprevailing party\u201d status requires \u201cjudicial finding\u201d of \u201cthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s case\u201d or \u201cof liability\u201d).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The plaintiff either is or is not a <em>Ricci </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>class member; there is no judicial imprimatur that changed the legal relationship of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">3. <em>Contempt. </em>On March 29, 2000, the judge held a hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for injunctive relief to obtain certain services from the department. On appeal, the department argues that the judge abused her discretion in later finding the department in contempt of an order the judge concluded she had issued orally at that hearing, namely, to provide one-to-one care and a private room to the plaintiff by April 30, 2000. There is no dispute that the plaintiff was not in a private room and was not receiving one-to-one services by April 30. But the hearing at which the judge ostensibly issued the order in fact contains no order on the subject. The judge\u2019s conclusion that she had issued such an order, a conclusion she reached some six months later without the benefit of the transcript of the March 29 hearing, is clearly erroneous in light of the transcript that is now before us. As a result, the judge\u2019s finding that the department was in contempt must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">To hold a party in contempt, \u201cthere must be a clear and unequivocal command and an equally clear and undoubted disobedience.\u201d <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>342 Mass. 462, 464 (1961). Oral orders may, of course, support a contempt finding. Cf. <em>Dominick </em>v. <em>Dominick, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 85, 88-89 (1984) (oral agreement read into record binding on parties). But whether in written or oral form, we determine whether a party is in contempt by looking to the precise words of the order itself. Where the order is oral, we look to the words of the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In this case, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for contempt alleged that the department had failed to comply with two orders that he claimed the judge had issued orally on March 29: (1) that the department make specific changes in the wording of the plaintiff\u2019s ISP, and (2) that certain components of that revised ISP (placement of the plaintiff in a private room and the provision of one-to-one services for approximately twenty-five hours each week) be implemented by April 30, 2000. In her December 1, 2000, memorandum and order on contempt, the judge found that, although she had ordered on March 29 that changes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>be made in the ISP document, she had not set any deadline for the making of those changes. She therefore concluded that the department could not be held in contempt on that ground. She found contempt solely on the second ground, concluding that on March 29 she had issued an oral order that services be in place by April 30 and that the department had failed to provide the services by that date. The issue, then, is not whether the judge issued some form of \u201corder\u201d at the March 29 hearing, but whether any such order included a \u201cclear and unequivocal command\u201d setting an April 30 deadline for the implementation of services.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The transcript of the March 29 hearing, which (as we have noted) was not available to the judge before she issued her ruling on contempt, contains nothing resembling an order that the department implement specific services by April 30. That date was contained in the ISP prepared by the department; the transcript reflects only the judge\u2019s inquiries as to the funding status that would make April 30 a feasible date for implementation. The department\u2019s answer to the judge was that while the ISP service coordinator had put the April 30 date in the ISP and understood that funding had been approved, the service coordinator did not know enough about the details of the funding mechanism to say for certain whether the April 30 date would in fact be met. See note 21, <em>supra. </em>Beyond this colloquy between the judge and the ISP service coordinator, the subject of the April 30 date, and the subject of the funding that would make the April 30 date achievable, did not come up again at any time throughout the remainder of the March 29 hearing. Instead, the judge turned her attention to resolving the two components of the ISP with which plaintiff\u2019s counsel remained dissatisfied: the placement of the plaintiff in a private room, and the provision of one-to-one services. After a colloquy between the judge and the department on the one hand, and the judge and the plaintiff on the other, the department confirmed that the service coordinator had agreed to amend the ISP to provide those services, the plaintiff said that this was satisfactory, and the judge expressed the view that the parties had now \u201cdealt with the ISP.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The judge next addressed how the plaintiff\u2019s pending motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>for injunctive relief should be resolved, observing that \u201cwith the current ISP, you [the plaintiff] really don\u2019t need me to do anything.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel agreed, but asked that the judge make certain findings about the plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to the rights of a <em>Ricci </em>class member and the corresponding right to services under his ISP and the regulations. The judge responded by asking plaintiff\u2019s counsel to submit to her proposed findings of fact. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then requested that his motion for injunctive relief be denied as \u201cmoot,\u201d as opposed to simply being denied. The judge agreed to do so, clarifying that the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for injunctive relief as moot was without prejudice to his request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">From this review of the transcript of the March 29 hearing, it does not appear that the judge ever ordered anything. She sidestepped the department\u2019s legal objections to her authority to issue an order modifying the ISP by indicating that she was merely \u201casking\u201d the department to do what the department had, on its own, already \u201cagreed to.\u201d To the extent there was any ambiguity in such terminology, the ultimate resolution of the hearing was that the plaintiff\u2019s request for an injunction was denied as moot. What had rendered the motion moot was the department\u2019s submission of an ISP and an agreement to make two modifications to the wording of that ISP. At most, the judge had exerted pressure on the department to prevent it from backing off its prior agreement with respect to those two modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Even if one were to interpret this transcript as ordering the department to make the two amendments to the ISP (a point we need not decide, as the department was not found in contempt of that aspect of the ostensible \u201corder\u201d),<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> the transcript contains no order that particular services be implemented by the April 30 date. As noted earlier, the transcript reflects only the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>inquiries as to the funding status that would make that date feasible. In short, the plaintiff never sought, and the judge never issued, any order that the provisions in the ISP (either the original provisions or the amended provisions) be implemented by any particular date.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The burden of proving contempt is, of course, on the plaintiff. <em>United States Time Corp. </em>v. <em>G.E.M. of Boston, Inc., </em>345 Mass. 279, 282 (1963). In the case of a disputed oral order, this makes it incumbent on the plaintiff to obtain the transcript and prove the contents of the order. Here, the judge herself recognized that she needed the transcript to determine precisely what she had and had not ordered some six months earlier: during the contempt hearing, she ordered the court reporter to prepare a transcript of the March 29 hearing for that purpose. The department cannot be penalized with contempt when it was a court reporter who flouted the judge\u2019s order for an immediate transcript. What is clear from the contempt hearing is that the department did not understand that the judge had imposed an obligation on it to provide one-to-one services and a private room for the plaintiff by April 30, 2000.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">That the department is not in contempt does not suggest that it is blameless in this affair. To the contrary, the department was under a legal obligation, even without a court order, to make good faith efforts to achieve the objectives set forth in its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ISP, and it failed to do so. And, after the department provided the ISP containing the April 30 date to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, counsel relied on that date in effectively withdrawing his request for injunctive relief. The department\u2019s failure to provide services by the date given to counsel in the ISP and at the hearing is in essence a breach of an agreement with the plaintiff. Finally, having made representations to the judge to the effect that, if funding were in place, the services would be provided by April 30, the department failed to honor that representation. These are serious forms of misconduct, but in the absence of an express court order, this misconduct cannot be elevated to a contempt of court. We therefore reverse that portion of the judge\u2019s order holding the department in contempt and awarding damages to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\"><em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>West Virginia Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Resources, </em>532 U.S. 598 (2001) <em>(Buckhannon), </em>concerned whether the plaintiffs were the \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the fee-shifting provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3601 et seq., and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 et seq.

Access to a private room was one focus of the February and March, 2000, hearings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The judge later found that, as a \u201cdirect result\u201d of the department\u2019s being served with the complaint for contempt on June 1, 2000, the plaintiff was moved to a private room on June 5, the department produced an ISP that incorporated the provision of a private room and approximately twenty-five hours of one-to-one care per week on June 13, 2000, and the plaintiff started receiving one-to-one care on June 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\">On August 10, 2000, the judge issued an order finding that the plaintiff was a member of the class of litigants entitled to lifetime services under <em>Ricci. </em>She further found that, as \u201cthe result of the proceedings in this matter,\u201d the department had provided the plaintiff with an ISP (\u201cdated February 11, 2000 as modified on March 29, 2000 and with further modification as ordered on March 29, 2000\u201d) that substantially complied with the requirements of <em>Ricci.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\">When asked whether she could \u201ctell us what the court ordered on March 29th, if anything, pertaining to one-to-one visitation and care,\u201d the ISP service coordinator responded: \u201cI think that ... the one-to-one for [the plaintiff] would be in place on April 30.\u201d Shortly thereafter, plaintiffs counsel asked the ISP service coordinator again whether she had \u201cany doubt\u201d that the judge had ordered the one-to-one services to commence by April 30. She answered: \u201cI, I\u2019m not sure if I was the one who said it could be done by April 30th or not. To be honest with you, I don\u2019t know what \u2014 I was saying, \u2018Yes, I thought it could be done by April 30th.\u2019 And I, I don\u2019t know if that was a direct order that it had to be done or if it was me saying that\u2019s when I, in all good faith, thought that we could have them in place.\u201d When plaintiff\u2019s counsel pressed her on the same point, she again responded: \u201cI don\u2019t recall if it was the [j]udge who ordered it, or if it was what we had put into the ISP and we had all agreed upon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The full transcript of the March 29, 2000, hearing was not filed with the court until June 16, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b314-9\">The plaintiff filed his motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on September 14, 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (2000) authorizes a judge, in her discretion, to award attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party in civil rights litigation. See <em>id. </em>(\u201cIn any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983] ... the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs\u201d). See also <em>Mendoza </em>v. <em>Licensing Bd. of Fall River, </em>444 Mass. 188, 209-212 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Where, as here, a plaintiff brings an action alleging both Federal constitutional claims under \u00a7 1983 and State law claims, \u201cthe plaintiff need not obtain a final, favorable determination of his constitutional claims in order to claim an attorney\u2019s fee under \u00a7 1988. It is enough that the constitutional claims are \u2018substantial,\u2019 and arise from the same nucleus of facts on which the State law claims are based.\u201d <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 317 (1982), citing <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 128 n.10, 132 n.15 (1980). The department does not contest that this standard is met by the plaintiff\u2019s claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b314-12\">The judge held the department in contempt for its failure to provide the plaintiff with one-to-one care and a private room by April 30, 2000, and awarded the plaintiff damages based on the cost of a private room from April 30 to June 4 and of one-to-one services from April 30 to June 16. With respect to the plaintiff\u2019s ISP itself, the judge found that her March 29, 2000, order did not \u201cspecify a deadline\u201d by which the department was required to amend the ISP and that her order therefore could not sustain a finding of contempt to that effect. Although the department had incorporated the private room requirement and the requirement of twenty-five hours of one-to-one care per week into the plaintiff\u2019s ISP, the judge found that the department had not used specific language \u201cagreed to by [the department]\u201d in the ISP. The judge therefore ordered the department to incorporate specific language into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s ISP within thirty days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The judge initially ruled that she was \u201cdivested of jurisdiction to act\u201d on the department\u2019s motion for reconsideration because notices of appeal had been filed. On February 19, 2002, an assistant attorney general wrote a letter to the judge arguing that the Superior Court retained jurisdiction on posttrial motions as long as the appeal had not yet been docketed in the Appeals Court. See <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Beverly Hosp. Corp., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 913, 915 n.5 (1999); <em>Springfield Redevelopment Auth. </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 432, 435 (1998). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Montgomery, 53 Mass. App. Ct. 350, 351 n.2 (2001). Thereafter, on March 18, 2002, the judge treated this letter as a motion for reconsideration and issued her ruling on the department\u2019s motion because the appeal had not yet been entered in the Appeals Court. The appeal was entered in the Appeals Court on March 31, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The plaintiff also argues that the pretrial December, 1995, \u201cnotice of docket entry\u201d and March 1, 1996, order denying his request for a preliminary injunction, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>are the \u201cfunctional equivalent of a consent decree\u201d and, therefore, conferred \u201cprevailing party\u201d status on him at that time. This claim is raised for the first time on appeal and is therefore waived. See, e.g., <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Collector of Taxes of Worcester, </em>385 Mass. 335, 338 n.5 (1982), and cases cited. We have reviewed the transcript of the hearing on the motion for attorney\u2019s fees and are satisfied the plaintiff did not argue that the 1995 and 1996 actions were the bases of his request for attorney\u2019s fees. We have not been provided with copies of any of the plaintiff\u2019s memoranda in support of his motion for attorney\u2019s fees. On the record before us, we agree with the department that the plaintiff has not previously raised this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The plaintiff further argues that because the judge ordered the department to amend his ISP within thirty days of her December 1, 2000, memorandum and order, see note 25, <em>supra, </em>he is a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d The order was not clear \u2014 the judge initially ordered the department to amend the ISP within twenty days of the entry of her decision, and later in the same order changed that to thirty days. Moreover, according to the judge\u2019s findings, the department had already incorporated the private room and one-to-one care requirements into the plaintiff\u2019s ISP; the department had simply not used \u201cthe specific language agreed to by [the department] and ordered by this Court.\u201d We conclude that the December 1, 2000, order did not result in a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.

There, unlike this case, the action by the judge in the Federal District Court took the form of a written order in which the judge \u201cordered\u201d the defendants to prepare the SEIS, as described in the decision, and \u201cto comply\u201d with a series of written requirements. See <em>Preservation Coalition of Erie County </em>v. <em>Federal Transit Admin., </em>129 F. Supp. 2d 551, 577 (W.D.N.Y. 2000).

At an early stage of the <em>Ricci </em>proceedings, the judge stated that \u201ca \u2018class member\u2019 is defined as any person residing at or on the residential rolls of one of the [State] institutions ... on or after the following dates: Belchertown, 2/2/72.\u201d <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>646 F. Supp. 378, 380 n.2 (D. Mass. 1986). The record reveals that the plaintiff resided in the State institution at Belchertown until May 8, 1967, and was therefore not a class member under this formulation. The 1993 <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Okin </em>decision, however, also defined class membership to include \u201cthe individuals who have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>been identified in the Class Member Identification List issued as of April 30, 1993, regardless of their current place of residence.\u201d <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Okin, </em>823 F. Supp. 984, 986 n.1 (D. Mass. 1993). The plaintiff claims he was identified in the class member identification list because his file with the department includes a \u201clegal notice\u201d informing him that he is a plaintiff class member in <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Okin, supra, </em>and that he is entitled to rights and services guaranteed by the 1993 order in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">It does not appear that the judge had before her evidence that the plaintiff resided in the Belchertown State institution only until 1967. That evidence was presented to a different judge in 1995. See note 8, <em>supra. </em>She did, however, have a copy of the \u201clegal notice\u201d naming the plaintiff as a <em>Ricci </em>class member. A copy of the class member identification list does not appear in the record. In light of the conflicting evidence we cannot conclude that the judge\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\">As required by <em>Ricci </em>and the department\u2019s current regulations, if the plaintiff\u2019s name appears on the class member identification list, he qualifies for \u201cspecial eligibility\u201d for the department\u2019s services. See 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.05(1) (2003). \u201cSpecial eligibility\u201d entitles clients to the same services as clients with \u201cgeneral eligibility,\u201d with two exceptions. First, persons with \u201cspecial eligibility\u201d are entitled to \u201cthe least restrictive, most typical, appropriate residential environment, together with the most appropriate treatment, training and support services suited to that person\u2019s individual needs.\u201d <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Okin, supra </em>at 987 n.2. See 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.05(2)(e) (2003). Second, persons with \u201cspecial eligibility\u201d receive priority if the department lacks resources to provide services to all of its clients. See 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.07(l)(a) (2003) (\u201cExcept as to individuals who have special eligibility pursuant to 115 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 6.05, all supports, including assessments, planning and development and implementation of Individual Service Plans, are subject to the availability of resources\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s reliance on cases outside the <em>Buckhannon </em>context is inapposite. See <em>Sumner </em>v. <em>Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 549 (1981) (in habeas corpus context, requirement imposed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 52 on Federal District Court following bench trial to \u201cfind the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon\u201d \u201cundoubtedly makes a judge more aware that it is his own imprimatur that is placed on the findings of fact and conclusions of law\u201d); <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Garvey, </em>298 F.3d 1184, 1192 (10th Cir. 2002) (describing findings of facts by judges as having \u201cimprimatur that has been stamped upon them by the judicial system\u201d that leads juries to give disproportionate weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>to such findings of fact if admitted in evidence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The department apparently did understand that some order had issued because it moved for reconsideration of the March 29 \u201corder.\u201d The department\u2019s motion addressed the judge\u2019s ostensible order that the department amend the ISP to include provision of a private room and one-to-one services for the plaintiff, but made no reference to the judge\u2019s having ordered a particular implementation date. Just as the record contains no order that services be implemented by April 30, it contains no admission from the department that the order included such a term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The plaintiff points to the ISP service coordinator\u2019s electronic mail message (e-mail) as evidence that the department understood that the judge had entered that order. In her testimony at the contempt hearing, the ISP service coordinator confirmed that the first sentence of the e-mail in question reflects that \u201c[t]he start date [the ISP service coordinator] gave the [c]curt was April 30th.\u201d That is an accurate reflection of what is contained in the transcript of the March 29 hearing, where the coordinator indicated to the judge that she had put the April 30 date in the ISP and explained her expectation, but not certainty, that the funding would be in place by that time. In another question posed to the ISP service coordinator at the contempt hearing, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, referring to the same e-mail, asked her if it reflected that she, the service coordinator, gave \u201cthe deadline for providing services to [the plaintiff] as April 30th.\u201d She answered in the affirmative. This does not, by itself, indicate that any \u201cdeadline\u201d was imposed by the judge. The e-mail establishes nothing more than what the transcript of the March 29 hearing establishes, i.e., that the ISP service coordinator made certain representations to the judge at the March 29 hearing about the April 30 date that was already set in the ISP.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
