(City Fuel) by National Fire Insurance Company of Hartford (National Fire). The policy covered City Fuel\u2019s oil delivery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>trucks. The indorsement provided coverage for damages arising out of the release of pollutants \u201c[b]eing transported\u201d by such trucks, or \u201c[o]therwise in the course of transit by or on behalf\u201d of City Fuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">A controversy arose when approximately one hundred gallons of oil leaked from the tank of one of the delivery trucks while it was parked overnight. Coverage was denied by National Fire under a pollution exclusion clause in the policy for the release of pollutants \u201c[b]eing stored . . . upon the covered auto.\u201d City Fuel then brought the present action. The facts not being in dispute, a judge in the Superior Court granted summary judgment for National Fire on City Fuel\u2019s claims for declaratory relief and for damages under G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> City Fuel appealed and we granted its application for direct appellate review. We reverse the judgment for declaratory relief and direct entry of judgment for City Fuel. We affirm summary judgment for National Fire on the G. L. c. 93A claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cAn insurance policy . . . is to be construed with reference to the customs of the trade or course of business respecting which it is issued. The insurer is charged with notice of such practices and his liability is to be determined in that light.\u201d <em>Koshland </em>v. <em>Columbia Ins. Co, </em>237 Mass. 467, 472 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">City Fuel is in the business of delivering oil to residential customers on a retail basis. It purchases the oil from Sprague Energy Corp. The oil is transferred to City Fuel\u2019s delivery trucks at Sprague Energy\u2019s terminal (terminal). Once loaded, the trucks deliver the oil to City Fuel\u2019s customers pursuant to a computer-generated list that estimates when those customers will need oil and in what amounts. During the course of the day, the trucks may return to the terminal to be refilled with oil as needed to continue making deliveries. At the end of each business day, the trucks return to the terminal, where they park overnight. If a truck has any undelivered oil in its tank, the oil remains there until it is delivered to customers on the following business day. The question we must answer is whether the insurance policy, properly interpreted, covered the release of oil from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>a City Fuel truck while it was parked overnight between deliveries.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law. <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 142, 146 (1982). When interpreting insurance policies, courts are guided by several principles. Like all contracts, an insurance policy is to be construed according to the fair and reasonable meaning of its words. <em>Id. </em>Exclusionary clauses must be strictly construed against the insurer so as not to defeat any intended coverage or diminish the protection purchased by the insured. See <em>Vappi &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>348 Mass. 427, 431-432 (1965). Doubts created by any ambiguous words or provisions are to be resolved against the insurer. <em>August A. Busch &amp; Co. of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>339 Mass. 239, 243 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The policy contained a general exclusion for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the release of pollutants. In relevant part, coverage was excluded for the release of \u201cpollutants . . . [tjhat are, or that are contained in any property that is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">\u201c(1) Being transported or towed by, handled, or handled for movement into, onto or from, the covered \u2018auto\u2019;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">\u201c(2) Otherwise in the course of transit by or on behalf of the \u2018insured\u2019; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">\u201c(3) Being stored, disposed of, treated or processed in or upon the covered \u2018auto\u2019 . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">City Fuel purchased a \u201cBroadened Coverage Endorsement\u201d to cover the release of pollutants that might occur in the circumstances described in the first two of the excluded categories, i.e., while the pollutant (oil) was \u201c[bjeing transported\u201d in its trucks (or being loaded onto or off of them), or while it was \u201c[ojtherwise in the course of transit by\u201d City Fuel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">We turn first to the language of the indorsement, which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>find to be dispositive. In particular, we consider the meaning of the terms \u201ctransit\u201d and \u201ctransported.\u201d In <em>Koshland </em>v. <em>Columbia Ins. Co., supra, </em>this court was faced with determining whether an insurance policy that insured a merchant against the loss of his wool while \u201cactually in transit\u201d or in the course of \u201ctransportation\u201d covered a loss caused by the flooding of a warehouse where the wool had remained for eight months waiting to be processed before being shipped from the west coast to Boston. In its decision, the court noted that the \u201cnatural meaning of the words \u2018transit\u2019 and \u2018transportation\u2019 as applied to wool <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>is that it shall be in the course of movement by some kind of carriage from one place to another,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 472, and that \u201c [transportation implies the taking up of persons or property at some point and putting them down at another.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Gloucester Ferry Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>114 U.S. 196, 203 (1885). The court also noted that \u201cdelays commonly incident to a movement of merchandise . . . would not ordinarily be thought to suspend transportation or transit.\u201d <em>Koshland </em>v. <em>Columbia Ins. Co., supra </em>at 472-473. Although the court went on to discuss how the terms \u201ctransit\u201d and \u201ctransportation\u201d had been broadened beyond their \u201cnatural meaning\u201d in various contexts involving the shipment of goods,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it concluded that it need not consider those broadened definitions because the policy\u2019s inclusion of the wording \u201cactually in transit\u201d conveyed the \u201cnatural\u201d significance of the word \u201ctransit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476. The court therefore found that the policy only insured the wool while in \u201cphysical portage,\u201d not while awaiting processing before commencing such portage, but that the wool would \u201cof course be protected under the policy during . . . ordinary delays and transshipments incident to such movement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-19\">Consistent with this analysis, and in the context of the policy before us, we conclude that the oil was \u201cin the course of transit,\u201d within the meaning of the indorsement, once it had been picked up for delivery and had begun to travel to its destination, and that it remained in transit until it was delivered to City Fuel\u2019s customers, even though there may have been ordinary delays and stoppages along the way. The fact that the trucks into which the oil was loaded normally traveled only during business hours, or might stop for periods of time during those hours to make other deliveries or to provide relief to the drivers, does not alter the status of the oil as being \u201cin the course of transit.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-31\">This interpretation of the indorsement is consistent with what \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>an \u201cobjectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.\u201d <em>Hakim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers\u2019 Insolvency Fund, </em>424 Mass. 275, 283 (1997), quoting <em>Trustees of Tufts Univ. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>415 Mass. 844, 849 (1993). As noted above, City Fuel is in the business of delivering oil to residential customers. In purchasing an indorsement that covers the oil it delivers <em>both </em>while it is \u201c[b]eing transported\u201d and, more broadly, while it is \u201c[ojtherwise in the course of transit by\u201d the insured, an objective purchaser in City Fuel\u2019s position would reasonably believe that a release of the oil would be covered from the time the oil is loaded onto its trucks until the time it is delivered to the customer, at least in the ordinary course.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">This interpretation of the policy is also consistent with the strict construction we normally afford exclusionary clauses, particularly where there is any ambiguity. In the context of the trade or course of the delivery business being insured, and in light of the wording of the indorsement discussed above, it would be unreasonable to interpret the words \u201c[bjeing stored,\u201d as used in the exclusion clause of the policy, to apply to those periods when the truck transporting the oil was parked, and interpreting the indorsement language to apply only when the truck was moving. We decline to do so, and order the entry of summary judgment for City Fuel on its claim for declaratory relief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">We do, however, affirm the judge\u2019s decision granting sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>mary judgment on the G. L. c. 93A claim to National Fire. That claim fails because the interpretation of the policy\u2019s language is an issue of first impression, and we find that National Fire\u2019s position was reasonable. See <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>414 Mass. 747, 763 (1993) (even if coverage found to exist, insurer not liable under G. L. c. 93A if its position was reasonable, particularly where little or no legal precedent exists on the issue).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The G.

Meintzer &amp; Sons vs. Nationwide Mut. Ins., Civ. A. No. HAR91-353 (D. Md. Jan. 14, 1992). This reliance is misplaced. City Fuel purchased broadened coverage under the \u201cPollution Liability \u2014 Broadened Coverage for Covered Autos \u2014 Business Auto and Truckers Forms \u2014 Massachusetts\u201d indorsement. The insurance policy at issue in the Meintzer case contained a pollution exclusion, but no indorsement. The Meintzer case focuses on an exception to the exclusion having nothing to do with the interpretation of the terms \u201c[o]therwise in the course of transit\u201d or \u201c[b]eing transported,\u201d which is dispositive in this case. Additionally, \u201cMaryland does not follow the rule, adopted in many jurisdictions, that an insurance policy is to be construed most strongly against the insurer.\u2019 . . .
