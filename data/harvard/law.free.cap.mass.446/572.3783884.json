L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, which states that \u201c[a] person shall have the right to be free from sexual harassment, as defined in\u201d G. L. c. 151B and c. 151C, applies to volunteers. The plaintiff, a volunteer, brought an action alleging sexual harassment by a former coworker. A judge in the Superior Court granted summary judgment for the defendant because the alleged conduct did not occur in an employment or academic context. The Appeals Court determined that G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, creates a cause of action for volunteers and reversed the order. <em>Lowery </em>v. <em>Klemm, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 307 (2005). We granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review, and we hold that G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, does not apply to volunteers, although volunteers retain their common-law rights regarding sexual harassment. We therefore affirm the order of summary judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991), citing Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The plaintiff volunteered her time at a \u201cswap shop,\u201d operated by the town of Falmouth (town) at its waste management facility. The defendant worked as the gatekeeper and land supervisor at the same facility. He frequently visited the shop and made sexual advances toward the plaintiff for three years, despite her repeated requests that he leave her alone. The town ultimately terminated the plaintiff\u2019s volunteer services and issued a no-trespass order, barring her from the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The plaintiff filed a one-count complaint in the Superior Court, alleging that the defendant had harassed her sexually in violation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim on which relief could be based because she was not an employee. The judge granted summary judgment for the defendant, reasoning that G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, incorporates definitions of \u201csexual harassment\u201d from G. L. c. 15IB and c. 151C, which require that the conduct occur in an employment or academic environment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The Appeals Court, however, concluded that G. L. c. 214, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\u00a7 1C, applies to volunteers and reversed the order. <em>Lowery </em>v. <em>Klemm, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 307, 308 (2005). The court discerned \u201ca legislative intent comprehensively and broadly to reach sexual harassment wherever occurring, including in nontraditional employment structures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312. The court further noted that the statute\u2019s broad language, which grants \u201c[a]ll \u2018persons\u2019 \u201d the right to be free from sexual harassment, and its codification in G. L. c. 214, which confers equity jurisdiction, suggest a statutory reach broad enough to encompass volunteers. <em>Id. </em>at 313-314. Finally, as a matter of public policy, the Appeals Court observed that an interpretation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, that did not protect volunteers would create unfair and absurd results: volunteer workers could be subject to the same sexual harassment as paid employees, but would lack the statutory remedies afforded them. <em>Id. </em>at 314-315.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In 1986, the Legislature passed \u201cAn Act prohibiting sexual harassment,\u201d St. 1986, c. 588, which added a definition of sexual harassment to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (18), and declared it an \u201cunlawful practice\u201d for an employer or its agents \u201cto sexually harass any employee,\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16A). See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. 551, 553 (1996) (discussing enactment of St. 1986, c. 588). It also amended G. L. c. 151C to include a definition of sexual harassment, see G. L. c. 151C, \u00a7 1 <em>(e), </em>and made it \u201can unfair educational practice . . . [t]o sexually harass students in any program or course of study in any educational institution,\u201d G. L. c. 151C, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>\u00a7 2 <em>(g). </em>In addition, this legislation created G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, which provides that \u201c[a] person shall have the right to be free from sexual harassment, as defined in\u201d G. L. c. 151B and c. 151C, and grants the Superior Court jurisdiction to adjudicate such claims. See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., supra </em>at 553, 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">General Laws c. 15 IB provides a remedy for sexual harassment involving employers with six or more employees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Lowinger, </em>422 Mass. 570, 572 (1996). <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., supra </em>at 559. Plaintiffs alleging sexual harassment in this environment must comply with the procedural requirements of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, by filing a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) within the statutory time limit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the \u201cbroad exclusivity provision\u201d of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, precludes plaintiffs from \u201crecasting\u201d their claims of sexual harassment as common-law claims or violations of other statutes, it permits recovery of actual and punitive damages (as well as reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs). See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., supra </em>at 555 (employee\u2019s statutory claims alleging violations of civil rights act and equal rights act, and common-law claims for negligence, breach of contract, and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, barred by exclusivity provisions of G. L. c. 151B and workers\u2019 compensation act). See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Purity Supreme, Inc., </em>422 Mass. 563, 565-567 (1996) (employee\u2019s common-law claims for negligence, assault and battery, and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress barred by exclusivity provision of workers\u2019 compensation act; statutory claims barred by exclusivity provision of G. L. c. 15 IB).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">General Laws c. 214, \u00a7 1C, supplements G. L. c. 15 IB by ensuring \u201cthat <em>all </em>employees are protected against sexual harass<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>ment in the workplace, whether or not their employers fit within the definition in c. 151B\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., supra </em>at 557. General Laws c. 214, \u00a7 1C, thus extends statutory protection from sexual harassment to employees of employers with fewer than six workers. <em>Id. </em>Like G. L. c. 151B, when G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, applies to a claim of sexual harassment, it is the exclusive remedy: plaintiffs may not proceed with other statutory or common-law actions for sexual harassment. See <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Lowinger, supra </em>at 572 (\u201cJust as G. L. c. 15 IB provides an exclusive remedy for sexual harassment claims against employers with six or more employees, G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, provides the exclusive remedy for such claims against employers of fewer than six employees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The defendant contends that G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, incorporates the entire definition of sexual harassment contained in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (18), and G. L. c. 151C, \u00a7 1 (e), and that it therefore provides statutory protection only from sexual harassment that affects a person\u2019s employment or education. The defendant emphasizes that victims of sexual harassment in other contexts are not without remedy: unlike employees and students, they may pursue common-law claims against alleged offenders. The plaintiff, however, urges us to adopt an interpretation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, that is not limited to employment and academic settings, because it grants the right to be free from sexual harassment to \u201ca person,\u201d not \u201can employee\u201d or \u201ca student.\u201d The plaintiff claims that the Legislature intended to incorporate into G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, only the part of the definition of sexual harassment that appears in both G. L. c. 15 IB and c. 151C: \u201cThe term \u2018sexual harassment\u2019 shall mean sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature,\u201d without any reference to an employment or academic environment. The plaintiff further argues that the Legislature already has addressed the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace and academia, and that limiting the scope of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, to those environments would, leave it \u201centirely duplicative\u201d of G. L. c. 151B and c. 151C.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">\u201cThe general and familiar rule is that a statute must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). \u201c[T]he primary source of insight into the intent of the Legislature is the language of the statute.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 853 (1983). We therefore begin with the plain language of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C: \u201cA person shall have the right to be free from sexual harassment, as defined in chapter[s 151B and 151C].\u201d Although we agree with the plaintiff that \u201cperson\u201d is a broad term, the definitions of sexual harassment in G. L. c. 15 IB and c. 151C, expressly incorporated into G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, limit the reach of that statute: these provisions define as \u201csexual harassment\u201d only conduct that affects \u201ca term or condition of employment\u201d or serves as \u201ca basis for employment decisions,\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (18) <em>(a); </em>creates \u201can intimidating, hostile, humiliating or sexually offensive work environment,\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (18) <em>(b); </em>functions as \u201ca basis for the evaluation of academic achievement\u201d or otherwise affects academic placement or privileges, G. L. c. 151C, \u00a7 1 <em>(e) </em>(i); or creates \u201can intimidating, hostile, humiliating or sexually offensive educational environment,\u201d G. L. c. 151C, \u00a7 1 <em>(e) </em>(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">A statute must be interpreted to give effect \u201cto all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous.\u201d <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 136, 140 (1998), quoting 2A B. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.06 (5th ed. 1992). The plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, would require us to ignore much of the definition of \u201csexual harassment\u201d provided in G. L. c. 151B and c. 151C. We agree with the defendant that, had the Legislature intended to incorporate only part of these definitions, it would have done so explicitly. Cf. <em>Vicarelli </em>v. <em>Business </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number><em>Int\u2019l, Inc., 913 </em>F. Supp. 241, 245 (D. Mass. 1997) (\u201cThe Legislature could have provided a broader definition for sexual harassment in [G. L. c.] 214, \u00a7 1C, or it could have enacted provisions that would have explicitly protected [volunteers] from sexual harassment\u201d). We accordingly construe G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, to incorporate the complete definitions of \u201csexual harassment\u201d found in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (18), and G. L. c. 151C, \u00a7 1 <em>(e), </em>which limit statutory protection to conduct occurring in the employment and academic contexts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s contention, our interpretation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, does not render that statute duplicative of G. L. c. 151B and c. 151C. General Laws c. 214, \u00a7 1C, fills a gap in the statutory scheme by creating a cause of action for sexual harassment for employees who are not protected by G. L. c. 151B. <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Lowinger, </em>422 Mass. 570, 572-573 (1996). It also \u201cprovides exclusive jurisdiction in the Superior Court for any sexual harassment claim that is brought in the courts because ... the employer is not covered by c. 151B.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. 551, 557 (1996). In addition, the statute gives students who are sexually harassed in violation of G. L. c. 151C, \u00a7 2 <em>(g), </em>access to the remedial provisions of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9. See <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Northern Essex Community College, </em>56 Mass App. Ct. 784, 786 n.6 (2002). General Laws c. 214, \u00a7 1C, thus extends to employees and students protection that is not otherwise available under G. L. c. 151B and c. 151C; it does not duplicate the relief provided by those statutes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Moreover, we will not adopt a construction of a statute that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>creates \u201cabsurd or unreasonable\u201d consequences. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982). The plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, would result in a statutory scheme that gives volunteers greater rights than employees. The workers\u2019 compensation statute, G. L. c. 152, precludes employees from bringing common-law actions for personal injuries, including emotional harm, arising \u201cout of and in the course of. . . employment.\u201d See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>381 Mass. 545, 548-550 (1980), quoting G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While the exclusivity provisions of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, and G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, prohibit plaintiffs from framing sexual harassment as a violation of another statute, or as a common-law claim, the workers\u2019 compensation statute bars employees\u2019 claims for other injuries related to workplace sexual harassment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Purity Supreme, Inc., </em>422 Mass. 563 (1996); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., supra </em>at 558 (\u201ccommon law claims not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>barred by c. 151B, notably the claims for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, are barred by the exclusivity provision of the workers\u2019 compensation act\u201d). Because the workers\u2019 compensation statute does not apply to volunteers, however, their common-law claims relating to sexual harassment are not similarly barred. See <em>Vicarelli </em>v. <em>Business Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>973 F. Supp. 241, 245-246 (D. Mass. 1997) (granting motion to dismiss sexual harassment claim under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, because statute does not apply to independent contractors, but denying motion to dismiss claims for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress). If we were to conclude that G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, covered volunteers, then volunteers could pursue common-law claims for injuries related to sexual harassment as well as claims under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, whereas employees would be limited to statutory claims under G. L. c. 151B or G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C. The plaintiff does not argue that the Legislature intended to give volunteers more rights and remedies than employees, and we see nothing in the statute itself, its legislative history, or our cases to support such an outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The plaintiffs proposed interpretation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, also would have the peculiar effect of making it more difficult for employees to prove sexual harassment than nonemployees. An employee alleging sexual harassment would be required to demonstrate that (1) a defendant made sexual advances, requested sexual favors, or engaged in other conduct of a sexual nature; and that (2) the employee\u2019s submission to this conduct was a term of employment or the basis of employment decisions; or that (3) this conduct created a hostile work environment. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (18). If only the first part of the definition of sexual harassment contained in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (18), is incorporated into G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, however, nonemployees like the plaintiff would have to prove merely that the defendant made sexual advances, requested sexual favors, or engaged in other conduct of a sexual nature to establish their claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Given the emphasis on the problem of workplace sexual harassment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>the over-all statutory scheme, we do not believe that the Legislature intended to make it more difficult for employees \u2014 one of the groups singled out for protection when the statutory prohibition on sexual harassment was first enacted \u2014 to bring such claims. See <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Lowinger, supra </em>at 573; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., supra </em>at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Finally, we emphasize that volunteers, like the plaintiff, who experience sexual harassment are not without recourse: although not protected by G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, they may bring actions under other statutes, including the civil rights act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, as well as common-law claims for sexual harassment or related injuries that would be barred for employees by the exclusivity provisions of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9; G. L. c. 214C, \u00a7 1C; and the workers\u2019 compensation statute. Because volunteers retain these common-law rights and remedies, our decision today does not leave employers free to sexually harass volunteers with impunity. It may be, as the Appeals Court noted, that volunteers do not enjoy protection as extensive as that granted to students and employees. See <em>Lowery </em>v. <em>Klemm, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 307, 314-315 &amp; n.7 (2005) (noting that G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, and G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, \u201cprovide greater protections and grant a broader array of remedies and tools for enforcement than are available at common law\u201d). However, this reflects a legislative policy judgment, and \u201c[tjhat public policy is entitled to deference .... Whether a statute is wise or effective is not within the province of courts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leno, </em>415 Mass. 835, 841 (1993), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lammi, </em>386 Mass. 299, 300 (1982). The Legislature may have considered that employees, who generally depend on their jobs for their livelihood, need greater protection from sexual harassment than volunteers, who are uncompensated and therefore more free to leave an uncomfortable workplace environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the Superior Court judge\u2019s ruling that G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, applies only in the employment and academic contexts, and does not provide a statutory cause of action to volunteers. \u201cAn order granting or denying summary judgment will be upheld if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>trial judge ruled on undisputed material facts and his ruling was correct as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass. 534, 536 (1992), citing <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, 369 </em>Mass. 550, 556 (1976). Because we conclude that the judge ruled correctly as a matter of law, and no disputed issue of material fact exists, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">General Laws c. 214, \u00a7 1C, provides: \u201cA person shall have the right to be free from sexual harassment, as defined in chapter[s 151B and 151C].

However, even if the plaintiff had advanced such an argument, we still would affirm the decision of the Superior Court, for the reasons explained above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Although his decision is not binding on this court, a Federal trial judge reached a similar conclusion concerning the scope of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C. See <em>Vicarelli </em>v. <em>Business Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>973 F. Supp. 241, 245 (D. Mass. 1997). He reasoned, as we do today, that the Legislature\u2019s incorporation of the definitions of sexual harassment in G. L. c. 151B and c. 151C \u201cstrongly suggests an intention to restrict the meaning of the term \u2018person\u2019 in [G. L. c.] 214, \u00a7 1C to a \u2018person\u2019 either in the employment context or a person in the educational context,\u201d and ultimately concluded that the statute would not apply to independent contractors because they are \u201coutside the traditional employer-employee framework.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\">We also reject the plaintiff\u2019s argument that incorporating the complete definitions of \u201csexual harassment\u201d from G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (18), and G. L. c. 151C, \u00a7 1 (&lt;?), would require a plaintiff to satisfy both definitions simultaneously, by demonstrating that the alleged conduct affected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>petitioner\u2019s employment <em>and </em>education. Nothing in the statutory language suggests that conduct must occur in both environments at the same time to be actionable as sexual harassment, and we have never interpreted the statute in such a manner. See <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Lowinger, </em>422 Mass. 570, 572 (1996) (noting that G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, \u201cpermits employees\u201d to bring suit for \u201csexual harassment in employment,\u201d without mentioning any requirement of an academic nexus). General Laws c. 214, \u00a7 1C, simply provides two alternative definitions of sexual harassment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b597-11\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 24, the exclusivity provision of the workers\u2019 compensation statute, provides in relevant part: \u201cAn employee shall be held to have waived his right of action at common law or under the law of any other jurisdiction in respect to an injury that is compensable under this chapter, to recover damages for personal injuries, if he shall not have given his employer, at the time of his contract of hire, written notice that he claimed such right. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 26, explains when injuries are compensable: \u201cIf an employee who has not given notice of his claims of common law rights of action under section twenty-four . . . receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment ... he shall be paid compensation by the insurer or self-insurer, as hereinafter provided . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b597-13\">The definition of \u201cemployer\u201d in G. L. c. 152, unlike the definition in c. 151B, is not limited to those with six or more employees. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (5) (defining \u201c[ejmployer\u201d as \u201can individual, partnership, association, corporation, or other legal entity . . . employing employees subject to this chapter\u201d); G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4) (defining \u201c[ejmployee\u201d as \u201cevery person in the service of another under any contract of hire\u201d with certain exceptions not relevant here). Thus, the workers\u2019 compensation statute prevents any employee from pursuing claims for injuries related to workplace sexual harassment, whether actionable under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, or G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s interpretation thus would have the unreasonable or absurd result of making all sexual advances actionable as sexual harassment, regardless of the circumstances or the effect of the conduct. We agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>defendant that this broad construction would be unworkable and inconsistent with legislative intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Although we affirm the order of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that this appeal is frivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
