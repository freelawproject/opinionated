L. c. 231, \u00a7 111, second par., and Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, as amended, 423 Mass. 1410 (1996), a judge in the Superior Court reported to the Appeals Court the correctness of her ruling denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for trial, as well as six questions pertaining to proceedings under the \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d (SDP) commitment statute, G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 12-14:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">\u201c1. Does the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knowlton, </em>378 Mass. 479 (1979)[,] [prescribing] substantive procedures and protections for incompetent respondents in SDP proceedings under the now repealed \u00a7 6 of c. 123A, apply to a proceeding under \u00a7 12 of c. 123 A?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">\u201c2. If the answer to question [number one] is in the negative, then can a petition for indeterminate commitment under \u00a7\u00a7 12 through 14 of c. 123A proceed as against an incompetent respondent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-12\">\u201c3. If the answer to question [number two] is in the affirmative, then who exercises or waives the substantive rights granted respondents in petitions for their commitment for a day to life under \u00a7\u00a7 12 through 14 of c. 123A?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-13\">\u201c4. Can a respondent who is incompetent to participate in the therapy provided under c. 123A be civilly committed to the care of the \u2018[treatment [c]enter\u2019[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-14\">\u201c5. If the person named in a petition filed pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the [s]exuaUy [d]angerous [p]erson (SDP) [s]tatute, G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 1-16, is incapable, by reason of incompetence, of affirmatively waiving a trial by jury, does G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (\u00ab)[,] require that a trial on the petition be in front of a jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201c6. Should the Trial Court appoint a [gjuardian [ad] [l]item and utilize the \u2018substituted judgment\u2019 standard to determine whether a respondent, who has been found incompetent for all purposes, should exercise or waive his substantive rights including whether he should testify on his own behalf at a trial on an SDP petition?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We transferred the case to this court on our own motion and conclude that the interpretations of repealed sections of G. L. c. 123A do not apply to the materially different sections of the statute presently in effect; that due process is not offended by proceedings to commit an incompetent person, represented by an attorney, pursuant to c. 123A; that the judge may permit an incompetent person\u2019s attorney to invoke or waive various statutory rights, including the right to a jury trial; that restraint of a sexually dangerous person within the meaning of c. 123A does not offend the defendant\u2019s Federal due process rights, even if treatment would be ineffective; that a guardian ad litem need not be appointed; and that the decision whether to seek commitment under G. L. c. 123 or c. 123A is reserved to the appropriate executive official. In order to continue the commitment of an incompetent person, if the Commonwealth believes that such person continues to be sexually dangerous, the Commonwealth must seek the appointment of a court-appointed attorney for the incompetent person before the expiration of the initial term of one year, and before the expiration of any subsequent term for which the Commonwealth seeks to continue the commitment. Such attorney may then exercise the rights of the incompetent person in regard to a proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">1. <em>The statute. </em>Chapter 123A commitment is composed of \u201ccomplex court proceedings,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>441 Mass. 499, 507 n.11 (2004), to which certain constitutional rights available to criminal defendants do not apply, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Given, </em>441 Mass. 741, 746 n.8, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 948 (2004). The statute is civil and remedial in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>character, although, to be committed, one must first have been adjudicated responsible for certain sexual offenses or misconduct. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 500-502 (2000). See also G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We sketch the commitment process, the particulars of which are set forth in earlier cases. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>441 Mass. 157, 159-165 (2004). The process begins six months prior to the release from a correctional facility of a person previously convicted of a qualifying sexual offense. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 12. At that time, the agency with \u201cjurisdiction of [the] person\u201d notifies the Attorney General or the appropriate district attorney of the pending release. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(a). </em>If that official determines that the prisoner \u201cis likely to be a sexually dangerous person,\u201d the official may file a petition for commitment and obtain a determination from the Superior Court whether there is probable cause for the petition to proceed. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The defendant has a right, among other things, to be represented by counsel. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 12 <em>(d) </em>(1), 13 (c). If the defendant is indigent, counsel is appointed by the court. \u00a7 13 <em>(c). </em>If a prisoner is scheduled for release prior to the hearing on probable cause, he or she may be committed until the hearing, which \u201cshould commence\u201d within a statutorily appointed time. See \u00a7 12 <em>(c), </em>(&lt;?); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 513. On a determination of probable cause, the defendant is temporarily committed for evaluation by qualified examiners. \u00a7 13. The Commonwealth must move for trial on its petition within a relatively short time. \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14. Trial is by jury \u201cunless affirmatively waived\u201d by the defendant. \u00a7 14 <em>(a).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">To obtain a commitment of a sexually dangerous person, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201csuffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes [him] likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. If the finder of fact so concludes, a defendant is committed to the treatment center, see \u00a7 2, where he will be \u201cheld in the most appropriate level of security required to ensure protection of the public, correctional staff, himself and others,\u201d \u00a7 6A, \u201cfor an indeterminate period of a minimum of one day and a maximum of such person\u2019s natural life,\u201d \u00a7 14 <em>(d), </em>until discharged pursuant to his petition or that of his parents, spouse, issue, next of kin, or friend, \u00a7 9. A petition for discharge may be filed annually, and either the Commonwealth or the person committed may demand trial by jury on the issue whether the defendant remains a sexually dangerous person. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><em>2. Facts. </em>We recite the salient facts, which are derived from the stipulated record. See Mass. R. A. R 8 (d), 378 Mass. 932 (1979). In 1993, the defendant was convicted of violently raping a woman at the side of a public street. He served a sentence of three years, part of it in State hospitals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A hospital staff member noted that he had \u201cdelusions about a female forensic evaluator . . . and difficulty controlling his sexual impulses.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The defendant was twice discovered under a female patient\u2019s bed, and on another occasion was kissing female patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In September, 1996, the defendant was released from custody, and approximately three days later, while still on probation, he violently dragged a motorist from her car and attempted to rape her. As a result of this incident, the defendant was convicted of assault with intent to rape, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and assault and battery. He was sentenced to from five years to five years and one day on the first two indictments. A guilty finding was placed on file on the third indictment. While serving this sentence, he was cited for fifty-one disciplinary violations such as fighting, being out of place, refusing orders, and assaulting and threatening correction officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">In September, 2001, in anticipation of the defendant\u2019s release from custody, the Commonwealth filed a petition in the Superior Court for commitment of the defendant as a sexually dangerous person. The defendant waived his right to limit preliminary confinement to ten days. Two qualified examiners evaluated him, one of whom was selected by the defendant. Both concluded that the defendant was likely to commit additional sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility, as provided in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, although only one found that he was an SDP. The other examiner was uncertain whether the defendant\u2019s dangerousness originated from a \u201cmental abnormality or personality disorder,\u201d as required by \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">At a later hearing, counsel suggested to the hearing judge that the defendant lacked competency to stand trial under \u00a7 14. After a colloquy with the defendant, the judge declared him \u201cincompetent to proceed on this day.\u201d A qualified examiner concluded that the defendant was \u201ccompromised in his ability to assist his attorney by his limited intellectual ability (mild retardation) particularly as it relates to his ability to follow testimony, retain what he has heard, and follow instructions from his attorney.\u201d The examiner noted that \u201cthere may be some fluctuations in the degree of [the defendant\u2019s] competence to stand trial that may require an on-the-spot assessment at the time of court hearings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">After several hearings, the hearing judge found probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>cause to proceed to trial. Pursuant to \u00a7 13 <em>(a), </em>two more examiners interviewed the defendant and concluded that he was an SDP within the meaning of c. 123A. After the passage of some time,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendant was reexamined on motions of both the Commonwealth and the defense, with the same results.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The Commonwealth moved for trial pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14. The reporting judge denied the motion, pending a showing that the defendant was competent to stand trial, and reported the correctness of her ruling together with the questions quoted above.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>The present SDP commitment procedure, adopted in 1999, St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7\u00a7 3-8, is the successor to a procedure that was repealed by St. 1990, c. 150, \u00a7 304. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knowlton, </em>378 Mass. 479, 487-488 (1979), this court interpreted the language of the repealed statute to preclude commitment \u201cwithout first resolving the issue of [a defendant\u2019s] competence.\u201d Pursuant to the <em>Knowlton </em>case, if a defendant subject to a \u00a7 6 petition was found to be incompetent, the judge would employ procedures prescribed in the former section, such as appointment of a guardian ad litem and notification of the defendant\u2019s relatives or guardian, or the judge would continue proceedings until the defendant regained competence. <em>Id. </em>at 484-486.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The language of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 12-14, differs markedly from that of the prior statute and leaves no doubt that the Legislature intended SDP proceedings to go forward against an incompetent person without appointment of a guardian ad litem and without substantial delay. Sections 1 and 15 strongly suggest that a judge may find probable cause to proceed to trial despite incompetence and that the Legislature anticipated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>incompetents would be subjected to the trial procedures specified in \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 15 states expressly that even if a defendant is incompetent, \u201cthe court may proceed to consider whether the person is a sexually dangerous person according to the procedures set forth in sections 13 and 14.\u201d (The latter two sections provide for process relating to temporary and indeterminate commitment, proceedings that follow the probable cause hearing.) Where the statute is clear, we interpret it as written. <em>West\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 146, 149 (1943). We are confident that the Legislature did not intend to revive the repealed sections by enacting opposite language.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">4. <em>Trial of an incompetent person. </em>The defendant argues that trial of a petition to commit an incompetent person under \u00a7 14 would violate principles of due process. We disagree. \u201cMinimum due process varies with context.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>441 Mass. 499, 502 (2004), quoting from <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. 258, 274 (1982). The inquiry is guided by the familiar three-part balancing test of <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334-335 (1976). \u201cWhere, as here, the government [seeks to] interfere[] with an individual\u2019s protected liberty interest, we must balance the interest of the individual affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation of that interest, and the government\u2019s interest in the efficient administration of its affairs.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>441 Mass. 157, 166 (2004), citing <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, supra </em>at 334-335. We consider these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The defendant\u2019s interest is weighty. If committed, his loss of liberty would be total. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 6A. Commitment is for an indeterminate period, \u00a7 14, and he has a strong interest in avoiding such commitment. However, the defendant\u2019s interest must, with appropriate safeguards, yield to the Commonwealth\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>paramount interest in protecting its citizens. We see no reason why the public interest in committing sexually dangerous persons to the care of the treatment center must be thwarted by the fact that one who is sexually dangerous also happens to be incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The robust, adversary character of the c. 123A procedure minimizes the risk of the erroneous commitment of a person who is not sexually dangerous. The defendant has, among other things, the right to counsel, and to the appointment of counsel if necessary. \u00a7\u00a7 12 <em>(d), </em>13 (c). \u201cWhere, because of the condition of the [incompetent] person[,] . . . notice and hearing would not be effective [because the defendant is incompetent], . . . the requirements of due process may be satisfied by the appointment of counsel ... to act for the . . . person.\u201d <em>Rohrer, petitioner, </em>353 Mass. 282, 286 n.5 (1967). See <em>State ex rel. Nixon </em>v. <em>Kinder, </em>129 S.W.3d 5, 9-11 (Mo. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 979 (2004). Cf. <em>In re Branch, </em>890 So. 2d 322, 328-329 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004) (due process not violated by subjecting incompetent respondent to adversary proceeding if underlying facts are not susceptible to dispute).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Due process is not offended by subjecting the defendant, with the assistance of counsel, to trial of the Commonwealth\u2019s petition as provided in \u00a7 14. Nothing in this procedure \u201cshocks the conscience.\u201d <em>Rochin </em>v. <em>California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952). See <em>Dutil, petitioner, </em>437 Mass. 9, 13-15 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">5. <em>Exercise of rights. </em>Chapter 123 A also permits the defendant to exercise a number of statutory rights. For example, \u00a7 14 (a) provides for trial by jury \u201cunless affirmatively waived by the person named in the petition.\u201d The defendant may also retain experts, \u00a7 14 <em>(b); </em>obtain process to compel the attendance of witnesses, <em>id.; </em>cross-examine adverse witnesses who testify at trial, \u00a7 13 <em>(d), </em>see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGruder, </em>348 Mass. 712, 716 (1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 972 (1966); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradway, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 280, 289 (2004); and present evidence in his defense, \u00a7 14 (c), see <em>McHoul, petitioner, </em>445 Mass. 143, 146-147 &amp; n.2 (2005). Obviously, to assure equal treatment of incompetents, a person in such condition must be allowed some opportunity to benefit from these rights just as a competent person would. See <em>Baxstrom </em>v. <em>Herold, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>383 U.S. 107, 110-111 (1966). Thus, some person must be authorized to exercise these rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">We think the rights granted by c. 123A may generally be exercised by counsel where the defendant is incompetent to do so. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>438 Mass. 618, 626 (2003) (attorney will present evidence on behalf of incompetent defendant in hearing under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 17 <em>[b]). </em>When a client is suffering from a mental disability and \u201chas no guardian or legal representative, the lawyer often must act as de facto guardian.\u201d Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.14 comment [2], 426 Mass. 1361 (1998). See <em>Guardianship of Hocker, </em>439 Mass. 709, 718 &amp; n.18 (2003). This is such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The choices provided a defendant are quintessentially the types of choices that attorneys regularly make with respect to their competent clients. Here, the defendant\u2019s counsel has, among other things, argued motions to dismiss the Commonwealth\u2019s petition, moved to continue proceedings, moved several times for funds for psychiatric evaluations under \u00a7 14, and moved for a competency evaluation. We see no reason why exercise of the defendant\u2019s choice to request a bench trial should be any different. In the circumstances, to the extent possible, the attorney should counsel the defendant as to the choice most likely to defeat the petition for commitment and invoke the procedure appropriate to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">There are safeguards in place should an attorney fail to act effectively. Counsel exercises the defendant\u2019s procedural rights in the presence of the court. Cf. <em>Guardianship of Hocker, supra </em>at 711, 717 (judge may strike appearance of ward\u2019s appointed attorney). The judge may refer improper conduct to the Board of Bar Overseers for disciplinary action. <em>Beit </em>v. <em>Probate &amp; Family Court Dep\u2019t, </em>385 Mass. 854, 861 n.13 (1982). Other lawyers have an obligation to report any \u201cserious violations of ethical duty.\u201d Mass. R. Prof. C. 8.3 comment [1], 426 Mass. 1436 (1998). \u201cReporting a violation is especially important where the victim is unlikely to discover the offense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">. The Commonwealth argues that a guardian ad litem should be appointed to exercise or waive the defendant\u2019s rights based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>on a \u201csubstituted judgment\u201d procedure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree. As discussed above, c. 123A no longer expressly provides for appointment of a guardian ad litem. Nor does due process require the appointment of a guardian in the ordinary case. See <em>Rohrer, petitioner, supra </em>at 286 n.5. In an extraordinary case, the inherent or statutory power of a court to appoint a guardian may be exercised.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On this record, the appointment of a guardian ad litem is not constitutionally required at this stage of the proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">6. <em>Ineffective treatment. </em>The defendant argues that it would be unconstitutional to commit an individual for treatment he is not able to utilize. He concedes that \u201camenability to treatment is not a [constitutionally mandated] precondition to commitment\u201d under <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 366 (1997), but argues that \u201cpermanent detention\u201d of \u201ccertain mentally disordered persons\u201d solely for the purpose of protecting the public is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra </em>at 366, the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>stated that it had \u201cnever held that the Constitution prevents a State from civilly detaining those for whom no treatment is available, but who nevertheless pose a danger to others.\u201d \u201c[I]t would be of little value to require treatment as a precondition for civil confinement of the dangerously insane when no acceptable treatment existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A dangerous person, particularly one for whom \u201cno acceptable treatment existed,\u201d <em>id., </em>may be committed in the interest of public health and safety on a determination that the person \u201c suffer[s] from a volitional impairment rendering [the person] dangerous beyond [his or her] control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The standard in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(d), </em>suffices for purposes of <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra. Dutil, petitioner, </em>437 Mass. 9, 14-19 (2002). Section 14 <em>(d) </em>provides for commitment where a defendant \u201csuffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility.\u201d See \u00a7 1 (\u201c[s]exually dangerous person\u201d defined). Commitment to protect the public pursuant to \u00a7 14 is not improper under the <em>Hendricks </em>standard, even where no effective treatment exists to remedy the defendant\u2019s infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">7. <em>\u201cDangerous person\u201d statute. </em>The defendant argues that the Commonwealth should have requested commitment pursuant to the authority of a separate statute, G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7-9, instead of G. L. c. 123A. The separate provisions of c. 123 relate to commitment of \u201cdangerous persons.\u201d The defendant argues that an action to commit pursuant to c. 123 would have been preferable because c. 123A has a \u201cmore lenient definition ... of illness\u201d and an ostensibly narrower definition of dangerousness, and commitments under c. 123 automatically expire, with the burden on the detaining authority to seek recommitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">We think this argument evidences a misapprehension of the role of this court. \u201c[M]any SDPs could be proceeded against under either statute.\u201d <em>Andrews, petitioner, </em>368 Mass. 468, 480 (1975). The determination whether to seek commitment pursuant to chapter 123 or chapter 123 A is reserved to the executive branch. See art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. In addition, to the extent the defendant argues that c. 123A is constitutionally infirm because it requires the submission of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>petition to initiate postcommitment judicial review while c. 123 does not, see <em>Andrews, petitioner, supra </em>at 480, \u201cwe have already determined that this difference in procedure does not violate equal protection.\u201d <em>Dutil, petitioner, supra </em>at 21, citing <em>Thompson, petitioner, </em>394 Mass. 502, 507-508 (1985). It does give rise to due process concerns, however, which we address below.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Although we conclude that the decision whether to seek commitment of a person under G. L. c. 123 or G. L. c. 123A is reserved to the appropriate official, there is one aspect of G. L. c. 123A, as it applies to persons who are found incompetent, that warrants further comment. It pertains to the availability of the safeguards afforded under the statute after the incompetent person has been found sexually dangerous and implicates due process concerns with respect to the continuation of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">A person who is found incompetent to stand trial, and is then adjudicated a sexually dangerous person pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, faces \u201can indeterminate period of a minimum of one day [to] a maximum of such person\u2019s natural life.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(d). </em>In other words, once adjudicated sexually dangerous, absent some intervention that triggers a judicial review of his status in which the Commonwealth must prove that he continues to be a sexually dangerous person, an incompetent individual may spend the rest of his natural life incarcerated in a secure facility. This contrasts with the procedure for individuals who are found incompetent to stand trial by reason of mental illness or defect and are committed, pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 7, to a public or private facility for the care and treatment of mentally ill persons or to Bridgewater State Hospital<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> because there has been a determination that the \u201cfailure to hospitalize would create a likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness.\u201d Incompetent persons so committed are subject to an initial civil commitment for a term of six months, and may then be committed for subsequent periods of one year <em>only </em>on a required show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>ing by the Commonwealth. See G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 (committed individual has the right to a hearing on every petition for commitment and may be recommitted only on a showing that he is mentally ill and that his discharge would create a likelihood of serious harm). The requirement of periodic judicial review of the status of the person was one basis on which we concluded that the retention of an incompetent person in a treatment facility was constitutionally sound. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelVerde, </em>398 Mass. 288, 301 (1986) (\u201cThrough G. L. c. 123, the Legislature has created a comprehensive set of procedural and substantive safeguards to ensure that criminal defendants incompetent to stand trial are neither criminally tried nor civilly committed <em>for longer than </em>necessary\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The Commonwealth forthrightly recognizes that due process protection for sexually dangerous persons who are found incompetent to stand trial requires some mechanism \u201cto ensure that the respondents\u2019 rights and interests are adequately protected.\u201d It posits that it may be appropriate for a judge to appoint a guardian ad litem \u201cwhen a question is raised concerning competency.\u201d That proposed solution, however, fails to address the mechanism by which \u201ca question is raised\u201d concerning the competency of the person once he has been adjudicated sexually dangerous and committed to a secure facility. There is a real risk that an incompetent person committed to the treatment center may be unable to avail himself of the opportunity to appear before a judge to require that the Commonwealth demonstrate that he remains sexually dangerous and in need of commitment. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9 (permitting any person committed to treatment center to petition for examination and discharge once every twelve months). The absence of any reliable means of obtaining such periodic reviews raises serious due process concerns. See <em>Hill, petitioner, </em>422 Mass. 147, 154 (1996) (commitment pursuant to G. L. c. 123A does not constitute criminal punishment in part because G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9, \u201cpermits the SDP to petition for release every year .... Thus, unlike a criminal prisoner, the SDP is continuously evaluated to determine if treatment is necessary, and, if not, the petitioner will be released . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Under the terms of G. L. c. 123A, a hearing to review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>status of the committed sexually dangerous person must be initiated by petition, which a sexually dangerous person can do with or without the assistance of a lawyer. See G. L. c. 123A,</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">\u00a7 9 (\u201cUnless the trier of fact finds that such person remains a sexually dangerous person, it shall order such person to be discharged from the treatment center\u201d). But no person is required to initiate such petition. For individuals who have been found incompetent, relying on the individual himself, or his parents, spouse, issue, next of kin, or any friend to request a hearing (see G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9, listing persons who may petition on behalf of the committed person), does not afford constitutionally adequate protection. Those individuals named in the statute are not legally obligated to obtain review of the status of the incompetent person. Thus, an incompetent person might not himself be able to activate a review petition, and he may have no meaningful access to persons who are statutorily authorized to do so on his behalf. In this case, for example, there is no indication in the record that the defendant has a family member or friend required to assume the responsibility of filing petitions for his discharge. Even if such family member or friend were available, placing the burden of initiating periodic reviews of the defendant\u2019s status (which may extend for decades) solely on a third party may be constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Accordingly, to address the reservations described above, we interpret the statute as follows. In order to continue the commitment of an incompetent person, if the Commonwealth believes that such person continues to be sexually dangerous, it must seek appointment of a court-appointed attorney for the incompetent person before the expiration of the initial term of one year. Such attorney may then exercise the rights of the incompetent person in regard to a proceeding, see discussion <em>supra. </em>This procedure must at a minimum be followed at each successive occasion at which the petitioner has a right to apply for a hearing but remains incompetent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We impose this requirement to provide what we consider to be essential to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>requirements of due process protection for incompetent persons who are involuntarily committed as SDPs pursuant to G. L. c. 123A.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Pielech </em>v. <em>Massasoit Greyhound, Inc., </em>423 Mass. 534, 538-539 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1131 (1997), quoting <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. 757, 763-764 (1985) (\u201cstatutes are to be construed so as to avoid an unconstitutional result or the likelihood thereof\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">8. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, we answer the reported questions as follows: Question one, \u201cno\u201d; question two, \u201cyes\u201d; question three, \u201cattorney for the defendant\u201d; question four, \u201cyes\u201d; question five, \u201cno\u201d; and question six, \u201cno.\u201d The order denying the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for trial pursuant to G.
