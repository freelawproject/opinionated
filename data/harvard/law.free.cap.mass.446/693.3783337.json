G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28. The defendant appealed, arguing that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that the dissemination must be the result of purposeful, intentional conduct. The Appeals Court affirmed the conviction in an unpublished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>memorandum and order pursuant to its rule 1:28. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belcher, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 1107 (2005). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. Because we conclude that there was no error in the judge\u2019s instruction, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><em>Background. </em>We recite the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, reserving certain details for our discussion of the issue raised. The victim was the defendant\u2019s niece,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who was seventeen years old at the time and had an IQ under fifty, causing her to function at the level of a ten year old child. Until 1999, the victim often had overnight visits at the defendant\u2019s house. The victim testified that during some of the visits, when the defendant\u2019s wife was not at home, the defendant showed her \u201cadult\u201d videotapes. During one such visit, the victim testified that while she and the defendant were both in the living room, the defendant played a videotape, showing \u201ca guy and a girl\u201d with no clothes on, \u201cplaying with each other.\u201d The victim testified that the people in the videotape were touching each other\u2019s private parts, and that the people were lying down, with the man on top, moving up and down. While the videotape was playing, the defendant was wearing only a blue bathrobe, and was masturbating. In addition, the victim testified that the defendant showed her photographs depicting the defendant and his wife naked, including one where the defendant\u2019s wife was performing oral sex on the defendant. There was another photograph showing the defendant and another woman engaged in sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">A police search of the defendant\u2019s home in January, 2000, revealed numerous \u201cadult\u201d videotapes located throughout the home, including the living room. In a drawer in the defendant\u2019s bedroom, police found several photographs depicting the defendant in sexual acts with his wife, and some depicting him in sexual acts with another woman. The police also found the defendant\u2019s blue bathrobe.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The defendant and his wife testified at trial. The defendant denied ever watching \u201cadult\u201d videotapes with the victim or showing her any of the photographs. The defendant\u2019s wife testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>fled that she worked in a video rental store, that she and her husband had over 1,000 videotapes, and that about ten or eleven of them were \u201cadult.\u201d She stated that the \u201cadult\u201d videotapes were usually kept in the bedroom, but that some of them may have been in the living room. Before the victim came to their home, the defendant\u2019s wife would try to remove all of the \u201cadult\u201d videotapes from the living room. Both the defendant and his wife testified that they had found the victim watching \u201cadult\u201d videotapes, reprimanded her, and took them away. They both testified that they kept the photographs in question in the defendant\u2019s nightstand in the bedroom, and the defendant testified that he saw the victim going through that drawer, as well as his bureau drawers. On at least one occasion, the defendant\u2019s wife reprimanded the victim for going into the bedroom, a room she was not allowed to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 28, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">\u201cWhoever disseminates to a minor any matter harmful to minors, as defined in section thirty-one,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] knowing it to be harmful to minors, or has in his possession any such matter with the intent to disseminate the same to minors, shall be punished by imprisonment. . . or by a fine . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">In his charge to the jury, the judge instructed that the Commonwealth had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that (1) the matter was harmful to minors; (2) the defendant knew the matter was harmful to minors; and (3) the defendant disseminated that matter to a minor. The judge also defined the relevant terms in each of these elements, in accordance with the statutory definitions in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>After defining \u201cmatter\u201d and \u201charmful to minors,\u201d the judge defined \u201cknowing\u201d as a \u201cgeneral awareness of the character of the matter.\u201d The judge defined \u201cminor\u201d as a person under eighteen years of age, and then defined \u201cdissemination\u201d as the following: \u201cthe Commonwealth must demonstrate beyond a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>able doubt that the defendant <em>exhibited </em>or <em>displayed </em>the harmful matter in question <em>to </em>a person under eighteen years of age\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The defendant claims that because the evidence fairly raised the question whether the harmful matter was inadvertently displayed, the judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that the defendant could not be convicted under the statute absent purposeful or intentional dissemination of the material. At trial, the defendant did not object to the judge\u2019s instruction, nor did he request that the judge instruct the jury concerning the meaning of the word \u201cdissemination.\u201d In reviewing an unobjected-to claim of error in a jury instruction, the court must determine whether there is an error in the charge that creates a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>430 Mass. 746, 750 (2000). We consider the jury charge as a whole, \u201clooking for the interpretation a reasonable juror would place on the judge\u2019s words.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harbin, </em>435 Mass. 654, 658 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trapp, </em>423 Mass. 356, 361, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1045 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 28, requires purposeful activity for proof of guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>365 Mass. 164, 172 (1974) (\u201cSpeaking generally, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28, deals with actual or intended sales, exhibitions, or distributions of certain material harmful to minors\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 153, 157, 160 (2003) (evidence insufficient where no minors saw matter and where evidence suggested that defendant did not intend for them to see it).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The judge\u2019s instructions tracked the language of \u00a7 31, using \u201cexhibited\u201d or \u201cdisplayed.\u201d \u201cThese terms must be given their usual and accepted meaning so long as it is consistent with the statutory purpose . . . Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2105-2106 (1971) uses \u2018show\u2019 as a synonym for \u2018display\u2019 and defines \u2018show\u2019 as \u2018to cause or permit to be seen.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 514 (5th ed. 1979) defines \u2018exhibit\u2019 as: \u2018To show or display; to offer or present for inspection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lotten Books, Inc., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 625, 628 (1981). Moreover, the words \u201cexhibited or displayed\u201d were used in conjunction with the words <em>\u201cto </em>a person under eighteen years of age,\u201d indicating intentional behavior on the part of the defendant (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>In addition, at trial, the Commonwealth did not argue that the defendant inadvertently showed the victim the material, and the defense was that the defendant did not show the material to the victim at all. In no part of their testimony did the defendant or his wife suggest that they inadvertently \u201cpermitted\u201d the videotapes or photographs to be seen by the victim. The defendant testified that when he found the victim watching an \u201cadult\u201d videotape on one occasion, he was angry \u201c[t]awards myself\u201d about not putting all the videotapes away. He stated that he tried to be more cautious about locking up all the \u201cadult\u201d videotapes in order to hide them more effectively from the victim. Such testimony, if believed, does not indicate that the defendant negligently \u201cpermitted\u201d the victim to view the materials. In fact, the testimony demonstrated that he actively attempted to prevent her exposure to the materials. We conclude that in hearing this testimony, coupled with the words the judge used in his instruction, the jury could not have found the defendant\u2019s actions \u201caccidental\u201d or \u201cnegligent\u201d and incorrectly convicted the defendant on the basis of inadvertent conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated above, there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that the judge erred in instructing the jury. Although there was no error in the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury, we conclude that, in the future, a judge should emphasize that the dissemination must be purposeful or intentional on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-15\">Prior to trial, the defendant pleaded guilty to one indictment charging unlawful possession of a firearm or ammunition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The defendant is approximately fifteen years older than the victim and is the brother of the victim\u2019s mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\">General Laws, c. 272, \u00a7 31, defines a \u201c[m]inor\u201d as a person under eighteen years of age; defines \u201c[disseminate\u201d as \u201cto import, publish, produce, print, manufacture, distribute, sell, lease, exhibit or display\u201d; and defines \u201c[k]nowing\u201d as \u201ca general awareness of the character of the matter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The closing arguments also would have reinforced to the jury that the defendant\u2019s actions had to have been purposeful for him to be convicted. Defense counsel stressed the exculpatory character of the defendant\u2019s testimony that \u201che never showed these movies to [the victim]. He never showed her any naked photos.\u201d The prosecutor never suggested that the defendant could be convicted merely because he was negligent in leaving the materials around, allowing the victim to exhibit the materials to herself. The prosecutor rather argued that the \u201crelevant\u201d aspect of \u201cdissemination\u201d was \u201cwhen you\u2019re showing pictures to your niece . . . with you and your wife or some other woman engaging in sexual conduct.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
