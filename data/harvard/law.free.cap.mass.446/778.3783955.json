L. c. 272, \u00a7 53; harassment, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A; and assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, of the victim, a fellow cashier at a supermarket. After a jury-waived trial in December, 2003, a District Court judge allowed the defendant\u2019s oral motion for a required finding of not guilty of harassment. The judge found the defendant not guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>of assault and battery but guilty of accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex, and sentenced him to one year of probation. The defendant appealed and the Appeals Court reversed his conviction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 911 (2005). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. Because we conclude that the defendant\u2019s conduct was offensive and disorderly within the meaning of the statute, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\"><em>Facts. </em>We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, reserving certain details for our discussion of the issues raised. The victim was hired as a new cashier in February, 2003. The defendant also worked as a cashier at the store and conducted the victim\u2019s training session. One of the defendant\u2019s duties was to evaluate the victim\u2019s job performance. Between February and April, 2003, the defendant \u201cforced his unwanted attentions on [the victim] . . . asking her out for dates [over twenty times]; sometimes approaching her cashier station too closely, so that his body would \u2018graze\u2019 hers; occasionally touching her back; [and] often staring down at her station from a balcony above the checkout counters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 911. Much of the victim\u2019s testimony was corroborated by two former coworkers who were called by the Commonwealth to testify at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The victim testified that in March, the defendant left a telephone message and his telephone number with a supervisor, asking the victim to telephone him. She told the supervisor that she did not want the defendant to telephone her. The next day the defendant approached the victim in an angry and confrontational manner, came close to her face, and asked her why she did not contact him. The victim felt panicky and afraid for her safety outside the workplace. In April, while the victim was assisting customers at her cashier\u2019s station, the defendant came up behind her and \u201cgrabbed [her] around the neck really tight with both arms around [her] shoulders and neck . . . more around [her] shoulders\u201d and said, \u201cI love you.\u201d The victim felt panicky <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>and frightened and told the defendant to let her go. The defendant did so after ten to fifteen seconds. He left the victim\u2019s station but stayed nearby, still pleading with her to go out with him and to have dinner with him. After this incident, which was the basis for the complaint against the defendant, the victim was frightened, had trouble concentrating at work, and had to take medication.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One or two days after the incident, the defendant came up to the conveyor belt at the register where the victim was working, banged on it, and asked a female customer why the victim had not called him, frightening the customer. The victim reported the incidents to the store manager, who suspended the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The defendant testified that the victim told him that her husband left her and she was looking for a paralegal job. He concluded that she was depressed and needed a friend. He stated that he offered to help her find a paralegal job. He claimed that while he did ask the victim to go out with him, it was only as friends and, although she declined, she never told him no. He stated that he was old enough to be her father and was not interested in her romantically. He denied staring at her. He stated that he did not own a telephone and that the number he left for the victim was a person to contact so she could find another job. He denied working on the day the victim claimed he put his arms around her and told her he loved her. He said he only put his arms around her shoulders once, to comfort her as a friend, but it happened when there were no customers around.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty. In reviewing a denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty, \u201cwe must consider and determine whether the evidence, in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the contrary evidence presented by the defendant, is sufficient ... to permit the [fact finder] to infer the existence of the essential elements of the crime charged . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>368 Mass. 729, 740 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 53, states in relevant part: \u201c[Pjersons who with offensive and disorderly acts or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex . . . may be punished.\u201d Under this statute, the Commonwealth has to prove that the defendant\u2019s behavior was offensive and disorderly to a reasonable person. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. 229, 235 (2001). We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">1. <em>Offensive acts. </em>The defendant argues that his behavior was not offensive, especially because the two former coworkers who testified (see note 1, supra) did not refer to the defendant\u2019s behavior as harassing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree. Offensive acts are those that cause \u201cdispleasure, anger or resentment; esp., repugnant to the prevailing sense of what is decent or moral.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1113 (8th ed. 2004). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 920 (2003). The defendant\u2019s act of grabbing the victim from behind \u201creally tight\u201d around her shoulders, while she was attending to customers, was offensive, particularly when considered in the context of the defendant\u2019s other behaviors toward the victim in the workplace. The victim testified that the defendant accosted her when he grabbed her from behind, and she stated that this action made her feel panicky and frightened and caused her to have trouble concentrating at work. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s claim that the testimony of the other two coworkers supports the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s behavior was not offensive misses the mark. It was clear from their testimony that the defendant subjected the victim to far more unwanted attention than that experienced by coworkers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">2. <em>Disorderly acts. </em>Disorderly acts are behaviors that \u201ccreate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>a . . . physically offensive condition for no legitimate purpose of the actor, whether the resulting harm is suffered in public by the public or in private by an individual.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, supra </em>at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The defendant argues that the Commonwealth did not prove that his behavior was disorderly because his behavior was not the extreme invasion of personal privacy at issue in other cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 911, 912 (2005), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LePore, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 543, 548-549 (1996) (voyeurism violative of statute because it invades privacy where people \u201care most entitled to feel secure\u201d). The defendant further argues that while his action was \u201cpossibly inappropriate in the workplace,\u201d the behavior is not the kind of behavior the statute was meant to cover. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s behavior was disorderly within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LePore, supra, </em>the victim was sleeping and therefore was <em>unaware </em>that the defendant had opened her bedroom window and screen and was standing there. <em>Id. </em>at 545. Obviously, there was no physical contact between the victim and the defendant. Nevertheless, the court held that the behavior was physically offensive. <em>Id. </em>at 548-549. Here, the defendant physically grabbed the victim from behind \u201creally tight,\u201d which had sexual overtones in light of his words, \u201cI love you,\u201d and his previous and subsequent behavior, thus invading her personal privacy<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at the workplace while she was trying to attend to customers. This was physically offensive. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number><em>Chou, supra </em>at 235 (defendant\u2019s distribution of sexually derogatory flyers concerning victim not physically offensive; however, act was threatening under statute). Because we conclude that the defendant\u2019s act was physically offensive, we need not consider whether it also was threatening.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">3. <em>Reasonable person. </em>The defendant also argues that because the victim was involved in a previous sexual harassment case, and because her coworkers\u2019 views of the defendant\u2019s behavior were different from hers, she is not a reasonable person under the statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, supra. </em>We have discussed these arguments and need not reiterate them here. We conclude that a reasonable person would have found the defendant\u2019s behavior offensive and disorderly.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">4. <em>Overreaching. </em>Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LePore, supra, </em>the defendant argues that the statute requires a higher level of threatening or \u201cphysically offensive\u201d behavior than he exhibited here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We also need not belabor this argument. As we discussed, the <em>Chou </em>case dealt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>with threatening behavior under the statute, and the <em>LePore </em>case extended \u201cphysically offensive\u201d to mean behavior of which the victim was unaware. Particularly in light of these two cases, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s action fits into the spectrum of offensive behavior contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient for the judge to infer the existence of the essential elements of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The two former coworkers testified that the defendant touched the victim on the back; asked her to dinner, which she refused; and stared at the victim. Both testified that the victim was upset or made nervous by the defendant\u2019s behavior.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\">The victim testified that she had been prescribed this medication before this incident happened.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The defendant also takes the victim\u2019s testimony out of context to argue that because she previously had filed a harassment complaint, she was more sensitive to harassment. The victim actually said that since the earlier incident, \u201cI\u2019m more aware of it and I\u2019m more willing to report it right away, instead of letting it go.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\">One coworker was not asked whether the defendant touched her. She testified that the defendant called her \u201csweetheart\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s behavior toward another coworker made her uncomfortable. However, the other coworker testified that the defendant rubbed her back once and that it made her feel \u201c[k]ind of awkward. I\u2019m only seventeen. He was older, it was weird.\u201d She stated that she thought the defendant was being too friendly, but when asked whether she similarly characterized the defendant\u2019s behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>toward the victim as friendly, she stated, \u201cI don\u2019t really think so. I mean in her case it was different, he asked her out on dates . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Because on a grant of further appellate review, this court reviews the trial record and not the decision of the Appeals Court, we need not address every argument the defendant makes in reliance on the reasoning of the Appeals Court in this case. For example, the defendant relies on the Appeals Court\u2019s assertion that other statutes covered the defendant\u2019s behavior. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 911, 912 (2005). Here we are concerned only with whether there was evidence sufficient for a fact finder to infer the existence of the essential elements of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b800-10\">We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s argument that the victim\u2019s personal privacy was not implicated, because the defendant\u2019s action took place in a public place. General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 53, contains no requirement that the offensive acts be conducted in private. Furthermore, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>433 Mass. 229, 233 (2001), we stated that \u201cthe crime of accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex evinces a legislative intent to criminalize offensive and disorderly conduct or language that has a personal and private, rather than a necessarily public, impact.\u201d Here, after the incident in which the defendant grabbed the victim, she was frightened, had trouble concentrating at work, and had to take medication. We hold that the impact here of the defendant\u2019s offensive act was certainly \u201cprivate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b801-12\">In his brief, the defendant also arg\u00fc\u00eds that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the defendant lacked a legitimate purpose for his actions under the statute. He argues that his behavior toward the victim was due to his concern for the victim and because he was the performance evaluator and his job required him to be near all cashiers. However, at oral argument, counsel for the defendant conceded that there was no legitimate purpose for the defendant\u2019s behavior. In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, there could be no legitimate purpose for the defendant\u2019s act. The defendant grabbed the victim from behind while she was helping customers and told her that he loved her, then lingered near the victim and asked her out to dinner after she told him to let her go. Such behavior has nothing to do with the defendant\u2019s job as a performance evaluator or having to be near cashiers on occasion. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feigenbaum, </em>404 Mass. 471 (1989) (conviction reversed where Commonwealth failed to prove defendant\u2019s actions served no legitimate purpose); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zettel, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 471 (1999) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b801-13\">The defendant further argues that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, has a \u201ccontroversial history\u201d and is \u201carchaic.\u201d The statute\u2019s history and the definition of \u201cdisorderly\u201d at issue in this case were addressed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>433 Mass. 229 (2001), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721 (2000). In the <em>Sholley </em>case, we concluded that the definition of \u201cdisorderly\u201d conduct is found in \u201csubsections (a) and (c) of \u00a7 250.2 of the Model Penal Code, with any application of subsection (c) restricted to cases not involving protest or other expressive activities (as required by the <em>Feigenbaum </em>decision).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728. The <em>Sholley </em>decision narrowed the definition of \u201cdisorderly\u201d conduct so that it now conforms to the Model Penal Code, thus eliminating any impact of the statute\u2019s history. <em>Id. </em>at 727.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
