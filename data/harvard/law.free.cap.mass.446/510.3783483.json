The defendant was tried with a codefendant, Pov Hour, who was convicted as a joint venturer of murder in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>the first degree, also on a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pov Hour, ante </em>35 (2006). The defendant appeals from his conviction and from the denial of his motion to set aside the verdict or, in the alternative, for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The principal focus of the defendant\u2019s appeal is his claim that Oanh Tran, a key eyewitness, identified two men, the defendant and an individual named Nak Choeum, as the man who stabbed the victim, Tran first told the police that a man named \u201cBJ\u201d had been the perpetrator, and she identified from a pretrial photographic array an individual whom she said was BJ. Midway through the trial defense counsel revealed that the man in the photograph selected by Tran was not the defendant, but Nak Choeum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant argues that the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury regarding Tran\u2019s out-of-court identification, to which the defendant did not object, \u201cimproperly forbade\u201d the jury from considering Tran\u2019s \u201crepeated identification of [Nak Choeum] as the true killer.\u201d He claims that these instructions created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, and that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to them. He also contends that trial counsel\u2019s failure to seek to exclude as unnecessarily suggestive Tran\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. For the reasons we shall explain, we reject the arguments relating to Tran\u2019s identification of the defendant as the person who stabbed the victim: they rest on a mischarac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>terization of the evidence or a misapprehension of the judge\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The defendant also claims that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper in suggesting that Tran was reliable because she had volunteered to testify at trial when there was no evidence to that effect. The argument is not persuasive. Finally, he argues that we should exercise our power pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial. We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction and decline to grant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>We describe briefly the events that transpired on the night of the victim\u2019s death, which are recounted in more detail in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pov </em>Hour, <em>supra </em>at 36-39 (affirming codefendant\u2019s conviction). We then turn to Tran\u2019s out-of-court photographic identification and her in-court identification of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">a. <em>The events leading to the victim\u2019s death. </em>The killing was the culmination of a late-night melee. Several men were indicted for the crime. Only one witness, Tran, identified the defendant as having been present at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The evidence was that, on the night of July 13, 2001, while Tran was standing in front of a house on Cross Street in Lowell, a Cadillac automobile driven by codefendant Hour pulled up in front of her. Tran knew Hour and the other men in the automobile. When asked whether she wanted to join the men, who were going to a party in Lynn, Tran agreed and entered the automobile, sitting in the front seat between Hour (known to Tran as \u201cPolo\u201d) and a man she knew as \u201cBJ,\u201d the defendant in this case. The Cadillac continued down Cross Street; at some point it was blocked by a Honda Accord automobile parked in the middle of the narrow street. The victim, the driver of the Honda, had driven to the house of his friend, Jeremy Richardson, located on Cross Street. The victim had stopped his automobile in the middle of the street outside Richardson\u2019s house, sounded his horn, and was waiting for Richardson to join him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">When the victim asked Hour to move his automobile so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the victim could back his Honda into an empty parking space, Hour responded, \u201cWhat does this nigger want?,\u201d or \u201cWhat is this nigger saying?\u201d Within seconds an argument commenced, and Hour, the defendant, Sokphann Chhim, Kimthy Un, Thol Leang, and Tran stepped out of the Cadillac, while the victim got out of his automobile.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The victim called for his friend, and Richardson emerged from his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">After a heated exchange, Richardson pushed the defendant to the ground and a fight followed, during which Richardson and the victim were separated. The defendant, Hour, and Chhim attacked the victim, repeatedly punching him. During their attack, Tran testified, the defendant repeatedly stabbed the victim with a knife or a blade. After the victim fell to the ground, Hour continued to punch, kick, and drag him. The defendant, Hour, Un, Leang, and Tran then reentered Hour\u2019s automobile and drove to the defendant\u2019s house in Lynn, where Tran spent the night. While they were in the automobile, the defendant threw the knife out of the automobile. The defendant and Hour repeatedly told Tran \u201cnot to tell nobody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The victim was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead within one hour of his arrival. A medical examiner testified that the victim, who had multiple stab wounds, bruises, and abrasions, died of a stab wound to the right chest that punctured his lung and caused internal bleeding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">b. <em>Tran's out-of-court identification of BJ. </em>Within a couple of days of the fight, Tran left Massachusetts and resumed her out-of-State schooling. Sometime later, Tran had a conversation with her school principal. This led to two meetings between Tran and two police officers, Trooper Alan Hunte and Detective Gerald Wayne from the Lowell police department, approximately two months after the victim\u2019s death. During the first meeting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Tran identified as those present at the incident codefendant Hour, Chhim, Un, and Leang by selecting their photographs from color photographic arrays. She then circled and initialed on black and white copies of the arrays the photographs of the men she had selected. On the back of each photograph, respectively, Tran briefly summarized each man\u2019s actions during the melee.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">At this first interview, Tran also provided the police with information concerning the participation of another man whom she identified as \u201cBJ.\u201d This information led the police to commence a search of their records for a photograph of an individual called \u201cBJ.\u201d Two days after the first interview with Tran, the police showed Tran another photographic array from which she selected one photograph. Tran said it was a photograph of BJ, the man who had stabbed the victim. The photograph selected by Tran had been taken in 1995, six years before the stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">c. <em>Tran\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant. </em>During her grand jury testimony and again at trial, Tran testified that the photograph she had selected from the second photographic array was a photograph of BJ, the man she said had stabbed the victim. At trial Tran also made an in-court identification of the defendant: she testified that the defendant was the man she knew as BJ, and was the man who had stabbed the victim during the fight. She was the only witness to identify the defendant at trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the in-court identification. Tran testified that she knew BJ because she had \u201cbeen hanging around with him\u201d on approximately four occasions, sometimes for \u201cthe whole day.\u201d During his cross-examination of Tran, defense counsel directed the jury\u2019s attention to the link between Tran\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant and her earlier selection of the photograph from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the array. On redirect examination, Tran once again identified the defendant as \u201cBJ,\u201d \u201cthe person [she] testified about stabbing and beating up\u201d the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">After Tran had completed her testimony she left the court house and apparently returned to Maine, her home State. Several days later, at sidebar during the testimony of Trooper Hunte, defense counsel informed the judge (and the prosecutor for the first time) that the man in the photograph selected by Tran was in fact not the defendant, but an individual named Nak Choeum. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>Counsel pointed out that the date of birth listed on the photograph was not the defendant\u2019s date of birth,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and stated that the defendant had been in State prison on the day the 1995 photograph had been taken. The photograph was admitted in evidence, as was the array from which Tran had selected it. Also admitted was the booking photograph taken of the defendant in September, 2001, on his arrest for the victim\u2019s murder. Through cross-examination of Trooper Hunte, defense counsel revealed to the jury the discrepancies between the photograph Tran had identified as BJ, and the defendant\u2019s booking photograph. Trooper Hunte testified, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that the defendant\u2019s alias was \u201cBJ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The defense at trial was mistaken identification. The theory was that Tran had identified a photograph of Nak Choeurn as the stabber, had repeated her photographic identification of him to the grand jury and at trial, and that Tran had then mistakenly identified the defendant in court as the man who had stabbed the victim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We begin our discussion with the defendant\u2019s claim on appeal that the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury improperly excluded from their consideration Tran\u2019s out-of-court photographic identification of Nak Choeurn as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>victim\u2019s stabber. We then turn to his argument that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution because of defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to allegedly erroneous jury instructions and his failure to exclude an in-court identification of the defendant by Tran.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">a. <em>Jury instructions. </em>At trial, the black and white copies of the photographic arrays from which Tran had identified the defendant and others she said had participated in the victim\u2019s death, including the words she had written on the back of the photographs, were admitted in evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant objected to the admission of Tran\u2019s writings on the photographs. In response the judge gave limiting instructions, explaining that the writings on the photographs were being admitted not for the truth of the statements, but for identification purposes only.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition, as part of his final charge to the jury, the judge gave the following instructions regarding inconsistent statements by witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">\u201cWhen you evaluate how reliable a witness\u2019s testimony is, you may take into account whether that witness made an earlier <em>statement </em>that differs in any significant way from his or her present testimony at trial. . . . The earlier <em>statement </em>is not itself positive evidence of any fact that is mentioned in it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>On appeal, the defendant argues that together these instructions created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, and that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to them deprived him of effective assistance of counsel. As to the inconsistent statement instructions, in particular, the defendant argues that Tran\u2019s selectian of the photograph of Nak Choeum was an inconsistent \u201cstatement\u201d and that the judge\u2019s final instructions removed from the jury\u2019s substantive consideration Tran\u2019s previous \u201crepeated identification\u201d of Nak Choeum as the stabber.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The defendant is correct that prior identifications are admissible as substantive evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Duc Le, </em>444 Mass. 431, 432 (2005) (adopting \u201cmodem interpretation\u201d of rule expressed in Fed. R. Evid. 801[d][l][C] and identically worded Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 801[d][l][C] to allow substantive use of pretrial identification evidence). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, however, the judge did not instmet the jury that Tran\u2019s prior identification of the man in the photograph as BJ could not be considered substantively. The judge\u2019s first set of instructions, given essentially contemporaneously with the testimony of various witnesses and at the request of defense counsel, specifically limited the jurors\u2019 use of <em>written </em>statements on the backs of the black and white photographic copies of the codefendant and others. See note 11, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">As to the defendant\u2019s challenge to the judge\u2019s final instruction concerning inconsistent witness statements, the argument that Tran\u2019s photographic identification of Nak Choeum was a \u201cstatement\u201d excluded from the jury\u2019s substantive consideration is without merit. The judge did not at any point refer to Tran\u2019s photographic identification of \u201cBJ\u201d as a \u201cstatement.\u201d Rather, he distinguished between the photographs and the written statements on the back of the photographs, instmeting the jury several times that they were not to consider substantively the \u201cwritten statements\u201d on the backs of the photographs identified by witnesses. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>When she selected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>photograph of BJ from the photographic array, Tran did not write anything on the back of the photograph, so nothing of Tran\u2019s identification of \u201cBJ\u201d or Nak Choeum was excluded from the jury\u2019s consideration. Stated differently, the judge did not limit in any respect the jury\u2019s substantive consideration of Tran\u2019s out-of-court identification of the individual called Nak Choeum.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The judge did in fact give final instructions on mistaken identification prior to deliberation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201cYou may take into account whether a witness ever tried and failed to make an identification of a defendant or made an identification that was inconsistent with the identification that such witness made at trial. ... If, after examining the testimony, you have a reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of the identification, you must find the defendant not guilty. In deciding whether or not to believe a witness who identifies the defendant as the perpetrator, remember that you must not only consider whether the witness is trying to tell you the truth or is lying. You must also decide whether that witness\u2019s identification is accurate and instead may well have been an honest good faith identification that may nonetheless have been mistaken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Providing these instructions to the jury comported with our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pressley, </em>390 Mass. 617, 620 (1983), that \u201c[f]airness to a defendant compels the judge to give an instruction on the possibility of an honest but mistaken identification when the facts permit it and when the defendant requests it.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, Tran never identified the victim\u2019s killer as Nak Choeum. Rather, she told Trooper Hunte that a man named \u201cBJ\u201d had stabbed the victim, and she selected from an array a 1995 photograph that she said was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>photograph of \u201cBJ.\u201d Tran was consistent that \u201cBJ,\u201d a man she knew, and the man she identified at trial, was the perpetrator. To the extent that the jury considered that Tran had mistakenly identified either the defendant they observed in court or the man she selected from the photographic array, they were correctly instructed that they had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant stabbed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">b. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>\u201cIn evaluating a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a case of murder in the first degree, we begin by determining whether there was a serious failure by trial counsel. If so, then we determine whether the failure resulted in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harbin, </em>435 Mass. 654, 656 (2002). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>430 Mass. 111, 120 (1999) (in capital cases, we review ineffective assistance of counsel claim for substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice, a standard more favorable to defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992) (to prevail on ineffective assistance of counsel claim, defendant must demonstrate that \u201cthere was an error in the course of the trial [that was] likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion\u201d). As there was no error in the judge\u2019s various instructions to the jury concerning Tran\u2019s out-of-court identification, or his instruction on mistaken identification, counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to those instructions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, supra </em>(error in course of trial is prerequisite to successful ineffective assistance claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">On appeal, the defendant also argues that Tran\u2019s in-court identification of him as \u201cBJ,\u201d the man who stabbed the victim, was \u201cso suggestive\u201d in the circumstances \u201cas to be inherently unreliable,\u201d and that trial counsel\u2019s failure to move to strike the in-court identification deprived the defendant of effective assistance of counsel. We again begin by determining whether trial counsel erred in any respect. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harbin, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We have long recognized that \u201ca degree of suggestiveness inheres in any identification of a suspect who is isolated in a court room.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Napolitano, </em>378 Mass. 599, 604 (1979). That \u201cdoes not, in itself, render the identification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>impermissibly suggestive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, an in-court identification is excluded if it is tainted by an out-of-court confrontation arranged by the Commonwealth that is \u201cso impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968). Although the defendant casts serious doubt that Tran had previously selected a photograph of him as \u201cBJ,\u201d he makes no claim that Tran\u2019s earlier photographic identification of the man she believed was \u201cBJ\u201d was itself a suggestive confrontation in any respect.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rather, the defendant\u2019s argument rests on a theory that he was mistakenly identified by Tran as the stabber. Had trial counsel objected to Tran\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant, it is unlikely that her identification would have been struck. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conceicao, </em>388 Mass. 255, 264 (1983) (no error in declining to file motion with \u201cminimal chance of success\u201d). As the judge noted in rejecting this claim, \u201cthe risk of mistaken in-court identification was minimal given the fact that Tran knew and had spent time with BJ prior to the night that [the victim] was killed.\u201d He further noted that the jury \u201ccould have further credited Tran\u2019s testimony based on the corroboration of many of the details of her story by other evidence presented at trial.\u201d Defense counsel posited that Tran was not \u201clying,\u201d see note 9, <em>supra, </em>but that once she saw the defendant sitting at counsel table she simply made a mistake about whether he was the perpetrator.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">\u201c[Where] [t]here is no indication that [an] identification was the result of impermissibly suggestive procedures or that there was any defect in the identification process[,] . . . it is highly unlikely that a motion to suppress would have succeeded. It is not ineffective assistance of counsel when trial counsel declines to file a motion with a minimal chance of success.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conceicao, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In this case, it was likely a tactical decision by trial counsel not to file a motion to preclude Tran\u2019s in-court identification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the defendant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As described earlier, defense counsel waited until several days after Tran had finished her testimony and left the State before confronting a police witness with Tran\u2019s erroneous identification of the photograph as that of the defendant. Had counsel moved to preclude Tran\u2019s in-court identification of BJ, he would likely have had to reveal to the Commonwealth the error in Tran\u2019s pretrial photographic identification. This would have permitted the Commonwealth to examine Tran about the issue, potentially minimizing the impact of the inconsistency in front of the jury. By waiting to do so until he cross-examined Trooper Hunte, defense counsel set up for maximum impact on the jury the unexpected revelation that the photograph selected by Tran was not a photograph of the defendant. In these circumstances, trial counsel\u2019s actions were purposeful and consistent with a reasonable strategy. Simply because the strategy was unsuccessful does not mean it was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conceicao, supra </em>at 265. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sena, </em>441 Mass. 822, 825-826 (2004), and cases cited (proper to defer to trial counsel\u2019s tactical decisions unless manifestly unreasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">c. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing statement. </em>In his unsuccessful posttrial motion to set aside the verdict or, in the alternative, for a new trial, the defendant asserted that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper in several respects. He claimed that the prosecutor misstated evidence, appealed to the jury\u2019s sympathy, and vouched for the credibility of Tran, the Commonwealth\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>principal witness. On appeal, the defendant maintains only that the prosecutor improperly argued facts not in evidence in order to bolster Tran\u2019s credibility, and that the judge erred in declining to give a specific limiting instruction on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">It appears that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to which the defendant objects includes the following comments about Tran:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201cIs [Tran\u2019s] story inherently believable, does it make sense? Why come in here almost two years later when you\u2019re married with a child on the way living a great distance away and come in and say these things happened unless it\u2019s the truth. Remember, she went to the police, the police didn\u2019t go to her. That\u2019s important. No one sought her out. She was gone [from Massachusetts]. She went to the police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The defendant characterizes such comments as the prosecutor\u2019s vouching for Tran as a reliable witness because he was suggesting to the jury that Tran had volunteered to testify at trial. As there was no evidence whether Tran testified under compulsory process or fear of compulsory process, the defendant suggests that the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">We consider any challenged statements made during closing arguments \u201cin the context of the entire argument, and in light of the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury and the evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Passley, </em>428 Mass. 832, 835 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viriyahiranpaiboon, </em>412 Mass. 224, 231 (1992). The credibility of Tran\u2019s identification of the defendant as the man who inflicted the lethal wounds was key to his defense. And where credibility is at issue, \u201cit is certainly proper for counsel to argue from the evidence why a witness should be believed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>401 Mass. 109, 116 (1987). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>438 Mass. 808, 816 (2003) (\u201cIt is not improper vouching for the prosecutor to point to reasons why a witness\u2019s testimony, or portions of a witness\u2019s testimony, should logically be believed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">In this case the prosecutor did not state that Tran had volunteered to testily at trial, but his words \u201c[s]he was gone\u201d and \u201c[n]o one sought her out\u201d could arguably have been susceptible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>of this interpretation. At worst the prosecutor\u2019s statements were ambiguous: in context the statements could also have referred (accurately) to Tran\u2019s initial contact with the police. We discourage the use of ambiguous statements in the course of closing arguments. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 391-392 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 115. But \u201c \u2018unartful isolated instances\u2019 are generally not enough to lead the jury to improper inferences drawn from presumed personal knowledge of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, supra. </em>In this case, even assuming that the jury could have concluded that Tran had returned voluntarily to Massachusetts to testify at the defendant\u2019s trial, any conceivable improper inference was isolated and not repeated by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">We recognize here, as we have before, \u201cthat closing argument is identified as argument, the jury understands that, instructions from the judge inform the jury that closing argument is not evidence, and instructions may mitigate any prejudice in the final argument.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 517 (1987). Here, the judge\u2019s final instructions to the jury immediately before they begin their deliberations were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cOur rules prohibit attorneys from making certain types of arguments in an effort to persuade you to reach a certain result or to favor or discredit either party. For example, <em>the attorneys are not permitted to refer to facts that are not in evidence in this case. </em>If, based on your memory and understanding of the evidence, a lawyer did this, you should disregard that comment. The attorneys are not permitted to express their personal belief in the credibility or lack of credibility of any witness who testified in this case. That determination is entirely for you to make. If a lawyer made such a comment, you should disregard that comment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">These instructions were sufficient to cure any ambiguity in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, supra </em>at 522-523 (if judge is in doubt about propriety of prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, he may take \u201ca neutral posture and advise[] the jury that, if their memory of the evidence did not support the prosecutor\u2019s argument, they should disregard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>it\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, supra </em>at 392 (\u201cWe believe this unambiguous charge to the jury that they must determine credibility on their own mitigated any prejudice that might be derived from the prosecutor\u2019s statement\u201d). The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument regarding Tran\u2019s testimony did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, particularly where, as here, the remarks were \u201cdirected at [Tranj\u2019s believability, an issue raised by the defense and contested by both sides.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>430 Mass. 111, 119 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">3. <em>Relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the entire record pursuant to our responsibilities under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and see no reason to exercise our extraordinary power to reverse the verdict or reduce the conviction. It was for the jury to assess the credibility of Tran and for the jury to assess her identification of the defendant as the man who had inflicted the lethal injuries on the victim. They could observe Tran, could observe the defendant, could compare the similarity (if any) between the 1995 photograph selected by Tran and the defendant, and could draw their own conclusion about Tran\u2019s selection of that photograph and her later identification of the defendant in court as the stabber. It is not for us to resolve any questions of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\n<em>Order denying posttrial motion affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The judge severed Bol Choeum and Pov Hour\u2019s trial from the individual trials of Sokphann Chhim and Kimthy Un, who were also indicted in connection with the death of the victim. At the time of trial a fifth alleged participant, Thol Leang, had not been apprehended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The record reveals that the name of the individual shown in the photograph selected by Tran is variously described as Nak Choeum, or Chhoeun. We use the spelling on the back of the photograph selected by Tran.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The Commonwealth had proceeded on the mistaken belief that the photograph of BJ selected by Tran was in fact a photograph of the defendant. The mistake had apparently arisen because, according to a police witness, State Trooper Alan Hunte, the defendant had used the name Nak Chhoeun as an alias, and crimes that Nak Chhoeun had committed in 1995 were on the defendant\u2019s probation record. The Commonwealth proffered evidence that the defendant was \u201cBJ,\u201d and asserted that the Lynn and Revere police departments had conducted various field interviews of the defendant, including one in which he identified himself as BJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Tran testified that, when she first saw the Honda parked in the middle of Cross Street, the driver was not inside, but a man (whom she later came to know was the victim) returned to the automobile \u201c[f|ive, ten minutes\u201d after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the automobile in which she was riding pulled up behind it. Richardson testified that the victim remained in the automobile and sounded his horn to announce his presence. In his ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge, who also presided at the trial, adopted Richardson\u2019s account of the events.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b531-13\">According to Richardson\u2019s testimony at trial, Tran remained in the automobile.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b531-14\">There was much blood at the scene of the stabbing, but no matches were made to deoxyribonucleic acid taken from the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\">During a voir dire, a second Commonwealth witness, Phen Chhon, testified before the judge and out of the jury\u2019s presence that he had known someone by the name of Bol Choeum or BJ, that he had known BJ for some years, and that BJ had arrived at his house earlier on the day of the killing in a Cadillac and in the company of the codefendant and several other men. When testifying before the jury, however, Chhon did not identify the defendant as BJ, or as one of the men in the Cadillac who came to his house. Chhon did identify the codefendant, Hour. His testimony was to the effect that he could not remember how many men had arrived in the Cadillac.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The back of the 1995 photograph selected by Tran as a photograph of \u201cBJ\u201d contained the name \u201cNak Choeum\u201d with the birth date of February 4, 1976; height of five feet, three inches; and weight of 125 pounds. The back of the photograph of the defendant taken at the time of his arrest in 2001 for the murder of the victim indicated a birth date of April 7, 1972; height of five feet, one inch; and weight of 170 pounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Defense counsel argued to the jury in his closing: Tran \u201cwas wrong once, twice, three times. She is mistaken. This is mistaken identification. That\u2019s not lying. She just doesn\u2019t know and she sees one person in the court room and picks him out.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Certain sections of the writings on the backs of the other photographs, such as those suggesting gang affiliation, were redacted. Tran had not written on the back of the photographic array containing the defendant\u2019s photograph.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"AW7\">The judge instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">\u201c[L]et me explain to the jury that the written statements that the witness is reading on this exhibit and the prior two exhibits . . . , the language that she\u2019s reading is not being admitted for the truth of the <em>statements contained in that written statement. </em>It\u2019s solely being admitted because that\u2019s the nature of the way this witness identified these particular individuals that she allegedly saw at the time of the incident that she\u2019s described. But it\u2019s not being offered <em>for the truth of the statement contained therein.\u201d </em>(Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The judge instructed the jury with respect to each reading of the writings by Tran. No such limiting instruction was required for the photographic array containing the defendant\u2019s photograph on which Tran had not written anything.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Specifically, the defendant argues that the judge erroneously instructed that Tran\u2019s prior identification of the perpetrator of this crime as Nak Choeum, not Bol Choeum, \u201ccould not be received as substantive evidence of Bol [Choeum]\u2019s innocence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The judge\u2019s instructions to the jury were substantially similar to those we have approved where a defendant raises the issue of mistaken identification, and were sufficient to mitigate any suggestiveness inherent in an in-court identification. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass. 296, 310-311 (1979) (Appendix), as modified in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cuffie, </em>414 Mass. 632, 640-641 (1993) (Appendix), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santoli, </em>424 Mass. 837, 845 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Such a claim would, in any event, be difficult to sustain. It was Tran\u2019s statement to the police that BJ had participated in the victim\u2019s killing that caused the police to assemble a new array containing a photograph, among others, of the man the police believed was BJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Defense counsel\u2019s approach to the identification testimony throughout the trial, including his cross-examination of Tran, demonstrates that he was well aware of its importance. Several days after Tran testified and in anticipation of a different witness\u2019s testimony, defense counsel moved to preclude \u201can in-court identification of the defendant from any witness that has not previously made such an identification\u201d as \u201cinherently and unnecessarily suggestive.\u201d After voir dire of that witness, Phen Chhon, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion, although the witness ultimately failed to identify him. Defense counsel declined the judge\u2019s offer \u201cto attempt to create a less suggestive environment for an in-court identification\u201d because he did not \u201cthink that there is anything we could do in these circumstances that would diminish the suggestiveness.\u201d Moreover, at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, defense counsel moved for a required finding of not guilty based on \u201cthe identification issue,\u201d including his assertion that Tran\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant \u201cis diminished by the circumstances surrounding that identification.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
