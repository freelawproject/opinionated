The complaint in the Superior Court stated claims for negligence, misrepresentation, tortious interference with a dead body, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The defendants moved for summary judgment. Although the complaint contained only the aforementioned counts, materials submitted in connection with the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment essentially transformed the case into one involving issues of compliance with the Massachusetts version of the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA), G. L. c. 113, \u00a7\u00a7 7-13 (the statute). A judge granted summary judgment to the defendants after determining that the \u201cgood faith\u201d provision of the statute, G. L. c. 113, \u00a7 13 (c), provided them with immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Since the statute has not yet been construed in Massachusetts, we discuss the statute\u2019s provisions as they relate to this case, examine whether the defendants failed to comply with any provision of the statute, and if so, address whether the defendants are immunized against judgment by the \u201cgood faith\u201d provision, <em>id. </em>We conclude that most of the acts or omissions that generated this dispute did not contravene the statutory requirements and that, as to the sole statutory violation, the defendants are protected by the \u201cgood faith\u201d section.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">A brief overview of the statutory scheme is helpful to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>understanding of the dispute. The UAGA, as approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1968, was codified in Massachusetts (with changes immaterial to this case) as G. L. c. 113, \u00a7\u00a7 7-13. See St. 1971, c. 653. The UAGA was intended, among other things, to \u201cencourage the making of anatomical gifts\u201d by eliminating uncertainty as to the legal liability of those authorizing and receiving anatomical gifts, while respecting dignified disposition of human remains. Prefatory note to UAGA (1968), 8A U.L.A. 71 (Master ed. 2003). Improved clarity was particularly beneficial because, typically, time is very limited for consent and procurement of certain body parts. See, e.g., comment to UAGA (1968) \u00a7 <em>2(b), supra </em>at 117. Some variation of the UAGA was adopted by all fifty States and the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prefatory note to UAGA (1987), <em>supra </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">We summarize the portions of the statute that are pertinent to this appeal. Certain parties (essentially the next of kin of the decedent) may make an anatomical donation \u201cafter death or immediately before death,\u201d but a recipient is prohibited from accepting a gift where it has \u201cactual notice of contrary indications by the decedent\u201d or notice that the gift \u201cis opposed by\u201d certain other persons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> G.

L. c. 113, \u00a7 10 <em>(e). </em>At the time of the gifts in this case, hospitals or their designated representatives were required to \u201cinform\u201d certain persons of \u201cthe opportunity\u201d to authorize \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>gift of all or part of the decedent\u2019s body for purposes of organ and tissue transplantation.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> G.

L. c. 113, \u00a7 13 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The plaintiffs contend that the defendants\u2019 acts were not authorized by the statute, and seek to identify genuine issues of material fact to defeat the grant of summary judgment. This appeal requires that we interpret the provisions for the first time. We hold that the judge correctly concluded that no genuine issue of material fact prevented the allowance of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><em>Background. </em>On review of summary judgment, we make all permissible inferences favorable to the nonmoving party, here the plaintiffs, and resolve any disputes or conflicts in the summary judgment materials in their favor. <em>Willitts </em>v. <em>Roman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>Catholic Archbishop of Boston, </em>411 Mass. 202, 203 (1991). See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The evidence in the record viewed in this manner is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 sixteen year-old son, Adam Carey, was mortally injured in a vehicle mishap at the Kemwood Country Club in Beverly at about 10 a.m. on September 16, 2000. Adam received emergency treatment and was taken to a local hospital, but died about one hour later, at 10:58 a.m. Hospital staff discussed anatomical donation with the plaintiffs and then contacted the Organ Bank, whose representative, Jorge Duran, spoke with Adam\u2019s father, Richard Carey, by telephone about the giving of an anatomical gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The Organ Bank\u2019s procedure at the time called for its representative to read, by telephone, to the appropriate person (here, the father) a form entitled \u201cConsent for Organ and Tissue Donation,\u201d and record the responses. The form was essentially a lengthy checklist that permitted the parent or other authorized person to consent or refuse with respect to many specific tissues and organs, and to consent or refuse to allow use of gifts for medical research if the organs or tissues were determined to be unsuited to transplantation and therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Duran followed this procedure. At 1:06 p.m., about two hours after Adam expired, Duran completed the consent form while speaking with the father by telephone. Tara Conway, also an Organ Bank employee, listened to the conversation on another telephone and signed the form as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Federal regulations in effect at the time prohibited transplantation of organs and tissue if so much saline had been infused into the donor that the resulting dilution of blood would significantly affect testing for infectious diseases, and no preinfusion sample was available for testing. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1270.21(h)(2) (2000). Moments before Duran completed the consent form, a nurse at the hospital reported to Duran, among other things, that Adam had received substantial infusions of saline during emergency treatment, and that no preinfusion samples of his blood were available for testing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On receipt of this information, Duran had sufficient information to determine, had he performed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>necessary calculation, that Adam\u2019s tissues would not be suitable for human transplantation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Duran never told Adam\u2019s father that Adam might be ineligible to be a transplant donor. Instead, he completed the consent form. Adam\u2019s father made a gift of Adam\u2019s skin, blood vessels, eyes, and certain other tissues for transplantation or therapy. Duran recorded these responses. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, Adam\u2019s father refused to donate Adam\u2019s heart \u201cfor valves,\u201d brain, or a specific blood vessel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Duran indicated the opposite, i.e., that the father consented to a gift of these tissues and organs. Adam\u2019s father similarly refused to permit use of the tissues and organs for medical research if not useable for transplantation or therapy. Duran nonetheless wrote the opposite.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Organ Bank did not make an audio rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ording of the conversation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Based on Duran\u2019s rendering of the father\u2019s wishes, which we assume for purposes of this decision was inaccurate, the Organ Bank proceeded to harvest Adam\u2019s tissues. An organization apparently acting on its behalf, Cryolife, Inc., procured several blood vessels from Adam\u2019s body at about 8:30 p.m., including the vessel for which Adam\u2019s father refused consent. At about 9 p.m., the Eye &amp; Tissue Bank recovered Adam\u2019s corneas and a graft of skin. There is no evidence that Adam\u2019s heart valves and brain, for which Duran inaccurately recorded consent, were harvested, and there is no dispute with respect to these body parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">During the next few days, the defendants noted that the harvested tissues were unsuitable for transplantation for various reasons. The tissues were discarded, and no anatomical gifts were used for those purposes or for medical education or research.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Despite this, the defendants contacted the plaintiffs by letter to report erroneously they had achieved success rather than failure. The Eye &amp; Tissue Bank wrote that Adam\u2019s right cornea had been successfully transplanted. The Organ Bank wrote that the harvested blood vessels were in quarantine and would later be transplanted, although by that time they had been rejected. In a subsequent letter, the Eye &amp; Tissue Bank apologized for giving the plaintiffs incorrect information and explained that at the time of writing its letter, it had been \u201cmaking every effort to place Adam\u2019s tissue with local researchers,\u201d consent for which Adam\u2019s father had refused. The plaintiffs eventually asked for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the return of Adam\u2019s remains for internment; because the remains had already been discarded, that request was never fulfilled. TBI wrote on behalf of the Eye &amp; Tissue Bank that it \u201ctruly apologize[d] for th[e] miscommunication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Other activities of the defendant organizations are also relevant to the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments. The defendants are organized to promote, coordinate, and implement the recovery, preservation, and distribution of organs for charitable purposes. However, subsequent to these events, both the Organ Bank and TBI, the parent of the Eye &amp; Tissue Bank, realized financial benefits from transactions involving anatomical gifts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">As earlier described, the plaintiffs filed suit on various theories. The defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of showing that the defendants\u2019 actions were not \u201cin good faith in accordance with\u201d the statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A judge allowed the motion and dismissed the complaint. The plaintiffs appealed and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants did not adhere to the statute in several respects. They contend that G. L. c. 113, \u00a7 8 <em>(b), </em>prohibited the Organ Bank from soliciting their consent for anatomical donations, and that it is liable for having done so in this case; that, although not expressed in the statute, the Organ Bank must inform those authorizing anatomical donations of any circumstance affecting the usability for human transplantation of the gift, and that its failure to do so invalidated consent; and that the Organ Bank failed to \u201crecord\u201d consent as required in G. L. c. 113, \u00a7 10 <em>(e). </em>The plaintiffs further assert that the defendants \u201ctransgressed the scope of [the father\u2019s] consent\u201d as a result of these inappropriate acts and that disputed issues of fact preclude summary judgment. They also claim that the defendants\u2019 letters after these events provide a ground for liability outside the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>the statute. The defendants argue that they acted at all times \u201cin good faith in accordance with\u201d the statute and are thus immune.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">1. <em>'Standard of review. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate if the materials \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). Where the opposing party will have the burden of proof at trial, the moving party must demonstrate, by reference to materials properly in the summary judgment record, unmet by countervailing materials, \u201cthat the party opposing the motion has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of that party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u201cThat some facts are in dispute will not necessarily defeat a motion for summary judgment. The point is that the disputed issue of fact must be material. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 247-248 (1986). <em>Norwood </em>v. <em>Adams-Russell Co., </em>401 Mass. 677, 683 (1988).\u201d <em>Beatty </em>v. <em>NP Corp., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 607-608 (1991). Only those facts that, if true, provide a basis for a reasonable jury to find for a party are material. See <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 556-557 (1976). \u201cAs to materiality, the substantive law will identify which facts are material.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Liberty Lobby, Inc., supra </em>at 248. We examine the substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">2. <em>Statutory requirements. </em>General Laws c. 113, \u00a7 13 <em>(c), </em>provides a defense for acts \u201cin good faith in accordance with the terms of\u201d the statute. This requires a two-step analysis of the defendants\u2019 acts: first, whether they were \u201cin accordance\u201d with the technical requirements of the statute and, if not, whether they were nevertheless \u201cin good faith.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>id.; Lyon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>843 F. Supp. 531, 536 (D. Minn. 1994) (interpreting UAGA). We turn first to the question whether the defendants adhered to the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The plaintiffs contend that the defendants violated G. L. c. 113, \u00a7 8 <em>(b), </em>by participating in a discussion of the making of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>an anatomical gift for purposes of transplant when sufficient facts were available to the Organ Bank\u2019s representative to establish that consent would yield no useable gift.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 8 (b) implies a prohibition on solicitation of consent in such circumstances. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Section 8 (6), since amended, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>required that a hospital or its \u201cdesignated representative\u201d inform certain individuals of \u201cthe opportunity\u201d to donate gifts for transplantation, although a hospital was required to do so only if, among other things, consent would yield a gift appropriate for the purpose.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Nothing in the record indicates that the defendants were designated representatives of the hospital within the meaning of the statute, as then appearing. Instead, the uncontradicted evidence is that the hospital itself informed the plaintiffs of their \u201copportunity\u201d and then referred them to the Organ Bank for further steps in the donation process. The statute placed the burden on the hospital, not the Organ Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Even if the requirement of \u00a7 8 (b), as then in effect, did apply to these defendants, the section neither expressly nor implicitly prohibited what occurred here. On its face, the purpose of \u00a7 8 <em>(b) </em>was to ensure that in all cases where a gift would yield tissue or organs suitable for transplant, those authorized to consent to the giving of an anatomical gift were notified of their opportunity to do so.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 113, \u00a7 8 (b), as appearing in St. 1986, c. 360, \u00a7 2 <em>(b). </em>Constming the provision as a \u201cgag rule\u201d would subvert its purpose. Cf. <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Comm\u2019n, </em>407 Mass. 77, 82 (1990) (statutory interpretation should reasonably effect purpose).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>In the circumstances, \u00a7 8 <em>(b) </em>neither obliged nor prohibited a discussion of \u201cthe opportunity\u201d to make an anatomical gift. The duty to inform where certain conditions are present does not imply a prohibition in the absence of those circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Super, </em>431 Mass. 492, 497-498 (2000) (authorization to act in certain circumstances does not imply prohibition in absence of condition); <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>429 Mass. 560, 570 (1999) (same); <em>Child Support Enforcement Div. of Alaska </em>v. <em>Brenckle, </em>424 Mass. 214, 224 (1997) (same). Even if the notification requirement applied to the Organ Bank, the unsuitability of Adam\u2019s tissues negated any responsibility pursuant to the section. See <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Danvers, </em>411 Mass. 39, 45 (1991) (relating to contract law). We are satisfied that \u00a7 8 <em>(b) </em>did not prohibit the Organ Bank\u2019s solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Next, the plaintiffs attempt to import common-law notions of informed consent, see <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Childrens\u2019 Hosp. Med. Ctr., </em>387 Mass. 152, 155 (1982), to the area of post mortem anatomical donations. They argue that the Organ Bank should have apprised them of any articulable reason that Adam\u2019s gift might not qualify for human donation, and that the Organ Bank\u2019s failure to disclose information of this nature invalidated their consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The statute prescribes in detail the manner of obtaining consent for post mortem gifts. It provides in \u00a7 8 <em>(d) </em>that a parent (or another) may authorize a gift and that a donee may accept it unless contrary wishes were expressed by the donor or other persons with a similar connection to the decedent. The statute does not suggest any limitation with respect to disclosure of risk factors for unsuitability. See G. L. c. 113, \u00a7 8 <em>(d). </em>Expression of one or more limitations implies exclusion of all others. <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 620 (1997). Moreover, importing such a disclosure requirement would raise the specter of litigation whenever a donated organ later proved unsuitable for transplantation, thereby resurrecting the very disincentives the statute seeks to eliminate. Consent in accordance with \u00a78 <em>(d) </em>was all that was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Finally, the plaintiffs argue that they presented sufficient evidence to create a jury question whether the Organ Bank adequately recorded the father\u2019s consent. General Laws c. 113, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>\u00a7 10 (&lt;?), specifies that \u201c[a]ny gift by a person . . . [such as a father] shall be made by a document signed by him, or made by his telegraphic, recorded telephonic or other recorded message.\u201d A comment to the UAGA emphasizes that the provision addressed a problem encountered \u201c[frequently\u201d because \u201cthe next of kin are [often] far away.\u201d See comment to UAGA (1968) \u00a7 4, 8 U.L.A. 130 (Master ed. 2003). Allowing for recording of consent even when the next of kin are geographically distant has \u201cthe advantage of expediting the [consent] where time for effective action is short.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The plaintiffs advance two arguments with respect to the recording provision, \u00a7 10 <em>(e). </em>First, they argue that the Organ Bank\u2019s representative, Duran, erroneously indicated that the father had consented to the donation of certain body parts, as well as to their use in medical research, and therefore failed to \u201crecord\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10 <em>(e). </em>Obviously, the defendants dispute that Duran, the Organ Bank\u2019s agent, misconstrued the father\u2019s statements regarding consent, but we assume for purposes of summary judgment that Duran completed the consent checklist incorrectly in some respects. However, mere inaccuracy or defective information, in itself, does not constitute noncompliance with the \u201crecording\u201d requirement of the subsection. Section 10 <em>(e) </em>is concerned with the manner of recording, not fidelity or quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The plaintiffs also argue that \u00a7 10 <em>(e) </em>requires audio recording of telephonic consent, and that the Organ Bank did not comply with this provision. The Organ Bank concedes it made no voice recording. Consent here was by telephone, and \u00a7 10 <em>(e) </em>requires that such communications be \u201crecorded.\u201d In context, we think this means the capture of the father\u2019s voice for later reproduction and not simply transcription of the father\u2019s responses, as interpreted by Duran, on the Organ Bank\u2019s checklist. The Legislature explicitly set out a separate recording requirement for \u201ctelephonic\u201d messages, presumably to avoid arguments such as those in the present case. The explicit requirement cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the only statutory noncompliance they have demonstrated is the omission of the Organ Bank to record properly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>father\u2019s telephonic consent, see G. L. c. 113, \u00a7 10 (e). As we have explained, pursuant to \u00a7 8 <em>(b), </em>as then in effect, the obligation of informing the father of the donative opportunity was directed to the hospital and its representatives, and there is no evidence that the defendants served in either role here. Moreover, the section did not prohibit the solicitation of consent. Finally, \u00a7 8 <em>(d) </em>has displaced common-law notions of informed consent, and consent to a gift in accordance with the statute is all that is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">3. <em>Good faith. </em>Having identified an act or omission within the scope of the statute that did not comply with its requirements, i.e., failure to make a voice recording of telephonic consent, we proceed to examine whether the defendants nevertheless acted \u201cin good faith\u201d and are thus immune. G. L. c. 113, \u00a7 13 (c). We begin by addressing the meaning of \u201cgood faith\u201d in this context and the burdens at the summary judgment stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The majority of other courts interpreting the term \u201cgood faith\u201d in the UAGA have adopted the definition provided by <em>Nicoletta </em>v. <em>Rochester Eye &amp; Human Parts Bank, Inc., </em>136 Misc. 2d 1065, 1067-1068 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1987). We do the same. Good faith is defined in this context, as elsewhere, see, e.g., <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Stoughton, </em>403 Mass. 332, 337 (1988), <em>S.C., </em>406 Mass. 1001 (1989) (award of attorney\u2019s fees), as an honest belief, the absence of malice, or the absence of a design to defraud or to seek an unconscionable advantage over another. See <em>Nicoletta </em>v. <em>Rochester Eye &amp; Human Parts Bank, Inc., supra. </em>See also <em>Pardo </em>v. <em>General Hosp.

See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Saint Francis Hosp. &amp; Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>886 F. Supp. 1551, 1557, 1559 (D. Kan. 1995); <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>843 F. Supp. 531, 534-536 (D. Minn. 1994); <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Alabama Eye Bank, </em>727 So. 2d 62, 64 (Ala. 1999); <em>Rahman </em>v. <em>Mayo Clinic, </em>578 N.W.2d 802, 805, 807 (Minn. Ct.

App. 1996); <em>Sattler </em>v. <em>Northwest Tissue Ctr., </em>110 Wash. App. 689, 699 (2002). Cf. <em>Ramirez </em>v. <em>Health Partners of S. Ariz., </em>193 Ariz. 325, 328, 330 (Ct. App. 1998) (similar allocation of burden but different statutory language); <em>Kelly-Nevils </em>v. <em>Detroit Receiving Hosp., </em>207 Mich. App. 410, 419-420 (1994) (good faith immunity must affirmatively be pleaded by defendant). Contrast <em>Schembre </em>v. <em>Mid-America Transplant Ass\u2019n, </em>135 S.W.3d 527, 531 (Mo. Ct. App. 2004) (different statutory standard but burden of proving good faith or lack of negligence is on defendant). Thus, where a defendant moving for summary judgment contends, and makes at least a minimal showing, that it acted in good faith within the meaning of G. L. c. 113, \u00a7 13 <em>(c), </em>the burden falls to the plaintiffs to identify competent evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find to the contrary. See <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The good faith immunity \u201cis designed for situations . . . where because of confusion, an organ is removed without genuine consent.\u201d <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 536. Evidence of technical noncompliance with the statute will not suffice. See, e.g., <em>Sattler </em>v. <em>Northwest Tissue Ctr., supra </em>at 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Of course, the proffered evidence must not be \u201ctoo remote, according to the ordinary course of events,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>137 Mass. 245, 247 (1884) (Holmes, J.), and must be \u201crationally susceptible\u201d to the requested inference, <em>Wasserman </em>v. <em>Hollidge, </em>267 Mass. 460, 470 (1929). See G. L. c. 113, \u00a7 13 (c). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201cEvidence which merely raises a suspicion, or a surmise, or a conjecture, is not enough . . . .\u201d <em>Hillyer </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>154 Mass. 502, 504 (1891).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The plaintiffs argue that certain evidence in the record satisfied their burden. First, they argue that the defendants\u2019 noncompliance with the statute was \u201cegregious[j,\u201d and therefore is evidence of a lack of good faith. We disagree. While it may be possible that evidence of peculiarly pervasive noncompliance could warrant an inference that a defendant acted maliciously, possessed a design to defraud or to seek an unconscionable advantage over the plaintiffs, or acted out of something other than an honest belief, see <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Saint Francis Hosp. &amp; Med. Ctr., Inc., supra </em>at 1559; <em>Nicoletta </em>v. <em>Rochester Eye &amp; Human Parts Bank, Inc., supra, </em>we agree with the judge that the inference is not warranted from the single violation in this case. The few mistakes in the consent form that the plaintiffs deem a deviation from the statute provide no evidence of lack of good faith. Although the manner of recording was incorrect, the Organ Bank\u2019s interpretation of the statute was not unreasonable, and we are unaware of any previous authoritative construction to the contrary. In the absence of definitive guidance on the manner of recording, completion of a written form reflecting the responses, with a witness listening and signing the consent form, cannot be deemed a lack of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The plaintiffs also contend that the subsequent letters misinforming them of use of Adam\u2019s gifts showed lack of good faith. However, despite several months of discovery, the plaintiffs failed to show that the errors were connected to one another by more than a common lack of administrative accuracy. The letters may, perhaps, constitute circumstantial evidence of lack of care, but they give rise to no more than conjecture or suspicion of lack of good faith. See <em>Hillyer </em>v. <em>Dickinson, supra. </em>See also <em>Nicoletta </em>v. <em>Rochester Eye &amp; Human Parts Bank, Inc., supra. </em>The judge was correct to conclude that the letters were not probative of the issue of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs maintain that the financial relationships between the defendants and other entities show a lack of good faith. They suggest the relationships increased the defendants\u2019 \u201czest to recover\u201d anatomical gifts. However, the plaintiffs have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>failed to show any significant connection between the financial relationships, initiated well after the defendants destroyed Adam\u2019s donated tissue and organs, and any failure to adhere to the statute in this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, supra </em>(evidence must not be \u201ctoo remote\u201d). The inference of lack of good faith is unwarranted from the evidence in the record of the transactions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Thus, with respect to the sole instance of statutory noncompliance, the plaintiffs have not carried their burden of demonstrating a lack of good faith. See G. L. c. 113, \u00a7 13 (c). Summary judgment was appropriate with respect to the failure to record the gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">4. <em>Conduct not within scope of statute. </em>The plaintiffs advance a new argument on appeal, i.e., that the sending of inaccurate letters by the defendants is not subject to the immunity of G. L. c. 113, \u00a7 13 (c), because the statute is silent on the matter of postrecovery communication, and they maintain that the sending of the letters constituted negligence which caused them harm. In the Superior Court, the plaintiffs argued only that the letters were relevant to the issue of \u201cgood faith\u201d immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u201cAn issue not raised or argued below may not be argued for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Century Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Bank of New England-Bristol County, N.A., </em>405 Mass. 420, 421 n.2 (1989). The plaintiffs never put the judge on notice that they opposed summary judgment on this theory. Cf. <em>Douillard </em>v. <em>LMR, Inc., </em>433 Mass. 162, 168 n.3 (2001) (no waiver because not separate \u201ctheory\u201d of recovery). Thus, we deem the issue waived.
