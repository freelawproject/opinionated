The father, who lives in Trinidad, filed a petitian in the Suffolk Division of the Probate and Family Court Department (Probate and Family Court), pursuant to G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>c. 209B, \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 14, seeking enforcement of the terms of a consent decree, and related orders, entered in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago Family Court, Supreme Court of Judicature (Trinidad Family Court), which awarded the mother physical custody of the son, but prohibited either parent from taking the son out of Trinidad, except by agreement of the other parent or by court order. A judge in the Probate and Family Court granted the father\u2019s petition for enforcement of the Trinidad consent decree and ordered the mother to return the child to Trinidad no later than July 27, 2005. The judge denied the mother\u2019s motion for a stay pending determination of a motion for reconsideration and an evidentiary hearing. The mother obtained an emergency stay of the order from a single justice of the Appeals Court and appealed to that court. We transferred the case here on our own motion and now affirm the order for enforcement of the Trinidad consent decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The following facts do not appear to be in dispute. The parties are the biological parents of a son bom, out of wedlock, on April 5, 1991, in Trinidad. The son lived with his mother in Trinidad for the first several years of his life. In 1995, the mother relocated to Florida to pursue an education in medical radiography, leaving the son in Trinidad. During this time, the son lived in the home of his mother\u2019s brother from Monday through Friday and spent weekends at the home of the father and the father\u2019s wife. In 1996, at the mother\u2019s request, the son was sent to the United States to live with her. In early 1999, the son was sent back to Trinidad. He lived there with the father for four years, returning to the United States every summer to spend one month with the mother. During the son\u2019s visit with the mother in the summer of 2003, the mother (who, by this time, was married and living with her husband in Allston) informed the father that the son would not be returning to Trinidad as planned. She enrolled the son in public school, and he resided that year in Allston with the mother and her husband. He spent the summer of 2004 with the father in Trinidad and was due to return to the mother in Massachusetts on August 29. On August 24, the father advised the mother by telephone that the son would not be returning to Massachusetts but would remain with him in Trinidad. Beyond these facts, the affidavits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>and complaints of the mother and father present widely differing accounts of the dispute, which we need not set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">On August 25, the father filed an emergency application in the Trinidad Family Court for orders to make the son a ward of the court, to restrain the mother from removing him from Trinidad, and to award him custody. The matter was set down for hearing before a judge on September 2. On August 26, 2004, the mother filed a complaint to establish paternity in the Probate and Family Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That same day,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a judge issued an ex parte temporary order awarding sole legal and physical custody of the son to the mother and further providing that the son be returned to the United States by August 29. On or about August 27, the mother traveled to Trinidad, the temporary custody order in hand, with the goal of returning to the United States with the son. There she was served with papers informing her of the upcoming hearing in the Trinidad Family Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The mother and father, accompanied by their respective counsel, attended the September 2 hearing in the Trinidad Family Court. At the end of the hearing, an order was issued by the Trinidad Family Court that a consent decree enter in that court. As stated, the terms of the consent decree awarded custody of the son to the mother, with weekends, one-half of each school vacation, and alternate holidays to be spent with the father. The consent decree also prohibited either parent from removing the son from Trinidad, except by agreement of the other parent or by court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">On October 1, 2004, the mother and the son departed for the United States without the permission of the father (who was in London at the time) and without notifying the Trinidad Family Court. After an ex parte hearing on October 18, 2004, the Trinidad judge once again made the son a ward of the court and ordered the mother to return the son to Trinidad forthwith for a hearing and determination of custody. The son has remained with the mother in Allston and has not returned to Trinidad.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>On May 11, 2005, the father filed a petition in the Probate and Family Court seeking enforcement of the terms of the consent decree, and the related orders that were issued by the Trinidad Family Court on October 18. On June 10, the father filed a motion seeking to vacate the temporary custody order entered in the Probate and Family Court. On June 1, the mother filed an answer and counterclaim requesting that the custody issue be determined in Massachusetts, and on June 14, a motion seeking an investigation or, in the alternative, the appointment of a guardian ad litem (GAL) to represent the son\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">A hearing was held in the Probate and Family Court on June 28, 2005. The judge recognized that the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, G. L. c. 209B, governs any proceeding in which a custody dispute is presented for resolution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> General Laws c. 209B, inserted by St. 1983, c. 680, \u00a7 1, was modeled, in large part, on the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. See 9 (Part IA) U.L.A. 111 (Master ed. 1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under G. L. c. 209B, the judge was required, first, to determine whether the court had authority to exercise jurisdiction, and second, if such authority existed, whether it should be exercised in the circumstances of this case. See <em>Custody of Brandon, </em>407 Mass. 1, 5-6 (1990). After considering affidavits and other documents submitted by the parties, and hearing arguments of counsel, the judge declined to exercise jurisdiction over the case, vacated the temporary order granting the mother custody, and ordered enforcement of the Trinidad consent decree and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>dismissal of the mother\u2019s paternity petition. As stated, the judge further ordered the mother to return the child to Trinidad no later than July 27, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">A second hearing was held on July 25, in which the judge considered the mother\u2019s motions for reconsideration and for an evidentiary hearing, and for a stay of the order requiring the son\u2019s return to Trinidad. The mother\u2019s arguments focused on the factual circumstances underlying the Trinidad consent judgment, to which, according to the mother, she had agreed while under duress.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The mother\u2019s counsel also informed the judge of disturbing telephone calls to the mother\u2019s home in Allston on July 15, 2005, from a caller allegedly identifying himself as a judge of the High Court of Trinidad, who is also a friend and neighbor of the father, and from a caller allegedly identifying himself as the first caller\u2019s son.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The mother argued to the judge that the content of these calls supported her position that, if forced to return to Trinidad with the son, she could not expect justice from the Trinidad Family Court, and that she feared that she would never be allowed to see the son again if he is returned to Trinidad. The judge denied the motion for a stay, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We conclude that the judge in the Probate and Family Court properly declined to exercise jurisdiction over the custody dispute. The judge recognized that G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2 (d),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> bars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the exercise of jurisdiction while a custody proceeding is pending in another jurisdiction, and that G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 7 (a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides a judge with discretion to decline to exercise jurisdiction at any time prior to making a custody determination on concluding that jurisdiction would be based on the \u201cwrongful conduct\u201d of the party seeking jurisdiction. The judge further reasoned that, under the clear language of G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 14, she had no authority to disregard the custody determination of the Trinidad Family Court. The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 7 are generally phrased in reference to custody proceedings that are pending in other States, not proceedings in which a final custody determination has been made. See <em>Custody of Brandon, supra </em>at 8-9. The judge was correct, however, to recognize their applicability to circumstances in which a determination of custody had been entered in a court of another country. See <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 3), </em>392 Mass. 728, 733 (1984).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is \u00a7 14, however, the third statutory provision on which the judge relied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>on which we base our conclusion that the judge properly deferred to the Trinidad Family Court in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The dispute was the subject of a consent judgment already entered in the Trinidad Family Court. Section 14 of G. L. c. 209B provides: \u201cTo the extent that the legal institutions of other nations have rendered custody determinations in substantial conformity with the provisions of this chapter, the courts of the commonwealth shall grant due recognition to such determinations.\u201d Under \u00a7 14, the issue is not whether the Probate and Family Court had jurisdiction to determine the custody question pursuant to the mother\u2019s paternity complaint, but whether the judge had authority to exercise that jurisdiction in the face of the Trinidad consent decree. We conclude that she did not. Our analysis tracks standards reflecting the traditional doctrine of comity articulated by the Appeals Court in <em>Schiereck </em>v. <em>Schiereck, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 378, 380 (1982), citing generally <em>Kapigian </em>v. <em>Minassian, </em>212 Mass. 412, 415-416 (1912); J.F. Lombard, Family Law \u00a7 2383.5 (Supp. 1981); Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 98 (Approved Official Draft 1971), and approved by this court in <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 3), supra </em>at 735, for use in the context of G. L. c. 209B.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The facts of <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 3), supra, </em>are remarkably similar to those here. The father in that case had petitioned the Family Court in Sydney, Australia, in January, 1984, for custody of one of his two children after the mother, who had been living in Massachusetts with the children since February, 1983, informed him that she did not plan on returning the children to Australia as planned, despite a court order requiring her to do so. After a hearing in Australia (of which the mother had notice and at which she was represented by counsel), the Australian court awarded the father guardianship and custody of the child and further ordered that the child be returned to Australia forthwith. See <em>id. </em>at 730. The mother appealed from the Australian order, and the father filed a petition in the Probate and Family Court seeking its enforcement. The mother, meanwhile, sought resolution of the custody dispute in Massachusetts. The judge in the Probate and Family Court determined that, under G. L. c. 209B, the Australian court lacked jurisdiction and that the Probate and Family Court had jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>tian over the custody proceedings. See <em>id. </em>at 729. We concluded that the Australian court had jurisdiction and vacated the judge\u2019s ruling of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Because the mother\u2019s appeal of the custody order was still pending in the Australian court, our decision that the Family and Probate Court lacked jurisdiction was based, primarily, on our consideration of the mandates contained in G. L. c. 209B, \u00a72 <em>(d) </em>and (e).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 734. We took that occasion to comment, however, on the provision contained in \u00a7 14 regarding the enforcement of custody determinations of foreign countries. Although we noted that there might be occasions where recognition of a foreign country\u2019s custody determinations would not be owed, for example, when a determination is made in an \u201carbitrary or capricious manner,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 735, we left no room for doubt that \u00a7 14 compels a judge to \u201cgrant due recognition\u201d to custody determinations rendered by a court of a foreign country \u201cif those determinations have been rendered in substantial conformity with G. L. c. 209B.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further stated that, to meet the \u201csubstantial conformity\u201d test, three procedural components must be satisfied: (1) jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter; (2) applicable procedural and substantive law reasonably comparable to our laws; and (3) the foreign order must be based on a determination of the \u201cbest interests of the child.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Schiereck </em>v. <em>Schiereck, supra. </em>See <em>Akinci-Unal </em>v. <em>Unal, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 212, 220 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Those components are present in this case. Contrary to the mother\u2019s argument, the Trinidad Family Court had subject matter jurisdiction. That Massachusetts may be the son\u2019s \u201c[hjome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>state,\u201d as defined by G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is not determinative of jurisdiction. Such a determination would serve only to allow the Probate and Family Court judge to exercise jurisdiction, pursuant to G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2 (a),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in the first place; it would neither compel the judge to exercise jurisdiction, nor prohibit the Trinidad Family Court from doing so. Trinidad law vested the Trinidad Family Court with subject matter authority to adjudicate the custody issue. The mother appears to have conceded as much when she appeared, with counsel, at the hearing on September 2, 2004. The record contains a letter from the judge who conducted the Trinidad hearing advising that the mother was present at the hearing, with her attorney, and that the mother \u201cindicated that she intended to relocate permanently to Trinidad and Tobago and it was on that basis that a [cjonsent [ojrder was entered.\u201d The mother does not contradict these assertions and, significantly, describes the consent judgment, in her motion for reconsideration and an evidentiary hearing, as \u201ca negotiated agreement.\u201d See <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>406 Mass. 88, 90-91 (1989), citing <em>Insurance Corp. of Ireland </em>v. <em>Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, </em>456 U.S. 694, 702 n.9 (1982) (party who fails to litigate jurisdictional question in foreign forum, when \u201copportunity\u201d exists to do so, may not litigate that issue in Massachusetts in collateral attack on judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-22\">We have examined the documents contained in the record referencing procedural and substantive laws of Trinidad regarding custody matters. There can be no serious doubt that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>laws followed by the Family Courts in Trinidad are reasonably comparable to our own laws. Above all, the record demonstrates that Trinidad judges are bound by statute and case law to treat the welfare of the minor child as the paramount consideration in determining custody issues. The mother\u2019s insistence that the consent decree in this instance was reached without an independent evaluation of the son\u2019s \u201cbest interest\u201d can have no persuasive value, because the terms of the decree to which she now objects were reached on the basis of her agreement. It is clear that those terms did not authorize the mother\u2019s permanent removal of the son to Massachusetts. The mother should not be permitted to seek relief in Massachusetts because she is unable, or unwilling, to comply with conditions to which she previously agreed. See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>380 Mass. 454, 460 (1980) (three years before enactment of G. L. c. 209B, decision based, in part, on Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act). Any petition to remove the travel restrictions, or otherwise reconsider or modify the consent decree, at this time, must be addressed to the Trinidad Family Court. See G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2 <em>(e).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">We reject the mother\u2019s claim that the judge\u2019s refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing to afford her the opportunity to demonstrate that the Trinidad hearing was not a fair proceeding, or to allow the son to testify to his own wish to remain in the United States, violated her Federal and State constitutional rights to due process.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The order for enforcement of the Trinidad consent decree acted neither to remove the son from the mother\u2019s custody nor otherwise to deprive her of a fundamental liberty interest in the son. See <em>Custody of Lori, </em>444 Mass. 316, 317 (2005); <em>Care &amp; Protection of Erin, </em>443 Mass. 567, 570 (2005). An evidentiary hearing was not warranted. Contrast <em>Tazziz </em>v. <em>Tazziz, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 809, 813-816 (1988) (when judge failed to recognize discretion to hear custody dispute set for hearing in Israeli court, case remanded for evidentiary hearing to ensure adequate basis for determination of jurisdictional issues). There is nothing in G. L. c. 209B that would allow a court in Massachusetts to address the substantive merits of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>consent decree, or to otherwise evaluate its fairness or possible negative repercussions (including future immigration consequences), to the mother or son. See <em>Guardianship of Zeke, </em>422 Mass. 438, 446 n.12 (1996); <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 3), </em>392 Mass. 728, 734 (1984). \u201cIf a Massachusetts court had the power to disregard a foreign judgment by considering the propriety of that judgment in a substantive, rather than a procedural, sense, the very purpose of the law would be undermined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The circumstances would be different if the son\u2019s return to Trinidad raised credible concerns of physical harm to the son. The mother\u2019s allegation, contained in her answer and counterclaim filed in the Probate and Family Court, that she \u201cfears for the [son\u2019s] health and well being if the [son] is placed with the father,\u201d however, has no reasonable factual support in the record before us. This case presents a question of jurisdiction and raises no issue of domestic abuse.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Custody of Vaughn, </em>422 Mass. 590, 599-600 (1996) (judge making custody order required to make detailed findings of fact with regard to effect of domestic violence on child).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-20\">Here, the matter of custody has been determined, by agreement, in a court of competent jurisdiction in Trinidad, in substantial conformity with our laws. The father has filed, pursuant to G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 12,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a certified copy of the consent decree with the Probate and Family Court. It would, in these circumstances, be beyond the scope of the judge\u2019s discretion, under G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 14, not to defer to that court. Contrast <em>Bak </em>v. <em>Bak, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 614-615 &amp; n.8 (1987) (judge in Probate and Family Court had discretion not to defer jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tian to German court, where there were no pending custody proceedings, or previous valid custody determinations, elsewhere). We need not, therefore, address the mother\u2019s claim that the judge erred in ceding jurisdictional authority under \u00a7 2 <em>(d), </em>when the father\u2019s action in Trinidad had been filed a mere one day before the mother\u2019s action in Massachusetts, or her challenge to the judge\u2019s conclusion that she had committed \u201cwrongful conduct,\u201d under \u00a7 7 (a), when she traveled with the son to Massachusetts in violation of the terms of the consent decree.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The orders of the Probate and Family Court vacating the temporary order awarding custody to the mother and dismissing the mother\u2019s paternity complaint, and for enforcement of the Trinidad consent decree, and related orders, are affirmed.

The father asserts in his brief that Trinidad is a party to the Hague Convention, but \u201cthe treaty has not yet entered into force between the two countries; therefore, the provisions of the Hague Convention do not apply to the facts of this case.\u201d The mother, in turn, states in her brief that \u201cTrinidad is not one of the signatories to [the Hague] [C]onvention and thus the particular principles of comity do not apply.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Although this court has recognized that our statute differs from the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act \u201cin material respects,\u201d any differences in the two statutes are not relevant to this case. <em>Custody of Brandon, </em>407 Mass. 1, 6 n.4 (1990), quoting <em>Tazziz </em>v. <em>Tazziz, </em>26 Mass.

L. c. 209B, \u00a7 1, the \u201c[h]ame state\u201d is \u201cthe state in which the child immediately preceding the date of commencement of the custody proceeding resided with his parents, a parent, or a person acting as parent, for at least 6 consecutive months . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b114-29\">Section 2 <em>(a) </em>(1) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-30\">\u201cAny court which is competent to decide child custody matters has jurisdiction to make a custody determination by initial or modification judgment if . . . the commonwealth (i) is the home state of the child on the commencement of the custody proceeding, or (ii) had been the child\u2019s home state within six months before the date of the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from the commonwealth because of his or her removal or retention by a person claiming his or her custody or for other reasons, and a parent or person acting as parent continues to reside in the commonwealth . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The mother did not formally request an evidentiary hearing at the June 28 hearing, but included a request to reopen the proceedings and conduct an evidentiary hearing as part of her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b116-29\">We neither discount nor credit the mother\u2019s allegations contained in the supplemental affidavit. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>Nothing in the affidavit, or anywhere else in the record, alleges any history of abuse by the father against the son. The telephone calls described in the affidavit are not alleged to be from the father, nor is there any evidence that they were made at his behest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b116-34\">Section 12 <em>(a) </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-35\">\u201cA certified copy of a custody judgment of another state may be filed in the office of the clerk or register of any court of competent jurisdictian in the commonwealth. The clerk or register shall treat the judgment in the same manner as a custody judgment of a court of the commonwealth. A custody judgment so filed has the same effect and shall be enforced in like manner as a custody judgment rendered by a court of the commonwealth.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\">We note, however, that the judge appeared to fault the mother for failing to inform the Probate and Family Court, on August 26, 2004, of the matter pending in the Trinidad Family Court, and in failing to inform the father, or the Trinidad Family Court, of her own paternity complaint and the temporary ex parte custody order, when she appeared in that court on September 2. There is nothing in the record that suggests the mother\u2019s awareness, on August 26, of the Trinidad proceeding filed only the previous day, or that demonstrates the father\u2019s lack of awareness, on September 2, that the mother had already obtained an ex parte temporary custody order in Massachusetts. There appears to be an unresolved factual dispute on the latter point, but one that is not material to our resolution of the jurisdictional question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
