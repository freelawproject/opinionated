His convictions were affirmed by the Appeals Court in an unpublished memorandum and order entered pursuant to its rule 1:28. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 1120 (2005). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review on the limited issue whether a judge in the Superior Court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress an incriminating statement made by the defendant, who had an attorney, to an investigator with the Department of Social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Services (department) who interviewed him at jail without his attorney present. We conclude that the statement should have been suppressed, but that the admission of the evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence indicated the following. In the fall of 2001, the victim, who was then fourteen years of age, and the defendant, her uncle, resided in the same house in the town of Orange. On the evening of November 5, the victim accompanied the defendant on a drive to Winchester, New Hampshire, to purchase cigarettes. On their return to Massachusetts, the defendant drove to a remote location and stopped his vehicle in a field, explaining to the victim that he \u201cneeded to go to the bathroom.\u201d There were no houses anywhere around. The victim waited in the passenger seat of the vehicle. On his return, the defendant entered the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle, reached over the center console, and lifted a lever on the side of the passenger seat that caused the victim\u2019s seat to fall backward. The defendant then climbed over the center console and on top of the victim. The defendant used one hand to hold down the victim\u2019s hands and with his other hand fondled the victim\u2019s breasts. The victim told the defendant to stop and screamed for help. The defendant ignored her screams, pulled her jogging pants and underwear down below her knees, pried apart her legs, and inserted his penis into her vagina. The victim cried out in pain. The defendant eventually withdrew his penis, spilling some ejaculate onto the victim\u2019s pants. The defendant cautioned the victim that he would kill her if she told anyone what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In February, 2002, the victim discovered that she was pregnant. She informed everyone that the baby\u2019s father was her boy friend at the time, because she was ashamed and did not want it known that her baby was an \u201cincest baby.\u201d On July 14, 2002, the victim finally disclosed the facts of the rape to her mother and a friend, who immediately reported the rape to the Orange police. A few days later, the victim gave birth to a baby girl. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing on blood samples taken from the victim and her daughter, and a buccal swab taken from the defendant, demonstrated that, in the Caucasian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>population, it was twenty-one million times more likely that the defendant was the baby\u2019s biological father as opposed to the biological father being a randomly selected male.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The defendant contended at trial that he was living with family members in Maine in November, 2001, and that the victim had fabricated the charges against him in order to \u201ctake the heat off\u201d of her boy friend (who, as an adult, could have been prosecuted for statutory rape). The defendant challenged the victim\u2019s testimony with respect to the sudden manner in which the defendant had lowered the back of her seat by introducing in evidence a photograph of a blue Pontiac LeMans automobile, purported to be the same vehicle driven by the defendant that night. The vehicle depicted in the photograph was equipped not with a lever but with a knob that, when turned, lowered the seat back slowly in increments. The defendant also attempted to impeach the victim with an alleged statement made to the defendant\u2019s son that any intercourse between herself and the defendant had not been forced.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">1. The factual background of the motion to suppress (drawn from the motion judge\u2019s findings of fact) is as follows. On July 15, 2002, the department received a report, filed pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A, alleging sexual abuse of the victim by the defendant. Two days later, a department investigator, Brenda Mozdzierz, a trooper from the Massachusetts State police detective unit, Walter Dacyczyn, and a victim witness advocate from the district attorney\u2019s office met as part of a Sexual Abuse Intervention Network (SAIN)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> team to interview the victim. As the department investigator assigned to the victim\u2019s case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Mozdzierz was responsible for investigating and evaluating whether the allegations against the defendant could be substantiated. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 5IB. After the interview ended, Trooper Dacyczyn sent a memorandum to the department requesting that Mozdzierz refrain from making any contact with the defendant until further notice, and gave no direction to Mozdzierz with respect to his own investigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Some time thereafter, Mozdzierz became aware that the defendant was scheduled to appear in the Probate and Family Court on July 23. Mozdzierz believed that, as a member of a SAIN team, she had an obligation to report this information to the investigating police officer. Consequently, she left a message informing Trooper Dacyczyn of the defendant\u2019s court date and further advising him that she had heard that the defendant often flees from the area when he is in trouble. The defendant appeared in the Probate and Family Court on July 23 in connection with a case involving custody of his daughter. On July 24, Trooper Dacyczyn interviewed the defendant regarding the allegations and then placed him under arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">At his arraignment in the Greenfield Division of the District Court Department the next day, the defendant was appointed counsel and ordered held in lieu of posting bail. After learning that the defendant was in custody, Mozdzierz arranged to interview him and, on July 30, met with him in a \u201cfenced in\u201d area at the Franklin County house of correction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She advised him that she was working with the SAIN team as part of a joint investigation with the district attorney\u2019s office and handed him a department brochure. She explained the investigative process and informed the defendant that he had a right to refuse to speak with her and that he could have his attorney present. On being told that the defendant had a lawyer, Mozdzierz inquired whether he wanted his lawyer to be present at the interview and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>advised him that the interview was voluntary. She did not, however, advise him that the information he gave could be used in court proceedings. The defendant agreed to speak with Mozdzierz.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The interview lasted between forty-five minutes and one hour. From the outset of the interview, the defendant denied raping his niece. When Mozdzierz repeatedly asked the defendant whether he had ever had a sexual relationship with her, the defendant declined to answer and, finally, stated that he needed to speak with his lawyer. Mozdzierz wrote a report of her investigation, pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B, including her interview with the defendant, that was forwarded to the district attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The judge accepted Mozdzierz\u2019s testimony that she sought to interview the defendant in performance of her duties as a department investigator, but found that her questions were directed solely toward the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt. The judge further found that, because SAIN teams conduct joint investigatians of child sexual abuse allegations, Mozdzierz understood that the report would be sent to the district attorney\u2019s office, and that the report was also independently required to be sent to the district attorney\u2019s office and local law enforcement authorities, pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B (4). The judge reasoned, nevertheless, that the department is not a law enforcement agency within definitions of that term appearing in the General Laws (see, e.g., G. L. c. 22A, \u00a7 1; G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1; G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 32 <em>[d\\)\\ </em>that nothing in the agency\u2019s statutory or regulatory framework, or in the creation of SAIN teams, indicates that department employees have any law enforcement powers; and that Mozdzierz was not under the direct supervision of Trooper Dacyczyn. The judge determined that the defendant had not demonstrated that the police \u201c \u2018took some action . . . that was designed deliberately to elicit incriminating remarks,\u2019 <em>Kuhlmann </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>447 U.S. 436, 459 (1986), or that they \u2018knowing[ly] exploited] ... an opportunity to confront the [defendant] without counsel being present.\u2019 <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Moulton, </em>474 U.S. [159, 176 (1985)].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bandy, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 329, 334-335 (1995). Accordingly, the judge concluded that Mozdzierz\u2019s interview of the defendant did not constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>violation of his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The judge did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>443 Mass. 597 (2005). In that case, we affirmed the partial suppression of statements made by a defendant in response to specific questions posed by a court officer on the ground that the statements were made in violation of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. The Commonwealth acknowledged in the <em>Hilton </em>case that the defendant\u2019s right to counsel had attached at the time of her conversation with the court officer. See <em>id. </em>at 614. We recognized that the principle prohibiting government agents from \u201cdeliberately eliciting]\u201d statements from a defendant without his lawyer present, <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 206 (1964), \u201cnot only prohibits direct interrogation of a defendant, but more generally prohibits any \u2018knowing exploitation by the State of an opportunity to confront the accused without counsel being present.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, supra, </em>quoting <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Moulton, supra. </em>Once the Sixth Amendment right to counsel has attached, we stated, the <em>Massiah </em>and <em>Moulton </em>decisions, and others in their constitutional wake, see, e.g., <em>Kuhlmann </em>v. <em>Wilson, 477 </em>U.S. 436, 457 (1986); <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>475 U.S. 625, 630 (1986); <em>United States </em>v. <em>LaBare, </em>191 F.3d 60, 64 (1st Cir. 1999), make clear that governmental efforts to elicit incriminating information from an accused are prohibited and the scope of this prohibition includes questioning by a government official or an agent of such an official. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, supra </em>at 615. We reasoned that court officers, while not police officers, are authorized to perform police duties, see G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 70A, wear a uniform and a badge, and may be required to report observations of criminal activity to a supervisor or the police. We concluded, therefore, that court officers are agents of law enforcement authorities for Sixth Amendment purposes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, supra </em>at 616, 617. We went on to say that, leaving the law enforce-</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>ment analysis aside, court officers are required, as part of their usual employment duties, to interact with defendants without counsel present, and \u201cby virtue of their presence in the court room during ongoing proceedings, court officers regularly become aware . . . of the nature of the pending charges and the specific evidence against a defendant. The right to the assistance of counsel would be seriously \u2018dilute[d],\u2019 <em>[Maine </em>v. <em>Moulton, supra </em>at 171,] if court officers could, on their own initiative, question defendants about their pending cases and then turn a defendant\u2019s incriminating responses over to the police and prosecutor.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, supra </em>at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">What was said in our <em>Hilton </em>decision is dispositive here, a conclusion that the Commonwealth does not strenuously contest. Although the court officer in the <em>Hilton </em>case was deemed to be an agent of law enforcement, our holding did not rest on that particular fact pattern. See <em>id. </em>at 614-615. Our primary concern was, and remains, with the constitutional implications of questioning on matters concerning pending charges posed by persons whose official duties direct them to interact with a defendant and who may be required to turn any incriminating responses over to the police and prosecutor. \u201cThe command of <em>Massiah </em>and its progeny is that we not tolerate interrogation practices by government officials or their agents that will provide the prosecution with the \u2018equivalent of direct police interrogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617, quoting <em>Kuhlmann </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 459. A department investigator is a government official, and there can be no question that Mozdzierz\u2019s interview of the defendant, even though conducted in furtherance of her responsibilities for the care and protection of children, was prohibited governmental interrogation and constituted the equivalent of direct police interrogation. The admission of her testimony was, therefore, error.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">2. We now inquire whether the error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and in the admission of the testimony of the department investigator requires a new trial. We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the error was presumptively prejudicial and, as such, mandates reversal. The United States Supreme Court has explained that a violation of a defendant\u2019s right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>United States Constitution requires reversal only in \u201ccases in which the deprivation of the right to counsel affected \u2014 and contaminated \u2014 the entire criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Satterwhite </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>486 U.S. 249, 257 (1988). Where the error \u201ccaused by [the] Sixth Amendment violation is limited to the erroneous admission of particular evidence at trial,\u201d as is the case here, the harmless error analysis applies. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vao Sok, </em>435 Mass. 743, 753 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>411 Mass. 249, 259-260 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>392 Mass. 647, 651 (1984).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under that analysis \u201c[t]he admission of testimony obtained in violation of [the] defendant\u2019s [right to counsel] will not amount to reversible error \u2018if the reviewing court may confidently say, on the whole record, that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>420 Mass. 67, 73 (1995), quoting <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 681 (1986). To make that determination, we examine a number of factors, including the importance of the evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case, the frequency of reference to the evidence, whether it was cumulative of other evidence and whether the other evidence against the defendant was overwhelming. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>413 Mass. 498, 509 n.11 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>Sinnott, </em>399 Mass. 863, 872 n.8 (1987).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>430 Mass. 505, 511 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Examination of the record of the entire trial satisfies us that the error could not have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. In addition to the victim\u2019s own testimony describing the rape, the Commonwealth introduced DNA evidence that virtually mandated the conclusion that the defendant was the father of the victim\u2019s child. In his defense, the defendant offered testimony that the defendant was in Maine in November of 2001; that the vehicle he drove on November 5, 2001, had a knob that required turning for the seat to fall back slowly; that the victim had stated that her boy friend was the father of her child; and that her boy friend had told a cellmate the same. To shore up his claim that the victim\u2019s account of rape was not to be believed, the defendant offered testimony of his son that the victim had told him no force was involved. The jury obviously believed the victim\u2019s testimony that a forcible assault took place. The only material evidence adduced from Mozdzierz\u2019s improper questioning, offered by the Commonwealth in rebuttal, was the defendant\u2019s admission that his last contact with the victim had been eight to nine months earlier, an estimate consistent with a period of time when the victim was impregnated. We conclude that the error in admitting Mozdzierz\u2019s testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">3. The order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is reversed, and an order is to enter allowing the motion. The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The Sexual Abuse Intervention Network (SAIN) was developed to avoid multiple interviews of children who may have suffered abuse. A SAIN team typically is comprised of members of several different agencies, one or more who interview the child, while the representatives of other agencies watch from behind a mirrored window. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam, </em>444 Mass. 224, 227 n.4 (2005). As indicated above, the victim\u2019s interview in this case was conducted in the presence of representatives from the Department of Social Services (department), the State police, and the district attorney\u2019s office. There was no two-way mirror. Although the Appeals Court has acknowledged that electronic recordings of SAIN interviews are \u201cgood practice,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton U., 59 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 252, 255 (2003), neither the Appeals Court, nor this court, has required that such recordings be made, and none was made in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Trooper Dacyczyn was unaware that SAIN teams ordinarily undertake cooperative investigations of sexual abuse allegations and, consequently, intended to conduct his own independent investigation into the victim\u2019s allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The defendant, apparently, raised no issues regarding the propriety of Trooper Dacyczyn\u2019s interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Mozdzierz did not notify the defendant\u2019s counsel or Trooper Dacyczyn of this meeting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The judge in her memorandum of decision also rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that he had been denied his right to counsel under art 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. On appeal, the defendant raises only his Sixth Amendment right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>373 Mass. 438, 443 (1979), governs here is misplaced. In that case, Federal law enforcement officials intentionally made disparaging statements to the defendant about his counsel in \u201ca calculated attempt to coerce the defendant into abandoning his defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Manning </em>decision makes plain that the Sixth Amendment violation was of such an egregious nature that automatic reversal was required. See <em>id. </em>at 441, 443. The court did not, however, adopt an automatic reversal rule as the decisions cited in the text confirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Here, the violation of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel did not reach the level of the very serious violation that occurred in the <em>Manning </em>case. Nothing in the judge\u2019s findings, or in testimony presented during the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, raises an inference that Mozdzierz deliberately subverted the defendant\u2019s right to counsel. Indeed, the record shows that the interview commenced with her suggestion that the defendant could have his counsel present. Nor was there evidence that Mozdzierz pressured the defendant to talk to her, directly or indirectly, by using his pending case in the Probate and Family Court, in which the department was involved, as leverage to obtain information she sought. Of course, based on our decision that department investigators are not permitted to engage in these types of interviews in the future, without counsel present, any problem of improper \u201cpressure\u201d by department officials will not arise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
