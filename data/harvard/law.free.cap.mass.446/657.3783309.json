Mammone, who suffers from bipolar disorder and claims that he was terminated due to his mental disability, brought suit against the President and Fellows of Harvard College (university) under the Commonwealth\u2019s employment discrimination statute, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 103.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Relying principally on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>United Airlines, Inc., </em>421 Mass. 55 (1995) <em>(Garrity), </em>a judge in the Superior Court granted the university\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that, because of his misconduct in the workplace, Mammone could not reasonably expect to prove that he was a \u201cqualified handicapped person,\u201d a required showing for protection under both statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">A \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d is one \u201cwho is capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job, or who would be capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job with reasonable accommodation to his handicap.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (16). In granting summary judgment, the judge found that the workplace misconduct that led to Mam-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>mane\u2019s termination was egregious and sufficiently inimical to the interests of his employer that it would have resulted in the termination of a nonhandicapped employee. In these circumstances, the judge concluded, it would be impossible for Mammone to show that he was \u201ccapable of performing the essential functions\u201d of his job. Mammone appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Mammone contends that the reasoning of <em>Garrity </em>\u2014 that a handicapped employee who engages in egregious workplace misconduct can be held to the same standard as a nonhandicapped employee who engages in similar misconduct \u2014 should be strictly limited to cases involving misconduct resulting from drug or alcohol dependence (as opposed to other handicaps). We conclude otherwise. Nothing in the language we used in <em>Garrity </em>suggests that our holding was meant to be so narrow, and we do not discern any legislative intent to create a distinction that would provide different protections against discrimination to persons suffering from one form of handicap (alcoholism) than the protections provided to persons suffering from other disabilities. Because we conclude that <em>Garrity </em>applies to all employment discrimination cases brought under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), and G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 103, regardless of the type of handicap underlying the workplace misconduct, we affirm the grant of summary judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>We recount the facts in their light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>most favorable to Mammone. See, e.g., <em>Joslyn </em>v. <em>Chang, </em>445 Mass. 344, 345 (2005); <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass 117, 120 (1991), citing Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). Mammone worked as a staff assistant at the university\u2019s Peabody Museum (museum) from January, 1996, until his termination on March 7, 2003.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He was usually stationed at the museum\u2019s receptionist desk in the main lobby. Among other responsibilities, Mammone was required to direct individual visitors and tour groups to destinations inside the museum, as well as answer any questions such guests might have. In this position, Mammone had significant contact with the public.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Mammone suffers from bipolar disorder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This mental disease manifests itself in occasional periods of mania (of which paranoia, agitation, hyperactivity, and irrationality are symptoms) and occasional periods of depression. Although Mammone was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1987, there is no evidence that, previous to the incidents at issue in this case, his mental disease ever negatively affected his ability to perform his workplace duties. Indeed, there is scant evidence that any of Mammone\u2019s supervisors or coworkers knew of Mammone\u2019s health problems before the events in question.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> During the course of his employment, Mammone received both annual salary increases and positive formal reviews from supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">In the middle of August, 2002, Mammone apparently experienced a manic episode. This episode led to workplace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>misconduct that eventually resulted in his termination. On August 18, Mammone established a website to decry what he believed were the low wages the university pays some of its employees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On August 20, while on duty at the museum, he began to distribute flyers summarizing and advertising his website. He also engaged coworkers in loud and animated conversations regarding his website and its content. He frequently used his personal laptop computer to access and update his website during his shift. According to his own testimony, Mammone would sing along with, clap to, and dance to protest songs from his website while stationed at the receptionist desk.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On August 22, Mammone\u2019s supervisor, Michele Piponidis, informed him, both orally and in writing, that he should not use his laptop computer at work. The next day Mammone sent an electronic mail message to Piponidis refusing to follow her instructions. He continued to bring his laptop computer to work, and to use it in the manner described above, until the date of his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Mammone\u2019s manic episode appeared to reach its zenith between August 29 and September 4. On August 29, when he could not find the keys to his house, he began to believe that a conspiracy had formed against him. That night, Mammone stayed at a local YMCA. However, because he believed persons at the YMCA were also involved in the conspiracy, he telephoned the police the next morning. Although Mammone thereafter was brought to a hospital for overnight examination,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> he did not meet the criteria for involuntary civil commitment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>and was thus released at his own insistence on August 31.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On September 3, subsequent to the Labor Day holiday, Mammone returned to work, his mania only worsening.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That day, a staff member of the museum\u2019s public programs office explained to Piponidis that Mammone\u2019s \u201cbelligerent attitude is not only affecting [the museum\u2019s] staff, but also visitors to the museum.\u201d That night, Mammone was contacted by his union representative, who left him with the impression that Piponidis was seeking to meet with Mammone and a representative of the university\u2019s office of labor and employee relations for the purpose of terminating his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">On the morning of September 4, 2002, Mammone arrived at work in brightly colored, traditional East Indian dress and adorned with necklaces, bracelets, and rings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While at his desk, he telephoned the police, his mother, his sister, and an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and spoke to each person \u201cvery loudly.\u201d When Piponidis approached him and asked him to join her in a private conference room, Mammone refused. He dismissively flicked his hand at her, saying, \u201cPsst, get away from me, you\u2019re evil.\u201d Piponidis left the lobby and returned with both Mary Reynolds, the museum\u2019s human resources administrator, and two university police officers. The officers informed Mammone that Piponidis and Reynolds wanted him to leave the museum and attend a meeting at the university\u2019s office of labor and employee relations the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>ing day. When Mammone refused the officers\u2019 request, they explained that if he did not leave after five warnings, he would be arrested for trespassing. After the officers\u2019 second warning, Mammone left his desk and sat on the floor in the middle of the lobby. After another three warnings, the officers handcuffed Mammone and placed him under arrest. Because he refused to move, the officers were forced to drag Mammone from the museum. During his arrest, he was told by the police not to return \u201chere.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Mammone was charged with trespassing and disorderly conduct and arraigned in the Cambridge Division of the District Court Department.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Immediately after his arraignment, Mammone walked back to the museum area to assure his friend, who had witnessed the incident, that he was unharmed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Mammone waited outside the museum for the end of his friend\u2019s shift. Then, before the end of the workday, Mammone entered the lobby of a second university museum, the Museum of Natural History, which was adjacent to and internally connected with the museum. Mammone did not believe that the arresting officer\u2019s admonition not to return \u201chere\u201d included any location other than the museum itself. Using a telephone in the lobby of the Museum of Natural History, Mammone telephoned the ACLU. During this conversation, Piponidis saw Mammone, approached him, and instructed him to leave the building. Mammone ended his telephone call, left the telephone booth, pointed at Piponidis (and Reynolds, who had joined Piponidis in the lobby close to the telephone booth), and stated, \u201cYou fucking whack bitches are going down.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Mammone then walked past the women and left the building. Reynolds followed Mammone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>and hailed a nearby university police officer, who told Mammone to leave the university\u2019s campus.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">On that same day, after Mammone\u2019s arrest, but before the confrontation in the Museum of Natural History, Piponidis had written and sent to Mammone a \u201cfinal written warning,\u201d see note 15, <em>supra, </em>summarizing his problematic workplace misconduct and indicating that this misconduct had \u201cbecome progressively more and more disruptive\u201d and was \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d The next day, September 5, Piponidis sent a superseding letter to Mammone, informing him that his return to the museum after his arrest, his subsequent conduct toward Piponidis and Reynolds, and the conduct described in the previous letter was grounds for immediate discharge and that this discharge was \u201ceffective at the end of business . . . September 4, 2002.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">At some point over the next few days, Mammone\u2019s union representative convinced officials at the university not to \u201cprocess [Mammone\u2019s] termination immediately so that [he] could apply for short-term disability [benefits].\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Piponidis then wrote a third letter to Mammone which superseded the September 5 letter, confirming that the university would \u201cdelay the effective date of [his] termination ... to allow [him] an opportunity to apply for Short-term Disability . . . benefits.\u201d The letter explained that Mammone\u2019s employment would terminate \u201ceffective the day the . . . benefits end.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Mammone first applied for disability benefits on September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>9, 2002. Based on a September 12 examination, Dr. Irving Allen, a psychiatrist at the university\u2019s health services, informed the university\u2019s disability claims unit that Mammone could not work due to a bipolar disorder and recurrent depression, and that this incapacity would likely last between thirty and ninety days. Mammone\u2019s application was granted on September 23. On October 22, Dr. Allen recommended another sixty days of disability benefits, explaining that Mammone\u2019s \u201cirritability . . . and agitation persist.\u201d On December 12, Dr. Allen requested that Mammone be given an additional sixty days of benefits, noting that, while Mammone was \u201cmaking significant improvement,\u201d he was \u201cnot stable enough to return to work.\u201d A similar request was successfully made by Dr. Allen on January 30, 2003. In clinician notes dated February 14, 2003, Dr. Allen reported marked improvement, but added that Mammone was \u201cfeeling depressed\u201d and that \u201c[t]here are still tinges of mania . . . .\u201d On March 5, 2003, Mammone\u2019s disability benefits expired. On March 7, 2003, his termination became effective. Although a jury could have found that Mammone was well enough to return to work on that date,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> there was no evidence that Dr. Allen or anyone else ever informed the university that this was the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">On December 9, 2002, approximately three months after Mammone began receiving short-term disability benefits, an attorney informed the university in writing that she had been retained to represent Mammone in a discrimination action against the university. Her letter noted that the university had offered Mammone \u201c[n]o reasonable accommodation, such as time off in which to get better . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. A </em>moving party will prevail on summary judgment, where the party opposing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>motion bears the burden of proof at trial, only if the moving party demonstrates, by reference to the material described in mie 56 (c), unmet by countervailing materials, that the nonmoving party has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of the case. <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991). It is sufficient that the moving party demonstrate that \u201cproof of [a required] element is unlikely to be forthcoming at trial.\u201d <em>Flesner </em>v. <em>Technical Communications Corp., </em>410 Mass. 805, 809 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">b. <em>The </em>Garrity <em>decision. </em>In <em>Garrity, </em>a terminated United Airlines customer service representative, Mary Garrity, brought a discrimination claim against her former employer under G. L. c. 15IB. We affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant airline because we concluded that Garrity could not reasonably expect to prove that she was a qualified handicapped person, as defined in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (16). <em>Id. </em>at 63. Because establishing that she was \u201cqualified for the position from which she was fired\u201d is a requirement of a prima facie case under G. L. c. 151B, Garrity\u2019s inability to do so was fatal to her claim. See <em>id. </em>at 60, 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Garrity suffered from alcoholism. As part of her employment, she was asked to distribute \u201cchits\u201d to passengers, which could be exchanged for free drinks during flight. When some passengers declined the chits, Garrity, irresistibly compelled by her disease, kept them for herself. After her shift, she boarded a United Airlines flight, paying a significantly reduced employee fare. On the flight, Garrity exchanged the chits for free drinks, \u201cbecame intoxicated and began drawing attention to herself and to the fact that she was a United Airlines employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57. Garrity \u201cdemanded excessive service and attention\u201d and complained to and in front of passengers \u201cabout how United \u2018screws us.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>United Airlines terminated Garrity for \u201cviolating company policies by accepting \u2018drink chits\u2019 from customers, using those chits while flying on a United pass . . . and for becoming intoxicated\u201d while on the flight. <em>Id. </em>at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">In affirming summary judgment, we reasoned that a disabled individual cannot be a qualified handicapped person \u201cif he commits misconduct which would disqualify an individual who did not fall under the protection of the statute\u201d (i.e., a non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>handicapped employee). See <em>id. </em>at 62-63, quoting <em>Wilber </em>v. Brady, 780 F. Supp. 837, 840 (D.D.C. 1992). We noted that \u201c[n]othing in c. 151B suggests a legislative intent that a lower standard of qualifying conduct should apply to handicapped employees than applies to those without handicap.\u201d <em>Garrity, supra </em>at 63. <em>Garrity </em>confirmed the commonsense notion that an employee is not \u201cqualified\u201d for a particular job \u2014 i.e., cannot perform the essential functions of that job, even with reasonable accommodation \u2014 if he or she takes part in \u201cegregious misconduct\u201d in the workplace. See <em>id. </em>at 62-63, quoting <em>Little </em>v. <em>Federal Bur. of Investigation, </em>1 F.3d 255, 258-259 (4th Cir. 1993) (\u201c \u2018[A]n employer . . . must be permitted to terminate its employee on account of egregious misconduct, irrespective of whether the employee is handicapped.\u2019 ... [A] handicapped employee who engages in conduct significantly inimical to the interests of his employer and in violation of the employer\u2019s rules ... is not a \u2018qualified handicapped person\u2019 within the meaning of G. L. c. 151B\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">c. <em>Applicability of </em>Garrity <em>to the present case. </em>Mammone\u2019s workplace misconduct, which took place over the course of two weeks, was at least as egregious and inimical to his employer\u2019s interest as was the misconduct for which Garrity was terminated. Mammone intentionally disregarded his supervisor\u2019s instructions regarding the use of his personal computer during work. Instead of acting as the professional face of the museum to visitors, he created numerous unprofessional disturbances for the public to witness at the exact location where they would decide whether to purchase admission to the museum. He exhorted his coworkers to do the same. During his shift, Mammone distributed flyers summarizing and advertising a website critical of the university and his supervisors. Certainly this misconduct was as inimical to his employer\u2019s interests as were Garrity\u2019s complaints to customers and employees about United Airlines, her demands for excessive service and attention from flight attendants, and her drawing of attention to herself as an unprofessional United Airlines employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Mammone\u2019s misconduct on September 4, however, was by far the most egregious of his actions. First, he abusively dismissed his supervisor\u2019s request to meet with her to discuss his behavior. Then he refused a request made by his supervisor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>and the museum human resources administrator to leave the museum and attend a meeting at the university\u2019s office of labor and employee relations the next day. Finally, he refused five lawful police orders to leave the premises, chose to become a trespasser, and forced the police to create a spectacle by physically carrying him out of the museum.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Later that day, on his return to the museum area, Mammone used objectively abusive, threatening, and sexually derogatory language to his supervisor and the human resources administrator, violating all reasonable standards expected at a place of business and public accommodation. Cf. <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>136 F.3d 1047, 1052 (5th Cir. 1998) (Americans with Disabilities Act [ADA] does not protect employee\u2019s \u201cemotional or violent outbursts,\u201d such as \u201cget that f_ing finger out of my face\u201d or \u201c[y]ou f_ing bitch!,\u201d even if such misconduct attributable to employee\u2019s posttraumatic stress disorder); <em>Maes </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>33 F. Supp. 2d 1281, 1283, 1286, 1289 (D. Nev. 1999) (where \u201cPostal Service demoted Plaintiff based on his off-color joking, sexual comments, threats, and hostile treatment of. . . employees, not on the basis of his depression,\u201d no claim under Rehabilitation Act). This conduct went far beyond anything Ganity said or did to her coworkers or United Airline customers. The judge below thus correctly concluded that the application of the <em>Garrity </em>decision to the facts of the instant case could only result in summary judgment for the university.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">In his dissent, Justice Greaney argues that our comparison of the conduct of Mammone and Garrity is \u201csubjective conjecture and inappropriate for summary judgment purposes.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 681-682. We disagree. As noted, <em>Garrity </em>involved a decision at the summary judgment stage. In that case, we explained that the \u201cmaterial before the [Superior Court] judge clearly demonstrated Garrity\u2019s conduct to be such that Ganity could not reasonably expect to prove that she was a \u2018qualified handicapped person\u2019 entitled to c. 151B\u2019s protection.\u201d <em>Garrity, supra </em>at 63. We did not balance this conduct against any positive work history Garrity may have had, and we did not consider whether Garrity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>could have (in the future) performed satisfactorily with a reasonable accommodation. We simply concluded that Garrity\u2019s conduct exceeded the egregious misconduct threshold. Similarly, we agree with the Superior Court judge in the present case that the materials before him on summary judgment evidenced conduct even more egregious than that of Garrity.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The practice of comparing and contrasting the facts of a case (as found in a lower court) to the facts of previously decided cases, particularly those in a similar procedural posture, is not new or controversial.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The dissent further faults our analysis for not considering whether Mammone could have performed his job successfully in the future if given a reasonable accommodation. According to the dissent, the definition of a \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d in G. L. c. 151B includes an employee who has engaged in egregious misconduct, but who could, in the future, perform his job without such misconduct if provided a reasonable accommodation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Certainly, the court did not engage in such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>analysis in Garrity,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Rather, we concluded that egregious workplace misconduct disqualified an employee from protection of the statute without regard to whether that employee could at some future date conform her behavior to acceptable standards. The statutory definition does not require otherwise. An employee who has committed egregious workplace misconduct (conduct so inimical to an employer\u2019s interest that any employee would be fired for the same acts) has precluded himself from \u201cperforming the essential functions of the position,\u201d with or without a reasonable accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Mammone\u2019s attempts to distinguish his case from <em>Garrity </em>are unpersuasive. Principally, Mammone contends that <em>Garrity </em>should be limited to cases involving workplace misconduct caused by alcoholism or other substance dependency disorders.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> He argues that workplace misconduct caused by any other handicap should bar an employee from being considered a \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d as a matter of law only if the misconduct \u201cposes a direct threat to himself or others (shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>by a reasonable probability of substantial harm),\u201d Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination Guidelines: Employment Discrimination on the Basis of Handicap Chapter 151B \u00a7 X.D (1998) (MCAD Guidelines).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> He further argues that he has a reasonable chance of proving that his misconduct did not rise to this level.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><em>Garrity </em>relied heavily on two Federal cases, <em>Little </em>v. <em>Federal Bur. of Investigation, </em>1 F.3d 255 (4th Cir. 1993) <em>(Little), </em>and <em>Wilber </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>780 F. Supp. 837, 840 (D.D.C. 1992) <em>(Wilber), </em>which interpreted the Federal Rehabilitation Act.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> See <em>Garrity, supra </em>at 59, 61-63 (\u201cIn construing and applying . . . G. L. c. 15IB, we are helped by case law construing the analogous Federal statute, \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973\u201d). Mammone correctly notes that both of these cases centered on workplace misconduct resulting from an employee\u2019s alcoholism and, more specifically, an employee\u2019s inebriation. See <em>Little, supra </em>at 257-258 (agent fired for on-duty intoxication); <em>Wilber, supra </em>at 840 (investigator with Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms caused fatal motor vehicle accident while driving under influence of alcohol). Because <em>Garrity, supra </em>at 63, which also dealt with an employee suffering from alcohol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>ism, held that the \u201creasoning with respect to the Rehabilitation Act in <em>Little . . </em>. and <em>[Wilber] . . . </em>applies with equal force to the interpretation and application of G. L. c. 151B <em>in the circumstances of the present case\u2019\u2019'1 </em>(emphasis added), Mammone suggests that we only adopted the principles announced in <em>Little </em>and <em>Wilber </em>for cases concerning misconduct stemming from alcoholism or substance dependency disorders.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Our decision in <em>Garrity, </em>however, did not expressly or impliedly distinguish between persons who were handicapped by alcoholism and persons who were handicapped by some other disorder. Rather, the court continuously used broad and generic language. See <em>id. </em>at 62-63 (\u201chandicapped employee\u201d; \u201chandicapped employees\u201d; \u201cdisabled individual\u201d; and \u201cindividuals with disabilities\u201d). The court\u2019s explanation in <em>Garrity, </em>that <em>Little, supra, </em>and <em>Wilber, supra, </em>were persuasive \u201cin the circumstances of the present case\u201d referenced the degree of egregiousness of the misconduct for which Garrity was fired, not the type of underlying disorder that caused her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Moreover, the Federal cases relied on in <em>Garrity </em>use similarly expansive language. See, e.g., <em>Wilber, supra </em>at 840 (Federal statute \u201cmandates nondiscrimination against <em>disabled </em>individuals; it does not waive basic prerequisites to service. . . . The law of this Circuit [and ... the other courts that have ruled on the issue] is clear that <em>those </em>who commit serious misconduct\u201d are not protected by the statute [emphasis added]). In particular, the cases speak of the purposes and coverage of the entire Federal statutory scheme, not just those portions that address alcoholism. See <em>Little, supra </em>at 258 (employer subject to \u201cRehabilitation Act must be permitted to terminate its employee on account of egregious misconduct, irrespective of whether the employee is handicapped\u201d); <em>Wilber, supra </em>(\u201cThe Rehabilitation Act is designed to put individuals with disabilities on equal footing with non-disabled people in regards to the hiring, promotion, and discharge decisions .... It is not designed to insulate them from disciplinary actions which would be taken against any employee regardless of his status. . . . [T]he Act is designed to help rehabilitate those who have not already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>disqualified themselves through their own misconduct\u201d).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Our holding that an employer does not violate G. L. c. 15 IB by terminating an employee for egregious misconduct stemming from <em>any </em>recognized handicap (as opposed to termination for the handicap itself) is consistent with the view adopted by the majority of courts that have faced the issue in interpreting Federal discrimination laws. See Timmons, Accommodating Misconduct Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 57 Fla. L. Rev. 187, 211-215 (2005). See also <em>Maes </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>33 F. Supp. 2d 1281, 1288-1289 (D. Nev. 1999) (\u201cMost circuit courts which have considered the question have reached the same conclusion; that is, if a disabled employee engages in misconduct, an employer may terminate . . . that employee without incurring liability under the Rehabilitation Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act\u201d). This is the case despite the fact that, in the Rehabilitation Act, \u201cCongress only <em>expressly </em>permitted employers to hold . . . <em>alcoholics </em>to the same . . . standards of conduct as other employees even though their disability causes misconduct\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>Moroni Feed Co., </em>162 F.3d 604, 609 (10th Cir. 1998), quoting <em>Den Hartog </em>v <em>Wasatch Academy, </em>129 F.3d 1076, 1086 (10th Cir. 1997). Particularly in the absence of any similar distinction made in G. L. c. 15IB\u2019s statutory text or in our case law, we decline Mammone\u2019s invitation to adopt the minority view that \u201cthe status-conduct dichotomy exists only in the contexts of alcoholism and illegal drug use\u201d and that \u201c[ojutside of those contexts . . . the [relevant discrimination statute] protects both the disability and the conduct caused by the disability.\u201d <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>Moroni Feed Co., supra </em>at 609.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">That <em>Garrity </em>was meant to apply to all disability-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>misconduct, not just alcoholism-related misconduct, is not surprising.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> \u201cAlcoholism is a handicap,\u201d MCAD Guidelines, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 X.C.2, and alcoholism cases are analyzed in the same way as other handicap discrimination cases. See Sullivan, Balancing the Rights of the Alcoholic Employee with the Legitimate Concerns of the Employer: Reasonable Accommodation vs. Undue Hardship, 46 Mont. L.

L. c. 151B suggests a legislative intent that persons suffering from alcoholism are in any way less handicapped than persons suffering from other disorders. Correspondingly, the standard we used in <em>Garrity </em>to determine whether an employee\u2019s alcoholism-related misconduct excludes that employee from the definition of \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d should be used to examine all disability-related misconduct. By its express terms, the definition of \u201cqualified handicapped person[s]\u201d in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (16), applies to all \u201chandicapped person[s].\u201d We perceive no basis on which to construe <em>Garrity </em>or the statutory definition of \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d in a way that would create significantly different levels of disqualifying disability-related misconduct based on whether the misconduct stems from alcoholism or some other disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Mammone\u2019s assertion that G. L. c. 15 IB creates a two-tiered system of disability-related workplace misconduct is not based on statutory text. Rather, Mammone points to interpretive MCAD Guidelines. See MCAD Guidelines, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 I (\u201cThese guidelines are intended to assist employers, labor organizations, employment agencies and persons with handicaps, and their lawyers, in understanding what employment practices are lawful or unlawful and what steps must be taken to accommodate handicapped persons\u201d). See also <em>Cargill </em>v. <em>Harvard Univ., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 585, 594 (2004), quoting <em>Dahill </em>v. <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Boston, </em>434 Mass. 233, 239 (2001) (\u201cWith respect to the MCAD guidelines as an informing source, the court has observed that, \u2018[gjuidance provided by the [MCAD] ... is also illuminating. . . . The guidelines represent the MCAD\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 151B, and are entitled to substantial deference, even though they do not carry the force of law\u2019 \u201d). In Mammone\u2019s view, the MCAD Guidelines recognize a stark distinction between alcoholism-related mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>conduct and misconduct stemming from all other disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The MCAD Guidelines include a section entitled \u201cSpecial Topics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 X. A portion of this section addresses \u201cSubstance Abuse,\u201d including addiction to drugs and alcohol. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 X.C.2, 3. After explaining that \u201c[a]lcoholism is a handicap\u201d and that the definition of \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d \u201capplies to individuals who are handicapped as a result of their addiction to alcohol,\u201d the MCAD Guidelines, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 X.C.3, state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">\u201cAn employer may hold individuals who are handicapped as a result of their [alcoholism] to the same standards of job conduct and performance as other employees, subject to the duty to reasonably accommodate the employee. The employee may be terminated to the extent that the employee cannot perform the essential functions of his/her job, with or without reasonable accommodation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">\u201cAn addicted individual engaging in misconduct may be subjected to . . . termination if the employer would subject a non-handicapped individual to similar discipline for similar misconduct. This is true even if the misconduct is related to the handicap. On the other hand, an employer may not treat the misconduct of an addicted employee more harshly than it would the misconduct of a non-handicapped individual. Moreover, where misconduct is related to the handicap, the employer may have a duty to provide reasonable accommodation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">A second subdivision deals with \u201cDisability-Related Misconduct.\u201d MCAD Guidelines, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 X.D. This subdivision does not address whether an employer can terminate an employee for disability-related misconduct for which a non-handicapped employee would be terminated. Nor does it explicitly say that handicapped individuals may be held to the same standard of job conduct as other employees. Rather, the MCAD Guidelines explain that \u201c[w]here misconduct is related to a handicap or disability, there may be a duty to provide reasonable accommodation[,] . . . for example, a leave of absence . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>The MCAD Guidelines then note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>\u201c[w]here the employee\u2019s behavior poses a direct threat to himself or others . . . the employee may not be considered a \u2018qualified handicapped person.\u2019 \u201d Finally, \u201c[i]n determining whether reasonable accommodation is possible, the employer should make an objective evaluation of all available relevant facts about the employee\u2019s work history and medical history.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">The MCAD Guidelines appear to be modeled after Federal regulations and guidelines interpreting the ADA and the Federal Rehabilitation Act. See MCAD <em>Guidelines, supra </em>at \u00a7 I n.2 (\u201cthe Federal guidelines can be used to guide Massachusetts in interpreting G. L. c. 151B\u201d); <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813, 823 n.13 (1997).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> There is no question that Federal regulations, guidelines, and other interpretive sources treat alcoholism and alcohol-related misconduct uniquely for purposes of Federal discrimination law.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> However, as noted above, the Federal statutes that these regulations and guidelines interpret explicitly distinguish alcoholism and alcoholism-related conduct from other disabilities and disability-related conduct. See <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>Moroni Feed Co., </em>162 F.3d, 604, 609 (10th Cir. 1998) (\u201cThe ADA states that a covered entity \u2018may hold an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>employee who ... is an alcoholic to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior that such entity holds other employees, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the . . . alcoholism of such employee . . . .\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12114[c][4]. The Rehabilitation Act similarly removes unsatisfactory conduct caused by alcoholism from its purview . . .\u201d). There is thus significant justification for the position that \u201cbecause Congress only expressly permitted employers to hold . . . alcoholics to the same objective standards of conduct as other employees even though their disability causes misconduct . . . Congress implicitly did not intend to extend the same employer prerogative to employees with <em>other </em>disabilities\u201d (emphasis added) (citation omitted). <em>Den Hartog </em>v. <em>Wasatch Academy, </em>129 F.3d 1076, 1086 (10th Cir. 1997). The regulatory interpretations of the Federal statutes are thus reasonable given their statutory text.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">To the extent that the MCAD\u2019s Guidelines may be read to afford different degrees of protection to disability-related workplace misconduct depending on whether the underlying disability is that of alcoholism or some other disorder,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> such a reading would be inconsistent with our statute. Cf. <em>Massachusetts Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>428 Mass. 805, 813 (1999) (regulations not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>followed if contrary to law). General Laws c. 15IB neither contains nor suggests such a distinction. Indeed, where the Federal statutes explicitly treat alcoholism, drug addiction, and current use of alcohol or illegal drugs differently from other handicaps, G. L. c. 151B explicitly singles out only current illicit drug use for unique treatment. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (17) (\u201cterm \u2018handicap\u2019 . . . shall not include current, illegal use of a controlled substance\u201d).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> There is therefore no basis to import into our statute a Federal statutory distinction \u2014 one that our Legislature did not choose to adopt \u2014 only because Federal guidelines can often be used to aid interpretation of G. L. c. 151B. If the Legislature had intended to adopt the other distinctions provided for in Federal law, it had the means to do so. The Federal interpretive aids are therefore inapplicable on this point. Cf. <em>New Bedford </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>440 Mass. 450, 463 n.26 (2003) (to aid in interpretation of G. L. c. 151B, courts \u201cconsider Federal case law construing the cognate Federal unlawful discrimination statute, <em>unless we discern some reason to depart from those rul</em>ings\u201d [emphasis added]). See <em>Cargill </em>v. <em>Harvard Univ., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 585, 595 (2004), quoting <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813, 823 n.13 (1997) (courts can similarly use \u201c[t]he Federal guidelines ... to guide Massachusetts in interpreting G. L. c. 151B\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We hold that the reasoning of the <em>Garrity </em>decision is applicable to employment discrimination based on disability-related workplace misconduct regardless of the type of handicap underlying the misconduct. Thus, a handicapped employee who engages in egregious misconduct, sufficiently inimical to the interests of his employer that it would result in the termination of a nonhandicapped employee, is not a qualified handicapped person within the meaning of G. L. c. 15IB, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>and therefore is not entitled to the protection of that statute.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> While it is appropriate for a jury to decide the nature and extent of an employee\u2019s misconduct, where those issues are in dispute, the judge correctly concluded that Mammone had no reasonable expectation of proving that he was a qualified handicapped person on the facts of this case viewed in their light most favorable to him. We therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment for the university.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-7\">General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), makes it unlawful for an employer to \u201cdismiss from employment or refuse to . . . rehire ... or otherwise discriminate against, because of his handicap, any person alleging to be a <em>qualified handicapped person, </em>capable of performing the essential functions of the position involved with reasonable accommodation\u201d (emphasis added). According to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (16), a \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d is \u201ca handicapped person who is capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job, or who would be capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job with reasonable accommodation to his handicap.\u201d Therefore, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (16), is applicable only to persons who both allege that they are and actually are qualified handicapped persons, i.e., they must (a) allege that they could perform the essential functions of a particular job with (or without) reasonable accommodations to their handicap, and (b) actually be able to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\">General Laws c. 93, \u00a7 103, \u201cincorporates the rights against handicap discrimination protected by art. 114 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution.\u201d <em>Cargill </em>v. <em>Harvard Univ., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 585, 604 (2004). This statute relies on the definition of handicap \u201cas defined in [G. L. c. 151B].\u201d G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 103 (a). Mammone must therefore be a \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d for G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 103, to apply to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b676-9\">We refer to handicap, disorder, disease, and disability interchangeably in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In his dissent, Justice Greaney asserts that our holding \u201cexcludes from the scope of G. L. c. 15 IB protection an entire category of persons with mental illnesses . . . whose symptoms include occasional displays of inappropriate, and sometimes bizarre, behavior.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 681. This is incorrect. Both <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>United Airlines, Inc., </em>421 Mass. 55 (1995) <em>(Garrity), </em>and our holding today only reach employees who engage in egregious workplace misconduct. Neither case would allow an employer to take adverse action against a handicapped employee for an incident of bizarre or inappropriate behavior caused by his handicap that does not rise to this level. See <em>Garrity, supra </em>at 62, quoting <em>Little </em>v. <em>Federal Bur. of Investigation, </em>1 F.3d 255, 258-259 (4th Cir. 1993) (\u201cemployer . . . must be permitted to terminate its employee on account of <em>egregious misconduct, </em>irrespective of whether the employee is handicapped\u201d [emphasis added]).

Thus, Justice Greaney\u2019s hypothetical employee who has an epileptic seizure at work, see <em>post </em>at note 4, cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>legally be terminated, because he did not commit misconduct at all, and certainly not egregious misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b678-9\">Mammone was initially hired by the President and Fellows of Harvard University (university) faculty of arts and sciences as a part-time employee in August of 1995.

As the Superior Court judge correctly noted, an examination of the context of this note, other documents relating to this note, and the entire sequence of events forces the conclusion that the handwritten note simply meant the university would not make his termination effective until after his short-term disability benefits expired. In any event, it is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>from Mammone\u2019s testimony and from a letter sent by his counsel to the university during the time in which Mammone was receiving disability benefits, that all parties understood Mammone to have actually been fired on September 4, with the effective date being postponed until his benefits ended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\">In his March 10, 2003, clinician notes, Dr. Allen described Mammone as \u201cfairly stable now.\u201d Approximately one year later, on January 29, 2004, in a letter to Mammone\u2019s attorney, Dr. Allen referenced this date and explained that, \u201cin [his] opinion, [Mammone] would have been able to resume work, while continuing treatment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Mammone\u2019s later return to the vicinity of the earlier incident violated the spirit if not the letter of the order he was given by an arresting officer not to return \u201chere.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b687-6\">We assume that had Mammone, for example, physically assaulted and harmed a museum patron, the dissent would not consider our comparison \u201csubjective conjecture . . . inappropriate for summary judgment purposes.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 681-682.

First, although the dissent asserts that Piponidis \u201chad been aware for some time that the plaintiff struggled with mental health issues,\u201d <em>post </em>at 683, the record simply does not reflect this. At most, Piponidis knew that Mammone was suffering from some unspecified mental problems shortly after the onset of the events in question. Second, despite the dissent\u2019s suggestion that employers should be required to raise affirmatively the issue of a reasonable accommodation with a handicapped employee who does not request such accommodation, <em>post </em>at 685-687, our case law does not support this position.

Assuming arguendo that one of the residents was handicapped \u2014 suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, depression, and a host of other mental and physical ailments \u2014 and that the housing violations stemmed from this handicap, the court turned to whether the resident met the definition of a qualified handicapped person.

In dealing with alcoholism, they explain that even though an employer can terminate an employee for alcoholism-related misconduct if a nonhandicapped employee would be terminated for similar conduct, \u201cwhere misconduct is related to the handicap, the employer may have a duty to provide reasonable accommodation.\u201d MCAD Guidelines, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 X.C.3. They then include a cross-reference to the section governing disability-related conduct. <em>Id. </em>A reasonable reading of the MCAD Guidelines is that employers may be required to make reasonable accommodation for disability-related misconduct regardless of the type of disability an employee suffers. However, the MCAD Guidelines do not further elaborate when the employer must make such an accommodation. At most, they advise that an employer definitely does not have to make such an accommodation when the employee is a direct threat to the safety of himself or others. This is not inconsistent with <em>Garrity, supra </em>at 62, 63, which simply adds an additional circumstance where an employer is not required to make reasonable accommodations in the face of workplace misconduct, i.e., when such misconduct is \u201cegregious\u201d and sufficiently \u201cinimical\u201d to the employer\u2019s interest, to warrant the termination of a non-handicapped employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b697-5\">General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (17), provides that the term \u201chandicap\u201d \u201cshall not include current, illegal use of a controlled substance.\u201d The MCAD Guidelines reasonably interpret this provision to mean that a person currently using illegal substances falls outside the definition of a handicapped person, even if such use is a result of a substance dependency addiction that would otherwise be considered a handicap. See MCAD Guidelines, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 X.C.1. Our decisions in <em>Garrity </em>and the present case are not inconsistent with this rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The judge set forth a two-pronged test for determining whether an employee\u2019s misconduct is egregious enough to disqualify the employee from being considered a \u201cqualified handicapped person.\u201d First, the judge looked to whether the employer terminated the employee promptly after the misconduct (which would demonstrate the employer\u2019s subjective belief that any person \u2014 handicapped or not \u2014 who engaged in such misconduct would be terminated). Second, the judge determined whether \u201c[t]he misconduct is so egregious that no employer should reasonably be required to retain such an employee . . . even if the employee, with . . . reasonable accommodation, otherwise could perform the essential functions of the job.\u201d Although we do not replace the test espoused in <em>Garrity </em>with either prong of this test, it is obvious that these considerations are relevant, and often might be conclusive, on the question whether a triable issue exists concerning the plaintiff\u2019s status as a qualified handicapped person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Mammone also claims that the judge abused his discretion by limiting Mammone\u2019s discovery. Mammone requested that the university identify all employees of the entire university who had in the last ten years engaged in alleged insubordination or threatening words or actions toward university personnel together with information regarding the disciplinary action taken against them. The judge allowed Mammone\u2019s request as applied to information regarding employees of the museum (the unit of the university from which he was terminated) who engaged in such misconduct on or after January 1, 1994. For each identified employee, the university was required to turn over the employee\u2019s disciplinary record. Although discovery of how other employees were treated for similar misconduct might be relevant, for instance to show that such misconduct was not egregious or sufficiently inimical to the university\u2019s interest, it requires no extended discussion to conclude that the judge\u2019s order was a valid exercise of his considerable discretion in this area. Limiting the discovery to the unit from which Mammone was terminated fairly balanced his right to discover how similarly situated employees were treated with the university\u2019s right to be free from overburdensome discovery not likely to lead to any relevant or material information, and with concerns regarding the significant privacy interests of other university employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b698-5\">Greaney, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aii\">(dissenting). This case illustrates precisely why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>summary judgment is disfavored in employment discrimination cases. See <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), </em>427 Mass. 1, 16 (1998); <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813, 820 (1997). A reasonable jury, presented with the plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony and other evidence in the summary judgment record, could conclude that the conduct for which the plaintiff was terminated was not \u201cegregious misconduct,\u201d but rather a manifestation of his bipolar disorder, an illness over which he had no control and which was aggravated by confrontational treatment by a supervisor (Piponidis) who should have known better. The plaintiff was entitled to present his claim of discrimination to a jury. The court today holds otherwise and, in so doing, excludes from the scope of G. L. c. 15 IB protection an entire category of persons with mental illnesses, including bipolar disorder, whose symptoms include occasional displays of inappropriate, and sometimes bizarre, workplace behavior. See Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 357-361 (4th ed. 2000). There is no indication that the Legislature intended such a harsh interpretation of G. L. c. 151B. I therefore dissent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Comparing the behavior of the plaintiff in this case to that of the plaintiff in <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>United Airlines, Inc., </em>421 Mass. 55 (1995), the court determines that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct \u201cwent far beyond anything Garrity said or did,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 668, and thus concludes that the plaintiff in this case had no reasonable expectation of demonstrating he was a \u201cqualified employee,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 680, for purposes of his G. L. c. 151B claim. This conclusion is subjective conjecture and inappropriate for summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>purposes. The <em>Garrity </em>court set forth a general standard to bar a terminated employee from demonstrating that he or she is a \u201cqualified\u201d individual, regardless of a handicap, when the conduct on which termination was based is \u201csignificantly inimical to the interests of his employer and in violation of the employer\u2019s rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63, citing <em>Little </em>v. <em>Federal Bur. of Investigation, </em>1 F.3d 255 (4th Cir. 1993). I agree with the court that the <em>Garrity </em>decision cannot fairly be limited to circumstances involving alcoholism or other addictions. See <em>Andover Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Shkolnik, </em>443 Mass. 300, 309 (2005). I would, however, point out cautionary language in the <em>Garrity </em>opinion signifying that not every act of misconduct is sufficient to trigger this bar (it must be \u201cegregious misconduct\u201d) and expressly limiting the court\u2019s reasoning to \u201cthe circumstances of the present case.\u201d <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>United Airlines, Inc., supra </em>at 62, 63. The court, in its rush to judgment, overlooks distinctive circumstances of the present case that should remove it from the scope of the <em>Garrity </em>holding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In my view, whether the plaintiff\u2019s behavior in this case was \u201csignificantly inimical to the interests of his employer and in violation of the employer\u2019s rules\u201d to rise to the level of \u201cegregious misconduct\u201d is a clear jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">To the court\u2019s recitation of the events leading to the plaintiff\u2019s termination, I add the following additional facts established by the summary judgment record viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See <em>Coveney </em>v. <em>President &amp; Trustees of the College of the Holy Cross, </em>388 Mass. 16, 17 (1983). Although he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1987, the plaintiff experienced symptoms of his disease only on rare occasions. During those occasions, the plaintiff would become paranoid, agitated, hyperactive, and irrational. Until the events that led to his termination, however, the plaintiff\u2019s condition never affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>his work at Harvard. From approximately mid-August, 2002, the plaintiff had been experiencing symptoms of a manic episode and was briefly hospitalized over the Labor Day weekend. Because hospital physicians administered the plaintiff medication to which he was allergic, hospitalization only served to exacerbate the plaintiff\u2019s manic state. On his return to work on September 2, it was obvious that the plaintiff was exhibiting uncharacteristically abnormal behavior, as shown by electronic mail messages received by Piponidis from museum staff expressing concern for the plaintiff and his mental health. One stated that the plaintiffs \u201cemotions seem to be out of control.\u201d Another observed that the plaintiff appeared to be experiencing psychological problems and suggested the need for a medical intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Instead of following that advice, Piponidis, who had been aware for some time that the plaintiff struggled with mental health issues, chose to address the plaintiff\u2019s problem behavior by arriving at his workstation with two campus police officers, who ultimately arrested the plaintiff and physically dragged him from the museum. The plaintiff testified at his deposition that he was paranoid, frightened, and so overcome by his heightened manic state that he could not control his choice of words, let alone the tone or volume with which he spoke them. After being arraigned on charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff was released by the police later that day. He was unable to go home, however, because the police had retained his house and car keys, and the plaintiff was afraid to attempt to retrieve them. He sought instead the safety of the museum and went there intending to wait outside for friends. The manner in which the plaintiff had been treated was, in his own words, \u201ccruel handling of someone with a mental illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Presented with uncontested evidence of what followed, a reasonable jury might well conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s final outburst was, as characterized by the court, \u201cabusive, threatening, and sexually derogatory.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 668. Believing the plaintiff, however, they might just as likely conclude that the outburst, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>part and parcel of his paranoid manic state, was intended only as a moral rebuke and, further, that more sensitive handling of the situation by Piponidis would h\u00e1ve averted the crisis altogether. The plaintiff testified at his deposition that it was \u201cpretty obvious that [he] was severely mentally ill\u201d and that \u201c[s]evere mania is frightening to watch [but] even more frightening for the person going through it.\u201d The final scene in the lobby of the Museum of Natural History, which triggered the plaintiff\u2019s immediate termination, was not, as in the <em>Garrity </em>case, a course of behavior independently engaged in by the plaintiff in flagrant disregard of the museum\u2019s rules, but the culmination of a supervisor-employee interaction that, fueled by the plaintiff\u2019s illness, had escalated out of control. The court reasons that language in the <em>Garrity </em>decision compels the conclusion that no unlawful discrimination occurred because the same behavior would have resulted in the termination of a non-handicapped employee. See <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>United Airlines, Inc., supra </em>at 63. This reasoning ignores the critical point of the plaintiff\u2019s argument \u2014 a psychologically healthy employee would not have behaved, nor would he have been treated by his supervisors, in the same manner. There is nothing remarkable in my conclusion that, in these circumstances, the plaintiff is entitled to a jury\u2019s assessment whether his behavior rose to the level of \u201cegregious misconduct.\u201d The court\u2019s suggestion that my view might differ \u201chad [the plaintiff], for example, physically assaulted and harmed a museum patron,\u201d <em>ante </em>at note 24, is altogether unfounded. Cases must be decided on the record, and the record in this case contains no evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms, at any point in time, included physical violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">I agree with the court that the ability to act calmly and peaceably, as opposed to erratically or threateningly, is an essential component of any job, especially one that involves interaction with the public, such as the plaintiff\u2019s position as staff assistant at Harvard\u2019s Peabody Museum. It follows that a handicapped employee whose disability compels him to behave in a unprofessional manner, or whose behavior poses a safety risk to others, has no chance of demonstrating that he is a \u201cqualified handicapped employee\u201d under G. L. c. 151B. See <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Hingham, </em>419 Mass. 535, 543 (1995); <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Yellow </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number><em>Freight Sys., Inc., </em>253 F.3d 943, 949-950 (7th Cir. 2001); <em>Mazzarella </em>v. <em>United States Postal Serv., </em>849 F. Supp. 89, 94 (D. Mass. 1994). The plaintiff in this case, however, has presented an abundance of evidence that, for seven years up until the days immediately preceding his termination, his job performance at the museum was impeccable and met with only positive work evaluations. During that time, despite his illness, the plaintiff had (in the words of one supervisor) worked with \u201cgraciousness,\u201d \u201centhusiasm,\u201d and \u201cefficiency.\u201d The evidence in the record thus demonstrates conclusively that the plaintiff was in fact capable of performing the essential functions of the job. This factor alone sets the plaintiff apart from plaintiffs in cases such as <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Hingham, supra </em>(police officer susceptible to stress-related blackouts), and <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Amego, Inc., </em>110 F.3d 135, 144-145 (1st Cir. 1997) (therapist who abused prescription drugs had job responsibility to monitor and administer psychotropic medication to clients), where summary judgment was proper based on the plaintiff\u2019s inability to demonstrate that she was qualified for the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">There is another important step in the discrimination analysis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> General Laws c. 151B defines a qualified handicapped person as one who can perform the essential functions of a job \u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation.\u201d In my view, before summary judgment is granted in its favor, Harvard must demonstrate that no \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d would have enabled the plaintiff successfully to continue to perform his job. See <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813, 822 (1997); <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Health, </em>419 Mass. 356, 360 (1995). This Harvard has not attempted to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">I would reject Harvard\u2019s argument that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to request accommodation relieved it of any responsibility in this fundamental area of discrimination law. It is clear that the plaintiff was unable to recognize, or communicate, at the time his need for special treatment to accommodate his illness. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>have never held that G. L. c. 151B requires an employer to initiate an interactive process to reach a reasonable accommodation for a handicapped employee. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>262 F.3d 41, 47-48 (1st Cir. 2000). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has recognized such a duty, however, and has stated that this duty is particularly important when an employee is suffering from a mental disability. See <em>Kvorjak </em>v. <em>State, </em>259 F.3d 48, 52-53 (1st Cir. 2001); <em>Criado </em>v. <em>IBM Corp., </em>145 F.3d 437, 444 (1st Cir. 1998); <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>Clean-Up Group, Inc., 96 </em>F.3d 506, 515 (1st Cir. 1996).

Bd. of Regents, </em>75 F.3d 1130, 1135 (7th Cir. 1996) (stating \u201c[i]n a case involving an employee with mental illness, the communication process becomes more difficult,\u201d and \u201c[i]t is crucial that the employer [be] aware of the difficulties, and \u2018help the other party determine what specific accommodations are necessary\u2019 \u201d); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>272 F.

I agree with the First Circuit and, based on the reasoning in the above cases, would impose an affirmative duty on the part of employers, in circumstances where it is obvious that a mentally handicapped employee is unable to initiate a request for reasonable accommodation and the employer knows, or should know, of the employee\u2019s need, to communicate to the employee a willingness to provide some type of special arrangements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In my view, a jury could find that Harvard had a duty to offer the plaintiff a reasonable accommodation that was triggered at the point when Piponidis became aware, through her own observations and those of others, that the plaintiff was experiencing a severe manic episode and needed medical attention or, at least, an immediate leave of absence to seek medical attention on his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>accord. See <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Cooley Dickinson Hosp., </em>437 Mass. 443, 455-456 (2002); <em>Criado </em>v. <em>IBM Corp., supra </em>at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The record demonstrates that the day before the plaintiff was terminated, Piponidis sent him a letter (which the plaintiff did not receive) suggesting that he avail himself of Harvard\u2019s employee assistance program. This letter indicates Piponidis\u2019s recognition of the plaintiff\u2019s need for help and of her responsibility to assist the plaintiff in obtaining that help. It does not, however, necessarily absolve her of her failure to offer the same support the next day, or Harvard of its duty to provide reasonable accommodation in the days that followed when the plaintiff\u2019s union representative, and his attorney, attempted to negotiate his return to work following a leave of absence to seek medical treatment. Based on the body of evidence in the summary judgment record, I conclude that whether the plaintiff was a qualified handicapped employee whom Harvard should have accommodated with a temporary leave of absence for medical treatment is a triable issue. See <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, supra </em>at 820; <em>Bultemeyer </em>v. <em>Fort Wayne Community Schs., supra </em>at 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Mental illness makes life more difficult in almost every way imaginable. As a practical reality, if employees who suffer from bipolar disorder are to hold jobs at all, some measure of special treatment from employers may, from time to time, be necessary. The court\u2019s affirmation of Harvard\u2019s right to summarily terminate the plaintiff, on the basis of one manic episode and with no attempt to accommodate his illness, is regrettable. This conclusion undermines a fundamental purpose of G. L. c. 151B, to preserve the employment status of the handicapped, including the mentally ill. See <em>Dahill </em>v. <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Boston, </em>434 Mass. 233, 240-241 (2001). We have held that, for purposes of the analogous Federal statute, \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, an individualized inquiry into whether a plaintiff is a qualified handicapped person is \u201cessential if [the statute] is to achieve its goal of protecting handicapped individuals from deprivations based on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to such legitimate concerns of [employers] as avoiding exposing others to significant health and safety risks.\u201d <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number><em>England. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 375, 383-384 (1993), quoting <em>School Bd. of Nassau County </em>v. <em>Arline, </em>480 U.S. 273, 287 (1987). Given its remedial purpose, G. L. c. 151B likewise requires a reviewing court carefully to \u201cmeasure whether the employer\u2019s decision \u2018reflect[s] a well-informed judgment grounded in a careful and open-minded weighing of the risks and alternatives.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cargill </em>v. <em>Harvard Univ., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 585, 603 (2004), quoting <em>Hall </em>v. <em>United States Postal Serv., </em>857 F.2d 1073, 1079 (6th Cir. 1988). No such weighing was conducted by Harvard in this case. The court\u2019s decision will make life even more difficult for those attempting to hold down a job while suffering with a mental illness, thereby undermining the compassion our society has expressed, through the Legislature\u2019s enactment of G. L. c. 151B, for someone in the plaintiffs circumstances.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-6\">I agree that summary judgment was proper on the plaintiff\u2019s claim of discrimination under our equal rights statute, G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 103, not for the reason set forth by the court, but because this court consistently has treated G. L. c. 151B as the exclusive remedy for claims of handicap discrimination arising out of employment against an employer with six or more employees. See, e.g., <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Health, </em>419 Mass. 356, 365 (1995); <em>Agin </em>v. <em>Federal White Cement, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 669, 672 (1994); <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Muzi Motors, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 580, 585 (1994); <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Chasdi, </em>400 Mass. 686, 693 n.9 (1987).
