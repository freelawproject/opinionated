Bulger, Jr. (alias \u201cWhitey\u201d), has long evaded the grasp of pursuing domestic and international law enforcement officers seeking to bring him to account for crimes too numerous and too craven to be summarized here, his malevolent tentacles have once again reached into the Commonwealth and have led to the grant of a motion for a new trial for the defendant, Frederick Weichell, who was convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree and whose conviction was affirmed by this court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. 62 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1032 (1984). The ground for the grant of the new trial motion is encapsulated in the bizarre circumstances that we shall describe below (material worthy of a crime novella). The circumstances persuaded the judge (not the trial judge, who had retired) that the defendant had happened on newly discovered evidence that called the validity of his conviction into question. We disagree with the judge\u2019s conclusion and vacate the order granting the defendant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">1. (a) The background of the case is set forth in our opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, supra </em>at 65-67, as follows: <em>\u201cThe shooting. </em>[The victim, Robert W. LaMonica,] worked for the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. He worked from 4 p.m. to midnight. He would usually drive straight home from his job to his [Braintree] apartment, customarily arriving there between 12:15 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. He would turn off Faxon Street to park his [automobile] in a parking lot adjacent to his apartment building. Faxon Park is across from the entrance to the parking lot. [The victim] followed this routine on the morning of May 31, 1980. He parked and got out of his [automobile]. Four shots were fired, two of them hitting [the victim]. A bullet entered through his neck and penetrated the brain. A second bullet entered his back and lodged in his right rib cage. [The victim] died in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\"><em>\u201cIdentification. </em>Shortly before midnight on May 30, 1980, John Foley, Jean Castonquay, Frederick Laracy, and Lisa Krause went to Faxon Park, after attending a drive-in movie together. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>Foley testified the group had been drinking and that he had consumed four or five beers during the movies. At 12:15 a.m., Foley was walking away from a wooded area of the park. He heard four \u2018bangs\u2019 and saw a man run out of the parking lot and turn up Faxon Street to a waiting [automobile]. Krause screamed. The man looked toward the group briefly but continued running. Foley testified that he had a full-face view of the man for approximately one second as the man passed under a street light. Foley and Laracy went across Faxon Street to the parking lot where they found the body of the victim on the ground. The police arrived shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">\u201cFoley described to the police the man he saw running as being five feet, nine inches tall, 175 pounds, wearing jeans and a pullover shirt. [At the time of his arrest, the defendant was five feet, seven inches tall, and weighed 155 pounds.] He said that the man had dark curly hair, bushy eyebrows, and sideburns. He also stated that the man had a slightly crooked nose, \u2018as if it had been broken.\u2019 At trial, he identified the defendant as the man he saw running that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">\u201cLater that morning, Foley assisted Detective Wilson of the Braintree police department in making a composite drawing. After indicating that he could not draw a face by himself, Foley gave Wilson a general description. With the aid of an Identikit, Wilson and Foley assembled a composite. Foley examined the composite and asked for changes. Wilson then changed elements of the composite and put together a different face. Wilson used a pencil to alter the nose. After Foley altered the hair style, he declared that the composite \u2018looks like him.\u2019 A photostatic copy of the composite was introduced in evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">\u201cThe next day, Foley was shown an array of nine photographs. He picked the defendant\u2019s picture as \u2018a pretty good likeness\u2019 of the man. Several months later, he again identified the defendant\u2019s photograph out of the same array but which now included one additional photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">\u201cOn June 12, 1980, two State troopers, Foley, and the victim\u2019s two brothers drove through the streets of South Boston in a van. The [two brothers] gave directions, but did not speak to Foley. Eventually, Foley picked, out of a group of young men, an individual whom he thought was the man he saw running. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>van was driven around the comer and passed the group for a second time. Foley stated, \u2018That\u2019s the guy.\u2019 A State trooper took a photograph of the individual which was introduced in evidence and identified as a photograph of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">\u201cJean Castonquay also testified that she heard four shots and saw a man running. At trial, she was unable to say whether the defendant was the man she saw. Moments later, she tentatively identified another person sitting in the back of the courtroom as the man [the victim\u2019s brother]. On three occasions Castonquay was shown the same array of photographs as Foley, but was unable to pick out any one photograph. Instead, she picked out two or three photographs each time, always including that of the defendant. Neither Laracy nor Krause made any identification.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">\u201cOther evidence offered by the Commonwealth was admitted to create an inference that the defendant was conscious of his guilt. After the shooting, but before his arrest, the defendant asked Francis Shea and Dennis King [whose connection with the defendant and the victim is explained below] if the police were looking for him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">On the issue of motive, the Commonwealth submitted evidence that in the weeks preceding the victim\u2019s death, the defendant and his friend, Thomas Barrett, had a series of confrontations, some involving physical altercations and threats, with Shea and Shea\u2019s friends, which included the victim, King, and Chuckie Carr. <em>Id. </em>at 64-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">We summarized the defendant\u2019s case in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, supra </em>at 67-68, as follows: \u201cAt trial, the defendant\u2019s counsel [Anthony M. Cardinale], through cross-examination, attempted to bring out whatever discrepancies existed in Foley\u2019s testimony. He emphasized that Foley had indicated that the man he saw running had thick sideburns and bushy eyebrows. Foley admitted, however, that the defendant\u2019s eyebrows were different. It also appears that the defendant did not have any sideburns. Despite some evidence to the contrary, the jury could have concluded that the defendant had curly hair at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>murder. The defendant also attempted to show that the lighting in the area was poor [evidence to the contrary was proffered by the Commonwealth] and that the identification process was unreliable. The defendant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">\u201cThe defendant also sought to establish a defense of alibi. Three witnesses testified on his behalf. One witness\u2019s testimony [Kevin McCormack<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] placed the defendant in downtown Boston until midnight. The other witnesses [Leo Mahoney and Kevin J. Weeks<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] placed the defendant at the Triple O Lounge in South Boston at, or shortly after, the time of the shooting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">We then pointed out that, \u201c[i]n rebuttal, the Commonwealth introduced evidence that the defendant could have left downtown Boston shortly before midnight and driven to [the victim\u2019s] apartment by the time of the shooting. A trip to the Triple O Lounge from the victim\u2019s apartment would have taken only another fifteen or twenty minutes. The Commonwealth also attacked the credibility of the two witnesses who placed him at the Triple O Lounge. Both were long-time friends of the defendant, and one [Mahoney] was engaged to Thomas Barrett\u2019s sister. The other witness [Weeks] failed to explain why he never came forward until one week before the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The defendant was represented by his trial counsel in his direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 63. In affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction, we rejected his claims that \u201cthe trial judge erred in (1) denying his motions in limine to exclude certain evidence relating to motive; (2) granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine to exclude evidence which tended to show that third parties had a motive to commit the crime; (3) refusing to exclude a \u2018mugshot\u2019 photograph of the defendant\u2019s profile; (4) permitting the Commonwealth to introduce in evidence a composite drawing; (5) allowing the Commonwealth to introduce in evidence an enlarged copy of a photograph of the defendant taken by the Braintree police at the time of his arrest; and (6) excluding photographs of the scene of the crime and the testimony of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>photographer who took them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also denied relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. <em>Id. </em>at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">(b) In August, 1991, the defendant, represented by new counsel, filed a motion for a new trial arguing that his trial counsel had deprived him of his right to testify. The trial judge denied the motion without a hearing. A single justice of this court, acting under the gatekeeper provision of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, did not permit the defendant to appeal from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">(c) Over a decade later, in January, 2002, the defendant, represented by his current counsel, filed his second motion for a new trial, which is before us. The motion was based on alleged newly discovered evidence and ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. The alleged newly discovered evidence consisted of a confession letter authored by the defendant\u2019s colleague Barrett, and evidence corroborating the defendant\u2019s alibi and exculpating him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With respect to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the defendant argued that his appellate counsel should have raised a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel predicated on trial counsel\u2019s failure to (1) challenge the reliability and credibility of the composite drawing of the defendant at trial; (2) properly investigate; (3) utilize previous false testimony and an investigative report of State Trooper John R. Sprague, the primary investigator of the shooting; and (4) request a jury instruction on good faith mistaken identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The judge concluded that the alleged newly discovered evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s alibi (hearsay statements attributed to Special Agent John Connolly of the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] and Bulger) was not newly discovered because the statements previously had been reasonably discoverable. The judge also explained that the evidence consisted of hearsay and was cumulative of evidence at trial. The judge rejected the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>noting that the defendant waived his right to raise the issues underlying the claim and that the issues did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The defendant has not appealed from the order containing these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">With respect to the alleged newly discovered evidence in the form of Barrett\u2019s confession letter, the judge ruled that the defendant had satisfied his initial burden of showing the existence of a substantial issue thereby necessitating an evidentiary hearing. The judge emphasized, \u201c[tjhere shall not be any hearing on any other claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The judge proceeded to conduct an evidentiary hearing in keeping with the foregoing rulings. In addition to presenting evidence concerning Barrett\u2019s confession letter, set forth below,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant presented evidence of incriminating statements Barrett allegedly made to Sherry Robb, a friend of the defendant with whom Barrett had lived periodically in California in the 1980\u2019s.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The judge\u2019s findings of fact recounted the testimony of the various witnesses at the evidentiary hearing. Where the judge specifically made certain findings or found certain evidence to be credible, it is so noted. The judge\u2019s findings are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">During the lifetime of the defendant\u2019s deceased mother, Gloria Weichel (Weichel),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> she spoke periodically over the telephone with her sister, Lorrie Doddie, who lived in Michigan. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Sometime in 1982 or 1983, Weichel telephoned Doddie and read her Barrett\u2019s confession letter. Weichel stated she had received the letter from a friend of the defendant\u2019s and that it appeared to have originated in California.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Weichel told Doddie that after she had received the letter, two men (unknown to her) came to her home in the South Boston area of Boston, asking for the letter, but she had not given it to them. The judge found Doddie\u2019s testimony credible and found that Weichel had expressed fear to Doddie about the letter and the two men who had visited her.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Sometime in 1990, Weichel gave Barrett\u2019s confession letter to Francis Hurley, an attorney and acquaintance of the defendant\u2019s family. Hurley would hold letters and other documents for people he knew, often without being aware of the contents. Unaware of the contents of the Barrett confession letter, Hurley kept the letter locked up until after Weichel\u2019s death. In 2001 or 2002, the defendant\u2019s friend, Donald J. Lewis, contacted Hurley. Hurley did not learn the contents of the letter until after he received the defendant\u2019s permission to provide copies of the letter to Lewis and to Jonathan Wells, a Boston Herald reporter. Hurley then delivered the original letter in its envelope to the defendant\u2019s current attorney in August, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Lewis, who was paying a portion of the defendant\u2019s legal fees, learned sometime in 2000 that Hurley was holding a letter for the by then deceased Weichel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Lewis recalled that the defendant had been speaking with Wells. The defendant told Lewis that the letter \u201cmay have information to convince Wells that he was, [the defendant] was innocent.\u201d At the direction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>the defendant\u2019s attorney, after she had received the original letter, Lewis delivered the original envelope and letter to the defendant\u2019s handwriting expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The defendant testified that Bulger and Stephen Flemmi (alias \u201cThe Rifleman\u201d) approached him about four times prior to his arrest, and once after his arrest, while he was awaiting trial and had been released on bail. Bulger told the defendant at one meeting, \u201cI do not want you to bring up Tommy Barrett\u2019s name ever.\u201d Bulger threatened to harm the defendant or his family should he disregard the warning. The defendant understood that the visit was intended to ensure that he never spoke of Barrett.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The judge considered the positions of Bulger and Flemmi \u201crelevant here; they were leaders of gangs that operated largely in South Boston during the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s. Bulger and Flemmi operated gambling rackets and trafficked in narcotics and weapons. Neither party disputes that Bulger and Flemmi were ruthless killers who used fear, intimidation, coercion, threats, and murder to hold the community of South Boston hostage. Their gangs worked with virtual impunity as the FBI protected and even aided Bulger, a confidential informant for the FBI. In the mid-1990\u2019s Bulger fled authorities and remains at-large. Bulger has previously sat atop the FBI\u2019s most wanted list and remains on it currently. Flemmi is incarcerated and has assisted investigators in locating the bodies of people that he, Bulger, and their associates murdered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Around 1982, the defendant\u2019s mother informed him that she had received a letter from Barrett that year declaring the defendant\u2019s innocence. In view of Bulger\u2019s threats, the defendant stopped his mother before she divulged the actual contents of the specific letter to him. The defendant did not inquire or learn of the contents of the letter until 2001, after his mother\u2019s death and after Bulger had become a fugitive from justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Barrett took the witness stand at the evidentiary hearing and invoked his right under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution not to incriminate himself. Based on the testimony of the defendant\u2019s handwriting expert, the judge found that Barrett had authored the March 19, 1982, confession letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>to the defendant\u2019s mother.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Robb, who originally was from California, worked in the South Boston area in the early to mid-1970\u2019s. During that time, Robb knew the defendant (and had a romantic relationship with him in the late 1970\u2019s or early 1980\u2019s), and was familiar with Barrett. In the summer or early fall of 1980, the defendant made a telephone call to Robb, who had moved back to California, and told her that Barrett was in trouble. The defendant asked her if Barrett could stay with her because Barrett had to get out of South Boston. Robb agreed and Barrett arrived at her home in Sausalito shortly thereafter.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Barrett stayed with Robb and her roommate over the next two to three months. Later, after one and one-half years had passed, Barrett again stayed with Robb, this time in Mill Valley, for a two to three week period. Robb remained in contact with Barrett through the 1980\u2019s, and even lived with him for six months in a house that Barrett\u2019s mother and Robb owned in Larchmont. When their cohabitation in Larchmont terminated, Robb never saw or heard from Barrett again.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Robb was not aware that Barrett had written to the defendant\u2019s mother. She did not recall giving Barrett her address. She did not recognize the handwriting on the envelope of the letter (the writing was not Robb\u2019s). Robb did not know if Barrett was in touch with the defendant or with the defendant\u2019s mother while Barrett was in Sausalito and Mill Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">During the 1980\u2019s, Robb and her mother maintained relationships with the defendant. Robb corresponded with the defendant five or six times per year, with the frequency decreasing in recent years. Occasionally, the defendant would telephone Robb. During those conversations, Barrett\u2019s name surfaced, and the defendant never cut short the conversation when Barrett was the topic of conversation. Until her death, Robb\u2019s mother regularly corresponded with the defendant and often kept Robb informed of his status.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Over the course of many in-person and telephone conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>tians, Barrett told Robb that he wanted to kill himself because \u201csomeone was taking the rap for something that he had done.\u201d Barrett also told Robb that the defendant had been wrongly accused and that Barrett had in fact killed someone. Robb testified that she \u201cpieced it together\u201d that Barrett had committed the crime for which the defendant was convicted and incarcerated. Robb urged Barrett to do \u201cthe right thing,\u201d but never discussed the topic with anyone else. Only once, after the defendant had been in prison for \u201cawhile,\u201d did she reference Barrett\u2019s statements with the defendant by asking, \u201cHow could a friend not come forth?\u201d The judge expressly credited Robb\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Trooper Sprague, the lead State police detective who investigated the victim\u2019s shooting, indicated that the working theory of the case was that two men, the defendant and Barrett, had killed the victim. Sprague was involved in a \u201csting operation\u201d to discover evidence linking Barrett to the victim\u2019s murder. With court authorization, State police and local investigators put a wiretap on Barrett\u2019s telephone, as well as a listening device in the defendant\u2019s automobile for a twenty-four hour period to intercept conversations between the defendant and Barrett. No evidence was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">State police Sergeant Kevin P. Shea interviewed Robb on July 23, 2003. Robb told him that while intoxicated by drugs and alcohol, Barrett had told her that he wanted to kill himself because the defendant was doing time for him. Robb also told Sergeant Shea that she had been in a coma for four days in 1993 as a result of Graves\u2019 disease, and that the coma had impaired her memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Sydney Hanlon, the former assistant district attorney who represented the Commonwealth at the defendant\u2019s trial (and who now is a Boston Municipal Court judge), testified that the working theory of the case was that two men had committed the murder: the defendant as the shooter and Barrett as the getaway driver. Hanlon had participated in the wiretap of Barrett\u2019s telephone, and she testified that Barrett once telephoned the defendant, stating, \u201cPick up the phone, pick up the phone Freddy, they\u2019re coming.\u201d All discovery, including police reports that described the working theory of the case, were given to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>defendant\u2019s trial counsel before trial. Further, Hanlon had discussed the joint venture theory with the defendant\u2019s trial attorney, and the theory was mentioned in submissions to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Against this factual background, the judge found the following: \u201cI find the defendant\u2019s testimony that he was unaware of the contents of the letter to be credible. Although the defendant knew of the letter\u2019s existence for over twenty years prior to his filing a motion for a new trial, he did not know the letter\u2019s import.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] The backdrop of South Boston provides the context which buttresses [the defendant\u2019s] credibility. The defendant was accused of murder and received five visits from Bulger and Flemmi. During those visits, Bulger made it abundantly clear that Tommy Barrett was a name that [the defendant] was not to utter. The force behind Bulger\u2019s admonition derived from his reputation for ruthlessness and violence earned by terrorizing the South Boston community. Bulger\u2019s threats were not empty.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">\u201cWhen Gloria Weichel approached her son with news of a letter written by Barrett, [the defendant] did not want to discuss it. It is fair to infer that at the time Gloria Weichel told her son about the letter, Bulger\u2019s threats to him were fresh; [the defendant] had been convicted of murder just months earlier. Bulger\u2019s words would have been at the peak of their potency, given that [the defendant] had only been incarcerated for a few months. It is credible that [the defendant] would not have inquired about the contents of the letter at that point, and that he did not do so until 2001.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The judge went on to address Barrett\u2019s confession letter and Barrett\u2019s incriminating verbal statements to Robb. The judge first noted that there was no question that the defendant did not know about the letter until after trial. The judge found that when the defendant learned of the letter, he did not know the letter\u2019s contents. The judge explained that the issue remaining was whether the defendant reasonably could have discovered the exculpatory content of the letter. The judge analogized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>circumstances to those in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>431 Mass. 212, 222 (2000), in which a judge\u2019s order denying a defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence of battered woman syndrome was affirmed, but in which the court held that, in appropriate cases, evidence of battered woman syndrome may constitute newly discovered evidence because characteristic of the condition is an inability of a woman to perceive herself as abused or to gain help by communicating abuse to others. The judge concluded, based on Bulger\u2019s threats and the \u201cfear and intimidation\u201d that the defendant \u201cfaced at the hands of Bulger and Flemmi,\u201d it was reasonable for the defendant to fear for his safety and his family\u2019s safety and \u201cdecide not to uncover the content contained in Barrett\u2019s letter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The judge next determined that Barrett\u2019s verbal statements to Robb that he had killed the victim also constituted newly discovered evidence. The judge reasoned: \u201c[The defendant\u2019s] counsel on his motion for a new trial did not discover that Robb had information relating to the defendant\u2019s case until after the evidentiary hearing had begun, and there is no evidence that [the defendant] had any reason to believe that Robb possessed exculpatory evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The judge recognized that Barrett\u2019s confession letter and Barrett\u2019s verbal statements to Robb constituted hearsay, but concluded that the evidence would be admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule for statements against penal interest. The judge focused on the corroboration requirement of that exception, namely that \u201cthe statement [against penal interest], if offered to exculpate the accused, must be corroborated by circumstances clearly indicating its trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>397 Mass. 65, 73 (1986), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>571 F.2d 285, 288 (5th Cir. 1978). After reviewing the circumstances in which Barrett made his statements, the judge stated that the totality of circumstances \u201cclearly show that Barrett had little to gain and much to lose by confessing to the [victim\u2019s] murder .... Given the unlikeliness that Barrett would fabricate a story and risk criminal liability by twice repeating it to two people who were loyal to the defendant, I find that sufficient corroboration merits the admissibility of Barrett\u2019s confessions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Finally, the judge concluded that the defendant had satisfied his burden of showing that the newly discovered evidence cast real doubt on the justice of his conviction. The judge noted that while there was sufficient evidence to warrant the jury\u2019s verdict convicting the defendant, the case against him did not have overwhelming evidence of guilt, but was based principally on one witness\u2019s (Foley\u2019s) identification. The judge noted that each type of newly discovered evidence (the letter or the verbal statements to Robb) by itself would be \u201cenough to merit a new trial,\u201d but that \u201cthe evidence together provides particular strength to its weight.\u201d We turn now to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">2. The well-established principles governing a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence are set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 305-306 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-6\">\u201cA defendant seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence must establish both that the evidence is newly discovered and that it casts real doubt on the justice of the conviction. . . . The evidence said to be new not only must be material and credible . . . but also must carry a measure of strength in support of the defendant\u2019s position. . . . Thus newly discovered evidence that is cumulative of evidence admitted at the trial tends to carry less weight than new evidence that is different in kind. Moreover, the judge must find there is a substantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion had the evidence been admitted at trial. . . . The motion judge decides not whether the verdict would have been different, but rather whether the new evidence would probably have been a real factor in the jury\u2019s deliberations. . . . This process of judicial analysis requires a thorough knowledge of the trial proceedings . . . and can, of course, be aided by a trial judge\u2019s observation of events at trial ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-7\">\u201cNot only must the allegedly new evidence demonstrate the materiality, weight, and significance that we have described, but it must also <em>have been unknown to the defendant or his counsel and not reasonably discoverable by them at the time of trial (or at the time of the presentation of an earlier motion for a new trial). . . . </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>defendant has the burden of proving that reasonable pretrial diligence would not have uncovered the evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted and emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">A defendant also bears the burden of demonstrating that any newly discovered evidence is admissible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>433 Mass. 406, 416 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>394 Mass. 341, 346-347 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">In reviewing the denial or grant of a new trial motion, we \u201cexamine the motion judge\u2019s conclusion only to determine whether there has been a significant error of law or other abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, supra </em>at 307. If the motion judge did not preside at the trial, we defer only to the judge\u2019s credibility determinations and \u201cregard ourselves in as good a position as the motion judge to assess the trial record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">3. The parties dispute whether the defendant waived his present claim by not asserting it in his first motion for a new trial in 1991 and, if a waiver occurred (the Commonwealth is probably correct that there was a waiver), what the consequences might be. We need not definitively resolve the disagreement because, as we shall next point out, the information that was determined by the judge to be newly discovered evidence is not within the purview of that doctrine. Thus, the defendant, not having shown that he possesses newly discovered evidence, is not entitled to a new trial because he has not demonstrated the chance that a miscarriage of justice occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">4. The judge erroneously concluded that the defendant had satisfied his burden of establishing that the evidence supporting his new trial motion was newly discovered and, particularly, that the evidence was not reasonably discoverable by the defendant or his counsel at the time of trial or his first motion for a new trial. We first take up Barrett\u2019s confession letter to the defendant\u2019s mother, and then consider Barrett\u2019s verbal confession to Robb.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">(a) <em>Barrett confession letter. </em>The judge erroneously concluded <em>that the </em>defendant could not have reasonably discovered, prior to his 1991 motion for a new trial, the exculpatory content of Barrett\u2019s confession letter because he feared, and had been threatened by, Bulger and had been intimidated by Bulger and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Flemmi. In essence, the judge, relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra, </em>carved out a coercion or fear exception to the reasonable diligence requirement of newly discovered evidence. This was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Although affirming the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on battered woman syndrome, the court in the <em>Pike </em>decision stated that \u201cin appropriate cases, evidence of battered woman syndrome may constitute \u2018newly discovered\u2019 evidence, even though the condition may have existed prior to, or at the time of, trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222. The court explained: \u201cWe do so because our case law, as well as experts in the field, acknowledge that a common characteristic of battered women is a \u2018learned helplessness,\u2019 which manifests itself in an inability of the woman to perceive herself as abused, or to gain help by communicating the abuse to others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Put another way, \u201cthe failure to recognize (or be able to communicate to one\u2019s attorney or others) that she is a battered woman is itself a specific characteristic of the syndrome.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Unlike the defendant in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra, </em>the defendant did not suffer from any recognized psychological syndrome, or other mental impairment, that prevented him from pursuing potentially exculpatory evidence. The <em>Pike </em>decision is inapposite to this case. Despite knowing at the time of trial that Barrett was considered a suspect; despite, before his trial, having been given repeated warnings by Bulger not to say anything about Barrett; despite learning in March, 1982, from his mother that she had received a letter from Barrett that claimed the defendant was innocent; and despite having heard \u201cword in the street\u201d that Barrett had killed the victim, the defendant \u201cdecidefd] not to uncover the content contained in Barrett\u2019s letter.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The basis for the defendant\u2019s decision, a coercion or fear exception to the standards governing newly discovered evidence, has no support in the law. It is surely regrettable that parties or witnesses in criminal prosecutions may be subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>threats and intimidation to the point where they may not come forward or cooperate. However, recognizing a new exception of the sort argued for by the defendant \u2014 an exception of almost limitless definition and application that insulates those who acquiesce to pressure \u2014 impermissibly evades the issue of witness intimidation and threatens the integrity of the trial process. Consistent with his duty of reasonable diligence, the defendant could have \u201cuncovered\u201d the content of Barrett\u2019s confession letter and revealed the content to his attorney, and he could have sought protection for himself and his family from the government. \u201cA hard choice is not the same as no choice.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Salazar, </em>528 U.S. 304, 315 (2000). He should not be rewarded for making the wrong choice with resulting impairment of the integrity of the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">In reaching his conclusions, the judge made findings concerning the \u201cbackdrop\u201d of South Boston and the past activities, past reputations, and current status of both Bulger and Flemmi. The judge ruled on information that, decades after the defendant\u2019s trial, had become common knowledge. The critical issue, however, was what the defendant knew, or reasonably should have discovered, before or shortly after his trial in 1981, and by the time of his first motion for a new trial in 1991. Subsequent disclosures about the evils and wrongdoings of Bulger and Flemmi are not legally relevant. We are satisfied that the defendant had it within his means to ascertain the content of the Barrett letter long before he filed his current motion, and his deliberate failure to do so renders the information clearly not newly discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">(b) <em>Barrett\u2019s verbal statements to Robb. </em>In 1981, during his trial, the defendant realized, or should have realized, that the Commonwealth considered Barrett a suspect. When the defendant asked Robb if Barrett could stay with her in California, he informed her that Barrett \u201cwas in trouble.\u201d While Barrett was living with Robb in the 1980\u2019s, some time after the defendant had been convicted and while he was serving his sentence (but before the defendant\u2019s first motion for a new trial in 1991), Robb asked the defendant why a friend would not come forward. Despite the fear that prompted the defendant to make it his \u201cpolicy\u201d never to discuss Barrett with anyone, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>Ms mother, he never \u201chalted the conversation when Barrett was the topic of conversation\u201d with Robb. In light of these circumstances, and the fact that the defendant and Robb mamtamed commumcations (albeit not on a regular or frequent basis) after she accepted Barrett into her California home, the defendant (assuming he did not already know that Barrett was \u201cin trouble\u201d because Barrett had had a role in the victim\u2019s murder) had to make no more effort than to ask Robb (before filing Ms first motion for a new trial in 1991) if Barrett, whom he knew to be a suspect, had said anytMng about the murder. As such, the judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthere is no evidence that [the defendant] had any reason to believe that Robb possessed exculpatory evidence\u201d is not supported by Ms findings and the underlying record, and consequently, is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The defendant\u2019s contention that the testimony of Barrett\u2019s mother, given at the evidentiary hearing (that, in California, Barrett had met a woman friend, a friend of the defendant, named Sherry), for the first time triggered the discovery of Barrett\u2019s verbal confession to Robb, ignores the facts that (1) in her testimony, Barrett\u2019s mother never stated or even intimated that Barrett had confessed anytMng to Robb, and (2) <em>the defendant </em>had long known Robb, had arranged to have Barrett stay with Robb in California after the murder because Barrett was \u201cin trouble,\u201d and had had commumcations with Robb while he was incarcerated. The defendant overlooks that the obligation to uncover evidence tMough reasonable diligence before trial (or before a motion for a new trial) lies not only with the defendant\u2019s counsel, but also with the defendant himself, when there is a reason to do so. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, supra </em>at 306. Barrett\u2019s mcriminatory statements to Robb also are not newly discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">5. The judge also erred in concludmg that the evidence was admissible. As previously pointed out, the judge recogMzed that the evidence constituted hearsay, but concluded that it was admissible because it constituted statements against penal interest. Under tMs exception to the hearsay rule, a statement is admissible if it satisfies three criteria: \u201c[1] the declarant\u2019s testimony must be unavailable; [2] the statement must so far tend to subject the declarant to criminal liability \u2018that a reasonable man in Ms position would not have made the statement un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>less he believed it to be trac\u2019; and [3] the statement, if offered to exculpate the accused, must be corroborated by circumstances clearly indicating its trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>397 Mass. 65, 73 (1986), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>571 F.2d 285, 288 (5th Cir. 1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>373 Mass. 617, 623-624 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">We agree with the judge that the first two criteria of the exception were satisfied. Barrett\u2019s invocation at the evidentiary hearing of his right under the Fifth Amendment not to incriminate himself rendered his testimony unavailable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, supra. </em>Barrett\u2019s admission to the defendant\u2019s mother that he had killed the victim, and his admission to Robb that he had killed someone whom the defendant had been convicted of killing, were essentially direct admissions of guilt to persons loyal to the defendant that would have subjected Barrett to criminal liability, and it could be found that \u201cany reasonable person in his position would have known as much, and for that reason would not have made the statement without believing it to be true.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tague, </em>434 Mass. 510, 516 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1146 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The judge erred on the third criteria because Barrett\u2019s statements were not adequately corroborated. Under this test, a judge should \u201cassess the credibility of the declarant [Barrett] and . . . admit a statement if \u2018there is some reasonable likelihood that the statement could be true.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galloway, </em>404 Mass. 204, 208 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, supra </em>at 76. \u201c[T]he judge may consider . . . the timing of the declaration and the relationship between the declarant and the witness ... the reliability and character of the declarant . . . whether the statement was made spontaneously . . . whether other people heard the out-of-court statement . . . whether there is any apparent motive for the declarant to misrepresent the matter . . . and whether and in what circumstances the statement was repeated\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, supra. </em>The judge should not, however, assess a proffered witness\u2019s credibility and should leave that task to the jury. <em>Id. </em>Finally, a judge \u201cshould not be stringent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75 n.10. \u201cIf the issue of sufficiency of the defendant\u2019s corroboration is close, the judge should favor admitting the statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As may be expected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>in light of the numerous factors to be considered, the cases are fact sensitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Stating that \u201cthe evidence and the circumstances of this case could . . . indicate the unreliability of Barrett\u2019s confessions,\u201d the judge apparently thought the issue of corroboration was a close one, and therefore deemed the statements admissible. The bases articulated by the judge to demonstrate the trustworthiness of Barrett\u2019s statements, however, were flawed and thus rendered his ultimate conclusion erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The judge found that the timing of Barrett\u2019s statements, \u201cshortly after [the defendant\u2019s] conviction,\u201d reflected trustworthiness because Barrett had not attempted to curry favor with the authorities and because he had confessed \u201camidst a homicide case that was still relatively fresh.\u201d While trustworthiness is present when a declarant\u2019s statement is <em>contemporaneous </em>with a defendant\u2019s arrest or incarceration (or a declarant\u2019s arrest or incarceration), see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, supra </em>at 77, the record does not support the judge\u2019s characterization of the timing. Barrett\u2019s letter was not contemporaneous with the defendant\u2019s arrest or conviction but, rather, was written some <em>nineteen months after </em>his arrest and some <em>seven months after </em>his conviction. While no definitive time was provided concerning Barrett\u2019s statements to Robb, his statements were made while he lived with Robb initially in Sausalito and later, in the spring of 1982, in Mill Valley, and were made before she moved to southern California in the mid-1980\u2019s. Thus, Barrett\u2019s statements to Robb were not contemporaneous with either the defendant\u2019s arrest or his conviction. The timing of the statements did not properly warrant a determination that they were trustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The judge also found trustworthiness in Barrett\u2019s statements because Barrett had reason to believe he was a suspect in the victim\u2019s murder. This consideration is more relevant to the second criteria of the exception. The judge overlooked the evidence that Barrett likely also knew, based on the fact that no charges were ever brought against him, that there was no evidence linking him to the victim\u2019s murder. Unlike the defendant, Barrett did not match the description of the man the witnesses in Faxon Park saw running after the shooting. Cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tague, supra </em>at 517. Three of the witnesses described the man as having dark or brown hair. Barrett had blond or \u201csandy\u201d hair, and did not look at all like the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Most problematic is the judge\u2019s finding of corroboration based on the fact that Barrett\u2019s separate confessions corroborated \u201ceach other.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While Barrett told two people (the defendant\u2019s mother and Robb) essentially the same thing, his statements contained no details about the crime and no factual details as to his involvement in it. See <em>id.; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiToro, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 191, 199 (2001). Barrett did not supply the victim\u2019s name to Robb, and with respect to both women (Robb and the defendant\u2019s mother), he never stated how he committed the murder (by way of a shooting). Further, Barrett\u2019s close relationship with the defendant, by itself, may demonstrate \u201can obvious motive to fabricate his statement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">We also add that Barrett\u2019s character was, at best, questionable. At the evidentiary hearing, the defendant acknowledged that Barrett drank alcohol and used marijuana. Robb had observed Barrett drinking and suspected that he used drugs because of his \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201cerratic\u201d behavior. Barrett also had been arrested (in the 1970\u2019s) for armed robbery and for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. The judge should have factored this evidence into his assessment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marple, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 150, 159 (1988). Had he done so, he would have had no choice (on this record) but to question the reliability and trustworthiness of any statements made by Barrett. We can sum up the weakness in the corroboration of the defendant\u2019s proposed proofs by looking to the words of Justice Kaplan in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marple, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-7\">\u201c[A] rundown of factors mentioned in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, [supra </em>at 76], and other authority shows a distinct deficit. The character and reliability of the declarant were suspect. The alleged statements were not contemporaneous with the homicide or the defendant\u2019s indictment; they came more than a year after the incident and were reported to the defendant . . . years later. [Here, it is simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>unknown if] [t]he statements were not spontaneous but were elicited by questions. They were confided to friendly or sympathetic associates, not to any indifferent audience, and, although there was repetition, the two hearers [or readers] can be seen as belonging to the same coterie. The statements themselves provided no detail toward exculpating the defendant, and the evidence in the case apart from the proposed hearsay [here, the identification of the defendant at trial] indicated strongly that the blanket exonerating assertions were false . . . .\u201d (Footnotes and citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Based on the considerations discussed, Barrett\u2019s alleged confessions lack trustworthiness and are not otherwise sufficiently corroborated. The evidence would not be admissible: See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, supra </em>at 78; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marple, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\"><em>6. </em>The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial is vacated.
