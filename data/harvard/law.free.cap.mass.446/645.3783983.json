L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (16), survives the employee\u2019s death and, if so, what damages may be awarded. The employee, Richard Gasior, filed a complaint against his employer, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), claiming it had violated G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4, and the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>c. 93, \u00a7 103, by refusing to permit him to return to work as a plumber after an authorized medical leave of absence. While the case was pending, Gasior died for reasons unrelated to his authorized medical leave.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> MGH thereupon moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that Gasior\u2019s discrimination claim did not survive his death, and that his MERA claim was barred by the exclusivity provision of G. L. c. 151B. A judge in the Superior Court denied MGH\u2019s motion to dismiss the discrimination claim insofar as Gasior claimed compensatory damages, but allowed its motion as to that claim insofar as he claimed punitive damages. She also allowed MGH\u2019s motion as to Gasi- or\u2019s MERA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">On a joint motion of the parties, the judge then reserved and reported to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 64, as amended, 423 Mass. 1410 (1996), so much of her ruling as concerned Gasior\u2019s discrimination claim: \u201cDoes an employment discrimination claim under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, survive the plaintiff\u2019s death pursuant to G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1, insofar as the plaintiff claims compensatory but not punitive damages?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted Gasior\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">We address the narrow question presented by the circumstances of this case, not the broader question reported by the judge. See <em>McStowe </em>v. <em>Bornstein, </em>377 Mass. 804, 805 n.2 (1979) (\u201cReported questions need not be answered . . . except to the extent that it is necessary to do so in resolving the basic issue\u201d). We conclude that a claim that an employee was wrongfully dismissed in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), survives the employee\u2019s death. We therefore affirm so much of the order as denied MGH\u2019s motion to dismiss. We further conclude that all of the remedies available to the employee under G. L. c. 15 IB survive his death. We therefore vacate so much of the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>decision that allowed MGH\u2019s motion to dismiss as to punitive damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>The issue for our consideration is the correctness of the interlocutory order entered in the Superior Court on MGH\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). See <em>McStowe </em>v. <em>Bornstein, supra. </em>Although MGH challenges some of the factual allegations in Gasior\u2019s complaint, in particular the circumstances of Gasior\u2019s efforts to return to work as a plumber, we review the question under the settled standard of review for a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule 12 (b) (6):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">\u201cWe take as true \u2018 \u201cthe allegations of the complaint, as well as such inferences as may be drawn therefrom in the plaintiff\u2019s favor ...\u201d <em>Blank </em>v. <em>Chelmsford Ob/Gyn, P.C., </em>420 Mass. 404, 407 (1995). In evaluating the allowance of a motion to dismiss, we are guided by the principle that a complaint is sufficient \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977) ....\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-10\"><em>Marram </em>v. <em>Kobrick Offshore Fund, Ltd., </em>442 Mass. 43, 45 (2004). Under the \u201cgenerous principles\u201d that govern our review, <em>Connerty </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>398 Mass. 140, 143 (1986), we summarize the facts alleged in the unverified complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Gasior worked as a plumber for MGH for nineteen years, beginning in 1981. In February, 2000, he began an authorized medical leave of absence because of a heart condition. A physician approved Gasior\u2019s return to work in August, 2000. Gasior claims that from that time forward he was able to perform the essential functions of his job as a plumber \u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation,\u201d and that despite repeated attempts to return to his job as a plumber, MGH refused to permit him to return to work at that time, notwithstanding that MGH had posted several openings for plumbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">In June, 2001, after exhausting his administrative remedies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>by filing a claim with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, Gasior filed a complaint in the Superior Court. He requested relief consisting of reinstatement, back pay, front pay, lost benefits, emotional distress damages, punitive damages, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and any other relief to which he might be entitled. At some point while his action was pending, Gasior became terminally ill. He filed motions to advance his trial date, but died in September, 2003, one week before the trial was scheduled to begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">2. <em>Survival of the discrimination claim. </em>We first discuss the survival of Gasior\u2019s G. L. c. 151B claim under the Massachusetts survival statute, G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We then turn to the issue of the relief that may be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The Massachusetts survival statute, G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1, provides in pertinent part that, \u201c[i]n addition to the actions which survive by the common law,\u201d certain enumerated claims, including certain specifically identified tort claims, survive the death of a party. A claim of employment discrimination in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is not a claim among those specifically enumerated in the statute. To remain viable after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Gasior\u2019s death, therefore, the claim must fall within one of the enumerated tort claims or be deemed an action that survives \u201cby the common law.\u201d G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Generally speaking, at common law contract claims, including those based on an implied contract, survive the death of a party. See <em>Rendek </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Bristol County, </em>440 Mass. 1017 (2003); <em>McStowe </em>v. <em>Bornstein, supra </em>at 806-807, and cases cited. We have not previously decided whether a claim of discrimination pursuant to G. L. c. 151B survives a plaintiff\u2019s death.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In other circumstances, in assessing whether a claim survives a party\u2019s death, we have observed that \u201c[w]hat constitutes a contract claim has not been rigidly defined.\u201d <em>Rendek </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Bristol County, supra </em>at 1017. We have also recognized the close relationship between some employment discrimination claims and actions for what we have characterized as breaches of contract. See <em>id. </em>at 1017-1018 (claim for unlawful termination in violation of G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 51, is \u201ccontractual, or quasi contractual,\u201d and therefore survives plaintiff\u2019s death, because statute \u201ccontrol[s] a critical term of the employment \u2014 permissible grounds for termination\u201d). See also <em>Stonehill College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>441 Mass. 549, 582 (2004) (Sosman, J., concurring) (\u201csome discrimination claims are \u2018rooted\u2019 in theories of contract [in essence reading the prohibitions of G. L. c. 151B into the parties\u2019 employment contract and then allowing suit for \u2018breach\u2019 of that contract]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In this case, we are presented with a specific question of alleged discrimination: does the claim of a plaintiff who has an established employment relationship with the defendant and who alleges that he was wrongfully dismissed or not reinstated by his employer, survive the plaintiff\u2019s death? The answer turns in part on the nature of the employment relationship. Gasior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>claimed that he had a \u201cgood work record\u201d and received \u201cpositive performance evaluations\u201d while working at MGH, but his complaint is otherwise silent as to any other aspect of his employment relationship with MGH. Gasior has not, for example, alleged the existence of an employment contract for a definite period, or that he was a member of a union protected by any collective bargaining agreement that might govern his termination. We therefore assume, without deciding, that he was an at-will employee at MGH. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Action for Boston Community Dev., Inc., </em>403 Mass. 8, 9 (1988). See also S.C. Moriearty, J.F. Adkins, L.F. Rubin, &amp; D.J. Jackson, Employment Law \u00a7 2.3, at 94 (2d ed. 2003) (\u201cPresumptively the employment relationship is at-will, meaning that either party may terminate the relationship at any time, with or without cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Although we have not characterized every at-will employment relationship as itself constituting a form of contract \u2014 such a relationship could, for example, be viewed as a contract of successive performances of indefinite duration<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 we have had no difficulty in concluding that an at-will employment relationship contains implied terms, the breach of which is actionable. See, e.g., <em>DeRose </em>v. <em>Putnam Mgt. Co., </em>398 Mass. 205, 210 (1986) (permitting at-will employee to recover damages on a breach of contract theory for discharge in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>public policy); <em>Fortune </em>v. <em>National Cash Register Co., </em>373 Mass. 96, 101 (1977) (written contract for at-will employment \u201ccontains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and a termination not made in good faith constitutes a breach of the contract\u201d). See also <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Action for Boston Community Dev., Inc., supra </em>at 9 (recognizing that prohibition against discrimination in employment contained in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, restricts employer\u2019s ability to discharge at-will employee). Here, the relevant provisions of G. L. c. 15 IB controlled a term of Gasior\u2019s employment at MGH: that term prohibited MGH from dismissing or refusing to reinstate him because of invidious, discrimination. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because Gasior has alleged that MGH did not permit him to return to work after his medical leave in violation of this implied contractual term of his employment relationship with MGH, his claim is among those that survive \u201cby the common law.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Rendek </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Bristol County, supra. </em>See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>504 U.S. 229, 247-248 (1992) (Sauter, J., concurring) (Tide VB\u2019s statutory ban on employment discrimination \u201ceasily envisioned as a contractual term implied by law\u201d); <em>Hishon </em>v. <em>King &amp; Spalding, </em>467 U.S. 69, 74 (1984) (\u201cOnce a contractual relationship of employment is established, the provisions of Title VII attach and govern certain aspects of that relationship\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Our holding that a claim by an employee that he suffered invidious discrimination when he was dismissed or not reinstated by his employer survives his death is consistent with the decisional law of the majority of courts that have considered analogous questions. See, e.g., <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. </em>v. <em>Darrone, </em>465 U.S. 624, 630 (1984) (former employee\u2019s claim that employer refused to permit him to return to work following a disabling accident, in violation of \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, survives his death); <em>Fariss </em>v. <em>Lynchburg Foundry, </em>769 F.2d 958, 962 n.3 (4th Cir. 1985) (former employee\u2019s claim that he had been terminated in violation of Age Discrimination in Employment Act [ADEA] survives his death as matter of Federal law); <em>Hawes </em>v. <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>940 F. Supp. 697, 704 (D.N.J. 1996) (former employee\u2019s claim of constructive discharge in violation of the ADEA and the New Jersey law against discrimination survives his death as a matter of Federal common law and under State survival statute, respectively); <em>Duart </em>v. <em>FMC Wyo. Corp., </em>859 F. Supp. 1447, 1451 n.2 (D. Wyo. 1994) (former employee\u2019s claim that he had been terminated from employment in violation of the ADEA survives his death); <em>Shkolnik </em>v. <em>Combustion Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>856 F. Supp. 82, 88 (D. Conn. 1994) (former employee\u2019s claim that he had been terminated from employment in violation of the ADEA survives his death); <em>Anspach </em>v. <em>Tomkins Indus., Inc., </em>817 F. Supp. 1499, 1510 (D. Kan. 1993) (former employee\u2019s Title VII claim survives his death under State survival statute); <em>Small </em>v. <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>759 F. Supp. 1427, 1430 (W.D. Mo. 1991) (former employee\u2019s claim that he was discriminated against and ultimately terminated because of his race, in violation of Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, survives his death under State survival statute); <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>United States Army, </em>758 F. Supp. 484, 485 (E.D. Ark. 1991) (former employee\u2019s claim that his employer failed to accommodate his disability in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, leading him to terminate his employment, survives his death pursuant to State survival statute); <em>Worsowicz </em>v. <em>Nashua Corp., </em>612 F. Supp. 310, 312 (D.N.H. 1985) (former employee\u2019s claim that he had been terminated from employment in violation of the ADEA survives his death); <em>Pedreyra </em>v. <em>Cornell Prescription Pharmacies, Inc., </em>465 F. Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>936, 939 (D. Colo. 1979) (former employee\u2019s claim that she was terminated in violation of Title VII survives her death pursuant to State survival statute).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">We conclude that Gasior\u2019s claim that MGH violated G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), by dismissing or refusing to reinstate him following an authorized medical leave, survives his death. We turn next to the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">3. <em>Survival of punitive damages. </em>Relying on <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Loyal Protective Life Ins. Co., </em>379 Mass. 212, 216-217 (1979), the judge concluded that Gasior could recover compensatory damages, but that there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that Gasior\u2019s claim for punitive damages abated because it is \u201cpunitive rather than compensatory in nature.\u201d We recognize that the purpose of punitive damages has been described as punishment and deterrence, rather than compensation of an injured party,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> see, e.g., <em>Newport </em>v. <em>Fact Concerts, Inc., </em>453 U.S. 247, 266-267 (1981), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 908 (1979), and \u2014 in the context of G. L. c. 151B \u2014 as not merely vindicating personal rights, but comprising part of a scheme to vindicate a \u201cbroader public interest in eradicating systemic discrimination.\u201d <em>Stonehill College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>441 Mass. 549, 563 (2004). Consistent with the broad remedial purposes of G. L. c. 151B, which both mandates that the provision concerning remedies available to the victims of discrimination be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the statute\u2019s purposes, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, and acts as a deterrent to those employers who engage in invidious discrimination, we conclude that to the extent a deceased plaintiffs discrimination claim survives him,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> he should have available to him all of the remedies provided under the antidiscrimination statute. This includes punitive damages.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 9 (petitioner may be awarded \u201cactual and punitive damages\u201d); <em>Clifton </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>445 Mass. 611, 624 (2005) (punitive damages may be awarded for employment discrimination in violation of G. L. c. 151B). We see no reason to distinguish as to statutory remedies between a plaintiff who has suffered the indignities of unlawful discrimination (if proved) and who survives, and a similarly aggrieved plaintiff who is deceased, simply because the exigencies of court scheduling may delay the granting of relief until after the plaintiffs death.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As Gasior noted, individuals claiming unlawful discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>must first exhaust their administrative remedies, see G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, and their cases sometimes take years to reach resolution. It would cause grave injustices to those plaintiffs who have embarked on the often burdensome and expensive journey to vindicate their rights if the full scope of their damages were to evaporate simply because of the fortuity of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Our conclusion is consistent with the broad remedial purposes underlying this Commonwealth\u2019s antidiscrimination statutes, which we have repeatedly emphasized in construing G. L. c. 151B. See, e.g., <em>Ayash </em>v. <em>Dana-Farber Cancer Inst., </em>443 Mass. 367, 390 (2005) (statutory limitations on tort liability of charitable entities do not \u201cshield charitable institutions from the full effects of liability under G. L. c. 151B\u201d); <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>424 Mass. 758, 763 (1997) (Commonwealth and its political subdivisions are liable for damages for violations of G. L. c. 151B); <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Electro Switch Corp., </em>402 Mass. 385, 387 (1988) (damage award for lost future earnings and benefits, or \u201cfront pay,\u201d available pursuant to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9). The Legislature has provided for a broad range of remedies, including the availability of punitive damages, to those who suffer invidious discrimination.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9. In determining whether Gasior\u2019s estate should be deprived of damages to which he himself would have been entitled had he survived, \u201cwe need not look beyond the words of the statute where the language is plain and unambiguous.\u201d <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>391 Mass. 92, 94 (1984). Our decision that Gasior may have access to all of the remedies available under G. L. c. 15IB is also consistent with the Legislature\u2019s determination that the \u201cremedies provision contained in \u00a7 9 expressly states that it should be \u2018construed liberally for the accomplishment of\u2019 the purposes of G. L. c. 151B and that \u2018any law inconsistent with any provision [of G. L. c. 15 IB] shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ayash </em>v. <em>Dana-Farber Cancer Inst., supra </em>at 391-392, quoting G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>A claim that an employee was wrongfully dismissed in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), survives the employee\u2019s death, as do all of the remedies available to him under G. L. c. 151B. We affirm so much of the judge\u2019s order as denied MGH\u2019s motion to dismiss, and vacate so much of her order as allowed MGH\u2019s motion as to punitive damages. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of an order consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\">following Richard Gasior\u2019s death, his attorney moved to substitute Gasi- or\u2019s estate as the plaintiff.

Because we affirmed the determination of the judge in the Superior Court that the plaintiff\u2019s claim in that case was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, we did not reach that issue. See <em>id. </em>at 838-839 &amp; n.5.

See Grossman, Making a Federal Case Out of It: Section 1981 and At-Will Employment, 67 Brook. L. Rev. 329, 362-363 (2001). That comment to the Restatement provides: \u201cValid contracts are often made which do not specify the time for performance. . . . When the contract calls for successive performances but is indefinite in duration, it is commonly terminable by either party, with or without a requirement of reasonable notice.\u201d Illustration 6 to comment d supports the proposition that an at-will employment relationship may constitute an enforceable contract of indefinite duration. Restatement (Second) of Contracts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 33 comment d, illustration 6. See Grossman, <em>supra </em>at 362 &amp; n.177.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b669-5\">As an employer of six or more persons, MGH was obligated to comply with the provisions of G. L. c. 151B. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (defining \u201cemployer\u201d for purposes of the chapter). Gasior could, therefore, not maintain a common-law breach of contract claim for MGH\u2019s allegedly discriminatory dismissal of him because any such claim would be preempted by G. L. c. 151B. See <em>Reidy </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>928 F. Supp. 98, 106 (D. Mass. 1996), aff'd, 107 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 809 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Gasior and the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD), the agency charged with implementing G. L. c. 151B, appearing here as amici, present alternative theories for concluding that Gasior\u2019s claim pursuant to G. L. c. 151B survives his death. They argue that Gasior\u2019s claim survives as an action of tort for \u201cother damage to the person,\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>They also argue that the Legislature intended that all G. L. c. 151B claims survive, as demonstrated by the inclusion of \u201clegal representatives\u201d within the class of people who are able to file a claim pursuant to G. L. c. 151B with the MCAD, and the inclusion of the Probate and Family- Court Department within the courts with jurisdiction over G. L. c. 151B actions. In light of our conclusion that in this case Gasior has stated a claim that survives at common law, we need not address these broader questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Cf. <em>Slade </em>v. <em>United States Postal Serv., </em>952 F.2d 357, 360 (10th Cir. 1991) (claim of failure to hire in violation of Title VII survives plaintiffs death); <em>Scott </em>v. <em>University of Del., </em>601 F.2d 76, 81 n.8 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 931 (1979) (State survival statute permits deceased plaintiff to pursue claims against former employer pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 for discrimination on the basis of race in rehiring). Here, we are dealing with an alleged violation of G. L. c. 151B that occurred during the course of a contractual relationship between an employer and an employee. We do not address the broader question whether all claims under G. L. c. 151B, including violations allegedly occurring when there was no contractual relationship between the parties, would survive the death of the plaintiff. See <em>Stonehill College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>441 Mass. 549, 578 (2004) (Sosman, J., concurring) (\u201cG. L. c. 151B sweeps far more broadly than breach of contract actions by discharged employees \u2014 it creates a cause of action for persons who had <em>no </em>contractual relation with the defendant, premised on the defendant\u2019s <em>refusal </em>to enter into a contract in the first place [e.g., discriminatory refusal to hire, or refusal to promote]\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Under Federal common law, actions that are penal in nature do not survive the death of a party, but those that are remedial do survive. See, e.g., <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; O.R.R., </em>168 U.S. 445, 448 (1897); <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Attrill, </em>146 U.S. 657 (1892); <em>Asklar </em>v. <em>Honeywell, Inc., </em>95 F.R.D. 419, 423 (D. Conn. 1982). Federal courts have determined that Title VII and Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) claims, inter alla, are remedial in nature and that claims brought under these statutes survive the plaintiffs death. See, e.g., <em>Khan </em>v. <em>Grotnes Metalforming Sys. Inc., </em>679 F. Supp. 751, 756-757 (N.D. Ill. 1988) (ADEA and Title VIII); <em>Asklar </em>v. <em>Honeywell, Inc., supra </em>(ADEA).

Ark. 1991) (former employee\u2019s discrimination claim under Rehabilitation Act survives his death pursuant to State survival statute). In one of the few cases analyzing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>availability of punitive damages under both Federal and State statutes prohibiting discrimination in employment, <em>Hawes </em>v. <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>940 F. Supp. 697 (D.N.J. 1996), the court applied Federal common law to determine that a deceased plaintiff\u2019s \u201cclaims for liquidated and punitive damages which are penal in nature under the ADEA\u201d do not survive his death, <em>id. </em>at 703, but that his claims for both compensatory and punitive damages pursuant to the New Jersey law against discrimination do survive his death pursuant to the State survival statute, <em>id. </em>at 702.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\">See note 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b672-7\">MGH does not challenge the judge\u2019s determination that compensatory damages would be available to Gasior in the event that his G.
