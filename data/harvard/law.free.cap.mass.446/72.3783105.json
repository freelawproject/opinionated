A District Court judge determined that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>violated his probation by this conduct and committed him to a house of correction to serve the balance of a suspended sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appealed and the Appeals Court affirmed the probation revocation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 142 (2005). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review, and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\"><em>Background. </em>On January 21, 2000, the defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, in the Clinton Division of the District Court Department. He was sentenced on each count to two and one-half years in a house of correction, with seventeen months to serve, the balance suspended for five years, with probation until January 21, 2005. The sentence on the second count was to run concurrently with that on the first count.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge imposed a special condition of probation that the defendant have \u201c[n]o contact [with] victim [and] [n]o contact [with] children under 16 yrs of age.\u201d It is this \u201cno contact\u201d condition that is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">On August 29, 2002, the defendant was notified that he had violated the \u201cno contact\u201d condition of his probation. The violation was based on his attendance at a local car show. At the probation revocation hearing, evidence was presented by a Bolton police officer who was present at the car show, the defendant\u2019s probation officer, and two of the defendant\u2019s acquaintances. A videotape of twenty minutes of the defendant\u2019s presence at the car show recorded by a second Bolton police officer was also introduced, and we have viewed it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The evidence presented at the hearing can be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>On August 27, 2002, while the defendant was on probation, he attended a car show in Bolton. The car show was a weekly event held in the evening in the parking lot of a candy store and factory.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> People of various ages attended, including children under sixteen years. The cars on display were congregated in one general area near a food concession stand. The defendant arrived at approximately 7:40 p.m. and stayed for about one hour. He displayed his antique automobile with the other cars in the show near the concession stand. He brought his dog with him and allowed it to roam through the crowd without a leash. Children in the crowd came within ten to fifteen feet of the defendant, perhaps even as close as five feet. The police officer who was present at the show did not observe the defendant speak to any children, but described children as \u201cin very close proximity\u201d to him, although not within \u201carm\u2019s reach.\u201d These observations are consistent with the videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The defendant\u2019s probation officer testified that, based on court documents, that in the defendant\u2019s previous offenses it had been part of his \u201cmodus operandi to use his car and his dog to lure children over to him, to get talking and to bring them into contact with him.\u201d This was part of the defendant\u2019s method of establishing relationships with his victims before he sexually assaulted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The first witness for the defense related an encounter with the defendant while he was on probation. The witness and his minor grandchildren stopped to talk to the defendant, who was in his driveway approximately forty feet from the children. The defendant prevented the children from visiting, saying, \u201cYou know I\u2019m not supposed to be around children.\u201d His second witness testified that he was at the car show displaying a car within view of the defendant, and that he did not observe the defendant touch or communicate with any children, and did not observe any children in the defendant\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\"><em>The probation order. </em>The defendant challenges revocation of his probation on the ground that the \u201cno contact\u201d condition did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>not reasonably communicate that his conduct at the car show was prohibited.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Due process requires that a probationer receive fair warning of conduct that may result in revocation of probation; thus, probation conditions must provide reasonable guidance with respect to what activities are prohibited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power, </em>420 Mass. 410, 421 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1042 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lally, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 601, 603 (2002). Probation conditions, however, need not provide the fullest warning imaginable. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>20 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1994). The notice requirement can be satisfied by \u201can imprecise but comprehensible normative standard so that [people] of common intelligence will know its meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 734 (1977). Reading the condition with due regard to the circumstances in which it was imposed, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gallo, supra </em>at 11, a reasonable person should have understood that \u201c[n]o contact with children under [sixteen years]\u201d precluded the defendant\u2019s activities at a car show attended by such children.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The Appeals Court has read a probation condition of \u201cno contact\u201d as a strict bar against proximity or encounters of any type. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 446 (1993), evidence of a defendant\u2019s standing on the victim\u2019s street and watching her walk away, even where her street was just a ten minute walk from where he lived, warranted a finding that he had violated a \u201cno contact\u201d condition. <em>Id. </em>at 449-450. The implication of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 930, 930 n.2 (1994), is similar: that a defendant\u2019s mere presence in a car in the driveway of his former wife\u2019s house, if proved, would violate his probation condition to have \u201cno contact\u201d with his former wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Likewise, Massachusetts appellate courts have interpreted the term \u201cno contact\u201d in the related context of G. L. c. 209A protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>tive orders to foreclose a myriad of potential encounters, engagements, or communications between people. A person subject to a G. L. c. 209A \u201cno contact\u201d order violates it by communicating by any means with a protected party or merely by being near that person. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Finase, </em>435 Mass. 310, 314 (2001). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Basile, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 919 (1999) (order violated when defendant appeared \u201cone block or more\u201d from the protected area and waved and jumped up and down on seeing protected party); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 906, 906-907 (1996) (order violated by sending flowers anonymously). These obligations are imposed without regard to a person\u2019s intent to violate an order, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>425 Mass. 587, 596-597 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1058 (1998), to prevent any interaction and the antisocial conduct that it may generate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">A \u201cno contact\u201d order also obligates a person to leave the area if a protected party appears. Happening on a protected person whom one did not, and could not reasonably, know to be present is not a violation, but the party subject to the order must end the encounter by leaving. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Finase, supra </em>at 314-315; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 493 (2002). Therefore, a defendant could have violated a \u201cno contact\u201d order by remaining near a protected party at a band concert on the town common. Although it was a public event, and although there was no evidence that the defendant was present because the protected party was there, he remained in proximity to the protected party after becoming aware of her presence. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Finase, supra </em>at 311, 315. By contrast, a defendant could be found not in violation of a \u201cno contact\u201d order if he entered a house where he did not know \u2014 and should not reasonably have known \u2014 a protected party was present, and then attempted to leave promptly, but was restrained from doing so. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, supra </em>at 489-490, 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The use of the words \u201cno contact\u201d in the defendant\u2019s probation condition, then, is reasonably understood to impose an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>obligation on the defendant to avoid encountering or engaging children in any way; to refrain from attendance at places where proximity to, and thus an encounter with, children is likely; and promptly to remove himself from such proximity if an encounter arises unexpectedly. The condition is not, as the defendant suggests, simply a requirement not to touch or speak to a child. \u201cNo contact\u201d obviously includes such conduct, but also requires the defendant to avoid even the opportunity for such touching or direct communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The requirement to have \u201cno contact\u201d with children under sixteen years of age was imposed when the defendant pleaded guilty to molesting children. In such circumstances, the order communicated to a reasonable person that the defendant\u2019s conduct at the car show was a probation violation. The car show was a community event held in the parking lot of a candy store and attended by minors. Whether the defendant knew beforehand that children would be present, he could not help but become aware of them on his arrival. He failed to remove himself from close proximity to those children. In fact, his actions could be interpreted as designed to encourage children to interact with him. He situated himself near a food concession stand, a location particularly likely to be visited by the protected class. He displayed his antique automobile, a clear invitation to all in attendance to approach. He also brought his dog with him and allowed it to wander through the crowd, an action that could well attract children. Any doubt that the conduct was forbidden by the probation condition is dispelled by its similarity to his conduct during his prior offenses where he used the car and the dog to establish relationships with his victims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The defendant argues that finding a violation where he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>simply near minors, but did not touch or speak with them, would cause him to be in violation of his probation in a host of innocent situations. For example, he suggests that such a reading would render him in violation if a child simply walked past him at a post office or in a supermarket. Probation violations are considered on a case-by-case basis, and we do not address today what other circumstances would constitute prohibited behavior under a \u201cno contact with minors\u201d provision. We note, however, that a \u201cno contact\u201d condition is not the equivalent of house arrest; therefore, some fleeting encounters with children must be anticipated. If the conduct at issue involved inadvertent and unavoidable proximity to children and a defendant removed himself from the situation as quickly as reasonably possible, a logical reading of a \u201cno contact\u201d probation condition and analogy to G. L. c. 209A cases might well lead to a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><em>Hearsay. </em>Relying exclusively on arguments advanced in a brief submitted in an unrelated case, the defendant maintains that the finding that he violated his probation conditions was impermissibly based on hearsay evidence rendered inadmissible by <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004). Most of the evidence at the defendant\u2019s probation revocation hearing was based on direct observation of the defendant\u2019s conduct. However, his probation officer testified that the use of the car and the dog were part of the defendant\u2019s behavior in his previous offenses. This testimony was apparently based on documents provided by the sentencing courts. At least this segment of the probation officer\u2019s testimony was hearsay. Assuming for the sake of argument that the judge relied on the hearsay testimony in reaching her decision to revoke probation, we have separately held that the <em>Crawford </em>case does not apply to probation violation hearings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilcox, ante </em>61 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, there was no error in revoking the defendant\u2019s probation and the order revoking probation is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The defendant has served the balance of his sentence, and the appeal appears to be moot. However, a probation revocation may have collateral consequences. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lally, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 601, 602 n.1 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 477, 479-480, <em>S.C., </em>429 Mass. 1022 (1999). The issue in the case has been fully briefed and may arise again but evade review. See <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 490, 492 (1993). Therefore, we address the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Both sentences were to run concurrently with a sentence the defendant received in the Superior Court approximately two weeks earlier when he pleaded guilty to an indictment charging indecent assault and battery on a child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The videotape was made at the request of the alert Bolton police officer who attended the show and recognized the defendant as a sex offender. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178P. She is the same officer who testified at the revocation hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b92-10\">The record does not indicate whether the candy store was open during the car show.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The defendant presents this basic argument in three ways: disputing the term \u201cno contact\u201d applied to his behavior; asserting that \u201cno contact\u201d is an ambiguous phrase requiring construction in a defendant\u2019s favor; and arguing that the phrase is unconstitutionally vague when applied in the circumstances of this case. Each formulation simply recasts the question whether the probation condition reasonably communicated that his conduct at the car show was barred, and our discussion takes into account all three versions of the defendant\u2019s contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The only intent required is that the defendant voluntarily intended the act that constituted the violation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>431 Mass. 194, 200 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The question in this case is what a reasonable person would understand the probation condition to mean, but our conclusion on this point is buttressed by evidence that the defendant himself understood the condition to mean he must stay away from children. As recounted above, one defense witness, a friend, testified that the defendant once stopped the witness from approaching with his grandchildrend saying, \u201cYou know I\u2019m not supposed to be around children.\u201d This statement indicates that the defendant was aware of the broad nature of the \u201cno contact\u201d condition and its proximity requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The probation revocation proceeding in this case took place over several days. At the end of the first day, the judge scheduled the hearing to resume approximately two weeks later. She also ordered that during the interval, \u201cif <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>[the defendant] goes someplace . . . and there are some children there, I\u2019m going to order that he just leave that area immediately in the meantime, so there\u2019s no further ambiguity with the idea of contact.\u201d The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s statements and order were a recognition that the probation condition was ambiguous. We disagree. The judge\u2019s order merely clarified for the defendant what was expected of him under his \u201cno contact\u201d order; it does not bear on how a reasonable person should have understood the condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilcox, ante </em>61, 66-68 (2006), does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>alter the rule that the hearsay on which the judge relied must have been reliable hearsay. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>441 Mass. 685, 690-691 (2004). The District Court judge did not make explicit findings as to the reliability of the hearsay. The issue, however, is not before us, as the defendant has not made any appellate argument on the matter. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
