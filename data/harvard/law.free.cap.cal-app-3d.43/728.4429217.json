Code]); on September 22, 1970, the proceedings were suspended and she was placed on probation for three years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 8, 1973, defendant was found to be in violation of probation and probation was revoked; on January 22, 1974, she was sentenced to the state prison. Defendant appeals from the judgment entered January 22, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Defendant did not appeal from order granting probation (\u00a7 1237, subd. 1, Pen. Code; <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>239 Cal.App.2d 75, 77 [48 Cal.Rptr. 443]) thus, inasmuch as the sole issue on this appeal concerns matters occurring prior to the order granting probation in 1970 she is estopped from claiming error with respect thereto; appellate review is restricted to the proceedings, in connection with revocation of probation and sentence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>243 Cal.App.2d 761, 763 [52 Cal.Rptr. 633]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>239 Cal.App.2d 75, 77 [48 Cal.Rptr. 443]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Glaser, </em>238 Cal.App.2d 819, 821 [48 Cal.Rptr. 427]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>169 Cal.App.2d 27, 32 [386 P.2d 540]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>68 Cal.2d 467, 470 [67 Cal.Rptr. 551, 439 P.2d 655].) Moreover, defendant has appealed from a judgment of conviction based on a plea of guilty. Examination of the record discloses neither the appropriate affidavit nor the requisite certificate of probable cause as required by section 1237.5, Penal Code. The validity of her guilty plea is the only appellate issue thus she was required to comply with the requirements of section 1237.5 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>66 Cal.2d 571, 575 [58 Cal.Rptr. 313, 426 P.2d 881]). However, because of the constitutional challenge involved, and in the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>of judicial economy, we treat this appeal as a petition for writ of habeas corpus and undertake the disposition of defendant\u2019s petition on the merits. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McMillan, </em>15 Cal.App.3d 576, 578 [93 Cal.Rptr. 296].)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The record on its face explicitly and directly establishes that appellant was advised of her constitutional rights to a trial by jury, of confrontation and against self-incrimination, the nature of the charges against her and the consequences of her guilty pleas, including the possible prison terms that could be imposed under the law. She concedes this and that she gave these up \u201cfreely and voluntarily,\u201d -but relying on <em>In re Tahl, 1 </em>Cal.3d 122 [81 Cal.Rptr. 577, 460 P.2d 449], contends that because the trial judge failed to (1) ascertain whether she was aware of \u201cthe possible legal defenses\u201d available to her, (2) ascertain whether she understood that if the cause was tried she would be entitled to the presumption of innocence and must be proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and (3) advise her that if she did not wish a jury trial she had a right to a court trial, her waiver was not knowingly and intelligently made and her guilty pleas were \u201cinsufficient.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In connection with her first contention she argues that before a defendant can understand the nature of the charge against him he must be aware of the elements necessary to constitute the crime, what must be proved by the People to obtain a conviction, the definition of legal terms used to describe the charge and \u201cwhat possible defenses . . . may exist\u201d\u2014in her case, she \u201cmay have\u201d been entrapped, \u201cmay have\u201d possessed a valid license permitting her to sell drugs, \u201cmay have\u201d made drug sales under apparent or real authority of a state or local agency or \u201cmay have\u201d made the sales under exigent circumstances as to negate specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">First, the record on its face demonstrates that before defendant entered her pleas of guilty, she was well aware of the exact nature of the charges against her and her defenses, if any; it contains direct evidence that she had discussed the case with her counsel and told him \u201call of the facts and circumstances known\u201d to her, and that he had sufficient time in which to discuss with her this case and \u201call of its ramifications\u201d and did discuss with her \u201cher rights, <em>her defenses, </em>and the possible consequences to her of a plea of guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Second, we do not subscribe to appellant\u2019s theory that before a defendant can understand the nature of the charge he must be aware of \u201cwhat possible defenses may exist.\u201d An understanding of the accusation is dependent upon the particular circumstances in each case. The matter of defenses goes more to the merits of the cause than to the nature of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Third, appellant has cited no authority for her argument that before a defendant can be aware of the nature of the charge in the context of <em>Tahl, </em>he must know the elements of the crime, what the People must prove to obtain a conviction, what possible defenses may exist and the definition of legal terms used in the accusation. However, it cannot be denied that the more an accused knows about the legal aspects of and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>the judicial procedures in his case the better he will be informed, not necessarily of the nature of the charge against him but of that which he faces if confronted with a trial of the cause. While this might be the ideal, practical considerations preclude the detailed examination and briefing on the subject urged by appellant the least of which are the inability of the average lay person charged with a crime to assimilate and fully understand such complex criminal law matters and articulate them upon examination by the court, and the necessary time involved in such inquiry and briefing whether it be done by defense counsel, the trial court or both. Thus, if a defendant must be that well informed before he can understand the nature of the charge the issue becomes one of the relative functions and responsibilities of the trial court and defense counsel in this connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238 [23 L.Ed.2d 274, 89 S.Ct. 1709] and its California progeny impose on the trial court the responsibility of canvassing the panoply of constitutional rights with the accused to make certain he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and its consequences, and leaving a record adequate for any review he may later seek. <em>(Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. at pp. 243-244 [23 L.Ed.2d at pp. 279-280]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rizer, </em>5 Cal.3d 35, 37 [95 Cal.Rptr. 23, 484 P.2d 1367]; <em>In re Tahl, </em>1 Cal.3d 122, 130 [81 Cal.Rptr. 577, 460 P.2d 449].) <em>Tahl </em>holds that \u201cthe record must contain <em>on its face </em>direct evidence that the accused was aware, or made aware, of his right to confrontation, to a jury trial, and against self-incrimination, as well as the nature of the charge and the consequences of his plea. Each must be enumerated and responses elicited from the person of the defendant.\u201d (P. 132.) It is sufficient if the district attorney enumerates the litany of rights and elicits the responses in open court. Actually most trial judges exercise the greatest caution and \u201cutmost solicitude\u201d in this connection, and at length and in great detail explain these rights to the accused and examine him concerning them as well as his understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of a plea of guilty, in order to satisfy themselves that in entering his plea he knowingly and intelligently and freely and voluntarily waives his constitutional rights. The holding in <em>Tahl </em>has been reiterated in numerous subsequent cases <em>(Mills v. Muncipal Court, </em>10 Cal.3d 288, 291 [110 Cal.Rptr. 329, 515 P.2d 273] [misdemeanor]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Levey, </em>8 Cal.3d 648, 653 [105 Cal.Rptr. 516, 504 P.2d 452] [submission of cause on transcript of preliminary hearing by stipulation under circumstances making it tantamount to plea of guilty]; <em>In re Sutherland, </em>6 Cal.3d 666, 670 [100 Cal.Rptr. 129, 493 P.2d 857] [guilty plea based on plea bargain]; <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number><em>Rizer, </em>5 Cal.3d 35, 37 [95 Cal.Rptr. 23, 484 P.2d 1367] [plea of not guilty by reason of insanity]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallegos, 4 </em>Cal.3d 242, 247-248 [93 Cal.Rptr. 229, 481 P.2d 237] [submission of the cause]; <em>In re Mosley, </em>1 Cal.3d 913, 926 [83 Cal.Rptr. 809, 464 P.2d 473] [submission of the cause]) and it is clear therefrom that while the record must show an enumeration of the rights involved and defendant\u2019s responses thereto, they \u201c[do] not require the recitation of a formula by rote or the spelling out of <em>every detail </em>by the trial court.\u201d (Italics ours.) <em>(in re Tahl, </em>1 Cal.3d 122, 132 [81 Cal.Rptr. 577, 460 P.2d 449].)  Thus in the case at bench, beyond the reading of the charge to defendant and inquiries concerning whether she knows the nature and the specifics thereof, what more must the trial court ascertain from or explain to her in light of the express showing that her counsel had \u201csufficient time to discuss this case and all of its ramifications\u201d with her and in fact did discuss with her \u201cher rights, her defenses, and the possible consequences to her of a plea of guilty,\u201d and the presumption that a defendant who appears in court with his counsel and who had the opportunity to and did confer with him and discuss the facts and circumstances of the case, was properly advised by him of the various rights waived by a guilty plea and that he took steps to protect these and other rights afforded by law, as long as the court is satisfied and the record shows that the accused is aware of the nature of the charge against her? <em>Boykin </em>and <em>Tahl </em>are generally aimed at fulfilling two purposes\u2014(1) \u201cinsuring that a defendant is aware of his constitutional rights and has voluntarily and knowingly waived them\u201d; and (2) \u201cinsuring that an adequate record of these facts is made so as to facilitate review on appeal or collateral attack.\u201d <em>(Mills </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>10 Cal.3d 288, 305 [110 Cal.Rptr. 329, 515 P.2d 273]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallegos, 4 </em>Cal.3d 242, 247 [93 Cal.Rptr. 229, 481 P.2d 237]; <em>In re Tahl, </em>1 Cal.3d 122, 134 [81 Cal.Rptr. 577, 460 P.2d 449].) In our view in the instant case both of these purposes have been accomplished in connection with the matter of defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature of the charges. <em>Tahl </em>says not \u201cevery detail\u201d need be spelled out by the trial court and we know of no authority that imposes upon the court under the circumstances here the added responsibility of inquiring into defendant\u2019s knowledge of the details of the charge such as the legal elements of the crime, what the prosecution must prove to obtain a conviction in a given case, what possible defenses may exist (which in most cases would be entirely outside of the court\u2019s knowledge or contemplation\u2014see <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>38 Cal.App.3d 484, 487 [113 Cal.Rptr. 272]) and the legal definition of the terms used, and if defendant is not aware of such details, to advise him thereof. If a defendant is to be that well informed of the legal aspects of his case it would seem to be the responsibility of defense counsel to so advise him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>inasmuch as only he is likely to know defendant\u2019s version of what occurred and what defenses, if any, are available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">This brings us to the responsibilities of defense counsel as an officer of the court and to his client. The practicalities of the situation and the fundamental right of a defendant to constitutionally adequate representation of counsel require his diligence and active participation in the full and effective preparation of his client\u2019s case. Aside from the exception in which other factors such as tactical decisions dictate a guilty plea, defendants plead guilty because, after discussing the case with their counsel, they believe they are guilty. In the normal exercise of his professional responsibilities in a criminal case, counsel thoroughly familiarizes himself with the accusation, studies the transcript of the testimony taken at the preliminary hearing, researches the law involved, discusses the case with his client and his witnesses, investigates all defenses of law and of fact and considering all of the circumstances of the case determines his client\u2019s best course bearing in mind a variety of factors such as the credibility of his client\u2019s version of what occurred, the availability of witnesses, the nature of the crime, trial strategy, public opinion, the alternatives available\u2014jury trial, court trial, submission of the cause and plea of guilty\u2014and the chances of acquittal or conviction. So inherent in the professional relationship between attorney and client are the foregoing that our courts have held that when a plea is entered with counsel, and it appears or can be inferred from the record that prior thereto defendant has consulted with him it is presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that counsel has informed him of the various rights which are waived by a plea of guilty <em>(In re Mosley, </em>1 Cal.3d 913, 926 [83 Cal.Rptr. 809, 464 P.2d 473]; <em>In re Tahl, </em>1 Cal.3d 122, 127-129 [81 Cal.Rptr. 577, 460 P.2d 499]), and has taken steps to assure their protection and to protect his other rights afforded by the law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rizer, </em>5 Cal.3d 35, 38 [95 Cal.Rptr. 23, 484 P.2d 1367].)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The same may be said of appellant\u2019s second contention\u2014that the trial court\u2019s failure to ascertain whether she understood that if she goes to trial she is entitled to the presumption of innocence and must be proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cconstitutes a failure to show an intelligent waiver of right to trial by court or jury.\u201d Factually the record on its face shows that defendant was advised that the prosecution had the burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>In the same manner we dispose of appellant\u2019s last contention that she was entitled to know that she had a right to a court trial, and the trial judge\u2019s failure to advise her of such right rendered her pleas \u201cunintelligent.\u201d In effect she suggests that in addition to a waiver of a jury trial, there should be what amounts to a waiver of a trial before the court. Such contention is founded only on her argument that she \u201cmay have\u201d feared a jury trial because the charge of possessing and selling restricted dangerous drugs involved acts condemned by society, and she was not advised of the \u201calternative\u201d\u2014a court trial. We know of no authority requiring the court to so advise, a defendant or to even examine him concerning his knowledge of such matter, but as a matter of common sense any defendant who pleads guilty to a crime knows he could have had instead of a jury trial a full trial before the court. Again we presume that her counsel told her of her alternatives and what she was entitled to by way of a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Defendant was examined in detail concerning her rights under <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 238 [23 L.Ed.2d 274, 89 S.Ct. 1709] and <em>In re Tahl, </em>1 Cal.3d 122 [81 Cal.Rptr. 577, 460 P.2d 449], and the trial judge exercised great care in insuring that defendant was aware of her constitutional rights and voluntarily and knowingly waived them, and that an adequate record of these facts was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The appeal is dismissed and the petition for writ of habeas corpus denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Wood, P.
