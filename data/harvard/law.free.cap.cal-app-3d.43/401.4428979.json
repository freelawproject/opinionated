(\u201cABC\u201d) appeal from a judgment of nonsuit denying recovery for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses claimed in their cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">The relevant facts disclose that plaintiff Marvin E. Becker (\u201cBecker\u201d) brought suit against respondent Walter Reade-Sterling, Inc. (\u201cReadeSterling\u201d), appellant ABC, John Jay Films, Inc. (\u201cJohn Jay\u201d) and others for alleged unauthorized use of certain film footage of the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley, California. Becker produced the film and, pursuant to a contract, supplied it to John Jay, a film library, which, in turn, supplied it to Reade-Sterling. ABC obtained the footage from ReadeSterling under a contract dated August 26, 1963. By Clause 4 of the agreement, Reade-Sterling represented that it had the right to supply the films to ABC for television use and agreed to indemnify ABC against all claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, arising from the broadcast, exhibition or other use of said films.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>suant to the agreement, ABC made use of parts of the film footage in a television series. As a consequence, Becker commenced suit claiming that none of the defendants had any television rights in the footage, because it had been supplied to John Jay solely for lecture tours personally conducted by John Jay.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In response to the Becker action, ABC cross-complained against ReadeSterling for indemnification against all sums for which ABC might be found liable to Becker and for costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, incurred in defending the case. At the trial appropriate evidence was taken to establish the amount of attorney\u2019s fees and costs, but the testimony also revealed that none of these fees or costs, totaling approximately $13,168 had yet been billed to or paid by ABC. Thereupon Reade-Sterling moved for a partial nonsuit limited to the claim for attorney\u2019s fees, contending that the statutory requirements of recovery as set forth in Civil Code, section 2778,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Initially, the trial court denied the motion. Subsequently, however, after indulging in further research, counsel for ABC concluded that the claim for attorney\u2019s fees and costs was premature and, most commendably, advised the trial court that its earlier ruling should be reversed. In this context the motion for nonsuit was granted and the court requested both parties to prepare proposed orders for the judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The rest of the case proceeded. The court granted a nonsuit to four of Becker\u2019s six causes of action. The court then submitted the case to the jury on the remaining questions of the primary liability of John Jay and ABC to Becker, and of the secondary liability of Reade-Sterling to ABC under the indemnity contract should ABC\u2019s primary liability toward Becker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>be established. The jury returned a verdict against Becker in favor of all defendants, and against ABC on its indemnity action.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">After the jury verdict was returned, both ABC and Reade-Sterling submitted their respective proposed orders for judgment of nonsuit on the cross-complaint with respect to the attorney\u2019s fees. The order proposed by ABC contained language that the judgment of nonsuit was not an adjudication on the merits, whereas the order proposed by Reade-Sterling did not contain such a provision. After a hearing the court adopted the version submitted by Reade-Sterling.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">On appeal ABC contends that in the situation here presented the trial court\u2019s failure to specify in the judgment that it was not an adjudication upon the merits constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and as a consequence the judgment cannot stand. Appellants\u2019 position is well taken and accordingly the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Preliminarily, we underscore that the judgment of nonsuit at hand cannot be interpreted in any other way than an adjudication on the merits. While prior to 1961 a judgment of nonsuit was not a bar to a subsequent action on the same cause of action (cf. <em>Mohn </em>v. <em>Tingley </em>(1923) 191 Cal. 470, 478 [217 P. 733]; <em>Bollinger </em>v. <em>National Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 399, 403 [154 P.2d 399]; <em>Ridley </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1944) 64 Cal.App.2d 503, 508 [149 P.2d 76]), the 1961 amendment to section 581c of the Code of Civil Procedure made it explicit that a judgment of nonsuit operates as an adjudication upon the merits, <em>unless the trial judge expressly provides </em>otherwise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">It is thus apparent that, under section 581c of the Code of Civil Procedure, the trial court is vested with discretion to make a nonsuit either an adjudication upon the merits or not <em>(Salomons </em>v. <em>Lumsden </em>(1949) 95 Cal.App.2d Supp. 924, 928-929 [213 P.2d 132]; see also <em>Safeway Stores </em>v. <em>Fannan </em>(9th Cir. 1962) 308 F.2d 94).  Since the judgment in the case at bench does not \u2018.\u2018otherwise specify\u201d it operates as an adjudication upon the merits. Accordingly, the cardinal issue confronting us is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>whether or not the trial court abused its discretion by giving res judicata effect to the judgment of nonsuit in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In determining this issue it is well to call to mind that respondent\u2019s motion for judgment of nonsuit was made on the basis that appellants failed to prove the actual payment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The judgment of nonsuit likewise recites that the proof of payment was a prerequisite to the recovery of the attorney\u2019s fees and expenses; that the evidence fell short of showing the payment of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses; that appellants could not recover such fees and expenses in the absence of proof of payment and finally that the nonsuit was granted solely upon the aforestated grounds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In short, the ruling of the court was founded on the premise that appellants\u2019 cause of action was prematurely brought because the payment of the attorney\u2019s fees and costs, a condition precedent to recovery under section 2778 of the Civil Code, had not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">However, the law is settled beyond controversy that when an action has been brought prematurely because a condition precedent necessary to the cause of action has not been complied with, the plaintiff is not precluded from maintaining an action after his claim has matured; and in such a case the doctrine of res judicata does not constitute a bar to his recovery <em>(Hardin </em>v. <em>Dickey </em>(1899) 123 Cal. 513 [56 P. 258]; <em>Nevills </em>v. <em>Shortridge </em>(1905) 146 Cal. 277 [79 P. 972]; see also: <em>National Ro-Tile Corporation </em>v. <em>Loomis </em>(1960) 82 Idaho 65 [350 P.2d 217]). Thus, it has been stated that where a judgment is rendered for the defendant on the ground of the nonexistence of some fact essential to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, the plaintiff is not precluded from maintaining an action after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>such fact has subsequently come into existence (Rest., Judgments, \u00a7 54). Consequently, a determination by the court that the plaintiff had no enforceable cause of action at the time when the action was brought is not a determination that he may not have an enforceable cause of action thereafter when his cause of action does become enforceable (Rest., Judgments, \u00a7 54, com. a; see also <em>Keidatz </em>v. <em>Albany </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 826, 828 [249 P.2d 264]).  It is likewise axiomatic that a judgment is a bar to a subsequent action only where an <em>identical issue </em>was decided in a prior case by a final judgment on the merits <em>(French </em>v. <em>Rishell </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 477, 479 [254 P.2d 26]).  The theory of estoppel by judgment or res judicata, however, <em>extends only to the facts in issue as they existed at the time the judgment was rendered </em>and does not prevent a reexamination of the same questions between the same parties where in the interim the facts have changed or new facts have occurred which may alter the legal rights of the parties. <em>When other facts </em>or conditions <em>intervene </em>before a second suit, furnishing a new basis for the claims and defenses of the respective parties, <em>the issues are no longer the same and the former judgment cannot be pleaded in bar of the second action (Hurd </em>v. <em>Albert </em>(1931) 214 Cal. 15, 26 [3 P.2d 545, 76 A.L.R. 1348]; <em>Hasselbach </em>v. <em>Dept. Alcoholic Bev. Control </em>(1959) 167 Cal.App.2d 662, 665 [334 P.2d 1058]; 29 Cal.Jur.2d, \u00a7 261, p. 230).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The foregoing legal principles as applied to the instant facts compel the conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion when, by its silence, it attached res judicata effect to the judgment of nonsuit in question. It has been repeatedly held that the discretion conferred upon the trial court is not a capricious or an arbitrary one, but rather an impartial discretion, guided by fixed legal principles. Moreover, it is not a mental discretion, to be exercised ex gratia, but a legal discretion to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve, not to impede or defeat, the ends of justice <em>(Bailey </em>v. <em>Taaffe </em>(1866) 29 Cal. 422, 424; <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Dalmo Mfg. Co. </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 523, 526 [190 P.2d 593]; <em>Boreta Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 85, 96 [84 Cal.Rptr. 113, 465 P.2d 1]). Where the trial court fails to exercise the discretion bestowed upon it in the aforestated fashion, and where, as in the instant case, it arrives at an erroneous legal conclusion, its order or judgment is subject to reversal <em>(Transit Ads, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tanner Motor Livery, Ltd. </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 275, 279 [75 Cal.Rptr. 848]).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Although the above discussion leaves no doubt that the trial court committed reversible error, respondent insists that the judgment below should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>be affirmed. In substance, respondent argues that the doctrines of prematurity or changed circumstances are applicable only in cases where the prematurity of obligation is the subject of a bona fide dispute and where the change of circumstances is outside the control of the party. In the instant case, continues respondent, the prematurity of appellants\u2019 cause of action was obvious and could have been cured by merely paying the attorney\u2019s fees, which was entirely within appellants\u2019 control. In the alternative, respondent contends that the appeal at hand should be dismissed on account of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Respondent\u2019s first contention is not borne out by the record or by applicable legal principles. The pleadings and the evidence appearing in the record clearly indicate that appellants entertained a bona fide mistaken idea with regard to the applicability of section 2778 of the Civil Code to their claim set out in their cross-complaint. The existence of a bona fide dispute is demonstrated by the fact that initially appellants resisted the motion for nonsuit and it was denied by the trial court and, furthermore, by the circumstance that appellants introduced evidence at the trial to prove the amount incurred for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Only after it was shown at the trial that these sums had not been paid by appellants, and after counsel for appellants did extensive research relative to the applicability of section 2778 of the Civil Code to the case at bench, did it become obvious and conceded by appellants that their claim was premature and therefore subject to a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Respondent\u2019s assertion, that the curing of the defect was within appellants\u2019 control and could have been easily cured by the simple payment of the attorney\u2019s fees, is also unfounded. In refutation of respondent\u2019s contention, the record reveals that the motion for nonsuit was made by respondent while the trial was in progress and before the issues were submitted to the jury. At that time appellants were in no position to predict with any degree of certainty the amount to be incurred for attorney\u2019s fees and costs during the entire trial or for post-trial and appellate procedures. An eventual demand to ascertain such fees and costs in the midst of the action would have placed appellants in the untenable posture of having to speculate on the future expenses or to forego a part of the recovery to which they were entitled under the indemnification clause of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In addition, respondent\u2019s argument is refuted by legal principles. The law controlling this case has been concisely summarized recently in Restatement Second (Tent. Draft No. 1, March 28, 1973) Judgments, section 48.1, subdivision (2), which provides: \u201cA valid and final personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>judgment for the defendant which rests on the prematurity of the action or on the plaintiff\u2019s failure to satisfy a precondition to suit, does not bar another action by the plaintiff instituted after the claim has matured, or the precondition has been satisfied, <em>unless a second action is precluded by operation of the substantive law or the circumstances are such that it would be manifestly unfair to subject the defendant to such an action.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Here, no provision of substantive law precludes another action for attorney\u2019s fees.  On the contrary, Civil Code, section 2778, subdivision 2, expressly sanctions another action after an actual payment has been made. Moreover, the institution of another action for recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, far from being manifestly unfair, would be entirely justified and in full accord with the contractual obligation which respondent voluntarily assumed for valuable consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Respondent\u2019s alternative claim that the appeal at bench is moot and therefore subject to dismissal is based upon the assertion that the jury verdict finding in respondent\u2019s favor on the cross-complaint was a conclusive determination that respondent had no obligation to indemnify appellants at all. This contention of respondent cannot be accepted for at least three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">First, regardless of the various theories of recovery set out in the Becker complaint against all defendants, in ultimate analysis the cause of action against appellants was stated on the ground that appellants used and televised the film footage purchased from respondent. This, of course, brought into play the indemnification clause of the contract because both the damages claimed by Becker and the necessity of defending the lawsuit and incurring attorney\u2019s fees in connection therewith arose \u201cout of the broadcast, exhibition or other use of said films.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Second, the record makes it crystal clear that the motion for nonsuit effectively removed the question of attorney\u2019s fees from the consideration of the jury,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the jury was instructed to that effect (see below). Thus, the issue of attorney\u2019s fees was not before the jury at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Third, the jury instruction<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by which we augment the record on appeal on our own motion (rule 12(a), Cal. Rules of Court) unequivocally shows that, in order to bring in a verdict for respondent on the cross-complaint, the jury had to make the dual finding that appellants were liable to Becker <em>and </em>the liability arose out of the use of the film footage sold by the contract to appellants. Consequently, the verdict for respondent cannot be considered conclusive as to respondent\u2019s indemnity liability in general, because such verdict might well have been rendered on the sole basis that the jury had found against Becker and in favor of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Respondent\u2019s additional arguments, based on an estoppel theory, and on the contention that appellants voluntarily dismissed or abandoned their case, are without merit and must be summarily rejected.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The judgment of nonsuit is modified by specifying th\u00e1t it shall not operate as an adjudication upon the merits. In all other respects\u2014and as so modified\u2014the judgment is affirmed. Appellants to recover costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Taylor, P.
