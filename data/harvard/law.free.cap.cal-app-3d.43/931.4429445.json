Plaintiff appeals from the order; defendant appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The judgment awarding plaintiff $50,000 compensatory damages was entered June 21, 1972. On June 22, 1972, plaintiff served on defendant by mail notice of entry of judgment, and on June 23, 1972, the clerk of the court served notice of entry of judgment on defendant. On July 10, 1972, defendant filed notice of intention to move for a new trial; thereafter plaintiff filed notice of motion to strike notice of intention to move for a new trial on the ground that it \u201cwas not timely filed and that such filing is jurisdictional.\u201d After a hearing the motion to strike was denied on the ground that \u201cplaintiff failed of strict compliance with the statutory requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was granted and the court filed its specification of reasons in support thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Viewing the record in light of applicable statutory and case law authority we conclude that defendant\u2019s notice of intention to move for a new trial was not timely filed and, this requirement being jurisdictional, the trial court acted outside of its jurisdiction and in excess of its power in granting the motion for new trial. The time in which the notice must be filed is governed by section 659, subdivision 2, Code of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under section 1013, Code of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> service of a document by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>mail is \u201ccomplete\u201d when it is deposited in the mail <em>(McKeon </em>v. <em>Sambrano, </em>200 Cal. 739, 741 [255 P. 178]; <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>174 Cal. 84, 87 [161 P. 1153]; <em>Caldwell v. Geldreich, </em>137 Cal.App.2d 78, 81 [289 P.2d 832]); and under section 1013a, subdivision (l),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> proof of service may be made by a declaration attached to the served document in the same manner as here made. We therefore compute the 15-day period afforded defendant in which to file his notice of intention to move for a new trial from the day of service of plaintiff\u2019s notice of entry of judgment, June 22, 1972, \u201cby excluding the first day, and including the last, unless the last day is a holiday, and then it is also excluded.\u201d (\u00a712, Code Civ. Proc.) Taking judicial notice of the calendar for June and July, 1972 (\u00a7\u00a7 452, subd. (h) and 459, subd. (a)(2), Evid. Code), we determine the 15th day from June 22, 1972, to be Friday, July 7, 1972 (not a holiday). Defendant\u2019s notice was filed on July 10, 1972. Thus, because compliance with the 15-day requirement of section 659 is jurisdictional defendant\u2019s notice was totally ineffectual; the trial court had no power to entertain or act on the motion, and its purported grant of the new trial was void. <em>(Neale </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>174 Cal. 49, 51-52 [161 P. 1165]; <em>Markaway </em>v. <em>Keesling, </em>211 Cal.App.2d 607, 610 [27 Cal.Rptr. 583]; <em>Radford </em>v. <em>Crown City Lumber &amp; Mill Co., </em>165 Cal.App.2d 18, 20 [331 P.2d 438]; <em>King </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>101 Cal.App.2d 242, 243 [225 P.2d 270], [notice one day late].)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Defendant claims plaintiff\u2019s notice of entry of judgment was \u201cdefective\u201d and therefore ineffectual to commence the running of the 15-day period because the declaration of \u201cproof of service by mail\u201d attached to the notice did not comply with the requirements of sections 1013 and 1013a. He refers to the language of section 1013 which provides that a document served by mail must be \u201caddressed to the person on whom it is to be served, at his office address as last given by him on any document which he has filed in the cause and served on the party making service by mail\u201d; and submits that every document he previously served on plaintiff bore defense counsel\u2019s suite number in a named building in addition to the street, city address and zip code, but that plaintiff\u2019s declaration of proof of service did not contain the room number and building name. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>refers to section 1013a, which requires the accompanying affidavit <em>or </em>declaration of proof of service by mail to show the \u201cplace of deposit in the mail,\u201d and argues that inasmuch as the declaration shows the place of its mailing as \u201cLos Angeles, California,\u201d this is inadequate because there is no indication of the specific mailbox in Los Angeles in which it was mailed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although we agree that \u201cstrict compliance\u201d with sections 1013 and 1013a is required, we decline to equate \u201cstrict compliance\u201d with absurdity in compliance. The rule of \u201cstrict compliance\u201d is satisfied by substantial, without literal, compliance (see 40 Words and Phrases, pp. 452-453, and authorities cited therein); and in light of the fact that the record shows that counsel for defendant admitted that his office received a copy of the notice of entry in the mail, we find defendant\u2019s entire argument in this respect to be hypertechnical. Moreover, the cases defendant cites fail to support his position. In <em>Forslund </em>v. <em>Forslund, </em>225 Cal.App.2d 476 [37 Cal.Rptr. 489], and <em>Marsden </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>23 Cal.App.2d 148 [72 P.2d 247], the court found there had been sufficient compliance with the \u201cmailing\u201d sections of the Code of Civil Procedure;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in <em>Carlon </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>10 Cal.App.2d 658 [52 P.2d 966], the purported proof of service by mail failed to show the street address of both the addresser and the addressee. <em>Marsden </em>distinguishes <em>Carlon </em>for this reason (23 Cal.App.2d p. 150).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">In light of the foregoing we deem it unnecessary to consider plaintiff\u2019s additional contention that the specification of reasons given in support of the order was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Inasmuch as our ruling above automatically reinstates the judgment we summarize the evidence for disposition of the issue of insufficiency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>evidence to support the judgment raised on defendant\u2019s appeal. Except for the precise language used by defendant in relation to the claim of slander, the evidence is undisputed. As to this we consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party and resolve all conflicts in favor of the respondent, and indulge all legitimate and reasonable inferences to uphold the verdict <em>(Cunningham </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>1 Cal.3d 301, 306 [81 Cal.Rptr. 855, 461 P.2d 39] [slander]).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Plaintiff is an independent television producer who has produced numerous programs in which he also has appeared as a commentator or performer. In 1964 he made a pilot film for a T.V. program to be called \u201cAmerica!\u201d wherein places of interest in the United States would be featured; and subsequently sold the show. For financing the production plaintiff arranged to borrow $418,000 from a bank, $100,000 of which had to be guaranteed by others. In this connection plaintiff, a member of the Riviera Country Club, approached defendant, also a member, and other individuals; 39 films were initially planned, and ultimately defendant and the others agreed with plaintiff that in return for 50 percent of the net profits of the show they would make the guarantee, and in addition would pay plaintiff for their percentage interest $20,000 at the commencement of the series and $15,000 after the 39 films had been completed. The production costs included $1,000 per show as salary to plaintiff for his role as producer and on-camera host. Ultimately 65 shows were produced and accordingly plaintiff drew a total of $65,000 in salary; with the $35,000 paid him by defendant and the others, he realized a total of $100,000. The show was not a financial success and defendant and the investors lost some of their investment. In addition, defendant and the others participated with plaintiff in the production of other format productions which too were unprofitable resulting in further monetary losses. These activities involved the formation of various participating corporate entities and covered the years 1964 through 1967. Sometime in January 1969, defendant stated to Fredericks, another investor, \u201cthat he discovered that Mr. Douglas had taken $100,000 from the \u2018America!\u2019 series and that he had records to prove it\u201d; on another occasion in January defendant stated to a group of four or five Riviera members, including a Mr. Goethals, during lunch at the club \u201cthat Mr. Jack Douglas had stolen $100,000 from one of his corporations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">In light of the substantial evidence in the record of defendant\u2019s statements to others and that these statements were untrue and nonprivileged, we find defendant\u2019s contention of insufficiency of the evidence to support the judgment to be untenable. Section 46, Civil Code, defines slander as \u201ca false and unprivileged publication, orally uttered . . . which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>1. Charges any person with crime. . . . 3. Tends directly to injure him in respect to his office, profession, trade or business ... by imputing something with reference to his office, profession, trade, or business that has a natural tendency to lessen its profits. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Fredericks, who testified to the aforementioned statement made to him by defendant, also testified that he had understood it to mean that plaintiff had taken <em>\u201canother $100,000,\u201d in addition </em>to the $100,000 in salary and investment funds, from the \u201cAmerica!\u201d series. Goethals, after testifying that defendant had stated to the luncheon group, \u201cMr. Jack Douglas had stolen $100,000 from one of his corporations,\u201d further testified in answer to the following questions: \u201cQ. Did you believe that he [defendant] was saying that it was something that Mr. Douglas was not entitled to? A. Yes. . . . That he had taken it. Q. And was not entitled to it. A. Yes. Q. Had not accounted for it? A. Yesi.\u201d The words spoken were understood by the hearer in a slanderous sense, and are actionable. In <em>Frolich </em>v. <em>McKiernan, </em>84 Cal. 177 [24 P. 114], the Supreme Court, affirming a judgment for slander, said at page 178: \u201c[T]he expression \u2018you want to swindle me out of my money,\u2019 . . . was so understood by the parties then and there present, as imputing to plaintiff an attempt to steal. . . .\u201d In <em>Moranville v. Aletto, </em>153 Cal.App.2d 667 [315 P.2d 91], defendant said to plaintiff within the hearing of others, \u201cYes . . . you stole my money.\u201d; the court said at page 672: \u201cTheft is a serious charge, definitely implying a high degree of moral turpitude. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Defendant testified that he had not stated to Goethals that plaintiff had \u201cstolen\u201d $100,000, only that he had \u201ctaken\u201d it, as he had said to Fredericks; and even as to Fredericks, and in his statement to Goethals, he had merely meant to indicate that plaintiff had legitimately received the initial $100,000 in salary and investment funds. However, this testimony was in direct conflict with that of Fredericks and Goethals as to what had been said and how they had construed the language. The jury was entitled to draw its own conclusion. Whether defendant\u2019s statements could reasonably be understood by Fredericks and Goethals to be defamatory was a question for jury determination. <em>(MacLeod </em>v. <em>Tribune Publishing Co., </em>52 Cal.2d 536, 546 [343 P.2d 36]; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Daily Review, Inc., </em>236 Cal.App.2d 405, 414 [46 Cal.Rptr. 135]; <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>191 Cal.App.2d 844, 853-854 [13 Cal.Rptr. 132].) Moreover, in <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Gray </em>(9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>1939) 101 F.2d 976, a slander action decided under California statutory and case law, the court in affirming a plaintiff\u2019s judgment stated: \u201cTo say that one has \u2018taken\u2019 money belonging to another and not accounted for it is to say that he has stolen that money.\u201d (P. 981.) It is true that <em>Carl </em>v. <em>McDougal, </em>43 Cal.App. 279 [184 P. 885], declares that \u201cThe word \u2018taken\u2019 does not imply the commission of a crime,\u201d (p. 282), but this isolated comment is pure dictum, the result of an obviously inartful attempt to distinguish another case cited by defendant\u2014the words actually used by the defendant in <em>Carl </em>having been \u201cHe forged a check on me,\u201d which were found to be actionable and a judgment for slander was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Defendant also contends that there is no substantial evidence to support the general damages verdict of $50,000. From the tenor of his comments we assume that he is urging that the damages awarded were excessive. This contention, too, is without merit. Plaintiff testified that as a result of defendant\u2019s statements he suffered \u201cmental\u201d upset and from lack of sleep, and from that time on has continued to have \u201ca feeling of general ill-being and just mental strain and emotionalism.\u201d He also testified: \u201cI felt very ashamed. I felt humiliated. I do to this day.\u201d \u201cThis being a case of slander which is libelous <em>per se </em>(charging the crime of theft), general damages are presumed as a matter of law. <em>(Clay </em>v. <em>Lagiss, </em>143 Cal.App.2d 441, at p. 448 [299 P.2d 1025].) [\u00b6] In addition, plaintiff is entitled to damages for injury to his feelings, including mental worry, distress, grief, and mortification.\u201d <em>(Moranville </em>v. <em>Aletto, </em>153 Cal.App.2d 667, 672 [315 P.2d 91].)  Moreover, \u201c[T]he determination of the jury on the issue of damages is conclusive on appeal unless the amount thereof is so grossly excessive that it can be reasonably imputed solely to passion or prejudice in the jury. <em>(Dunn </em>v. <em>Hearst, supra, </em>[139 Cal. 239 (73 P. 138)]; <em>Earl </em>v. <em>Times-Mirror Co. </em>(1921) 185 Cal. 165, 186-190 [196 P. 57]; <em>Hanley </em>v. <em>Lund </em>(1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 633, 644-645 [32 Cal.Rptr. 733]; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1925) 73 Cal.App. 189, 191 [288 P. 719]; . . .)\u201d <em>(Stoneking </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>254 Cal.App.2d 563, 579 [62 Cal.Rptr. 249].) In <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Geis, </em>251 Cal.App.2d 560 [59 Cal.Rptr. 569], a defamation case in which in 1967 (in comparison to the present value of the dollar) the jury awarded $55,000 to one plaintiff and $45,000 to another, the court stated at pages 572-573: \u201cHere, each plaintiff introduced substantial evidence of damage to her reputation, or humiliation, and of mental suffering, as well as the inability to obtain employment. Under the principles enunciated in the numerous cases discussing the subject of damages, we cannot say that either judgment is so excessive that it must be set aside.\u201d <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>1 Cal.3d 301 [81 Cal.Rptr. 855, 461 P.2d 39], wherein the Supreme Court affirmed liability for slander but found the award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>$25,000 excessive, is clearly distinguishable. Therein \u201cthe only actual damage related to the slander which was disclosed at trial\u201d was a $300 special damage loss (p. 309), and the court said: \u201cIt is true of course, that upon proof of actual damage in an action for slander (Civ. Code, \u00a7 46, subd. 5) the jury, in awarding general damages, may consider plaintiff\u2019s loss of reputation, shame, and hurt feelings (see Rest., Torts, \u00a7 621 and comment; <em>Di Giorgio Fruit Corp. </em>v. <em>American Federation etc. Organizations </em>(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 560, 576-578 [30 Cal.Rptr. 350]). The slander in the instant case, however, involves only a publication to a single individual who, at best, bore a rather remote relationship to plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Defendant cites as prejudicial error the trial court\u2019s refusal to give two requested instructions relating to plaintiff as a \u201cpublic figure.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However the United States Supreme Court cases cited as authority plainly involve not only \u201cpublic figures\u201d but defamations directed against them in relation to public issues and matters of public interest commented upon by defendant publications, for example, <em>Greenbelt Pub. Assn. </em>v. <em>Bresler, </em>398 U.S. 6 [26 L.Ed.2d 6, 90 S.Ct. 1537]. \u201cThere can be no question that the public debates at the sessions of the city council regarding Bresler\u2019s negotiations with the city were a subject of substantial concern to all who lived in the community. . . . The Greenbelt News Review was performing its wholly legitimate function as a community newspaper when it published full reports [containing an alleged libel] of these public debates in its. news columns.\u201d (P. 13.) Assuming arguendo that plaintiff as a lesser-known television personality might fit the description of a \u201cpublic figure,\u201d were he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>to have been defamed in a broadside publication to the general citizenry relating to his performance on television, the proffered instructions might have been applicable; however at bench the slanderous statements were strictly private and concerned only personal business transactions totally devoid of public concern. Instructions based on invalid theories are properly refused by the trial court. <em>(Roberts v. Del Monte Properties Co., </em>111 Cal.App.2d 69, 79 [243 P.2d 914].)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Defendant also claims that the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that plaintiff had not proved any special damages<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was error. The court fully instructed on the measure of damages applicable to the cause without alluding to special damages. Patently an instruction which would have advised the jurors in relation to a completely foreign form of damages with the admonition that plaintiff had failed to prove them would have been not only totally without relevance but confusing and prejudicial. Moreover defendant proffered his instruction orally; section 607a, Code of Civil Procedure requires that \u201cAll proposed instructions shall be typewritten.\u201d In addition its language is not contained in the record, therefore on appeal dedefendant cannot complain of the court\u2019s failure to give it. <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>14 Cal.App.2d 105, 112 [57 P.2d 1382].)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Other error cited by defendant is the giving of plaintiff\u2019s instruction re- \u25a0 lating to matters of \u201caggravated harm\u201d and \u201crepublication.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although he urges that the first paragraph \u201cis loaded in favor of plaintiff,\u201d it is a correct statement of the law (see <em>Stoneking </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>254 Cal.App.2d 563, 576 [62 Cal.Rptr. 249], citing <em>Mercado </em>v. <em>Hoefler, </em>190 Cal.App.2d 12, 19 [11 Cal.Rptr. 787]).  He argues that the second paragraph is \u201cclearly erroneous [because] there was no substantial evidence of republication.\u201d This contention is directly contrary to plaintiff\u2019s testimony that various members of the Riviera Country Club, who were not present at the time defendant made either of the slanderous statements, later initiated discussions about this subject matter with him (plaintiff). Even without this testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>mony it would not have been error to give the jurors the opportunity to decide whether defendant should have anticipated that his \u201cslanderous remarks . . . would reach the ears of persons other than those who heard the original utterance.\u201d (See <em>Stoneking, supra, </em>p. 577.)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Nor was it error to instruct that the amount of damages to be awarded was within the jury\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Defendant describes this instruction as \u201cperhaps the most prejudicial single instruction given by the court\u201d arguing that it informed the jury that it could award whatever amount of damages it desired omitting the requirements of evidence of actual damages and causal relationships between the wrongful conduct and injury sustained, and authorizes the jury to return a verdict of damages supported by insufficient or even nonexistent evidence. The instruction was proper and supported by express authority. \u201cIn defamation cases \u2018there is no accurate standard by which to compute the injury, and the jury must, necessarily, be left to the exercise of a wide discretion. . . .\u2019 <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Fitch </em>(1871) 41 Cal. 363, 385-386.)\u201d <em>(Stoneking, supra, </em>254 Cal.App.2d 563, 579.) Even if error had been committed it was not prejudicial in light of the many other given instructions which correctly informed the jurors on liability and damages: \u201cWhere the court\u2019s entire charge has fully and fairly instructed on all the basic issues involved, minor errors in a single instruction could not possibly have been prejudicial. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Perbost </em>v. <em>San Marino Hall-School, </em>88 Cal.App.2d 796, 801 [199 P.2d 701].)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">During cross-examination of plaintiff, defense counsel asked if he had written a certain letter to another member of the \u201cAmerica!\u201d enterprises, then sought to have a copy of the letter marked for identification. Before the court ruled, counsel commenced asking questions of plaintiff concerning the contents of the letter whereupon plaintiff objected on the ground of irrelevancy. The court permitted the document to be marked for identification; again plaintiff objected to \u201cany question with regard to the letter\u201d whereupon defense counsel stated: \u201cI am not seeking to introduce it in evidence.\u201d The court overruled plaintiff\u2019s objection then permitted defense counsel to ask plaintiff without restriction numerous questions relating to the contents of the letter. Subsequently defendant sought to have the document introduced into evidence, but the court sustained plaintiff\u2019s objection. Defendant contends this was prejudicial error because the letter contained an admission by, and evidence of matters unfavorable to, plaintiff and was supportive of his (defendant\u2019s) position. Plainly defendant could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>not have been prejudiced by the court\u2019s ruling because his counsel had already been given, and fully utilized the opportunity to ask plaintiff about the contents of the letter. The Supreme Court held in <em>Frazure </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>21 Cal.2d 851, 859 [136 P.2d 566], that four letters offered into evidence were properly refused by the court because prior evidence had established the subject matter of their contents, \u201cand the letters could have had no further value to appellant than to establish that fact.\u201d There was no error in excluding documentary evidence which was \u201cmerely cumulative.\u201d <em>(Kalmus </em>v. <em>Kalmus, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 405, 423 [230 P.2d 57].)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Defense counsel asked plaintiff: \u201cDid it come to your attention that the court had ruled against the first complaint [the cause proceeded on an amended complaint], what they call sustained a demurrer to it?\u201d and plaintiff answered, \u201cI heard of something.\u201d The court commented, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then said \u201cI think we ought to see what the ruling was if we are going into this,\u201d whereupon the court sustained the objection, and defense counsel questioned plaintiff on an entirely new subject matter. Defendant contends the court in sustaining the objection \u201cerred to [his] serious prejudice,\u201d but offers no explanation as to what error the court thereby committed; and frankly we fail to see any error much less prejudice to defendant particularly in the absence of any offer of proof made by defense counsel after the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The order granting the new trial is reversed; the judgment is affirmed.
