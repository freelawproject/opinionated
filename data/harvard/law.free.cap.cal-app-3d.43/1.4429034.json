(42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7301-1396g, inclusive.) The programs are funded by the states and matching federal grants, and by county participation on the order of about 16 percent (at least in Marin County) of the amount locally disbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The state\u2019s 58 counties, by statutory compulsion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are agents<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the state in the administration of the public assistance programs. By Welfare and Institutions Code section 10600 (hereafter all statutory references, unless noted otherwise, will be to that code), the Department is \u201cdesignated as the single state agency with full power to <em>supervise </em>every phase of the administration of the public social services.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 10615 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>emphasizes the Department\u2019s duty to exercise a proper degree of state control over \u201ccounty operations,\u201d even \u201ctight supervision\u201d if necessary, to the end that such county welfare administration shall be \u201ceconomic, efficient, and effective.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Eighteen of California\u2019s more heavily populated counties, which handle about 80 percent of the state\u2019s categorical aid caseload, operate their own welfare department merit systems. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19802.) In their administration of the state\u2019s welfare programs the remaining 40 counties (including Marin County) must employ persons recruited by the Department and placed on lists which are certified to the counties. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19800.) Uncontradicted evidence established that these persons would often \u201ccome in totally inexperienced in the welfare system at all and would be new hires off [\u00bf7c]\u2014in effect off the street except that they qualified by the examination.\u201d \u201cEligibility workers\u201d determine one\u2019s eligibility for public relief and the amount of such aid. The majority of such workers were \u201cnewly hired\u201d; in a recent fiscal year, of Marin County\u2019s 23 authorized \u201celigibility worker\u201d positions, 21 of those positions \u201cwere [filled with such] new appointments.\u201d Only \u201c[a] minority stay on,\u201d and there is \u201ca fairly high degree of turnover.\u201d And \u201cthe length of time to train them to be able to function on the job is a matter of three to four months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">County welfare aid is administered under federal and state laws and regulations. The director of the Marin County Department of Social Services, in uncontroverted testimony stated: \u201cWell, we have regulations on merit system rules and conditions for personnel and position classifications, have regulations on the training and development of staff, on the organization and structure of the department and relationships with some other departments, such as probation, the District Attorney. We have regulations governing the licensing of boarding homes for aged and boarding homes for children. There are regulations affecting or governing applications for aid, information and referral services and related record keeping, regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>tions on statistical reporting for Federal, State and local management needs, regulations on each categorical aid program and the MediCal program and food stamps, and in each of those areas the regulations go to eligibility conditions and standards, need standards, the application and treatment of income, grant amounts, forms, procedures and time limits, and there are regulations on complaints and fair hearings, and there are physical regulations and record keeping requirements, [\u00b6] These go to payment and repayment of aid, the funding source distributions, administrative expense and reimbursement. [\u00b6] I think that covers at least the major ones.\u201d The regulations, which \u201ccover a substantial number of volumes\u201d have \u201cgotten more complicated\u201d and are changed frequently. Those relating to \u201caid,\u201d and \u201celigibility [for aid],\u201d constitute \u201cprobably the major portion of the changes.\u201d And the various regulations \u201csometimes conflict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">We set out some of the demands upon county \u201celigibility workers\u201d by federal and state statutes and regulations. In determining eligibility for, and the amount of, public assistance they must act, not with deliberation, but \u201cpromptly\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 10000; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(10); Department\u2019s Welfare Regulation, 40-101-18), and \u201cpromptly to eligible individuals without any delay attributable to the agency\u2019s administrative process\u201d (45 C.F.R. [Code of Federal Regulations] \u00a7 206.10(a)(5)). They must be careful not \u201cto elicit any information [from the applicant] not necessary to carry -out the provisions of law applicable to the program\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 10500). And they are insistently admonished that the pertinent statutes are to be \u201cliberally construed\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 11000; Department\u2019s Welfare Regulation, 40-101.14; <em>Haberman </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>418 F.2d 664, 667 [7 A.L.R.Fed. 966]; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>309 F. Supp. 949, 956). Such a liberal construction under the Social Security Act has been held to mean: that \u201cany doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage\u201d <em>(Rasmussen </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>374 F.2d 589, 594); a construction \u201cin favor of allowing benefits to a claimant\u201d <em>(Brooks </em>v. Gardner, 276 F.Supp. 20, 23); a construction \u201cloosely in favor of claimants\u201d <em>(Millemon </em>v. <em>Secretary of Health, Ed. &amp; Welf, </em>256 F.Supp. 938, 940); and that the act should be liberally construed \u201cin favor of those seeking its benefits\u201d <em>(Allison </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, </em>238 F.Supp. 667, 673).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The complexity and ambiguity of federal, state and county welfare standards and regulations have received high judicial recognition. They were described in <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 399 [28 L.Ed.2d 842, 851, 91 S.Ct. 1420], as follows: \u201cThe system\u2019s administrative structure and procedures, with essential determinations numbering into the millions, are of a size and extent difficult to comprehend.\u201d And the Undersecretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which is charged with the federal share of the tripartite welfare administration, has described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the problem in this manner: \u201cMany, if not most, of the problems your investigation will uncover are the direct result of a failing system with overwhelming structural weaknesses that cannot be solved under existing law.\u201d (Hearings before the Subcommittee on fiscal policy of the Joint Economic Commission (part 1), 92d Congress, 2d Sess. 67, 1972.)</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">It is recognized, at least on the federal level, that errors in determining eligibility for public assistance and the proper amount of such assistance, are inevitable. A regulation of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare calls upon each state agency to submit: \u201cA schedule for reducing the level of payments to ineligible recipients and of overpayments for eligible recipients to achieve, as of the 6-month period beginning January 1, 1975, a 3-percent-tolerance level on incorrect eligibility decisions and a 5-percent-tolerance level on overpayments to eligible recipients. . . .\u201d (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.40(b)(4).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A Department of Health, Education and Welfare manual, published and distributed to the participating states pursuant to another of such regulations, provides that \u201cuntil the upper range of this <em>variation is </em>exceeded [i.e., 3 percent and 5 <em>percent] </em>corrective action is not a requirement.\u201d It further asserts that: \u201cLimits on rates of error are set at levels which are designed to protect the interests of the public and those served by the program, and at the same time take into account the inherent difficulties of keeping errors from arising in the complex process of administering the program.\u201d (See Quality Control in Public Assistance, U.S. Dept, of Health, Education and Welfare, Revised, June 1972 (SRS 72-21205, pp. IV 1, 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">We are brought more closely to the issues at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The Department started a practice of auditing a small proportion of Marin and Alameda Counties\u2019 welfare cases, and then projecting the percentage of error found to the whole of each county\u2019s caseload. The sole object of the audits was county administrative error in determining welfare applicants\u2019 eligibility for public assistance, and in determining the amount of such assistance. In Alameda County, for instance, an audit of 91 cases, randomly selected from a caseload of 285,000, disclosed three errors representing improper or excessive welfare payments of $269.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>state had of course already disbursed to the county, from its own and federal funds all, or nearly all, of that sum. The Department proposed to extrapolate the percentage of error found to the whole caseload, and thereby recover back from the county some $850,000. Similar auditing and recovery procedures were in effect, or planned, for all of the state\u2019s counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">The litigation which gave rise to the instant appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Following submission of the cause the trial court concluded from the substantially uncontested facts that: \u201cUnder applicable statutes [the Department\u2019s] right to adjust (cut) county claims for Federal and State reimbursement for public assistance expenditures by reason of administrative error, is limited to funds actually recovered by counties from a recipient, his estate or legally hable third parties.\u201d Judgment was entered so declaring and, among other things, enjoining the Department from continuing the intended procedure. It is that judgment from which the Department has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The criticial issue presented on the Department\u2019s appeal is whether,. as a matter of law, California's counties must indemnify the Department for the percentage of state and federal contributions to welfare payments erroneously made, because of incorrect eligibility decisions and overpayments to eligible recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">We first consider the pertinent federal statutes, and regulations of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare which have the force and effect of statutes. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Nothing is found, nor has anything been pointed out to us, in the Social Security Act or its related statutes or regulations, holding <em>counties alone </em>to be financially responsible for the errors which seem to be inherent in public welfare administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">We find the federal regulations relating to public welfare (45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 201-280.12, inclusive) to distinguish carefully between \u201cState and local [county] public assistance administration\u201d (e.g., 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.10). It is the \u201cstate administration\u201d which is responsible for the close supervision of the county agencies. The state is \u201crequired to carry out a continuing quality control program . . . covering determination of eligibility\u201d (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.10(b)), to keep the county agencies informed \u201cof the State policies, standards, procedures and instruction\u201d (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.120), and to fix standards for the employment, training and conduct of the county agencies\u2019 personnel (45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 205.200, 205.202). If responsibility must be fixed, a fair construction of the federal regulations must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>place at least a substantial part of blame for the administrative errors at issue upon the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">We advert now to the relevant statutes of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">As pointed out, section 10615 (see fn. 4, <em>ante) </em>requires the Department to determine the \u201cextent of state control needed over county [welfare] operations,\u201d and to exercise the necessary control, whether it be \u201cgeneral direction\u201d or <em>\u201ctight supervision.\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>(Italics added.) Neither this statute, nor any other that we have found, may reasonably be interpreted as fixing sole responsibility for the errors here in question, upon the state\u2019s several counties. Again, if such responsibility must be placed, even though the errors should exceed the federal \u201ctolerance levels,\u201d such errors committed under state supervision and often by state approved employees over whose selection the counties have limited control, must under the statute reasonably be considered principally, or at least equally, the responsibility of the state vis-a-vis its counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Regulations of the Department must of course be consistent with related statutes of the state, or they are invalid. (See \u00a7 10553, subd. (d); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>67 Cal.2d 733, 737 [63 Cal.Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697]; <em>Rosas </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>10 Cal.App.3d 77, 87-88 [88 Cal.Rptr. 907, 43 A.L.R. 3d 537].)</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">From the foregoing it appears that the superior court properly concluded that the applicable statutes (and federal regulations) give no support to the Department\u2019s purpose to hold the state\u2019s counties alone fiscally responsible for the administrative error here in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">We have further concluded that no principle of law or equity otherwise supports the Department\u2019s appeal. Any effort to reduce the incidence of error in welfare administration is of course commendable. But, as pointed out, it would be wholly unjust to hold the state\u2019s counties alone responsible for error committed under state supervision, by eligibility workers, who must \u201cliberally construe,\u201d and \u201cpromptly\u201d apply, complex federal and state welfare laws and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">The instant litigation seems to have its origin in a dispute between the participating states and the federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The latter agency continues to call upon the states to reduce the incidence of erroneous welfare payments; the last revision of its regulation, 45 Code of Federal Regulations section 205.40(b)(4), insists that \u201cPrior to July 1, 1975, the State[s] shall set forth a schedule for further reducing erroneous payments.\u201d On the other hand the states\u2019 position is illustrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>by a letter of the appellant Department\u2019s Director<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. It insists that the \u201cerroneous payments\u201d or some of them, are <em>\u201cgenerated by federal regulations\" </em>(italics added); it further complains: \u201cAlthough it was agreed that a joint federal-state task force should be established to review <em>federal regulations which contribute to errors, </em>we have not received further information on formulation of this group.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">The Department strenuously insists that it is not required to, and does not, supervise the county welfare departments in their \u201cday-to-day\u201d activities. This insistence does not comport with the command of section 10615 (see fn. 4, <em>ante) </em>that the Department exercise, where needed, a \u201ctight supervision\u201d over delinquent county welfare programs. Inherent in the Department\u2019s instant argument is the need for such \u201ctight supervision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Also relied upon heavily by the Department is section 15154 which provides: \u201cReports of amounts paid out for public assistance shall be presented by the respective counties at times and in the form prescribed by the department. Such reports shall be audited by the department and the State Controller, and, when and in the amount approved, shall be allowed to the county as a credit to apply against advances made under the terms of Section 15153.\u201d It is argued that the payments here in question, having been \u201cdisapproved\u201d by the Department, were not allowable to the counties \u201cas a credit.\u201d But such disapproval may not be arbitrary; it must be in accordance with law. Here, as we have noted, the counties may not lawfully be held solely responsible by the Department for the errors at issue. And it seems proper to point out that there are other reasons than such errors for auditing the county agencies\u2019 reports as, for instance, bookkeeping or arithmetical errors, and assurance that amounts claimed paid to welfare recipients have actually been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The Department also urges that the counties, as <em>agents </em>of the state, must perform their duties \u201cwith diligence and due care\u201d and failing to do so, are liable to their principal, the Department, for any loss caused thereby. But here it may not be said that the errors, universally found in public assistance administration, were necessarily caused by the counties\u2019 lack of \u201cdiligence and due care.\u201d As likely, they were the responsibility of the Department, or even as sometimes contended by that agency the federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare, or perhaps both.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The record furnished us lends no support whatever to the Department\u2019s argument that: \u201cThe [judgment] appealed from requires the state to bear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the financial burdens of <em>all </em>errors, regardless which entity (federal, state or county) was \u2018to blame\u2019 as a matter of fact.\u201d Indeed, the counties themselves suffer the loss of their fiscal contribution (16 percent by Marin County) toward erroneous welfare payments. And we observe no demand (certainly none is pointed out) that the state account to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare for the portion of federal matching funds consumed by the improperly allowed categorical aid. Instead the federal agency has seemed content, without reimbursement, to accept the \u201c3-percent\u201d and \u201c5-percent\u201d tolerance levels we havepreviouslymentioned. Moreover, within those limits the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, as previously pointed out, disclaims any need for \u201ccorrective action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">In the past the Department, finding errors as are in issue here, would charge the county for losses resulting from them. It is pointed out that no county complaint was ever made until the Department commenced extrapolating the percentage of error found, to the counties\u2019 entire welfare caseloads. But the earlier practice, as we have indicated, must have been consistent with statutory authority, to have been valid. We have concluded that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">We have not, in this opinion, said that that responsibility and fiscal accounting for improper welfare payments may not on some reasonable basis be apportioned between the three concerned governmental agencies, federal, state and county. Instead, we have simply concluded that under pertinent statutes and regulations, and well-known principles of equity, California\u2019s counties are not obliged to bear the whole burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">For the reasons stated the judgment and order of the superior court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">It has become unnecessary to the disposition of the Department\u2019s appeal to resolve the additional question whether \u201cthe state\u2019s plan for the projection of the results of a random sampling audit\u201d was legally proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">This opinion relates solely to the validity of the state\u2019s audit practice at the time judgment was entered in this case in May of 1972. We express no opinion on the method by which the cut in federal grants that may result from the operation of the federal \u201ctolerance level\u201d regulations should be distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">The \u201cJudgment Granting Declaratory Relief and Permanent Injunction,\u201d as modified August 4, 1972, and the order denying defendants\u2019 \u201cMotion to vacate judgment/injunctive order\u201d are, and each is, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">Molinari, P. J., and Sims, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 9, 1974, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-7\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 10800 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">\u201c[T]he administration of public social services in each of the several counties of the state is hereby declared to be a county function and responsibility and therefore rests upon the boards of supervisors in the respective counties pursuant to the applicable laws, and in the case of public social services for which federal or state funds are provided, subject to the regulations of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">\u201cFor the purpose of providing for and carrying out this function and responsibility, the board of supervisors of each county, or other agency as may be otherwise provided by county charter, shall establish a county department, unless otherwise provided by the county charter.
