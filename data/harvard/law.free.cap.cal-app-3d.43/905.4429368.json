LaBorne (LaBorne), plaintiff and appellant. Findings of fact and conclusions of law were signed. The judgment was entered on November 21, 1972. On December 6, 1972, Isabel Rublee Mulvany (Mulvany), defendant and respondent, filed her motion for a new trial. On January 19, 1973, after hearings, the court vacated the judgment and granted a new trial. This is an appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">The action was for personal injuries and property damage sustained by LaBorne resulting from a collision between the vehicle that she was driving and a vehicle allegedly owned by Mulvany, but being driven by one Reed, who allegedly was acting as an employee and/or agent of Mulvany at the time of the accident. After oral testimony of witnesses and documentary evidence, the trial court rendered judgment for LaBorne against the driver Reed and against Mulvany in the sum of $26,550, together with costs. One of the findings of fact was: \u201cDuring all the times mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s complaint, defendant Grant Robert Reed was driving and operating the motor vehicle ... as the employee and/or agent of the defendant Isabel Rubles Mulvany, . . . and the defendant Reed was further during all the times mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s complaint acting within the scope of said employment and/or agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">On November 21, 1972, the clerk mailed the \u201cNotice of Entry of Judgment\u201d to counsel for all parties of record. On December 6, 1972, Mulvany caused to be served and filed her \u201cNotice of Intention to Move for a New Trial,\u201d upon two grounds: (1) excessive damages; and (2) insufficiency of the evidence to justify the judgment. Argument on this motion was heard on January 9, 1973, and the court took it under submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">A statement by the court, entitled \u201cDecision Rendered on Submitted Matter,\u201d was entered in the permanent minutes of the court. The court order was dated January 19, 1973; however, on a subsequent copy appear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>ing in the clerk\u2019s transcript, the order was marked with an entry stamp bearing the date of January 23, 1973. The order states:</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">\u201cThis matter having heretofore been submitted on January 9, 1973, the Court now makes it\u2019s [sic] order as follows: The motion for new trial is granted on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding of an agency relationship. The Judgment heretofore made and entered is vacated and set aside as to the Defendant Isabel Rublee Mulvaney [sic] only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Appellant first contends that respondent\u2019s notice of intention to move for a new trial did not comply with the time limitations for filing such motions as delineated in section 659 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Notice of entry of judgment was mailed to the parties on November 21, 1972, and on December 6, 1972, respondent filed a \u201cNotice of Intention to Move for New Trial.\u201d Appellant\u2019s contention centers on the construction to be given the phrase \u201cwithin 15 days of . . .\u2019\u2019in section 659, and the method of computation to be utilized as a result of that language to arrive at the final date on which a notice of motion for new trial could be filed. Appellant states that the amendment of section 659 in 1965 to change the words surrounding the time requirement from \u201cwithin . . . after\u201d to \u201cwithin . . . of\u201d evinces a legislative intent that the count of 15 days commences with the counting of the date of mailing. The result of this interpretation would be that the fifteenth and final day for filing a motion for new trial would have been December 5; and, due to respondent\u2019s failure to file the motion until December 6, the trial court would have lost jurisdiction to order a new trial, and any subsequent order made on the motion therefore would have been void. <em>(Markaway </em>v. <em>Keesling, </em>211 Cal.App.2d 607, 610 [27 Cal.Rptr. 583]; <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>147 Cal.App.2d 76, 77 [304 P.2d 719].)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument, however, overlooks the application of Code of Civil Procedure section 12 to the procedure mandated by section 659. Section 12 provides the general rule for computing the time within which an act must be done and states: \u201cThe time in which any act provided by law is to be done is computed by excluding the first day, and including the last, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>unless the last day is a holiday, and then it is also excluded.\u201d As section 12 is the general rule for such computation and as \u201c[t]he gravest considerations of public order and security require that the method of computing time be definite and certain\u201d <em>(Ley </em>v. <em>Dominguez, </em>212 Cal. 587, 594 [299 P. 713]), any legislative intent to create an exception to the general rule and to provide for a different method of computation must be <em>\u201cclearly expressed.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) <em>(Ley </em>v. <em>Dominguez, supra, </em>at p. 595; <em>Union Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Domengeaux, </em>30 Cal.App.2d 266, 272-273 [86 P.2d 127].) Appellant asserts that such an intent is present where the Legislature changed the preposition used following the time requirement from \u201cafter\u201d to \u201cof.\u201d However, this slight change in the language of the statute does not appear sufficient to be that \u201cclear\u201d expression of intent required by <em>Ley </em>and <em>Union Oil Co., supra, </em>to create an exception to the general rule and thus to provide an alternative method of computation which is \u201cdefinite and certain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Further, in light of the decision reached in <em>Tuck </em>v. <em>Tuck, </em>245 Cal.App.2d 260 [53 Cal.Rptr. 872], it definitely can be seen that more than a shift in prepositions is needed to take section 659 beyond the limits of section 12. In <em>Tuck, </em>the court held that section 12 did apply to the time limitations placed on the filing of a notice of intention to move for a new trial. Although the case dealt with facts arising in 1964 and the court necessarily applied a version of section 659 which did not include the 1965 amendment, it is also the rule that \u201c[t]he Legislature is assumed to be aware of existing judicial decisions affecting the subject matter of proposed legislation. <em>(Kusior </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>54 Cal.2d 603, 618 [7 Cal.Rptr. 129, 354 P.2d 657].)\u201d <em>(Alhambra Cons. Mines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alhambra Shumway Mines, Inc., </em>239 Cal.App.2d 590, 596 [49 Cal.Rptr. 38].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For example, the legislature, being aware of the judicial application of Code of Civil Procedure section 1013<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to section 659 <em>(Tuck </em>v. <em>Tuck, supra), </em>specifically prohibited the use of the extension of time provisions of section 1013 with respect to the time for filing a motion for new trial by amending section 659 to that effect in 1967. (Stats. 1967, ch. 169, \u00a7 1, p. 1266.) Similarly where case law has specifically approved of the computation of the limitation period of section 659 in accordance with the provisions of section 12 <em>(Tuck </em>v. <em>Tuck, supra, </em>at p. 262), and where the Legislature has not excepted section 659 from the operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>section 12 or has not \u201cclearly\u201d expressed a different method of computation, the method to be adopted is that set forth in section 12.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By adopting this general rule of computation, that is, exclusion of the first day and inclusion of the last, December 6, the day on which respondent filed her notice of intention to move for a new trial, marked the 15th day from the date notice of entry of judgment was mailed. As a result, respondent\u2019s motion was timely and the trial court retained jurisdiction to render a decision on that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that the trial court failed to comply with section 660 of the Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by not determining the motion within 60 days from and after notice of entry of judgment. Appellant contends that the 60-day period in which the judge had to decide the case, commenced on November 21, 1972, the date notice of judgment was mailed, and expired on January 20, 1973, a Saturday; and as section 660 is subject to section 12a of the Code of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the time for determination of the motion was necessarily extended to Monday, January 22, 1973. Appellant further asserts that the controlling date of determination of the motion for new trial was the date stamped on the order by the deputy clerk, January 23, 1973, one day after the required period, and not the date which the order itself bears: January 19, 1973. If this were the case, the judge would then have had no jurisdiction to grant the order and, as a result, the motion would be denied by operation of law and that result could not be \u201cavoided by the entry of a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order purporting to grant the new trial after the court ha[d] lost jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(Siegal </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>68 Cal.2d 97, 101 [65 Cal.Rptr. 311, 436 P.2d 311]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 660.)</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>This interpretation, however, cannot survive in light of the judicial rules of construction of section 660\u2019s requirement that the order be entered in the \u201cpermanent minutes\u201d which were developed subsequent to the decision in <em>Siegal. </em>In the present case, the order bearing the date of January 19, 1973, was prepared, dated, and stamped with the notation \u201cEntered Book Page SW No APR 1873 159315\u201d; and subsequently was stamped by the deputy clerk with the additional date of \u201cJanuary 23, 1973.\u201d The facts lend themselves to the analysis initiated by <em>Desherow </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>1 Cal.App.3d 733 [82 Cal.Rptr. 138]. The court in <em>Desherow </em>stated at page 739 that the basic issue before that court, in a case which involved a factual situation similar to that in the present case, was to determine \u201cwhat constitutes entry of an order in the permanent minutes of the court\u201d to satisfy section 660. Where the order is not alternatively signed by the judge and filed with the clerk (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 660), the court in <em>Desherow </em>found at pages 740-741: \u201cIt may be seen that entry of an order in the permanent minutes of the court does not refer to any single act of recordation but rather describes the process followed in making minute orders part of the permanent records of the court. . . . Functionally, it is apparent that <em>stamping a date of entry on a given minute order is a purely mechanical step </em>in the processing of the order for photo-recordation.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">\u201cWhen we analyze the process of entry of an order in the permanent minutes, we find three elements which appear essential: (1) preparation of a written minute order; (2) recordation of the date and substance of the order in a permanent record; (3) delivery of the order to the custodian of records. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">\u201cBut certain additional steps take place in the mechanical recordation of an order, including the filing of the order in a temporary minute binder, its <em>stamping with a date of entry stamp, </em>and its recordation on microfilm.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">As to these additional steps, the court applied the \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d test to determine whether they were so critical to the process of entering an order in the permanent minutes that without them there would be no effective entry. If the movants have taken all steps possible to insure the timely entry of a judge\u2019s order and if they were powerless to prevent tardiness attributable solely to a public employee, then there has been substantial compliance. In <em>Desherow, </em>the court specifically held at page 745 that as courts are inclined to construe filing requirements liberally and to give statutes reasonable interpretations, where the \u201csole procedural error arose from the failure of a deputy clerk to stamp an order for a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>with the clerk\u2019s entry stamp on the day he was instructed to do so by the judge [w]e do not think such a slip nullifies the timely entry of the order in the permanent minutes of the court when the essentials of such entry have otherwise been complied with.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">It should further be noted that the <em>Desherow </em>decision does not represent an isolated case. The doctrine of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d was also adopted in <em>Meskell </em>v. <em>Culver City Unified School Dist., </em>12 Cal.App.3d 815 [96 Cal.Rptr. 773]. The appellate court, dealing with a memo in the \u201crough minutes\u201d of the clerk dated April 8, 1969, and an order made by the trial court on April 9, 1969 (within the time limits of section 660), but subsequently stamped \u201cEntered April 11, 1969,\u201d stated: \u201cWe are of the opinion that under the holding in <em>Desherow </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>1 Cal.App.3d 733, . . . the foregoing record is sufficient to show that the motion for a new trial was determined on April 9, 1969, when the necessary procedure for the entry of the courtroom minutes onto the permanent minutes <em>had been properly set in motion.\u201d (Meskell </em>v. <em>Culver City Unified School Dist., supra, </em>at p. 819, fn. 1.) (Italics added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Although in the present case the court is unaware of any personal commands given by the trial court to the deputy clerk, where the trial judge\u2019s order was (1) timely reduced to writing (Jan. 19, 1973); (2) timely recorded in a permanent record; and (3) as evidenced by the notation of entry in a specified book at a definite page, timely delivered to the custodian of records, the essentials for processing an order into the permanent minutes of the court are present and the subsequent stamping of an entry date by the deputy clerk is an additional step not required for the order to substantially comply with the requirements of section 660. As a result, the trial judge\u2019s order in the present case was timely where it was entered in the \u201cpermanent minutes\u201d on January 19, 1973, 59 days after the mailing of notice of entry of judgment, and was effective in granting the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Appellant contends that the order granting a new trial is void because the trial court inadequately specified the reasons behind its decision when it stated: \u201cThe motion for new trial is granted on the grounds of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding of an agency relationship.\u201d The procedural steps prescribed by section 657 of the Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> for determining a motion for new trial are mandatory and must be strictly followed. <em>(Mercer v. Perez, </em>68 Cal.2d 104, 118 [65 Cal.Rptr. 315, 436 P.2d 315].)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">The two leading cases which outline what is a sufficient specification of reasons where the trial court has granted a motion for new trial are <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>and <em>Scala </em>v. <em>Jerry Witt &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>3 Cal.3d 359 [90 Cal.Rptr. 592, 475 P.2d 864]. In the <em>Mercer </em>decision, the California Supreme Court first stated the two basic purposes for the requirement of a specification of reasons in section 657: to promote judicial deliberation before judicial action and to make the right of appeal from the order more meaningful. Particularly as to the latter, the court found that the statutory requirement of a specification of reasons is intended to correct the necessity on appeal of searching the record for one piece of evidence to support the ground on which the motion is based. The court construed section 657 to require that: \u201c[T]he judge who grants a new trial furnishes a concise but clear statement of the reasons why he finds one or more of the grounds of the motion to be applicable to the case before him. No hard and fast rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>can be laid down as to the content of such a specification, and it will necessarily vary according to the facts and circumstances of each case. For example, ... we hold that if the ground relied upon is <em>\u2018insufficiency of the evidence\u2019 </em>the judge must briefly recite the respects in which he finds the evidence to be legally inadequate; no other construction is consonant with the conclusive presumption on appeal that the order was made \u2018only for the reasons specified.\u2019 . . . <em>[S]uch an order must briefly identify the portion of the record which convinces the judge \u2018that the court or jury clearly should have reached a different verdict or decision.\u2019 \u201d (Mercer </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>68 Cal.2d 104, 115-116 [65 Cal.Rptr. 315, 436 P.2d 315].) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">In <em>Scala, </em>the California Supreme Court was again confronted with the necessity of further clarifying section 657 as a result of appellate court decisions subsequent to <em>Mercer </em>which allowed a mere restatement of fact to suffice as a specification of reasons. The trial court\u2019s order in the <em>Scala </em>case stated that \u201c \u2018there is no sufficient evidence to show that the defendant was negligent and the evidence does show that the plaintiff failed to use ordinary care for his own safety and that that failure was a proximate cause of his injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Scala </em>v. <em>Jerry Witt &amp; Sons, Inc., supra, 3 </em>Cal.3d 359, 363.) In determining whether this statement gave a sufficient specification of reasons, the court in <em>Scala </em>chose to adopt the approach of the appellate court decisions in <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>City etc. of San Francisco, </em>264 Cal.App.2d 310 [70 Cal.Rptr. 782], and <em>Van Zee </em>v. <em>Bayview Hardware Store, </em>268 Cal.App.2d 351 [74 Cal.Rptr. 21], which found that a specification of reasons phrased in terms of \u201cultimate fact\u201d is not adequate to comply with section 657. In doing so, the <em>Scala </em>court found at page 366 that a recitation that \u201c \u2018defendant was not negligent\u2019 or the \u2018plaintiff was negligent\u2019 is of little, if any, assistance to the appellant or to the reviewing court [as] [n]egligence, whether of the defendant or of the plaintiff, is a complex issue requiring for its resolution the determination of the existence or non-existence of a variety of different elements.\u201d As a result, the court found that the trial court\u2019s statement was merely one of \u201cultimate fact\u201d which was not adequate enough to enable the court to \u201cidentify the respects in which the trial court found plaintiff\u2019s evidence to be insufficient.\u201d <em>(McLaughlin </em>v. <em>City etc. of San Francisco, supra, </em>264 Cal.App.2d 310, 316.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>The decision in <em>Scala </em>also reaffirmed the test utilized in <em>Mercer </em>for determining whether the reasons specified in an order granting a motion for new trial were sufficient and stated, \u201cthe judge would do well to apply the yardstick used in <em>McLaughlin, Van Zee, </em>and the case now before us, i.e., by considering whether his proposed specification of reasons will fairly serve the legislative purposes elucidated in <em>Mercer.\u201d (Scala </em>v. <em>Jerry Witt &amp; Sons, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 370.) The court in <em>Scala </em>also criticized a statement of reasons which is nothing more than a reiteration of the ground itself. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 367.) Appellate court decisions since <em>Scala </em>and <em>Mercer </em>have followed the guidelines prescribed by those cases and have approved orders granting motions for new trial where the trial court has identified specific portions of the record in support of its decision or has enumerated reasons based on the testimony of specified witnesses, the evidence, or the record before it,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and have disapproved those orders which do not contain any such reference within the specification of reasons.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The statement in the instant order that the reason for granting the respondent\u2019s motion for new trial on the ground of insufficiency of evidence was that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a finding of an agency relationship is similar to those orders criticized and found lacking in <em>Mercer </em>and <em>Scala. </em>This reason for granting the motion is merely a statement of ultimate fact as it fails to specify any portion of the record which would uphold the court\u2019s conclusion to grant a new trial, and is only a reiteration of the ground on which the order is based. The issue of whether one is an agent is as complex as a finding of negligence in that the trial court must point to that evidence in the record which specifically failed to establish such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">As the requirement of specification of reasons is mandatory <em>(Mercer </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>at p. 120), and as such a specification does not appear on the order nor in a statement made within 10 days after the motion was granted, the trial court has lost its power to specify such reasons, and it is unable to revive its lapsed jurisdiction. To prevent this result, respondent\u2019s remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>was to apply for a writ of mandate ordering the judge to specify his reasons for granting the motion within the 10-day period. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 122-123.) As respondent failed to pursue her remedy, the order granting the new trial must be reversed. Consequently, the judgment will be automatically reinstated, and since we are presented with no cross-appeal by respondent Mulvany from such a judgment, its finality upon reinstatement will automatically follow. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Flood Control Dist., supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 689, 699.)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">In her brief, respondent suggests that a motion for new trial could have been sustained on the ground that the decision was \u201cagainst law\u201d; however, even though that ground is contained in the same subsection as the ground of insufficiency of the evidence, it is a distinct ground of motion, and as it was not set forth in the notice of intention to move for a new trial, it cannot now be urged. <em>(Malkasian </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>61 Cal.2d 738, 745 [40 Cal.Rptr. 78, 394 P.2d 822].) As the only other ground set forth by the respondent in her notice of intention to move for a new trial was excessive damages, and as the trial court based its order granting the motion on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence, respondent is foreclosed from showing that the trial court could have granted the motion on the ground that the verdict was \u201cagainst law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Respondent further asserts that the instant order is not to be read as granting a new trial pursuant to section 657 of the Code of Civil Procedure, but rather is to be read as granting the alternative relief of modification of judgment on a motion for a new trial which is provided for by section 662 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such a modification is permissible where the cause is tried without a jury, and neither a statement of grounds nor one of reasons is required in support of the modification.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">As respondent demonstrates, the appellate courts have held that where a trial court has granted a new trial, but amended its findings, and where an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>intent to act pursuant to section 662 is evidenced in an examination of the order as a whole, the order is in substance one denying the new trial and granting the alternative relief, regardless of form. <em>(Estate of Busteed, </em>105 Cal.App.2d 14, 18 [232 P.2d 881]; <em>Roraback </em>v. <em>Roraback, </em>38 Cal.App.2d 592, 596 [101 P.2d 772]; <em>Bureau of Welfare, etc. </em>v. <em>Drapeau, </em>21 Cal.App. 2d 138, 150 [68 P.2d 998].) However, to determine whether the rules established by these cases are applicable to the present action, the cases which respondent cites and those which have held to the above proposition must be examined to determine whether the factual basis for those cases is similar to that of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">In <em>Bureau of Welfare, etc. </em>v. <em>Drapeau, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.2d 138, the court was confronted with an order which read: \u201c \u2018Motion of defendant for new trial submitted on October 15, 1935, is now <em>granted in part and findings and judgment order amended </em>(see memorandum of opinion on file).\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 140; italics added.) The attached memorandum indicated that it was error to enter judgment for the plaintiffs and concluded that \u201c \u2018the findings and judgment herein will be <em>changed and amended </em>accordingly to conform to the views herein expressed and against the trust fund theory, [\u00b6] Upon other points and as to other findings the <em>motion is denied </em>and the judgment will remain.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id.; </em>italics added.) Subsequent to this order, the amended judgment was entered. The appellate court in <em>Drapeau, </em>in liberally construing section 662, concluded that: \u201cWhile that trial court used the expression \u2018granted in part\u2019 in the order and the expression \u2018granted as to that point\u2019 in the memorandum, <em>these expressions were followed immediately by the order for the change and amendment of the findings and judgment to conform to its corrected views </em>with respect to the legal effect of the applications and agreements. It is therefore clear that the trial court merely intended to grant the alternative relief under said section 662 in ruling upon the motion for new trial. We are therefore of the opinion that regardless of form of the trial court\u2019s order, it constituted in substance and effect an order denying the motion for new trial and granting such alternative relief.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 150.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">In a subsequent case, <em>Estate of Busteed, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.2d 14, the court similarly found that as evidenced by the minute order granting the motion for new trial, the trial court did not intend to have any further trial, but rather desired only to amend its findings and enter a decree accordingly. The order read in full: \u201c \u2018Motion for a new trial is granted upon the ground of insufficiency of evidence to sustain that portion of Finding VIII and Conclusion of Law thereon, declaring that . . . [appellants] are first cousins of decedent, and in so far as Findings VIII and the Conclusion of Law and Judgment thereon are concerned, the same are <em>modified and changed </em>so as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>to provide that decedent left her surviving as her sole heirs at law the following named first cousins: . . . and that, otherwise, said motion for a new trial is <em>denied. </em>Counsel to prepare modified Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Judgment in accordance herewith.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>atp. 16.) (Italics added.) The court in <em>Busteed </em>found support for its decision from both the <em>Drapeau </em>case and <em>Estate of Perkins, </em>21 Cal.2d 561 [134 P.2d 231], the latter case also dealing with an order which granted the motion for new trial in part, but specifically \u201cmodified and changed\u201d one portion of its previous judgment. <em>(Estate of Perkins, supra, </em>at pp. 567-568.) More recent cases have also found that after an examination of the particular order before the court, read as a whole, it was apparent that the trial court was acting pursuant to section 662 rather than section 657. These cases, however, involved orders that either first denied the motion for new trial and reopened the case as to specified findings <em>(Western Electroplating Co. </em>v. <em>Henness, 112 </em>Cal.App.2d 278 [341 P.2d 718]);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or specifically called for a modification of the findings. <em>(Medak </em>v. <em>Cox, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.3d 70;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Howard A. Deason &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Costa Tierra Ltd., </em>2 Cal.App.3d 742 [83 Cal.Rptr. 105]<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>); or specifically designated that the trial court was acting pursuant to section 662 of the Code of Civil Procedure in making its order. <em>(Avery </em>v. <em>Associated Seed Growers, Inc., </em>211 Cal.App.2d 613, 619 [27 Cal.Rptr. 625].)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">In each instance, there was language by the trial court expressing the intention to deny the motion for a new trial, at least in part; to reopen the hearings for further proceedings; to order and make new findings and conclusions, a new and different judgment, and even the entry of a new and different judgment; or a combination thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">In the present action no such action was taken by the trial court. The order states: \u201cThe motion for new trial is granted on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding of an agency relationship. The Judgment heretofore made and entered is vacated and set aside as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>the Defendant Isabel Rublee Mulvaney [sic] only.\u201d No reference was made to a new judgment; to a denial of a motion for a new trial, either in whole or in part; or to new findings and/or a new judgment. No substantive modification of the trial court\u2019s original decision was made; no separate judgment was later entered; and there was a complete omission of any instructions to prepare new findings to counsel from either side. Nor was a memorandum of costs filed or other remedies pursued to which respondent would be entitled if a judgment had been entered in her favor. It cannot be said that under these circumstances the order was meant to be a modification of the trial court\u2019s former judgment, pursuant to section 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The order granting a new trial is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Kaus, P.
