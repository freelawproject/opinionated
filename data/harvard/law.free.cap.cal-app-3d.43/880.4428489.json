J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AuS\">This is an appeal from a judgment sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Plaintiffs (Douglas William Johnson and other members of his family, Helen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Richard, Clement, and Dorance)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed suit on December 29, 1972, against defendants (Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, Inc. (publishers) and William F. Smith and Raymond Liedlich (authors of the textbook), alleging that defendants had invaded their right of privacy by republication of an article from The Nation magazine in a college English textbook published in 1965. The authors have not appeared in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">We are faced with two issues: (1) whether plaintiffs\u2019 complaint states a cause of action; and if so (2) whether the cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">There is no dispute as to the underlying facts involved in this case. On March 10, 1961, plaintiff Douglas William Johnson, a Negro janitor, found a sack containing $240,000 in cash lying on a street in Los Angeles. He reported his discovery to the authorities and was given a $10,000 reward for his action by Brink\u2019s, Incorporated, which had lost the money in transit. Several magazine articles recounted the experiences of the Johnson family after the incident. One such article, entitled \u201cUnexpected Rewards,\u201d was published in the June 1963 issue of The Nation magazine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1965, defendants reprinted this article with the author\u2019s permission as a part of a teaching exercise in a college English textbook entitled \u201cFrom Thought to Theme,\u201d subtitled: \u201cA Rhetoric and Reader for College English.\u201d Plaintiffs first learned of the republication of the article on April 17, 1972, when an acquaintance of William Johnson\u2019s whose son had used the English textbook in college, showed the republication<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>\n<em>The Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">For its first cause of action, plaintiffs alleged in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">\u201c7. The publication of said textbook article was deliberately concealed from plaintiffs by defendants who neither sought nor obtained plaintiffs\u2019 consent jointly or severally, to use plaintiffs\u2019 individual names, identities, experiences and stories in defendants\u2019 college English textbook.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>\u201c8. Plaintiffs discovered defendants\u2019 unauthorized use of their names, identities, experiences and stories in said textbook article on April 17, 1972 . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-4\">\u201c9. As a direct consequence of plaintiffs\u2019 discovery of defendants\u2019 unauthorized publication, for commercial purposes, of plaintiffs\u2019 names, identities, experiences and stories, each of the plaintiffs has been embarrassed, humiliated, and exposed to public ridicule, and each has suffered mental distress, and the individual privacy of each plaintiff has been unwarrantedly invaded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">\u201c11. Defendants, and each of them, did the things herein alleged maliciously, and oppressively, and each plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover exemplary damages. . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>For its second cause of action, plaintiffs alleged in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">\u201c13. With full knowledge of plaintiffs\u2019 rights to control the use and publication of their individual names, identities, experiences and stories, and in wilful and deliberate disregard thereof, and without the authority or consent of plaintiffs, or any of them, said defendants infringed upon plaintiffs\u2019 right and used plaintiffs\u2019 individual names, identities, experiences and stories in defendants\u2019 college English textbook and deliberately concealed such use and publication from plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">\u201c14. Reasonable compensation for the use and publication of each of plaintiffs\u2019 individual names, identities, experiences and stories, as aforesaid, is Ten Thousand Dollars ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The prayer of the complaint seeks compensatory and exemplary damages in specified amounts for each cause of action and against each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in sustaining defendants\u2019 demurrer without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">We proceed to examine plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for its legal sufficiency according to the well-settled principle that if upon consideration of all the facts alleged in the complaint it appears that the plaintiffs are entitled to any relief at the hands of the court, the complaint must be upheld. (Gruen<em>berg </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., 9 </em>Cal.3d 566, 572 [108 Cal.Rptr. 480, 510 P.2d 1032].) As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Barquis </em>v. <em>Merchants Collection Assn., </em>7 Cal.3d 94, 103 [101 Cal.Rptr. 745, 496 P.2d 817], \u201cwe are not limited to plaintiffs\u2019 theory of recovery in testing the sufficiency of their complaint against a demurrer, but instead must determine if the <em>factual </em>allegations of the complaint are adequate to state a cause of action under any legal theory. The courts of this state have, of course, long since departed from holding a plaintiff strictly to the \u2018form of action\u2019 he has pleaded and instead have adopted the more flexible approach of examining the facts alleged to determine if a demurrer should be sustained. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">\n<em>First Cause of Action:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action is based on the emerging tort of invasion of privacy. However, it is not clear from the face of the complaint under which category of invasion of privacy plaintiffs\u2019 claims are based. The concept of a legal right to privacy was first generated by Warren and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Brand\u00e9is in their landmark law review article entitled <em>The Right to Privacy </em>published in 1890.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Dean William Prosser in his treatise on torts, this right of privacy is composed of four distinct forms of tortious invasion: (1) unreasonable intrusion upon the plaintiff\u2019s seclusion or solitude, or into his private affairs (see, e.g., <em>Dietemann </em>v. <em>Time, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1971) 449 F.2d 245);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) publicity which places the plaintiff in false light in the public eye (see, e.g., <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Association, Inc., 4 </em>Cal.3d 529 [93 Cal.Rptr. 866, 483 P.2d 34, 57 A.L.R.3d l]);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (3) public disclosure of true, embarrassing private facts about the plaintiff (see, e.g., <em>Briscoe, supra); </em>(4) appropriation of plaintiff\u2019s name or likeness for commercial purposes (see, e.g., <em>Fairfield </em>v. <em>American Photocopy etc. Co., </em>138 Cal.App.2d 82 [291 P.2d 194]). (Prosser, Law of Torts, \u00a7 117, pp. 804-814; Prosser, <em>Privacy, </em>48 CaLL.Rev. 383; Rest. 2d Torts, \u00a7 652A (Tent. Draft No. 13, 1967).) Plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action appears to be based on the last three categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">a. <em>Public Disclosure of Private Facts:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">In <em>Briscoe </em>(1971), the leading case in this category, the Supreme Court overruled the sustaining of a demurrer and held that a person previously convicted of a crime had stated a cause of action for invasion of privacy where he alleged that the defendant\u2019s publication had unnecessarily identified him by name in an article which defendant published in 1968 entitled \u201cThe Big Business of Hijacking,\u201d which detailed various incidents of truck hijackings throughout the country. As an example of the \u201ctypical\u201d hijackings, <em>one </em>sentence in the article described an unsuccessful hijacking attempt and specifically identified the plaintiff, Marvin Briscoe, as one of the hijackers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There was no indication that the attempted hijacking occurred in 1956, approximately 12 years before the complained-of publication. Plaintiff contended that\u2014conceding the truth of the facts published in the article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>and that the subject matter of the article may have been newsworthy\u2014the public disclosure of his name in conjunction with his prior criminal activity violated his right to privacy. The court upheld plaintiff\u2019s contention, stating that although Reader\u2019s Digest had the constitutional right to report the facts of plaintiff\u2019s criminal act, it did not have the concomitant right to use plaintiff\u2019s name in connection with the article. The court reasoned as follows (at pp. 537-539): \u201c. . . [Identification of the <em>actor </em>in reports of long past crimes usually serves little independent public purpose. . . . Unless the individual has reattracted the public eye to himself in some independent fashion, the only public \u2018interest\u2019 that would usually be served is that of curiosity.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">\u201cThere may be times, of course, when an event involving private citizens may be so unique as to capture the imagination of all. . . . [P]urely <em>private individuals may by an accident of history lose their privacy regarding that incident for all time. </em>There need be no \u2018reattraction\u2019 of the public eye because the public interest never wavered. . . . [I]n each case it is for the trier of fact to determine whether the individual\u2019s infamy is such that he has never left the public arena; we cannot do so as a matter of law. [Italics added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">\u201cAnother factor militating in favor of protecting the individual\u2019s privacy here is the state\u2019s interest in the integrity of the rehabilitative process. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">\u201cOne of the premises of the rehabilitative process is that the rehabilitated offender can rejoin the great bulk of the community from which he has been ostracized for his anti-social acts. In return for becoming a \u2018new-man,\u2019 he is allowed to melt into the shadows of obscurity.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>In an earlier California case, <em>Melvin </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>112 Cal.App. 285, [297 P. 91], the court used almost identical reasoning as that expressed in <em>Briscoe </em>in also finding that the plaintiff had stated a cause of action for invasion of privacy. <em>Melvin </em>involved a motion picture entitled \u201cThe Red Kimono,\u201d which depicted the life of a woman who had been a prostitute and had been tried for murder and acquitted seven years earlier. The movie enacted the true story of the murder trial of plaintiff and used plaintiff\u2019s maiden name. As a result, plaintiff alleged that the film ruined her new life by revealing her past to the world; that she had given up her life as a prostitute, became rehabilitated, married, and led an exemplary life in society among friends and associates who were unaware of these incidents in her past. The court held that the use of the incidents from her life was not actionable because they appeared in public records, but that the use of her <em>name </em>in the movie was an invasion of her right of privacy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Another leading case (decided by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals) reached a different result from <em>Briscoe </em>and <em>Reid. </em>In <em>Sidis </em>v. <em>F-R Pub. Corporation </em>(2d Cir. 1940) 113 F.2d 806 [138 A.L.R. 15], the court held that a complaint alleging the publication of a biographical article in the New Yorker magazine without plaintiff\u2019s consent did not state a cause of action for invasion of privacy. There, the plaintiff had been a child prodigy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>who had lectured to eminent mathematicians at age 11 and had graduated from Harvard at age 16. Since his graduation he had sought to live as unobtrusively as possible. He effectively disappeared from public view and led an obscure life as a bookkeeper, occupying himself in collecting street-car transfers and studying the lore of Okamakammessett Indians. In its magazine, as one of a series of articles under the title \u201cWhere Are They Now?,\u201d defendant published a biographical sketch of the past and present life of plaintiff which contained a \u201cmerciless\u201d description of the intimate details of his personal life and activities. Although the court described the article as \u201ca ruthless exposure of a once public character who had once sought and now has been deprived of the seclusion of a private life,\u201d it reasoned that the plaintiff had remained a matter of public concern and was still newsworthy some 27 years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In all three cases, <em>Briscoe, Reid, </em>and <em>Sidis, </em>the plaintiffs made every effort to live in seclusion and avoid publicity. However, <em>Briscoe </em>and <em>Reid </em>can be distinguished from <em>Sidis </em>on the basis that they involved rehabilitated criminals, whereas <em>Sidis </em>dealt with a child genius who merely loathed public attention.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Prior to <em>Briscoe, </em>there were several decisions which held that once a person became a matter of public interest, he could not revert to a private status merely by lapse of time. <em>(Carlisle </em>v. <em>Fawcett Publications, Inc., </em>201 Cal.App.2d 733, 746 [20 Cal.Rptr. 405]; <em>Werner </em>v. <em>Times-Mirror Co., </em>193 Cal.App.2d 111, 118 [14 Cal.Rptr. 208]; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>National Broadcasting Co., </em>138 Cal.App.2d 807, 814 [292 P.2d 600]; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Marx, </em>94 Cal.App.2d 704, 705 [211 P.2d 320]; see also Prosser, Law of Torts, \u00a7 118, p. 826.) In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>National Broadcasting Co., </em>the court stated: \u201cIt is a characteristic of every era . . . that events which have caught the popular imagination or incidents which have aroused the public interest, have been frequently revivified long after their occurrence in the literature, journalism, or other media of communication of a later day. These events, being embedded in the communal history, are proper material for such recounting. It is well established, therefore, that the mere passage of time does not preclude the publication of such incidents from the life of one formerly in the public eye which are already public property.\u201d However, the <em>Briscoe </em>court held that although a public personage loses his right to privacy for a certain period of time, \u201c[i]t would be a crass legal fiction to assert that a matter once public never becomes private again. Human forgetfulness over time puts today\u2019s \u2018hot\u2019 news in tomorrow\u2019s dusty archives. In a nation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>200 million people there is ample opportunity for all but the most infamous to begin a new life.\u201d (Fn. omitted; <em>id., </em>at pp. 539-540.) Thus it appears that the court modified these earlier decisions as far as the lapse of time issue is concerned when the individual\u2019s name is used in connection with the event. The fact that a plaintiff may have been a public personage at one time may no longer be a viable defense to this type of invasion of privacy suit. Where the plaintiff is a past criminal and his name is used in a publication, the mere lapse of time may provide a basis for an invasion of privacy suit. The length of time between the commission of the crime and its subsequent redisclosure becomes a factor in the statement of a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">In the present case, we are not involved with either a reformed criminal, or a person who tried to avoid public scrutiny. We are dealing with a person who injected himself into the vortex of publicity by returning nearly a quarter of a million dollars. Although the family name was mentioned in the reprint, the textbook is still protected by the First Amendment because it satisfies both elements delineated by the court in <em>Briscoe: </em>\u201c[A] truthful publication is constitutionally protected if (1) it is newsworthy and (2) it does not reveal facts so offensive as to shock the community\u2019s notions of decency\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 541); and (3) it is not published with reckless disregard for its offensiveness. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 543.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The criteria for determining whether an article is newsworthy was enunciated in <em>Kapellas </em>v. <em>Kofman, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 20, 36 as follows: \u201cIn determining whether a particular incident is \u2018newsworthy\u2019 and thus whether the privilege shields its truthful publication from liability, the courts consider a variety of factors, including [1] the social value of the facts published, [2] the depth of the article\u2019s intrusion into ostensibly private affairs, and [3] the extent to which the party voluntarily acceded to a position of public notoriety.\u201d In the instant case, plaintiffs have failed to allege facts showing an infringement upon any part of their private lives. (See <em>Briscoe, supra, </em>at pp. 535-536, fn. 7; <em>Estill </em>v. <em>Hearst Publishing Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1951) 186 F.2d 1017.) The crux of this form of the tort is the unwarranted publication of intimate details of one\u2019s private life which are outside the realm of legitimate public interest. <em>(Coverstone </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>38 Cal.2d 315, 322-323 [239 P.2d 876]; Prosser, <em>Privacy, </em>48 Cal.L.Rev. 383, 394.) Here, we are not involved with a <em>Briscoe </em>or <em>Reid </em>type of case where Johnson had been prosecuted for stealing the money. To the contrary, he returned $240,000 which he found in the middle of a city street. Indeed, his action was not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>highly praised, but Johnson was given a $10,000 reward and received a letter of commendation from President Kennedy for his \u201cunflinching honesty.\u201d  A person may, by his own activities or by the force of circumstances, become a public personage and thereby relinquish a part of his right of privacy to the extent that the public has a legitimate interest in his activities. <em>(Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., supra, </em>418 U.S. 323, 351 [41 L.Ed.2d 789, 812].) A necessary corollary is that people closely related to \u2022public figures also lose their right of privacy to some extent. <em>(Carlisle </em>v. <em>Fawcett Publications, Inc., supra, </em>201 Cal.App.2d 733, 747.)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Moreover, we are convinced that the article does not reveal facts \u201cso offensive as to shock the community\u2019s notions of decency.\u201d <em>(Briscoe, supra, </em>at p. 541.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It describes Johnson\u2019s act as \u201ca strictly honest deed that should have made him the most admired of men,\u201d and states that he had acted \u201caccording to the dictates of pure and simple honesty.\u201d A reasonable person certainly would not find the article highly offensive. In a similar situation, the district court in <em>Samuel </em>v. <em>Curtis Pub. Co. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1954) 122 F.Supp 327, applying California law, held that a magazine publisher was not liable for republishing a photograph taken of the plaintiff attempting to dissuade a woman hanging on a bridge from committing suicide. The photograph had first appeared in a newspaper on April 22, 1952, and was republished in the February 6, 1954, issue of the Saturday Evening Post in connection with an article on suicides. The court pointed out that the photograph was merely illustrative of various types of suicides and that nothing in the article referred specifically to the photograph. The court observed (at pp. 328-329): \u201cAn invasion of the right of privacy occurs not with the mere publication of a photograph, but occurs when a photograph is published where the publisher should have known that its publication would offend the sensibilities of a normal person, and whether there has been such an offensive invasion of privacy is to some extent a question of law, . . . Gill v. Hearst Pub. Co., 1953, 40 Cal.2d 224, 253 P.2d 441. Where the photograph portrays nothing to shock the ordinary sense of decency or propriety, where there is nothing uncomplimentary or discreditable in the photograph itself, and where the caption and article add nothing that makes the photograph uncomplimentary or discreditable no actionable invasion of the right of privacy occurs, Gill v. Hearst Pub. Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>\u201c. . . . [Plaintiff] is not presented in a derogatory pose, nor is there anything to represent that his conduct is in any way reprehensible. Indeed, it was most laudatory. The Court finds that no reasonable person could find anything in the appearance or conduct of [plaintiff] which would cause the publisher of the picture to have reason to believe that the picture would offend the sensibilities of a normal person.\u201d Here, we are confronted with a fact pattern which exemplifies honesty. In <em>Samuel, </em>compassion and citizen participation to prevent disaster were the purport of the subject matter. In either instance, the subject matter continued on over the years as one of public attention, and continued in its newsworthiness. Johnson\u2019s name became an indispensable part of the total theme of honesty. Just as the fable is an educational tool, so likewise is a true life example of integrity one which justifies repetitive recounting. This was the text\u2019s purpose, as well as others more directly related to the literary field, such as style and clarity, development of topic matter, and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">In the instant case, two of the questions following the article asked the students, \u201cWhy would anyone consider Johnson a fool for returning [the money]?\u201d \u201cDo you?\u201d We must examine these questions in the context in which they were asked. We do not believe that these questions were asked with the intent of demeaning Johnson. They were only intended as a classroom tool to encourage discussion of the alternatives of persons faced with what could well constitute temptation away from honesty. We recognize, however, that the questions might be tortuously interpreted by persons to imply criticism of Johnson, suggesting that he was a fool, \u201cso that [their] publication might be objectionable as going \u2018beyond the limits of decency\u2019 and reasonably indicate defendants\u2019 conduct to be such that they \u2018should have realized [they] would be [highly] offensive to persons of ordinary sensibilities.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Gill </em>v. <em>Hearst Publishing Co., supra, </em>at pp. 230-231.) Were we to conclude that this is a rational construction, which we do not, there would then be presented a cause of action for tortious invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">b. <em>False Light in the Public Eye:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">As previously noted, in <em>Kapellas </em>v. <em>Kofman, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 20 (and reiterated in <em>Briscoe, supra, </em>at p. 543), the Supreme Court held that a false light action is in substance equivalent to a defamation suit. A plaintiff alleging false light, therefore, must also satisfy the requirements of malice <em>(Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill, supra, </em>385 U.S. 374; <em>St. Amant </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>390 U.S. 727, at p. 731 [20 L.Ed.2d 262, at p. 267, 88 S.Ct. 1323]) and demand for retraction within 20 days of notice of the publication. (Civ. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>\u00a7 48a.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Plaintiffs here alleged malice, but did not comply with Civil Code section 48a. Although <em>Briscoe </em>extended the coverage of section 48a to encompass magazines, under the conclusion we here reach we do not determine whether the retraction requirement extends to the publication of books. No cause of action for false light in the public eye could here be alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">c. <em>Appropriation of Name or Likeness for Commercial Purposes:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">This category of invasion of privacy was codified in California in 1971. Civil Code section 3344, subdivision (a), provides as follows; \u201c(a) Any person who knowingly uses another\u2019s name, photograph, or likeness, in any manner, for purposes of advertising products, merchandise, goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>or services, or for purposes of solicitation of purchases of products . . . without such person\u2019s prior consent . . . shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person . . . injured as a result thereof.\u201d We are convinced that the article was not so \u201cdirectly\u201d connected with the sale of the textbook that it falls within the purview of section 3344, subdivision (a). The article must be viewed in the context in which it was republished. It was only used as an educational tool in an English textbook. It is obvious that the article was not a primary reason for the textbook; nor was it a substantial factor in the students\u2019 purchases of the book. (See <em>Klein </em>v. <em>McGrawHill, Inc. </em>(D.D.C. 1966) 263 F.Supp. 919; <em>Corabi </em>v. <em>Curtis Publishing Co. </em>(1971) 441 Pa. 432 [273 A.2d 899]; <em>Dallesandro </em>v. <em>Henry Holt &amp; Co. </em>(1957) 4 App.Div.2d 470 [166 N.Y.S.2d 805]; <em>Kline </em>v. <em>Robert M. McBride &amp; Co. </em>(1939) 170 Misc. 974 [11 N.Y.S.2d 674].) This fact pattern is clearly distinguishable from the other California cases which have granted recovery for appropriation. (See <em>Stilson </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Assn., Inc., </em>28 Cal.App.3d 270 [104 Cal.Rptr. 581]; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Weisser, </em>273 Cal.App.2d 726 [78 Cal.Rptr. 542, 38 A.L.R.3d 761]; <em>Fairfield </em>v. <em>American Photocopy etc. Co., supra, </em>138 Cal.App.2d 82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Plaintiffs also assert that even if they failed to state a cause of action for invasion of privacy the demurrer must be overruled because they have stated a cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 3523, which provides: \u201cFor every wrong there is a remedy.\u201d This is an illusory contention. Section 3523 does not create a separate basis of recovery, absent a showing of fact otherwise sufficient to constitute a legal wrong. (2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed.) \u00a7 5, p. 882.) A cause of action in tort is based on a violation of a legally protected right. The facts alleged in the first cause of action simply do not show that defendants have inflicted any legally cognizable wrong on plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">d. <em>Statute of Limitations:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Even assuming that plaintiffs had stated a cause of action for tortious invasion of privacy, their cause of action would be barred by the statute of limitations. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in this action was not filed until December 29, 1972, more than seven years after the publication of the textbook.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The applicable statute of limitations for tortious invasion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>privacy is found in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision 3, which sets forth a one-year period during which the action may be filed. <em>(Belli </em>v. <em>Roberts Brothers Furs, </em>240 Cal.App.2d 284 [49 Cal.Rptr. 625].) Plaintiffs, however, assert that the statute should be tolled and begin to run on the date they first were told of the publication, because defendants fraudulently concealed the publication from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">It is the general rule that the statute of limitations will begin to run regardless of whether a plaintiff is aware that he has a cause of action (2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed.) \u00a7 264, p. 1117.) However, there are exceptions to this rule which provide that the statute will be tolled and begin to run from the time the aggrieved party discovers the underlying facts giving rise to the cause of action. One of these exceptions is found in Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision 4, which provides relief on the ground of fraud or mistake. Another exception which is based primarily on equitable considerations provides relief when the facts giving rise to the cause of action are fraudulently concealed from the aggrieved party. <em>(Pashley </em>v. <em>Pacific Elec. Ry. Co., </em>25 Cal.2d 226 [153 P.2d 325]; 2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed.) \u00a7 401, p. 1235.) It is this latter exception upon which plaintiff relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Plaintiffs have not alleged that defendants made any affirmative statement or did any act to prevent plaintiffs from learning of the existence of the English textbook. Rather, plaintiffs argue that the failure of defendants to notify them of the publication constitutes constructive fraud (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1573).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">It is well established that mere nondisclosure of the existence of a cause of action does not constitute fraudulent concealment in the absence of a fiduciary or confidential relationship. <em>(Hesse </em>v. <em>Vinatieri, </em>145 Cal.App.2d 448, 451 [302 P.2d 699]; see Annot. 45 A.L.R.3d 630.) in the present case, it is clear that no such relationship existed; nor were defendants under a duty to inform plaintiffs that they were republishing the magazine article. To hold otherwise would impose too great a burden on a defendant and chill the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment. The textbook was used in college English courses (apparently, throughout the country), and the mere fact that plaintiffs were unaware of its publication does not provide the necessary ingredient for fraudulent concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>\n<em>Second Cause of Action:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Plaintiffs assert that this cause of action sounds in tort and is based on a violation of a statutory obligation owed to them by defendants pursuant to Civil Code sections 1708 and 1714.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We do not agree for the same reasons hereinbefore set forth relating to plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action based on an alleged violation of section 3523. In order to constitute an actionable tort, there must be a legal duty owed by a defendant to the one injured, for, in the absence of such a duty, any damage caused is injury without wrong. <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Union Iron Works Drydock Co., </em>167 Cal. 539 [140 P. 250].) Under the facts of this case, defendants, owed no legal duty to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Ashby, J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 6, 1975, and appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 19, 1975.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The right of privacy is a purely personal one, fashioned to protect an individual\u2019s solitude. <em>(Metter </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Examiner, </em>35 Cal.App.2d 304 [95 P.2d 491].) In the instant case, the members of the Johnson fam.ily are not asserting that they are entitled to recover solely on the basis that their father\u2019s right of privacy was invaded, but rather have averred that their own right of privacy was violated by the republication of the article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\">It is not alleged that the first publication injured the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b755-8\">The republication as it appeared in the textbook, in pertinent part, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">\u201cUnexpected Rewards of Virtue\u201d by Fred J. Cook</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">\u201cLike the preceding selection, this one deals with the problems and pressures which a man faces when through some quirk of fate he suddenly finds a small fortune thrust into his hands, a fortune belonging to someone else. There is a considerable difference in the way the subject of each article responds to his situation, but it is interesting to note the similar pattern of public reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">\u201cThe introduction to the two articles are quite comparable, but the conclusions differ in that Cook adds a suggestion of the larger social significance of incidents such as these.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">\u201c(1) On March 10, 1961, Douglas William Johnson, a fifty-year-old Negro janitor in Los Angeles, a man who had felt the pinch of poverty, drove to an apartment house under construction to see if he could get the job of cleaning up the debris. With him was his wife. Helen, thirty-eight. The superintendent whom he had to see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>about the debris-cleaning chore wasn\u2019t at the site, and so Johnson climbed back into his station wagon and started home. He had driven only a short distance when he happened to see, lying in the street in front of his car, a bulky canvas bag. Thinking it might contain something useful, Johnson stopped, picked it up and tossed it into the back of the station wagon.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">\u201c(2) As he got behind the wheel and drove off, his wife, possessed by curiosity, turned around and began to examine the bag. It was sealed, but it bore a tag. The tag said that the bag contained $240,000 in $10 and $20 bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">\u201c(3) \u2018Do you know what you\u2019ve picked up?\u2019'Mrs. Johnson asked her husband. \u2018There\u2019s $240,000 in that bag!\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">\u201c(4) \u2018No!\u2019 he said\u2014and started to shake all over.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">\u201c(5) Explaining his reaction later, Johnson told reporters: T was knocked off my feet. I never dreamed I\u2019d have my hands on anything like that.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">\u201c(6) Here certainly was king-sized temptation. Bills of relatively small denominations are not easily traced, and Johnson\u2014the part-time maintenance m.an, father of three sons\u2014had $240,000 worth of those bills at his finger tips. What to do?</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">\u201c(7) T thought if I kept that money I\u2019d never be able to look my three kids in the face again,\u2019 Johnson explained, using the simplistic imagery of a bygone age when man had stature and was supposed to be responsible for his acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">\u201c(8) So Johnson acted according to the dictates of pure and simple honesty. As soon as he reached home, he telephoned a friend, a former Chicago policeman, to find out whom he should notify about the money; the friend advised him to call the FBI. He did. In m.inutes, four FBI agents were at his door, recovering the money bag that had fallen from the rear of a passing Brinks truck. The truck had traveled for some distance before the $240,000 loss was discovered and scores of police and FBI agents had begun to search along the truck\u2019s route when Johnson telephoned that he had the missing money.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-15\">\u201c(9) Brinks paid Johnson a $10,000 reward for his honesty, but this wasn\u2019t the end of the story. A little more than a month later, on April 21, 1961, the press of the nation recorded the sad and revealing sequel. Johnson\u2019s life had been made utterly miserable: the strictly honest deed that should have made him the most admired of men had made him. instead the most despised, ridiculed and harassed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-16\">\u201c(10) Crackpots wrote obscene letters to him, neighbors ridiculed him, fellow workers needled him, schoolmates taunted his sons. The universal theme was that Johnson had proven himself to be the world\u2019s greatest boob by returning that $240,000 once he had it in his hands. The taunts became too much for his oldest son, Richard, sixteen, who finally ran away from home, returning after a few days, hungry and disillusioned. \u2018The kids kept saying things to me,\u2019 he explained, \u2018All the time, they were saying m,y father was dumb, and a fool and stupid. ... I just couldn\u2019t stand it.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b756-17\">\u201c(11)Johnson himself said it was \u2018nice\u2019 that Brinks had given him a $10,000 reward, but he added:</p>\n<p id=\"b756-18\">\u201c(12) T can\u2019t leave the house to get to work without someone throws it all up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>me and calls me a fool. Can\u2019t be on the job without someone says, \u201cWhy you need work? You had $240,000.\u201d And now it\u2019s hurting my boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">\u201c(13) T wish I\u2019d never seen any of it. 1 wish we\u2019d let that money sit in the street and rot. I wish we\u2019d thrown it down a sewer or burned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">\u201c(14) \u2018That money? It\u2019s not worth anything. It has made me a poor man.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">\u201c(15) .... In a monied society, Douglas Johnson had committed the cardinal sin; acting on honest impulse, he had returned a fortune he might have kept.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">\u201cThe following \u2018postscript\u2019 to \u2018Unexpected Rewards of Virtue\u2019 appeared in an article in the April 27, 1963 <em>Saturday Review </em>entitled \u2018Sweet, Spontaneous Humanity\u2019 by Hallowell Bowser.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">\u201c. . . Eventually, news of the Johnsons\u2019 plight got out, and suddenly public sentiment changed. Now encouraging letters poured in, some of them addressed simply to \u2018Honest Man, Los Angeles, California.\u2019 Both neighbors and strangers began dropping in to say sheepishly that they had at first thought Johnson was a fool, but that the force of his example had made them change their minds.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">\u201cWhen President Kennedy heard of the family\u2019s ordeal he wrote to Johnson: T want to extend m.y personal commendation for your unflinching honesty. ... I have read news reports of the incident and regret the unfortunate few who have since harassed you and your family.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">\u201cBut what if lightning should strike twice? After his ordeal, would Johnson take a more \u2018realistic\u2019 view of things? The question was answered recently when a firm sent Mr. Johnson a money order of $90,036 instead of the $36 he had arranged for. He promptly returned the order, saying, T could sure use that money, but not enough to get it the wrong way.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">\u201cDiscussion and Writing</p>\n<p id=\"b757-15\">\u201c1.

This article was a condensed version of an article which originally appeared in the December 10, 1967. issue of a magazine published by Chicago American Publishing Company. As is the case here, it was not alleged that the first publication injured Briscoe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\">We are cognizant of the recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion in <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 323 [41 L.Ed.2d 789, 94 S.Ct. 2997]. where the court refused to extend the <em>New York Times </em>privilege to private individuals. In an opinion authored by Justice Powell, it rejected its earlier ruling in <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Metromedia, </em>403 U.S. 29 [29 L.Ed.2d 296, 91 S.Ct. 1811] where the court (in a plurality opinion written by Justice Brennan) concluded that the constitutional protection should extend to defamatory statements relating to private individuals if the statements concerned matters of general or public interest. <em>Gertz </em>involved the trial of a Chicago policeman for the shooting death of a youth. The policeman was tried and convicted of murder. The youth\u2019s family retained petitioner Elm.er Gertz to represent them in civil litigation against the policeman. The defendant, in an article appearing in his magazine, American Opinion, alleged that the policeman\u2019s murder trial was part of a Communist conspiracy to discredit policemen. It falsely stated that Gertz had arranged the policeman\u2019s \u201cframe up,\u201d implied that he had a criminal record, and labeled him. a \u201cLeninist\u201d and \u201cCommunist-fronter.\u201d The court held that the New York Times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>standard did not apply because Gertz was not a public figure. In the process, the court indicated that there exist two distinct classes of public figures, stating (at p. 351 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 812]): \u201cIn some instances an individual may achieve such pervasive fame or notoriety that he becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all contexts. More commonly, an individual voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues.

Under these theories of sociology it is our object to lift up and sustain the unfortunate rather than tear him down. Where a person has by his own efforts rehabilitated himself, we, as right-thinking members of society, should permit him. to continue in the path of rectitude rather than throw him back into a life of shame or crime.
