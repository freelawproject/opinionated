Payne's workers' compensation claim for disability benefits based on asbestosis. Subsequent to the hearing on his claim, but before a decision was rendered, Mr. Payne died and his wife Eileen C. Payne, the administratrix of his estate, was substituted as plaintiff. Defendants Ross and Witmer, Inc. (\"R &amp; W\") and Travelers Insurance Company have appealed from the Industrial Commission's opinion and award (a) granting total disability benefits for a period preceding Mr. Payne's death and death benefits under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-39 (2003) and (b) finding that Mr. Payne was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of asbestosis while employed at R &amp; W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The primary issues on appeal are whether the death benefits claim was properly before the Commission and, if so, whether it is time-barred by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-61.6 (2003). We hold that the Full Commission had authority to decide the death benefits claims. Further, because we have concluded that N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-61.6 violates the Equal Protection Clause, we hold that the claim for death benefits was timely. With respect to defendants' arguments regarding the merits of plaintiff's claim for benefits, since the Commission's findings are supported by competent evidence, the appropriate standard of review compels that we affirm the Commission's opinion and award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Payne worked at Charlotte Heating &amp; Air Conditioning from 1960 through 1966. He was responsible for servicing furnaces and boilers, during the course of which he was exposed to asbestos products. Mr. Payne mixed \"asbestos mud\" by pouring asbestos powder into buckets and adding water. He used the mud to repair boilers and insulate pipes. He also worked with asbestos rope and asbestos millboard, cutting it to size and installing it. Although he was, as a result, exposed to airborne asbestos dust, he was not provided and never used any form of respiratory protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After working for other companies in positions not involving significant asbestos exposure, Mr. Payne was employed by R &amp; W from 1972 to 1975. At R &amp; W, Mr. Payne primarily fabricated and installed duct work from sheet metal, but he also \"set some furnaces.\" At one point during his employment with R &amp; W, Mr. Payne worked on an apartment complex construction project involving furnace installations in 160 to 170 apartment units. Each furnace was surrounded by asbestos millboard and asbestos cloth. Mr. Payne was the supervisor of the\n   crew and the Commission found was exposed to airborne asbestos dust without having respiratory protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Mr. Payne's employment with R &amp; W ended, his subsequent jobs did not expose him to asbestos products to any significant extent. In 1989, Mr. Payne developed back problems that required surgery. After the surgery, he remained symptomatic and did not return to work, but rather began receiving Social Security disability. Mr. Payne and his wife both testified that ultimately his back symptoms were no longer the cause of his disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In January 1994, Mr. Payne saw a pulmonologist regarding a notable worsening of his ability to breathe. Mr. Payne had smoked one to two packages of cigarettes daily until quitting in 1993. Pulmonary function studies indicated very severe obstructive lung disease and severe emphysema. Upon further x-rays and examinations, Mr. Payne was diagnosed with emphysema, asbestosis, and pleural plaques related to asbestos exposure. Two National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (\"NIOSH\") certified \"B readers,\" who evaluate whether workers exposed to dust in their work environments have dust-related disease, also found that Mr. Payne had asbestosis or disease related to asbestos exposure. A third certified \"B reader\" found pulmonary abnormalities caused by asbestosis, but concluded that asbestos exposure probably did not contribute to Mr. Payne's pulmonary impairment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In February 1996, Mr. Payne filed an Industrial Commission Form 18B seeking total disability benefits based on asbestosis. A hearing was conducted on Mr. Payne's claim on 3 May 2000 by deputy commissioner Morgan S. Chapman. On 16 October 2000, Mr. Payne died. The deputy commissioner ultimately ordered that the record remain open until 15 September 2001, almost a year later. On 21 November 2001, the deputy commissioner issued an opinion and award, sustaining defendants' objection to any ruling on the issue of death benefits; holding that, in any event, death benefits were barred by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-61.6; and finding that Mr. Payne did not contract asbestosis and did not suffer any disability as a result of his exposure to asbestos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On 14 July 2003, the Full Commission filed an opinion and award, finding that the issue was properly before the Commission; that Mr. Payne did indeed have asbestosis; that his asbestosis caused his total disability and significantly contributed to his death; and that his last injurious exposure occurred during his employment with R &amp; W. Accordingly, the Commission awarded total disability compensation from 19 October 1999 through 16 October 2000 and death benefits under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-39. Defendants R &amp; W and Travelers have appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants first contend that the issue of death benefits was not properly before the Commission for determination. When a hearing was first requested, Mr. Payne was still alive. He died after the hearing, but prior to the entry of the deputy commissioner's opinion and award. On 28 February 2001, the deputy commissioner substituted Mrs. Payne, the administratrix for Mr. Payne's estate, as plaintiff and, on 6 September 2001, Mrs. Payne filed an amended Form 18B to assert a claim for death benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Full Commission concluded that as a result of the amended Form 18B, \"the issue of decedent's eligibility for death benefits is before the Full Commission.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants contend that the amended Form 18B and the substitution of Mrs. Payne as administratrix were insufficient to bring the issue of death benefits before the Commission. Defendants have not, however, cited any authority to support this contention. Under Rule 28(b)(6) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure, \"[a]ssignments of error . . . in support of which no reason or argument is stated\n   <em>\n    or authority cited,\n   </em>\n   will be taken as abandoned.\" (Emphasis added.) We are not, therefore, free to revisit the Commission's determination that the amended Form\n   18B allowed the Commission to address the issue of death benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants have, however, cited authority for their contention that they \"were not afforded an opportunity to present evidence or investigate the matter in light of a claim for death benefits.\" Nonetheless, the record reveals that defendants questioned plaintiff's expert witness extensively regarding Mr. Payne's death and that plaintiff filed her amended Form 18B on or about 6 September 2001, prior to the closing of the record and more than two months before the deputy commissioner filed her opinion and award. While on notice that plaintiff intended to pursue death benefits, defendants did not ask the deputy commissioner to extend the time for completing the record. Defendants apparently chose to rely upon their contention that the issue was not properly before the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the deputy commissioner declined to address the issue of death benefits, plaintiff, in her Form 44 \"Application for Review,\" specifically assigned as error the deputy commissioner's decision to \"sustain[] the Defendant's objection on the issue of death benefits being a part of the claim since Plaintiff died subsequent to the hearing, since the death certificate was admitted into evidence and since Plaintiff filed an Amended I.C. Form 18B specifically alleging death benefits on account of his asbestosis.\" It is well established that \"the full Commission has the duty and responsibility to decide all matters in controversy between the parties, and, if necessary, the full Commission must resolve matters in controversy even if those matters were not addressed by the deputy commissioner.\"\n   <em>\n    Crump v. Independence Nissan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8522900\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/112/587/#p589\">\n    112 N.C.App. 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 589,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20S.E.2d%20589\">\n    436 S.E.2d 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 592 (1993) (internal citations omitted). Specifically, a \"plaintiff, having appealed to the full Commission pursuant to G.S. 97-85 and having filed his Form 44 `Application for Review,' is entitled to have the full Commission respond to the questions directly raised by his appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Vieregge v. N.C. State Univ.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8524766\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/105/633/#p639\">\n    105 N.C.App. 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 639,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=414%20S.E.2d%20771\">\n    414 S.E.2d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774 (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Thus, once plaintiff included the issue of death benefits in her Form 44, defendants were on notice that the Full Commission would be required to address that issue. At that point, defendants had a strategic choice to make. They could (1) rest on their contention - accepted by the deputy commissioner - that the question of death benefits was not properly before the Commission or (2) request that the Full Commission allow them an opportunity to present evidence with respect to death benefits. \"The Commission, when reviewing an award by a deputy commissioner, may receive additional evidence, even if it was not newly discovered evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Cummins v.

If the Full Commission chose to address the issue of death benefits on the merits and determined that the transcript and record were insufficient to resolve that issue, then the Commission would have been required to \"conduct its own hearing\n   <em>\n    or remand\n   </em>\n   the matter for further hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Crump,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8522900\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/112/587/#p589\">\n    112 N.C.App. at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20S.E.2d%20589\">\n    436 S.E.2d at 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants, however, chose not to ask the Commission for the opportunity to present additional evidence. The record contains no request by defendants at any time (1) for an opportunity to supplement the record with medical evidence or other testimony regarding death benefits, (2) for a remand to the deputy commissioner for a hearing on that issue, or (3) for an evidentiary hearing before the Full Commission. In defendants' brief to the Full Commission, included in the record on appeal, defendants argue only (1) that the death benefits issue was not properly before the Commission because Mr. Payne died after the hearing before the deputy commissioner and (2) that plaintiff's evidence was insufficient to support an award of death benefits. Defendants' brief contains no suggestion that additional evidence should be taken on the death benefits issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The record thus reflects that defendants had notice that death benefits would be at issue at a time when they still could have offered evidence. Defendants have not established that they were denied an opportunity\n   to be heard because they did not ask to present additional evidence.\n   <em>\n    See Cummins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9126427\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/149/180/#p183\">\n    149 N.C.App. at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=560%20S.E.2d%20369\">\n    560 S.E.2d at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendants were not denied an opportunity to be heard when they had a doctor's records for two years and made no motion to depose that doctor until after the Full Commission entered its opinion and award).\n   <em>\n    Compare Allen v. K-Mart,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11093073\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/137/298/#p302\">\n    137 N.C.App. 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 302,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=528%20S.E.2d%2060\">\n    528 S.E.2d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63-64 (2000) (defendants were denied an opportunity to be heard when the Full Commission admitted evidence of two independent medical examinations (\"IMEs\") submitted by plaintiff, but did not rule until after filing its opinion and award on defendants' five objections to the allowance of the IMEs, defendants' request to depose two physicians, and on defendants' six requests to have plaintiff submit to an IME by a physician of defendants' choosing). We, therefore, hold that defendants have not demonstrated that they were denied notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue of death benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants argue that, even if the issue of death benefits was properly before the Commission, the claim was barred by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-61.6. Plaintiff argues in response that the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause and is, therefore, unconstitutional. The Full Commission awarded death benefits to plaintiff without specifically addressing the constitutionality of this statute. The parties agree, however, that if N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-61.6 controls, then plaintiff is barred from seeking death benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Paragraph 4 of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-61.6 sets out the time frame within which a claim for death benefits may be brought if the death resulted from asbestosis and silicosis:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [S]hould death result from asbestosis or silicosis\n   <em>\n    within two years from the date of last exposure,\n   </em>\n   or should death result from asbestosis or silicosis, or from a secondary infection or diseases developing from asbestosis or silicosis\n   <em>\n    within 350 weeks from the date of last exposure\n   </em>\n   and while the employee is entitled to compensation for disablement due to asbestosis or silicosis, either partial or total, then in either of these events, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid compensation in accordance with G.S. 97-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Emphasis added.) In comparison, for occupational diseases other than asbestosis or silicosis, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-38 (2003) provides for payment of death benefits \"[i]f death results proximately from a compensable injury or occupational disease and\n   <em>\n    within six years thereafter, or within two years of the final determination of disability,\n   </em>\n   whichever is later....\" (Emphasis added). Thus, for asbestosis and silicosis, the time limitation runs from the date of last exposure, while for all other occupational diseases, the focus is on the occurrence of the occupational disease and the final determination of disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff contends that N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-61.6 deprives those with asbestosis and silicosis of equal protection under the law. Plaintiff points out: \"Victims of [asbestosis and silicosis], because of paragraph 4 of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-61.6, are the only group of individuals suffering from occupational diseases whose claims must be diagnosed within a certain time period from date of last exposure; thus to preserve their future death benefits, these individuals would have to file claims prior to diagnosis or death.\" Plaintiff argues that there is no rational basis for providing a substantially shorter time frame for death benefit claims based on asbestosis or silicosis than death benefits claims based other latent occupational diseases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The principles governing our decision in this case were set out by this Court - and approved by the North Carolina Supreme Court - in\n   <em>\n    Walters v.

This analysis is equally true in this case. N.C.

Since the parties agree that plaintiff's claim was within the time limitation applicable to other occupational diseases, N.C.

In support of this argument, defendants quote at length from Commissioner Sellers' dissent below, which purports to set out the definition of asbestosis developed by the American Thoracic Society and then applies that test to the evidence presented in this case. Significantly, defendants did not present expert witness testimony regarding the American Thoracic Society standard or the application of that standard to Mr. Payne.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unquestionably, the standard by which asbestosis should be diagnosed and application of that standard in a specific case are questions requiring expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    Click v.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-57 when (1) the plaintiff testified \"that he worked around asbestos in one way or another up until the day he retired\" and that he worked directly with asbestos approximately four days a week from 1991 to 1993, (2) another employee testified that the plaintiff would take down pipe containing asbestos two or three times a week, and (3) the yard where the plaintiff worked \"was very dusty with levels of asbestos present.\"\n   <em>\n    Abernathy,\n   </em>\n   151 N.C.App. at 259,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=565%20S.E.2d%20218\">\n    565 S.E.2d at 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff offered comparable evidence in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Mr. Payne testified that as part of R &amp; W's apartment complex project, he worked directly with and supervised people cutting and installing asbestos wallboard and asbestos cloth. Mr. Payne was either cutting or standing close to people cutting asbestos boards and cloth \"roughly twice a week.\" Don Sloop, Mr. Payne's supervisor at the Barcelona Apartments Construction Project,\n   testified that Mr. Payne would have been exposed to asbestos material any time he was on the job site. Mr. Payne specifically testified that any cutting of the asbestos board would cause asbestos dust to cover his clothes, face, and hair and he would breathe it in. Under\n   <em>\n    Abernathy,\n   </em>\n   this evidence is sufficient to support the Commission's finding that Mr. Payne's last injurious exposure to asbestos occurred during his employment with R &amp; W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For this reason and the reasons above, we affirm the Commission's opinion and award directing defendants R &amp; W and Travelers to pay total disability and death benefits to plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Judges TIMMONS-GOODSON and McCULLOUGH concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    That amended Form 18B stated: \"Plaintiff's asbestosis has either caused or significantly contributed to Decedent's death from emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Decedent died on October 16, 2000 as testified to by Dr. Stephen D. Proctor.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Defendants' sole expert witness was Dr. Michael Alexander, a radiologist, who acknowledged that he was not a diagnosing physician for asbestosis and could not refute the diagnosis of a pulmonologist such as plaintiff's expert, Dr. Stephen Proctor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
