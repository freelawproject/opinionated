Pursuant to the plea agreement, the trial court consolidated all three charges into one judgment. Defendant stipulated to the State's factual basis for entry of the plea, which tended to show the following. Defendant's stepson, J.F., reported to J.F.'s father that defendant had shown J.F. a pornographic magazine and had told J.F. that he wanted J.F. to do what was depicted in the magazine. Defendant then touched J.F.'s penis underneath J.F.'s clothes and \"tr[ied] to get [J.F.] to do what the girls in the magazine were doing.\" J.F. refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   J.F.'s father reported what J.F. had told him to J.F.'s mother, defendant's wife, who called law enforcement. Child Protective Services (CPS) interviewed J.F. and J.F.'s brother, M.C. Both J.F. and M.C. stated that defendant had touched their genitalia. Defendant subsequently admitted to CPS that he had sexually molested both J.F. and M.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While defendant was being held for trial, law enforcement discovered that defendant had also molested B.H., the daughter of defendant's former girlfriend. When confronted, defendant also admitted to sexually molesting B.H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At sentencing, the State requested that the trial court find as an aggravating factor that defendant took advantage of a position of trust and confidence to commit the offenses. Defendant requested that the trial court find in mitigation that defendant voluntarily acknowledged his wrongdoing prior to his arrest and at an early stage in the criminal process. The trial court, without submitting the issue of the aggravating factor to a jury, found the aggravating factor that defendant took advantage of a position of trust and confidence to commit the offenses. In open court, the trial court also found in mitigation that defendant admitted wrongdoing at an early stage in the criminal process. Also in open court, the trial court found that the aggravating factor outweighed the mitigating factor. However, the written judgment only reflects the trial court's finding in aggravation and omits the finding in mitigation. The written judgment also omits the trial court's weighing of the factors. Defendant was sentenced to 280 to 345 months in prison. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After defendant filed his brief with this Court on 16 June 2004, the United States Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Blakely v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    542 U.S. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) on 24 June 2004. Defendant thereafter filed a Motion for Appropriate Relief with this Court, arguing that the trial court's finding of an aggravating factor was unconstitutional, since a jury did not find the aggravating factor by a reasonable doubt and defendant did not admit to the factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The North Carolina Supreme Court recently held that N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.16 was unconstitutional to the extent that it permitted a trial court to find a factor in aggravation when the factor was not submitted to a jury or admitted to by the defendant.\n   <em>\n    State v. Allen,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C. ___, ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633238\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/615/256/#p262\">\n    615 S.E.2d 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262 (2005). Since the trial\n   court did not submit the issue of the aggravating factor to a jury, its finding of the aggravating factor was error unless defendant admitted to the factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State argues that defendant stipulated to the existence of the aggravating factor when he stipulated to the State's factual basis for his plea. The State argues that the factual basis, which showed that defendant sexually abused the children of women with whom he was romantically involved, necessarily established that defendant took advantage of a position of trust and confidence. The State also points to defendant's failure to object to the State's request that the trial court find the aggravating factor, and to the following statement made by defense counsel at the sentencing hearing:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT]: Your Honor, I understand the State's position, their position for an aggravating factor. There would also be, Your Honor, the - as a counterbalance towards any of that - the - the fact that he voluntarily acknowledged his wrongdoing at an early stage. . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   established that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to a jury trial on whether an aggravating factor exists.\n   <em>\n    Blakely,\n   </em>\n   542 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d at 414-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Allen,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C. at ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633238\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/615/256/#p262\">\n    615 S.E.2d at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, defendant's stipulation to the factual basis for his plea was not a \"knowing [and] intelligent act[ ] done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    Brady,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12058257\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/742/#p748\">\n    397 U.S. at 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90 S.Ct. at 1469,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12058257\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/742/#p748\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d at 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We hold that defendant did not knowingly and effectively stipulate to the aggravating factor, nor waive his right to a jury trial on the issue of the aggravating factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The State argues that if any\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   error occurred, the error was harmless. However, our Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   that \"the harmless-error rule does not apply to sentencing errors which violate a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to jury trial pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Blakely.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Allen,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C. at ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633238\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/615/256/#p262\">\n    615 S.E.2d at 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We accordingly do not review the finding of the aggravating factor for harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the alternative, the State requests that we review the\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   issue for plain error. Not only have our Courts consistently held that plain error review is only appropriate when error has occurred in the trial court's instructions to the jury or its ruling on the admissibility of evidence,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g., State v. Roache,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2987693\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/358/243/#p275\">\n    358 N.C. 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20S.E.2d%20381\">\n    595 S.E.2d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403 (2004), our Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   that \"\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   errors arising under North Carolina's Structured Sentencing Act are structural and, therefore, reversible per se.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C. at ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633238\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/615/256/#p262\">\n    615 S.E.2d at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The State concedes that the trial court did in fact find the mitigating factor. However, the State argues that the failure to record the finding is merely a clerical error and is not error that merits a new sentencing hearing.\n   <em>\n    See State v. Gell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1155594\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/351/192/#p218\">\n    351 N.C. 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 218,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=524%20S.E.2d%20332\">\n    524 S.E.2d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349,\n   <em>\n    cert. denied,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9538048,9537729,9537923,9537860,9537989,9537638,9537799,9538117,9538377,9538435,9538319,9538197,9537686,9538264\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/867/\">\n    531 U.S. 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20S.%20Ct.%20163\">\n    121 S.Ct. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20110\">\n    148 L.Ed.2d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (finding that when a judgment mistakenly indicated that the trial court found an aggravating\n   factor, it was \"an obvious clerical error because it [wa]s inconsistent with the trial court's actual findings[,]\" and the defendant was not entitled to a new sentencing hearing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The transcript of the plea proceedings indicates that the trial court clearly found the mitigating factor in open court when it stated: \"Find in mitigation that at an early - that [defendant] admitted wrongdoing. Find the aggravating factor outweighs the mitigating factor.\" The failure of the judgment to reflect this finding is a mere clerical error that does not merit a new sentencing hearing. However, since we remand this case for resentencing on other grounds, we direct the trial court to amend its judgment to accurately reflect the finding in mitigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant next assigns error to the trial court's failure to find in mitigation that defendant accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct, under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.16(e)(15). In support of his argument, defendant points to the evidence that defendant confessed that he committed the crimes, was receiving psychiatric treatment for his condition, and entered an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   guilty plea. After entering his\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea, but prior to sentencing, defendant made the following statement: \"I'm just sorry for what I did, and I just hope the family will forgive me for what I did, and I'm really working hard at getting my life straight.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, defendant failed to request that the trial court find in mitigation that defendant accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct. When a defendant fails to request that a trial court find a factor in mitigation, the trial court has a duty to find the factor \"only when the evidence offered at the sentencing hearing supports the existence of a mitigating factor\n   <em>\n    specifically listed in N.C.

In addition, we find that defendant's\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea merits against finding that defendant accepted responsibility for his conduct. The\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea permitted defendant to \"consent to the imposition of a prison sentence even if he [wa]s unwilling or unable to admit his participation in the acts constituting the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v.

Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea indicates a reluctance to take full responsibility for his criminal conduct. Finally, defendant's confession and psychiatric treatment do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that defendant has taken responsibility for his conduct. Therefore, we cannot find that the trial court erred in failing to find in mitigation that defendant took responsibility for his criminal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant's final assignment of error contends that the trial court erred when it found that the aggravating factor outweighed the mitigating factor. Defendant argues that the trial court did not accept his\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea as a legitimate and constitutional guilty plea, and that this predisposition negatively affected the mitigating evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At trial, after defendant requested that the trial court find in mitigation that defendant voluntarily acknowledged his wrongdoing at an early stage in the criminal process, the trial court made the following statements:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Well, [counsel for defendant], I - you make a sound argument for mitigation. The only thing that troubles me about that is that he's entered a - he - he voluntarily told the police about this other offense that has put him in the position of facing this long sentence. He ought to get some credit for that, but yet he's entered an [\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   ] [p]lea which I don't really follow[,] you know. You want me to find that he's admitted his wrongdoing, yet he's entered a plea here where he's - he doesn't admit it, and - you know - I don't really understand the rationale behind what's gone on here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [Defendant has] come into court and entered a plea where he doesn't admit his guilt. I just find that sort of inconsistent that - I just don't understand it[,] you know.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant contends that, considering the trial court's statements, it is impossible to know whether the trial court gave appropriate weight to the mitigating factor. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A trial court has sound discretion in weighing aggravating and mitigating factors.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Furthermore, a trial court \"need not justify the weight [it] attaches to any factor. . . .

There is no evidence that the trial court failed to give the appropriate weight to either the factor in aggravation or the factor in mitigation.
