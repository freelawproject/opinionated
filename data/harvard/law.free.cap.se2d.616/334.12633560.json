We find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    A. State's Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   V.L. is defendant's daughter. The State's evidence tended to show in April 1995, defendant came home drunk while V.L., fifteen years old, was home alone. Defendant began touching V.L. and she attempted to get away from him. When V.L. tried to telephone for help, defendant pulled the telephone wire from the wall. V.L. and defendant wrestled. Defendant eventually overpowered and engaged in sexual intercourse with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   V.L. drove defendant's car to her mother's job site in tears. Her mother returned home and discovered the telephone wire had been torn from the wall. V.L.'s mother also observed the bedcovers were off the bed and defendant was lying across the bed drunk. The following day V.L.'s mother took her to the hospital. A rape kit indicated sexual activity but failed to detect the presence of semen. V.L. reported the rape to the Robeson County Department of Social Services (\"DSS\"), but recanted a short time later because defendant threatened to hurt her and her mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A second incident also occurred in 1995 when V.L. wrecked the car she was driving. V.L. was accompanied by defendant, her brother, and a cousin. V.L. was driving because defendant was too drunk to drive. V.L. and defendant hid from the police in the woods while her brother and cousin fled. While hiding, defendant and V.L. engaged in sexual intercourse. V.L. testified she believed this event occurred in Spring 1995 because it was warm outside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   V.L. testified that sexual intercourse with defendant became \"an ongoing thing,\" occurring \"about four and five times a month,\" although she had difficulty remembering specific dates. In 1997, V.L., then seventeen years old, engaged in sexual intercourse with defendant on the living room couch. V.L. subsequently became pregnant with her son,\n   J.L., born 26 June 1998. V.L. identified defendant as the father of her son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Four months after the birth of her son, V.L., then eighteen years old, went out on a date. Defendant insisted on \"checking her\" when she returned home to see if she had engaged in sexual intercourse. Defendant subsequently engaged in sexual intercourse with V.L. who became pregnant and gave birth to K.L., a daughter, on 12 August 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   V.L. told hospital employees and DSS of defendant's actions and the assaults that had taken place over several years. The hospital and DSS helped V.L. enter a shelter. In November 2002, V.L. spoke to Detective Vincent Sinclair (\"Detective Sinclair\") of the Robeson County Sheriff's Office Juvenile Task Force. DSS had taken V.L.'s children from her home until she filed charges against defendant, who continued to visit her. V.L. recalled telling Detective Sinclair about the incident where she wrecked the car but could not remember telling him the dates of the other incidents. V.L. stated defendant started inappropriately touching her when she was four years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   M.L., V.L.'s older sister, testified over defendant's objection that defendant had touched her private parts with his hands before she was old enough to start school. M.L. could not recall exactly what happened to her, but remembered the events. M.L. could not recall specific times, dates, places, or other precise information. In addition to M.L.'s testimony, V.L.'s mother testified defendant had beaten and shot at her, put knives to her throat, pulled her hair out by the roots, and had raped her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Detective Sinclair interviewed V.L., her mother, and M.L. During trial, their statements were read to the jury over defendant's objection. Detective Sinclair also had LabCorp perform a DNA analysis to determine the paternity of V.L.'s children. Anthony Winston testified he analyzed the specimens and in his opinion, the tests showed a 99.99% probability defendant had fathered both of V.L.'s children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After his arrest, defendant gave a statement to Detective Sinclair during which, at certain points, he admitted to having sex with V.L. after her children were born. At other times during his statement, defendant denied remembering placing his penis inside V.L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    B. Defendant's Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant testified on his own behalf, denied any wrongdoing with his daughter, M.L., and denied any type of sex with V.L. Defendant denied some of the statements he made to Detective Sinclair. When asked if he ever engaged in sex in any way with V.L. at any time, defendant responded, \"not that I can remember.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The jury found defendant guilty of two counts of second-degree rape and five counts of felony incest. Defense counsel did not object to the sentencing worksheet finding defendant a record level II for purposes of sentencing. The trial court sentenced defendant to seven consecutive sentences totaling a minimum of 275 months and a maximum of 348 months. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred in: (1) not dismissing the charges of second-degree rape for insufficient evidence; (2) not dismissing the charges of incest for insufficient evidence; (3) allowing Detective Sinclair to read statements of V.L. and V.L.'s mother into evidence for the purposes of corroboration; (4) allowing M.L.'s testimony on defendant's prior bad acts; (5) allowing V.L.'s mother to testify to remote past acts; (6) giving a disjunctive jury instruction concerning second-degree rape and incest; (7) not requiring the State to meet its burden of proof of defendant's existing criminal conviction record in sentencing defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    III. Abandonment of Assignments of Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant voluntarily abandoned assignments of error numbers seven, nine, eleven, twelve, and thirteen by failing to argue them in his brief. N.C.R.App. P. 10 (2004). We decline to review these abandoned assignments of error and dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    IV. Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred in not dismissing the charges of second-degree\n   rape and felony incest due to insufficient evidence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In ruling on a motion to dismiss, the trial court must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to and give the State every reasonable inference to be drawn from the facts and evidence presented.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant argues two specific instances: (1) V.L. told Detective Sinclair defendant had molested her since she was \"seven\" and later testified defendant's molestation began when she was \"four;\" and (2) V.L. inverted the\n   order in her testimony of an alleged sexual encounter and a fight between her mother, defendant, and herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   V.L.'s testimony clearly indicated a long term and continuing sexual abuse by defendant. Although V.L.'s statements included additional facts not referred to in her testimony, V.L.'s prior oral and written statements to Detective Sinclair tended to strengthen and add credibility to her trial testimony. Any inconsistencies were for the jury to consider and weigh. These statements were admissible as corroborative evidence.\n   <em>\n    See State v.
