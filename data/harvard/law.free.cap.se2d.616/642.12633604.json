After careful review, we reverse the order below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The record tends to indicate the following: Stahler Furniture is a Vermont corporation located in Lyndonville, Vermont. Timothy Havey (\"Havey\") and Marilyn Sommers (\"Sommers\") (collectively \"plaintiffs\") are North Carolina residents. On or about 22 July 2003, plaintiffs visited the Stahler Furniture store in Vermont and purchased a corner cabinet and an end table. Stahler Furniture contracted with defendants and third-party plaintiffs, Yellow Transportation, Inc. (\"Yellow Transportation\"), an Indiana corporation, to transport the furniture to plaintiffs' residence in North Carolina from Stahler Furniture's business facility in Lyndonville, Vermont.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Specifically, on or about 10 November 2003, Stahler Furniture contracted with Yellow Transportation to deliver an end table and corner cabinet to plaintiffs' home in Raleigh, North Carolina. Defendant Mark Valentine (\"Valentine\") was the truck driver. On 14 November 2003, Valentine arrived at plaintiffs' home. According to plaintiffs' complaint, as Valentine was unloading a crate containing a piece of furniture from the tractor-trailer, Valentine pushed the crate out of\n   the truck \"in an unsafe and dangerous manner causing it to fall on and permanently injure\" Havey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 12 March 2004, Havey and Sommers filed a complaint against Valentine and Yellow Transportation alleging negligence. Defendants answered and filed a third-party complaint against Stahler Furniture alleging negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. Stahler Furniture filed a N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss the third-party complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. On 24 August 2004, the trial court denied Stahler Furniture's motion. Stahler Furniture appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"`The standard of review of an order determining jurisdiction is whether the findings of fact by the trial court are supported by competent evidence in the record; if so, this Court must affirm the order of the trial court.'\"\n   <em>\n    Tejal Vyas, LLC v.

The website provides a history of the store and its owner, a brief description of the type of furniture made by the company (i.e., types of wood), and the number of employees. The website also lists its address, phone number, and an electronic mail address through which a person could request a catalog. The website allows viewers to view samples, and states that Stahler Furniture will deliver within seventy-five miles of the store and will ship furniture throughout the United States. However, viewers cannot purchase furniture via the website and the website does not actively target North Carolina customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As the website in this case does not specifically target North Carolina residents, does not allow viewers to purchase furniture directly from the website, and merely provides information to the viewer, we conclude the website is passive and does not, by itself, provide a basis for an exercise of personal jurisdiction by North Carolina courts. Similarly, because (1) all of the contract negotiations occurred outside of North Carolina, and (2) Stahler Furniture does not have any significant contacts with North Carolina, we conclude Stahler Furniture has not purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in this state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (2) Do plaintiffs' claims arise out of activities directed at North Carolina?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Yellow Transportation has alleged Stahler Furniture breached its duty to provide Yellow Transportation with the correct weight of the furniture, and therefore, Yellow Transportation brought a negligence claim against Stahler Furniture. \"[A] court may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant acting outside of the forum when the defendant has intentionally directed his tortious conduct toward the forum state, knowing that that conduct would cause harm to a forum resident.\"\n   <em>\n    Carefirst,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530070\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/390/#p400\">\n    334 F.3d at 397-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted). However, as explained by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, a single shipment of goods to a state may not be the basis for personal jurisdiction if the exercise of personal jurisdiction would not be fair, reasonable, and would not comport with the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\n   <em>\n    See Chung v.

As a result of this purchase, Stahler Furniture shipped the furniture to plaintiffs' residence in North Carolina. All of the negotiations for the purchase of the furniture and its shipment occurred in Vermont. Moreover, Havey and Sommers initiated contact with Stahler Furniture. Nonetheless, Yellow Transportation contends Stahler Furniture was negligent because it failed to provide them with the correct weight of the furniture, and this failure caused the truck driver to use an improper unloading technique, which proximately caused Havey's injuries when the furniture fell on Havey. While Stahler Furniture did make the shipping arrangements\n   to have the furniture shipped to North Carolina, an analysis of the entire transaction between Havey, Sommers, Stahler Furniture, and Yellow Transportation does not reveal a substantial connection to the State of North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (3) Would an exercise of personal jurisdiction be constitutionally reasonable?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"[T]he fundamental requirement of personal jurisdiction [is]: `deliberate action' within the forum state in the form of transactions between the defendant and residents of the forum or conduct of the defendant purposefully directed at residents of the forum state.\"\n   <em>\n    Millennium Enterprises v.

Moreover, plaintiffs went to Vermont to purchase the furniture. Through the purchase of furniture in Vermont, Stahler Furniture became contractually obligated to ship the furniture to North Carolina. Furthermore, Stahler Furniture has had essentially no contact with the State of North Carolina over the past ten years. And, as previously discussed, a passive Internet website cannot provide the basis for an exercise of personal jurisdiction. Considering the quantity and quality of Stahler Furniture's contacts with the State of North Carolina, we hold that specific personal jurisdiction does not exist in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   B.

The factors to be considered are (1) quantity of the contacts, (2) nature and quality of the contacts, (3) the source and connection of the cause of action to the contacts, (4) the interest of the forum state, and (5) convenience to the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Marion v.

Over the past ten years, Stahler Furniture has sold one or two pieces of furniture to North Carolina residents. It is not registered or licensed to do business in North Carolina. Stahler Furniture does not own any real or personal property located in this state. Stahler Furniture does not advertise here and it has a passive, informational website that anyone in the United States may access. Stahler Furniture did not solicit any customers in North Carolina; rather, the North Carolina plaintiffs in this case went to the Stahler Furniture store in Vermont and purchased the furniture. Accordingly, we conclude general personal jurisdiction does not exist in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, we conclude the trial court erroneously denied Stahler Furniture's Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. As we have explained, neither specific personal jurisdiction nor general personal jurisdiction exists in this case. Indeed, the significant facts in this case arose in Vermont and Stahler Furniture does not\n   have continuous and systematic contact with the State of North Carolina.
