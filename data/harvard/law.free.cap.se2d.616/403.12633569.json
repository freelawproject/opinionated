In this case, Plaintiff-Employee traveled to a patient's home, left on a personal errand, and was injured in an automobile accident on her return to the patient's home. Because the personal errand was complete and Plaintiff had resumed her business travel route, we hold that the accident occurred in the course of her employment making her injury compensable. Accordingly, we affirm the full Commission's Opinion and Award on this and other issues presented on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The evidence from the record on appeal tends to show that Plaintiff Leigh Ann Chavis, a certified nursing assistant (\"CNA\"), worked as a \"runner\" for Defendant TLC Home Health Care. As a \"runner,\" Ms. Chavis traveled to multiple patients' homes in a single day. TLC Home Health Care reimbursed Ms. Chavis for the mileage she incurred from her home to the first patient's home, to and from each patient's home, and from her last patient's home to her home. TLC Home Health Care paid Ms. Chavis an hourly wage only for the time she spent in-home with the patient and not for the travel time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 26 October 2000, Ms. Chavis drove to her first patient's home at 8:00 a.m. to perform three-and-a-half hours of work. However, upon arriving at the home, the patient, Linda Galegos, informed Ms. Chavis that she was leaving to take care of some business at school. Ms. Galegos informed Ms. Chavis that she would be back home in approximately twenty minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   TLC Home Health Care had a policy that did not permit Ms. Chavis to wait in a patient's home when the patient was not there. But TLC Home Health Care had no written policy on what Ms. Chavis should have done when a patient told her to wait twenty minutes. Ms. Chavis testified that, on a previous occasion, Barbara Locklear, TLC Home Health Care's scheduling supervisor, informed her to \"just go get something to eat or just do something till the time she come (sic) back, but if she's going to be gone more than an hour or two, you have to go to another client.\" But Ms. Locklear testified that in that situation Ms. Chavis should have called TLC Home Health Care to see if she should be immediately assigned to another patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Chavis told Ms. Galegos that she would meet her back at her home. Ms. Chavis then drove directly to her father's place of employment, dropped off his wallet, and drove directly back to Ms. Galegos's house. While driving back to Ms. Galegos's house, Ms. Chavis blacked out and ran her car off the road into the side of a church, sustaining injuries to her right foot. Ms. Chavis's father contacted Ms. Locklear that day to inform her of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Chavis came under the care of George Dawson, III, M.D. for the injuries to her right foot. Dr. Dawson applied a soft cast, and Ms. Chavis was unable to walk without crutches for several months. On 10 November 2000, Dr. Dawson recommended that Ms. Chavis be out of work for a four-month period. On 6 April 2001, Dr. Dawson gave her a note to return to working regular duty on 9 April 2001. Before returning to work in April 2001, Ms. Chavis contacted TLC Home Health Care to inquire about sedentary work but was told none was available. Nonetheless, Ms. Chavis's contract was not terminated. Ms. Chavis filed a claim for workers' compensation which TLC Home Health Care denied. The claim came for a hearing before Deputy Commissioner Ronnie E. Rowell, who awarded Ms. Chavis temporary total disability from 26 October 2000 to 9 April 2001 and for an additional 43.2 weeks thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   TLC Home Health Care appealed to the full Commission. On 1 April 2004, the full Commission filed an Opinion and Award affirming Deputy Commissioner Rowell's award including all travel expenses. TLC Home Health Care was also ordered to pay all medical expenses and attorney's fees. TLC Home Health Care appeals from this Opinion and Award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, TLC Home Health Care argues that the full Commission erred by concluding that (1) Ms. Chavis's injury \"arose out of\" and \"in the course of\" her employment; (2) Ms. Chavis's average weekly wage should include what she was paid in milage reimbursement; (3) TLC Home Health Care must provide medical treatment should it become necessary; (4) Ms. Chavis was temporarily and totally disabled from 26 October 2000 to 9 April 2001; (5) Ms. Chavis gave notice of her injury to TLC Home Health Care; and (6) evidence should be excluded. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The standard of review for this Court in reviewing an appeal from the full Commission is limited to determining \"whether any competent evidence supports the Commission's findings of fact and whether the findings of fact support the Commission's conclusions of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Deese v.

Ms. Locklear confirmed this payment arrangement. As Ms. Chavis was performing her job duties while driving from one patient's house to another, but was not paid an hourly wage during this time, there is competent evidence to support the finding that Ms. Chavis was paid mileage in lieu of wages, and the full Commission properly included the mileage in her average weekly wage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Shah v.

Caldwell Memorial Hospital,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C.App. ___, ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633151\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/448/#p450\">\n    614 S.E.2d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 450 (2005). Ms. Chavis was off-duty and returning to her original job site to resume work when the accident occurred. She was not at work or reimbursed for mileage when the accident occurred. The \"going and coming\" rule precludes compensation and Ms. Chavis has failed to prove she comes within any exception to the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The majority's decision will allow any off-duty employee who is injured while traveling on a purely personal errand to assert a workers' compensation claim. Workers' compensation insurance is not general liability insurance and requires a causal relation of the injury to the employment.\n   <em>\n    See Bryan v. Church,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558567\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/267/111/#p115\">\n    267 N.C. 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=147%20S.E.2d%20633\">\n    147 S.E.2d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 635 (1966) (\"The rule of causal relation is `the very sheet anchor of the Workmen's Compensation Act,' and has been adhered to in our decisions, and prevents our Act from being a general health and insurance benefit act.\") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The majority's opinion is an unprecedented and unwarranted extension of employers' liability for workers who are injured while not at work and while engaging in a purely personal pursuit. I cannot distinguish the facts here from when an off-duty employee leaves work in their personal vehicle and engages in\n   an activity that has no connection to or benefit for their employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Millions of workers leave and return to work daily in their personal vehicles for personal meals, doctor's appointments, banking, and any other personal errands that have no connection to or benefit for their employer. If an accident or injury occurs during these purely personal trips, the coming and going rule applies and no workers' compensation liability accrues to their employer. The cause of Ms. Chavis's injury was solely from a single car accident after she \"blacked out.\" The Commission's opinion and award is erroneous and should be reversed. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
