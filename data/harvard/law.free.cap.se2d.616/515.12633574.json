Following a capital sentencing proceeding, the jury found that the mitigating circumstances were insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstance and recommended a sentence of death. The trial court entered judgment on 22 October 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 29 November 2001, Officer Roy Turner was assigned to patrol the Jasper Street area as a member of the Neighborhood Improvement Team (NIT). On the NIT with Officer Turner that night were Officer Stephen Tredwell and the supervisor, Sergeant Shanon Brewer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sergeant Brewer radioed Officers Tredwell and Turner and instructed them to meet him at a church on Amy Street. Officer Tredwell arrived at the church where he found Sergeant Brewer but not Officer Turner. After waiting approximately ten minutes, Sergeant Brewer again radioed Officer Turner, who responded that he was headed in that direction. When Officer Turner still did not appear, Officer Tredwell made two unsuccessful attempts to reach him by radio. Three minutes later, Sergeant Brewer and Officer Tredwell heard a dispatch that a Fayetteville police officer had been shot in the vicinity of Moore and Hillsboro Streets, an area associated with drug activity, alcohol consumption, and domestic disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sergeant Brewer and Officer Tredwell immediately proceeded to the scene. There they saw Officer Turner's patrol car parked at an angle near the light pole at Moore and Hillsboro Streets. The headlights were on and the engine was still running, but the blue lights had not been activated. Officer Turner was lying on the ground as other officers administered CPR. His weapon was strapped in its holster on the right side of his body. He had suffered a bullet wound to the right side of the head and the autopsy revealed that he had also been shot in the right front shoulder. Officer Turner was taken by ambulance to Cape Fear Valley Hospital where he was pronounced dead about an hour and a half later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State presented evidence that, at the time of the offense, four people, including defendant, were standing near a pay telephone booth at the intersection of Moore and Hillsboro Streets. Three of these individuals, Deldrick Devone Autry (Autry), James \"Little D\" Carlysle (Carlysle), and Lisa Merrick (Merrick), testified that the fourth, defendant Quintel Augustine, shot Officer Turner. According to this testimony, earlier in the evening of 29 November, defendant, Autry, Carlysle, and Merrick were hanging out with several others in the yard of a Ms. Swinson, who resided on Moore Street. They had been drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana for approximately an hour to an hour and a half when Ms. Swinson returned home from work and chased everyone away. The group crossed the street, where defendant told Autry that he was angry because his brother had \"[gotten] some time\" and that he wanted to shoot a police officer. As the group slowly began to break up, defendant\n   and Autry walked up Moore Street to a telephone booth. According to Autry, this telephone booth was the site of frequent drug sales. Carlysle and Merrick joined them about twenty minutes later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Officer Turner's marked police car approached from Ramsey Street and stopped where Moore intersected with Hillsboro Street. Officer Turner looked at the group briefly, then drove on across Hillsboro Street. However, when Merrick yelled an obscenity, Officer Turner turned his cruiser around, recrossed Hillsboro, and parked in front of the telephone booth. Officer Turner then exited the vehicle and began to approach the telephone booth. Autry first saw defendant fumbling with something in the waist of his pants, then heard a gunshot. As Officer Turner began to reach for his own weapon, Autry saw defendant shoot Officer Turner over the telephone booth \"a couple more times.\" Carlysle similarly testified that he saw defendant take a black pistol out of his pocket and cock it while the officer was still in his car. As Officer Turner emerged from his vehicle, defendant raised himself up on the telephone booth and fired three or four rounds at close range, causing the officer to fall to his knees. Merrick also testified that she saw defendant pull out a pistol, heard some shots, and saw defendant shoot the officer. Although the murder weapon was never found, three expended shell casings were recovered at the crime scene. Forensic examination indicated that all three had been fired in the same .380 caliber firearm. Additional examination established that two bullet fragments removed from Officer Turner's head and chest had been fired from a Hi-Point Firearms .380 caliber automatic handgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant testified that he did not shoot Officer Turner. According to defendant, he never spoke to Autry about his brother being in prison or of having a desire to kill a police officer. Furthermore, Autry, not he, had been carrying a handgun earlier that evening. Defendant claimed to the investigating officers that the three witnesses implicated him because he \"wasn't from that neighborhood\" and they were trying to put the murder \"off on [him].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Additional facts will be set forth as necessary for the discussion of various issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   JURY SELECTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We first consider defendant's assignment of error pertaining to jury selection. Defendant contends that the trial court erred by ruling that he had not made a prima facie showing of racial discrimination at the time he objected to the State's peremptory challenge of prospective juror Ernestine Bryant. Ms. Bryant was the only African American in the first panel of twelve prospective jurors. When the State peremptorily challenged her, defendant raised an objection pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Batson v. Kentucky,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    476 U.S. 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    90 L.Ed.2d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986), arguing that Ms. Bryant was the first African-American prospective juror to be considered, that the number of African Americans who had been summoned for the jury pool in this case was small, and that Ms. Bryant had indicated during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   that she could consider both the death penalty and life imprisonment without parole as potential punishments in this case. The trial court confirmed that this peremptory challenge was the first exercised for a black female, then overruled the objection on the ground that defendant had made no prima facie showing of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution forbids the State from using peremptory challenges for racially discriminatory reasons,\n   <em>\n    Batson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    476 U.S. at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    106 S.Ct. at 1719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    90 L.Ed.2d at 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as does Article I, Section 26 of the North Carolina Constitution,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State presented strong evidence of defendant's guilt through the testimony of three eyewitnesses who were present at the corner of Moore and Hillsboro Streets when Officer Turner was shot. All three gave consistent testimony identifying defendant as the shooter. One of those witnesses, Autry, also testified that earlier in the evening defendant expressed anger about his brother's incarceration and that he \"wanted to shoot a police [officer].\" Moreover, defendant himself indicated several times on direct examination that he does not like to be troubled by police. When asked by defense counsel about spending time at the telephone booth on the corner of Moore and Hillsboro Streets, defendant stated that he would \"go up there and see what's going on\" and \"dress[] a certain way ... [to] fit in with the - with the drunks and homeless people, so you won't get harassed by the police.\" Defendant later stated that when Officer Turner approached the telephone booth on the night of the murder, he wanted to get away because he \"knew that [Officer Turner] was gonna harass somebody, ask questions, and try to search people.\" Furthermore, defendant admitted to the jury that he is a crack cocaine dealer who sometimes worked the Moore Street area and that on the day Officer Turner was murdered, he went to Moore Street to \"make some money\" and \"socialize.\" He possessed approximately twenty \"rocks\" and made one sale.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

Defendant has consistently maintained that he did not kill Officer Turner and that the killer was one of three others at the telephone booth that night. Specifically, defendant sought to pin responsibility on Autry. Defense counsel observed in opening statement that Autry \"had the most to gain from the death of ... Officer Roy Turner.\" Defense counsel's cross-examination of Autry concerning his actions after the shooting further exemplifies defendant's strategy of suggesting that Autry was guilty. Accordingly, Autry's direct testimony was relevant to show that he did not flee to a motel after Officer Turner was shot because he was guilty, as argued by defendant, but rather to assist his frightened girlfriend and children. Thus, Autry's testimony was admissible to shed light on circumstances surrounding the crime and its aftermath. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendant next argues that the trial court erred by failing to intervene\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu\n   </em>\n   during different portions of the prosecution's closing arguments in the guilt-innocence phase of the trial. The first argument\n   in question addressed defendant's alleged history of disrespect toward law enforcement and corrections officers. One of the prosecutors made the following argument:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   If there's an overall theme with respect to this case, I think it is that this defendant does not like to be harassed by cops. Now, what does that mean? He said he didn't want people trying to make him do things that he didn't want to do. Really what it boils down to, folks, is he doesn't want, doesn't like police officers doing their job. It's just that simple. Harassment. He doesn't like to be harassed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Now, what this defendant is telling you is that he does not want a cop doing his job and involving him. And there was example after example after example replete with his arrogance, his defiance, his combativeness, his total disregard for authority. That's what this case comes down to....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   ... You learned things about his attitude, about his demeanor, about his views on people of authority doing their job. \"They're always harassing me.\" A common theme throughout everything he told you about with respect to his contact with law enforcement officers, from the Laundromat at College Lakes - (pause) - to the breaking and entering and larceny that gave rise to the first prison sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Pursuing this theme, another prosecutor argued:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We have the same situation in this situation where Officer Turner is killed that you've seen in the testimony of every single incident of this defendant having trouble with law enforcement officers. He has a total disregard for society. And it came to a head whenever he laughed at snuffing out the life of this officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendant maintains that these arguments improperly appealed to the jury's emotions, encouraging the jurors to convict defendant because of his alleged lack of respect for and hostility toward law enforcement and corrections officers. In addition, defendant contends that this line of argument, focusing on defendant's contrary character to reinforce the State's theory that defendant shot Officer Turner, was not based on inferences fairly drawn from the trial evidence. Defendant did not object to these arguments. Accordingly, we must determine whether \"`the remarks were so grossly improper that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to intervene\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu.\n   </em>\n   '\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State's theory that defendant shot Officer Turner was supported by substantial evidence that defendant harbored ill will toward law enforcement personnel. For example, not only did Autry testify that defendant was upset with police because of his brother's incarceration, defendant himself twice referred to police \"harassment\" during his direct examination. First,\n   defendant testified that he sometimes dressed a certain way when hanging around the telephone booth with the drunks and the homeless \"so you won't get harassed by the police.\" Later, defendant stated that when Officer Turner approached the telephone booth, he \"knew that [Officer Turner] was gonna harass somebody\" and that he wanted \"to get away from him so [he] wouldn't get harassed.\" On cross-examination, when asked if he did not like being harassed by law enforcement officers, defendant responded that he did not \"like to be harassed by anyone.\" Defendant also grumbled to investigating officers about being harassed. In addition, defendant discussed his prior convictions on direct examination and admitted on cross-examination to hitting a uniformed law enforcement officer outside the College Lakes Laundromat. In light of this record, it is apparent that the prosecutors' arguments were based on facts in evidence and were relevant to the issue of defendant's motive for shooting Officer Turner.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The cited arguments of counsel were not grossly improper and the trial court did not err by failing to intervene\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendant also argues that another portion of the State's closing argument during the guilt-innocence phase was improper. The pertinent portions of the prosecutor's arguments related to Jerome Farmer, a witness for defendant who testified that he saw the group standing around the telephone booth shortly before the shooting and that Carlysle was \"acting fidgety\" and appeared to have a pistol in his pocket. Farmer further testified that later that night, another individual whom he knew as Andre or Adrian Crump (Crump's true name is Adrian Sturdivant) came to the house where Farmer was living and told Farmer that Carlysle was \"crazy\" and \"stupid\" and had shot the officer. During closing argument, the State addressed this testimony by contending:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Talk about inconsistencies and contradictions, let's talk about Jerome Farmer, one of the most incredible witnesses you'll ever see in any courtroom in this country. That hulk of a man sitting there in the horizontal black and white stripes, head down, mumbling, couldn't even be heard, wouldn't even answer the defense attorneys' questions, the side that called him. Had to be asked at least five times to tell his incredible story before we finally got it out. Just like pulling teeth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   And then [witness Farmer] says, in that same exhibit, speaking to [Assistant District Attorney] Ms. Kelley, \"Tell my lawyer to come and see me.\" And here's the kicker, \"And you tell him what you want me to know about the case.\" He's trying to sell his testimony, folks. He's trying to sell the state a bill of goods. And Elaine Kelley would have nothing to do with it. She didn't go see him. She didn't correspond with him. And he didn't get this deal with his conditions. And what happens? He's going federal. And he's gonna do a long, long time. And why is he going federal, and why is he gonna do a long, long time? Because the state didn't buy his junk. Because the state didn't meet his conditions. Because the state didn't go over and tell him what [sh]e wanted him to know about the case so that he could come in here and regurgitate it all over you.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Not only did his demeanor tell you that he was totally incredible, these letters tell you that he's totally incredible. Apparently he forgot to tell his lawyer and the defense what he was saying to Ms. Kelley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   There are other letters. You've had the opportunity to hear them and read them. He teased her, telling her that he knew something about, quote-unquote, \"the cop murder,\" but she didn't fall for it. The state didn't go for it. And you shouldn't go for one word that he said from that stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendant maintains that the prosecutor's arguments impermissibly stated his personal opinion about Farmer's credibility, distorted the record, and were abusive.

The defense called Farmer to impeach the testimony of Adrian Sturdivant/Andre Crump. During the State's case-in-chief, Sturdivant testified that after the murder, he ran to the house of Lillie Ann Hawkins and William Jones and said that \"Q [defendant] shot the rollers.\" Testifying as a rebuttal witness for defendant, Farmer indicated that Sturdivant had said instead that Carlysle, not defendant, had done something \"stupid\" and \"crazy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Q. Did Adrian Crump [Adrian Sturdivant] say anything else when he came into the house?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   A. Yeah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Q. What did he say?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   (Pause.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   THE COURT: Mr. Farmer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   A. The way he was saying, like Little D [Carlysle] did it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Q. Please keep your voice up and repeat that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   A. The way he was saying to me, like Little D did it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Q. Did what?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   A. Shoot the police officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Q. Mr. Farmer, is that, in fact, what you heard that night Adrian Crump say?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Farmer also testified that Carlysle later said \"The gun is sleeping with the fishes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Because Farmer implicated someone other than defendant as the shooter, his credibility was fair game. The prosecutor's closing arguments highlighted facts in evidence and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts. The prosecutor's comment about Farmer's dress was preceded by defense counsel's eliciting on direct examination that Farmer was wearing a \"black and white striped outfit\" because he was incarcerated in the Brunswick County jail. Defense counsel repeatedly asked Farmer to speak up, and the trial court on numerous occasions had to instruct Farmer to answer the questions asked. Farmer acknowledged on cross-examination that State charges against him had been dropped and that he was going to be indicted under federal charges. He also admitted writing nine letters to Assistant District Attorney Kelley. These letters, which were read aloud and introduced into evidence, create a reasonable inference that Farmer had been hoping to receive favorable treatment from the State in exchange for his testimony in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Thus, it is apparent that the prosecutor's argument appropriately focused on reasons the jury should not believe Farmer.\n   <em>\n    See Golphin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"684963\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/352/364/#p455\">\n    352 N.C. at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=533%20S.E.2d%20168\">\n    533 S.E.2d at 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Defendant next contends that the trial court erred in denying his oral request for a special jury instruction concerning the testimony and credibility of prosecution witness Autry. During the charge conference, defendant requested the trial court to instruct the jury that at the time of the trial, Autry could be facing habitual felon status if he were convicted of a pending felony cocaine charge. Although Autry had not been indicted as an habitual felon, defendant argued to the trial court that the jury should be instructed on his potential status so it could determine \"whether that has an impact on his testimony in that case, whether it makes him interested or not.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   During this charge conference, defendant's counsel stated that it would present to the court and the prosecution a proposed instruction when the court reconvened. The trial judge denied the oral request for the special instruction but agreed to allow defense counsel \"to tender an instruction for the record\" the next court day. However, when court opened the following Monday, defendant did not submit a pertinent proposed written instruction. Accordingly, the trial judge gave the jury the pattern instructions relating to interested witnesses:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   You may find that a witness is interested in the outcome of this trial. In deciding whether or not to believe such a witness, you may take his interest into account.

The transcript indicates that defense counsel's real interest was that the jury should know of Autry's status and have the opportunity to determine whether his desire to avoid prosecution as a habitual felon motivated him to testify for the State. This concern was captured in the pattern jury instruction relating to interested witness testimony that the court provided during the guilt-innocence phase of the trial.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

Cumberland County Sheriff's Deputy Melody Clark testified that while she was working as a jailer on 19 March 2002, she received an intercom call from defendant claiming that there was a problem in his cell block. Deputy Clark alerted Corporal Jennifer Harris, her supervisor, and Corporal Harris and two other deputies went to defendant's cell block to investigate. Corporal Harris testified that, upon her arrival, the inmates seemed \"rowdy\" and \"excited,\" so she decided to remove defendant for his own protection and for the protection of others. According to Corporal Harris, defendant was upset and asked where he was being taken. When Corporal Harris informed defendant that he was going to be locked in a single cell, defendant responded that when he was unlocked, \"he was going to ... get anybody that he could. Whether it be an officer or an inmate, it didn't matter. He didn't care.\" Defendant also told Corporal Harris: \"I'm going to get whoever I can when I'm unlocked. You can read my file. It doesn't matter. I don't care what happens to me.\" Defendant made this threat approximately three times while he was being taken to the single cell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Before Deputy Clark and Corporal Harris testified, defense counsel orally objected to the evidence outside the presence of the jury. The State contended that the evidence was relevant for two reasons: (1) as a tacit admission\n   of defendant's involvement in the murder of Officer Turner, and (2) to support the finding of the N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2000(e)(8) aggravating circumstance that the capital felony was committed against a law enforcement officer engaged in the performance of official duties. The trial court overruled defendant's objection. After these witnesses testified, defendant's motion to strike their testimony was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Defendant claims that this evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial and that he is therefore entitled to a new sentencing proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time this case was tried, we had interpreted Rule 10(b)(1) of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure to require that an attorney make a contemporaneous objection to a trial court's decision to admit evidence, even if the attorney had previously obtained a ruling on the basis of a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine.

However, on 21 May 2003, the General Assembly amended N.C. Rule of Evidence 103(a) to provide that once the trial court makes \"a definitive ruling on the record admitting or excluding evidence, either at or before trial, a party need not renew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.\" Act of May 21, 2003, ch. 101,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20N.C.%20Sess.%20Laws%20127\">\n    2003 N.C.

Even assuming the evidence of defendant's remarks on 19 March 2002 was improperly admitted under these less restrictive standards, defendant is not entitled to a new sentencing proceeding unless he can establish prejudice, that is, a reasonable possibility that a different result would have been reached had the evidence been excluded. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1443(a) (2003). Here, the evidence was offered by the State on the grounds that defendant's statements were a tacit admission that he killed Officer Turner and also to support the submission of the N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2000(e)(8) aggravator. Acknowledging in his brief that the jury had already found in the guilt-innocence phase that defendant had murdered Officer Turner, defendant argues that this evidence was cumulative, used to \"pad\" the State's case and assuage any lingering concerns the jurors may have harbored about defendant's culpability. Defendant also argues that the evidence was not relevant to establish that Officer Turner was carrying out his official duties when shot. However, in light of the other evidence presented in this case, we do not perceive any likelihood that the jury would have reached a different conclusion if it had not heard this evidence. Because we have considered defendant's substantive argument, we need not consider his contention that defense counsel's failure to make a contemporaneous objection constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   These assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendant next argues that one of his defense attorneys made a statement during the sentencing proceeding closing arguments that was contrary to defendant's interests and deprived him of effective assistance of counsel. Defense counsel argued that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   [The prosecutor] came before you and she held up two photographs. And basically what she was saying to you was \"before Quintel Augustine\" and \"after Quintel Augustine.\" Folks, I'll hold up a picture. It's a picture of Quintel praying.

Our review of the record reveals that this argument was consistent with such a trial strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The prosecution offered emotional victim-impact evidence through the testimony of Officer Turner's parents at the sentencing proceeding. Recounting his experience in the hospital the night his son was shot, Mr. Turner said: \"I've never seen him down.... It was hard for me to go in there and see that. And when I ... did get enough nerve to go in, ... I hope no parent have to go in and see they - they child in that type of situation.\" Mr. Turner later told the jury that his \"whole world [has] changed\" and he \"lost a part of [himself]\" since his son's death. Similarly, Mrs. Turner told the jury that \"there's no way ... a person can understand what I'm going through\" and that \"[i]t's heartbreaking. It's - it's a tremendous loss. I feel helpless. I feel - not angry, but I just feel like something has been torn away from me. There's an emptiness here that will never be replaced by anything.\" In advocating for the death penalty, the prosecutor incorporated this evidence into her closing argument when she stated that \"[t]he bullet - the bullets may have killed Roy Turner instantly, meaning taken away his brain functions, but the pain here ... will last forever. The pain of the mom. You heard from her. It's very real.... The pain will last forever for dad....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In arguing that his counsel's response to this victim-impact evidence was improper, we believe defendant both takes his counsel's comment out of context and construes it too literally.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

The record demonstrates that defense counsel was building on the testimony of Officer Turner's family for the purpose of evoking similar sympathy for defendant's family. The focus of counsel's argument was not that defendant would not feel pain if he were executed, but that defendant's parents, like Officer Turner's, would continue to experience the pain of losing a child long after defendant's death. Defense co-counsel's closing argument continued this theme that there had been enough suffering when he also referred to the testimony of Officer Turner's parents, then asked the jury to not \"let two families leave this courtroom with holes that large and deep that never heal.\" Accordingly, defendant has failed to establish that the challenged remark exceeded the wide latitude granted trial counsel in matters of strategy and closing argument.\n   <em>\n    See Fletcher,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"138528\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/354/455/#p482\">\n    354 N.C. at 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=555%20S.E.2d%20534\">\n    555 S.E.2d at 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (strategy);\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219899\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/355/117/#p125\">\n    355 N.C. at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 558 S.E.2d at 105 (closing argument).
