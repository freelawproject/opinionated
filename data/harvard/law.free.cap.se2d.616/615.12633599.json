He was placed on supervised probation for twenty-four months. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State's evidence at trial tended to show that Investigator Scott Houston (Investigator Houston) of the Pamlico County Sheriff's Department was conducting surveillance at the residence of Gloria Midgette (Midgette), a suspected crack cocaine dealer, on 22 November 2002. Around 8:00 or 8:30 p.m., Investigator Houston saw defendant pull his vehicle into Midgette's driveway. Investigator Houston saw Milton Cornell Davis (Davis), whom Houston knew as a drug runner for Midgette, approach defendant's vehicle from Midgette's home. Davis talked briefly with defendant and then walked back to Midgette's home. Davis soon returned to defendant's vehicle, and Davis and defendant drove off together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Investigator Houston followed defendant's vehicle and observed the vehicle cross the center line of the highway twice. Investigator Houston stopped defendant's vehicle. When he looked inside the vehicle, Investigator Houston saw a piece of plastic on the floor between defendant's feet. The piece of plastic was the corner of a plastic bag that had been cut and knotted at the top. Investigator Houston noticed that the bag contained an off-white residue and, based on his six-year history of over 300 arrests, believed it to be cocaine. Investigator Houston asked defendant to step out of the vehicle, and defendant complied. Investigator Houston asked defendant if defendant had any contraband in the vehicle. Defendant replied that he did not. Investigator Houston explicitly asked for defendant's permission to search the vehicle. Defendant agreed to the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Investigator Houston performed a pat-down search of defendant and Davis, and a quick search of defendant's vehicle to retrieve the plastic bag. Defendant stood at the trunk of his vehicle during this time. Probation Officer Larry Collins (Officer Collins) was passing by and witnessed the traffic stop. Officer Collins stopped to offer his assistance and informed Investigator Houston that Davis was on probation and subject to warrantless searches. Officer Collins searched Davis and found a crack-smoking device in Davis's shoe. Investigator Houston asked defendant to sit in Investigator Houston's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Collins informed Investigator Houston that Davis wished to cooperate with law enforcement by showing them where contraband was located in the vehicle. Davis informed Investigator Houston and Officer Collins that cocaine was located between the driver's seat and the console. Investigator Houston then retrieved what appeared to be crack cocaine from the location in defendant's vehicle as specified by Davis. Investigator Houston arrested defendant and charged him with possession of cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State Bureau of Investigation examined the substance found in defendant's vehicle and determined that the substance was 1.1 grams of cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence gathered as a result of the traffic stop on 1 October 2003. The motion was heard and denied prior to trial. A jury convicted defendant on 7 October 2003 for possession of a controlled substance, cocaine. Defendant moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress the evidence obtained from his vehicle during the search. The State counters that because defendant did not object to the admission of the evidence at trial, he has failed to preserve for appellate review all issues related to the evidence found in the search of his vehicle. Our Court has held that a pretrial motion to suppress is a type of motion\n   <em>\n    in limine,\n   </em>\n   and that \"a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   is not sufficient to preserve for appeal the question of admissibility of evidence if [a] defendant does not object to that evidence at the time it is offered at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
