Early without just cause. DSS argues on appeal: (1) that Early was not entitled to file a contested case alleging a lack of just cause, (2) that Early's contested case petition was not timely filed, (3) that this Court should order further proceedings on the just cause claim, and (4) that, in any event, a local governmental employee is not entitled to recover back pay or attorneys' fees. We hold that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over Early's just cause claim and that the contested case was timely. Further, we hold that the issue of just cause has been fully litigated and determined and DSS has offered no justification for additional proceedings or for reversal of the trial court's\n   conclusion that DSS lacked just cause for terminating Early's employment. Finally, because Early prevailed below, we hold that the trial court could properly decide to award her back pay and attorneys' fees. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Marsha Early began work on 3 January 2000 as a Child Support Agent II in the Establishment Unit of the DSS Child Support Department. Her immediate supervisor was Laurie Hasty, who in turn reported to Jerome Brown, the Program Manager. Approximately three months after she began work, on 4 April 2000, Early underwent emergency surgery. Early and her husband called Hasty, notified her why Early would not be reporting to work, and requested leave without pay (\"LWOP\") for the time necessary to recover from the surgery. On 6 April 2000, Early submitted the required paperwork to Hasty. On 17 April 2000, DSS approved LWOP for the period 4 April 2000 through 4 May 2000. Subsequently, Early requested and was granted an extension until 22 May 2000. She received additional time off through 29 May 2000 because of the death of her father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 4 August 2000, Early was involved in a car accident on her way to work. On 17 October 2000, a doctor advised Early that she required back surgery and that she would need approximately eight to twelve weeks to recover from the surgery. Early testified that her doctor gave her the choice of having the surgery on the following day, 18 October 2000, or at a later date of Early's choosing. Early telephoned Hasty, told her of the doctor's diagnosis, and asked Hasty if she would grant Early leave so that she could have the surgery the next day. Hasty replied, \"no problem.\" Based on Hasty's response, Early elected to have the surgery on 18 October 2000. Early testified that she would not have chosen to have the surgery then if Hasty had not verbally approved the leave request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the morning of 18 October 2000, Hasty faxed the appropriate LWOP forms to Early's doctor. Early underwent her surgery on the same day. On 19 October 2000, Early's doctor completed the LWOP forms and Early's husband faxed the forms to three different fax numbers provided by Hasty. On the forms, the doctor indicated that it would be necessary for Early to be absent from work for approximately eight to twelve weeks. On 23 October 2000, Early's husband also hand-delivered the completed forms to Hasty. DSS did not indicate to Early or her husband any problem with the leave request. Based on her doctor's projection, Early anticipated returning to work on 17 January 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In a pleading filed with the Office of Administrative Hearings, DSS stated: \"Although [DSS] initially granted [Early's] LWOP through January 17, [Early's] absence was creating a hardship on the unit such that it was not in the best interest of [DSS] for [Early] to remain on LWOP.\" Approximately one to two weeks after Early's communications with Hasty, Hasty met with Brown to discuss the potential impact of Early's absence. Hasty told Brown that her unit could only handle Early's caseload through 13 December 2000 without there being a hardship on her unit. Brown and Hasty then recommended to DSS' director, Daniel C. Hudgins, that Early's LWOP extend only until 13 December 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Accordingly, on 14 November 2000, Hudgins mailed Early a letter stating that her LWOP would last only until 13 December 2000. Specifically, the letter stated: \"You are on Leave Without Pay due to a medical condition effective October 19, 2000. . . . Since you are not eligible for Family Medical Leave, you will be expected to return to work full-time no later than December 13, 2000. You must bring a Fitness for Duty Statement from your medical doctor indicating that you are able to work with no limitations.\" The letter did not state what would happen if Early was unable to obtain a \"Fitness for Duty Statement\" from her doctor indicating no work limitations as of 13 December 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Early waited to reply to the letter until after her post-operation appointment with her doctor in early December. At that doctor's visit, Early's doctor recommended that she not return to work on 13 December 2000 in order to ensure that her spinal alignment remained intact. The doctor faxed a letter to\n   DSS indicating that Early was still under his care and would be able to return to work on 29 January 2001, but that, after that date, she would have two restrictions lasting for an additional four weeks: (1) no prolonged bending, stooping, standing, or sitting, and (2) no lifting of more than 10 pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On 13 December 2000, Early called Hasty at work and left a message on her voice mail, stating that she was calling to see if Hasty had received the doctor's letter. Hasty returned Early's call that day, confirmed that she had received the doctor's fax, and stated that she was placing it in Early's personnel file. During the course of this conversation with plaintiff, Hasty made no comment suggesting that plaintiff had exhausted her LWOP or that her employment was at risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Nevertheless, on the same day, 13 December 2000, Director Hudgins mailed Early a letter notifying her:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This is a follow-up letter to inform you that your employment with the County of Durham is terminated effective December 13, 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Unless an extension has been approved, any employee who fails to report to work at the expiration of a leave of absence, shall be considered Absent Without Leave (AWOL) and will be separated from the County without notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hudgins also attached a copy of the appeals process at DSS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In accordance with that process, Early submitted a grievance to her immediate supervisor, Hasty, within 15 days of receiving her termination letter. On 22 December 2000, Hasty responded: \"Leave without pay is granted only with the approval of the Department Head and supervisor and is based on the needs of the agency such as workload, need to fill the employee's job, etc. These factors were used in determining that we could only grant your leave without pay request until December 13, 2000.\" Within five days, Early then appealed to Hudgins. Hudgins responded in a letter dated 4 January 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On 19 February 2001, Early filed a contested case petition with the State Office of Administrative Hearings (\"OAH\"), alleging (1) that she was dismissed without just cause contrary to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-35(a) (2003) and (2) that she was discriminated against based on her gender, age, and handicapping condition. An administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") denied DSS' motion to dismiss the petition as untimely after finding that DSS had failed to follow the required procedures outlined in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-23(f) (2003) regarding notification of appeal rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following a two-day hearing, the ALJ rendered an opinion containing 73 findings of fact. Based on those findings, the ALJ (1) dismissed Early's just cause claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that Early lacked sufficient months of service to assert a claim for just cause and (2) concluded that Early had failed to meet her burden of proving intentional discrimination based on gender, age, or handicapping condition. She, therefore, recommended that DSS' decision to discharge Early from employment be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On 4 February 2002, the State Personnel Commission issued an \"Amended Recommendation for Decision to Local Appointing Authority.\" The Commission adopted the ALJ's 73 findings of fact in their entirety with the addition of one sentence relating to Early's just cause claim: \"However, there is no statutory requirement in Chapter 126 that County employees subject to the provision of Chapter 126 work a certain amount of time before becoming entitled to appeal a termination under Chapter 126.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Based on the findings, the Commission reached the same conclusion as the ALJ that Early had failed to prove discrimination based on gender, age, or handicapping condition. With respect to the just cause claim, however, the Commission concluded:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Petitioner was entitled to bring a just cause claim. Based on Petitioner's supervisor's statement to her \"no problem\" when she discussed having the surgery with her on October 17, 2000, it is clear that Petitioner reasonably expected to be able to take sufficient leave to complete the recuperation process from the surgery. Respondent did not have just cause to terminate her employment for failing to return to work on December 13, 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Commission, therefore, recommended that DSS adopt the ALJ's decision regarding Early's claims of discrimination, but that DSS conclude \"that there is jurisdiction for Petitioner's just cause claim and that Respondent's disciplinary action with regard to the Petitioner's employment be reversed for lack of just cause. . . .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Commission further recommended that DSS reinstate Early to her former position or a comparable position with back pay and back benefits. In the event that DSS did reinstate Early, the Commission ordered that Early could petition for attorneys' fees, \"which shall be awarded in any amount to be determined by the Commission upon receipt and consideration of a Petition for Attorneys Fees and the required documentation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On 18 April 2002, DSS issued its opinion, signed by Hudgins, stating that \"[t]he Respondent does not adopt the entire recommendation of the Office of State Personnel. . . .\" DSS specifically rejected only one sentence in the Commission's 73 findings of fact: the sentence that the Commission had added to the ALJ's findings of fact, stating that there was no months-of-service prerequisite to appealing a termination under the State Personnel Act. DSS concluded that OAH lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear Early's just cause claim, but that, even if jurisdiction existed, DSS had just cause to terminate Early. In support of its decision, DSS stated that it was relying upon five specified findings of fact of the ALJ, which it then set forth. DSS did not mention the remaining findings of fact of the ALJ and the State Personnel Commission. DSS made a \"final decision\" that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Petitioner failed to meet her burden with regards to the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (i) that the Respondent discriminated against her;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (ii) that the Court had jurisdiction to consider her dismissal for just cause;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (iii) that Respondent lacked just cause for her dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   DSS, therefore, affirmed the decision to discharge Early from employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On 29 May 2002, Early filed a petition for judicial review in Wake County Superior Court. On 11 July 2002, Judge Evelyn Werth Hill filed an order, concluding that the reasons given by DSS for not adopting the entire recommendation of the Commission were without merit; that Early's discharge was not supported by substantial evidence; that her discharge was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion; that DSS did not have just cause to terminate Early's employment; and that OAH had subject matter jurisdiction to hear Early's just cause claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Hill ordered DSS to reinstate Early into her former position or a comparable position and awarded her back pay and benefits and attorneys' fees. DSS appeals to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On appeal, DSS contends that the trial court and this Court lack subject matter jurisdiction for two reasons: (1) Early was not entitled to file a contested case based on a lack of just cause, and (2) Early did not timely file her contested case. We disagree as to each contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Local Government Employees and Just Cause\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The State Personnel Act (\"the SPA\"), Chapter 126 of the North Carolina General Statutes, describes in detail the procedures that state and certain local government employees may use to appeal personnel decisions. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-5 (2003) specifies the employees to whom the SPA applies:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (a) The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (1) All State employees not herein exempt, and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (2) All employees of the following local entities:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   a. Area mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    b. Local social services departments.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   c. County health departments and district health departments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   d. Local emergency management agencies that receive federal grant-in-aid funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Early, being an employee of DSS, a local social services department, falls under \u00a7 126-5(a)(2)(b) and, therefore, \"[t]he provisions of\" the SPA - Chapter 126 - apply to her. DSS contends nonetheless that those provisions of the SPA that allow an employee to file a contested case alleging that his or her termination of employment lacked just cause should not apply to Early. Specifically, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-34.1 (2003) provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (a) A State employee or former State employee may file in the Office of Administrative Hearings a contested case under Article 3 of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes only as to the following personnel actions or issues:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (1) Dismissal, demotion, or suspension without pay based upon an alleged violation of G.S. 126-35, if the employee is a career State employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-35(a) in turn provides: \"No career State employee subject to the State Personnel Act shall be discharged, suspended, or demoted for disciplinary reasons, except for just cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   DSS does not dispute that N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-35(a) applies to the local employees specified in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-5(a)(2) even though \u00a7 126-35(a) refers only to State employees or former State employees. It argues, however, that in order for \u00a7 126-34.1(a)(1) to apply to a local employee, that employee must meet the same months-of-service requirement that any state employee must meet in order to become a \"career State employee.\" The SPA defines a \"career State employee\" as \"a State employee who: (1)[i]s in a permanent position appointment; and (2)[h]as been continuously employed by the State of North Carolina in a position subject to the State Personnel Act for the immediate 24 preceding months.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-1.1 (2003). DSS argues that since plaintiff has worked for DSS for less than 24 months, she is not entitled to the benefit of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 126-34.1(a) and 126-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   DSS' argument, however, overlooks N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-5's provisions regarding the scope of the SPA's coverage. As indicated above, with respect to State employees, \u00a7 126-5(a)(1) specifies that the provisions of Chapter 126 apply to \"[a]ll State employees not herein exempt.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 126-5(c), (c1), (c2), (c3), (c7), and (c8) then specifically exempt certain categories of State employees from coverage under various portions of the SPA. In other words, \u00a7 126-5 specifies certain classes of State employees and identifies what portions of the SPA, if any, apply with respect to each class. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-5(c)(1) specifically exempts \"[a] State employee who is not a career State employee as defined by this Chapter\" from the SPA, with the exception of \"the policies, rules, and plans\" established by the State Personnel Commission pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 126-4(1)-(6) (2003) and 126-7 (2003) and with the exception of \"the provisions of Articles 6 and 7 of this Chapter,\" relating to equal opportunity for employment and compensation and the privacy of state employee personnel records. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-35, the just cause provision, falls within Article 8 - an Article not included within the list of those portions of the SPA applicable to non-career State employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   By contrast, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-5(a)(2) asserts that the provisions of the SPA \"shall apply to . . . (2) All employees of the following local entities,\" including local social services departments. It does not include any qualification of the \"[a]ll employees\" language comparable to the \"not herein exempt\" limiting language used for State employees. Further, none of the exemptions set out in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-5 refer to any local government employees. We are, therefore, left with the statute's specification that \"[t]he provisions of this Chapter [126] shall apply to . . . [a]ll employees of the following local entities\" without any express limitation. The language of \u00a7 126-5(a)(2) is straightforward in subjecting\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   employees of certain types of local entities to the provisions of the SPA. The language of the statute, moreover, does not suggest that these local employees are state employees, but only that the provisions of the SPA apply to them as well as to state employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   DSS appears to be arguing that this Court should craft what amounts to a new sub-categorization of local government employees included in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-5(a)(2)'s list based on the categorization of State employees in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-1.1. According to DSS' proposal, the class of local employees in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-5(a)(2) would be subdivided into \"career local employees\" and \"non-career local employees,\" in the same way that State employees are categorized.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The selection by the General Assembly of 24 months as the necessary length of service to be a career employee required the weighing of policy considerations involving State government needs and State employee interests. We have identified no expression of intent by the General Assembly to differentiate among local government employees in the same manner that it chose to differentiate among State employees. Nor may this Court engage in policymaking, as defendant requests, and, on our initiative, decide that it would be appropriate to superimpose this structure on local government employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We note that the Office of State Personnel, in its regulations, has not adopted such an approach. Instead, the applicable regulations divide local employees into the following categories: permanent, probationary, trainee, time-limited, temporary, pre-vocational student, or emergency employees. 25 N.C. Admin. Code 1I.2002 (2005). The regulations then provide, with respect to local government employees, that \"[a]ny employee, regardless of occupation, position, or profession may be warned, demoted, suspended or dismissed by the appointing authority. Such actions may be taken against employees with permanent status, as defined in 25 NCAC 1I.2002[c], only for just cause.\" 25 N.C. Admin. Code 1I.2301(a) (2005). \"A permanent appointment is an appointment to a permanently established position when the incumbent is expected to be retained on a permanent basis.\" 25 N.C. Admin. Code 1I.2002(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In short, under the Office of State Personnel regulations, the applicability of the just cause requirement to local government employees is determined by the permanency of employment and not by months of service. This Court has previously looked to these regulations for assistance in construing the SPA, including N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-35.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Steeves v.

DSS requests: \"[I]f this Court concludes that there is jurisdiction to hear this case, this matter should be remanded back to the OAH for the receipt of evidence and the preparation of findings of fact[ ], conclusions of law and a recommended decision on the issue of whether there was just cause to terminate the Petitioner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Contrary to DSS' contention, the trial court not only appropriately considered the issue of just cause; it was, in fact, required to do so. The decision being reviewed by the trial court was not the ALJ's decision, but rather DSS' final decision. DSS specifically decided that \"even if the Office of Administrative Hearings had subject matter jurisdiction to hear Petitioner's just cause claim, there was just cause to terminate Petitioner.\" DSS then recited the five findings of fact of the State Personnel Commission upon which it relied in support of this conclusion. In a section of the decision entitled \"Final Decision,\" DSS stated \"[t]he Petitioner failed to meet her burden with regards to the following: . . . (iii) that Respondent lacked just cause for her dismissal.\" Since Early specifically challenged this determination in its petition for judicial review, the issue was squarely before the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Further, there is no need to remand for a new evidentiary hearing, additional findings of fact and conclusions of law, or a recommended decision. DSS does not argue that it was in any way prevented from fully litigating the issue of just cause before\n   the ALJ and does not explain why additional evidence is necessary. Moreover, the State Personnel Commission disagreed with the ALJ on the jurisdictional question and, therefore, actually made findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding just cause. It then submitted an advisory opinion to DSS on that issue. The State Personnel Commission was not, of course, bound by the ALJ's findings or conclusions:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \"It is well established that an agency has the ability to reject the recommended decision of an administrative law judge. . . . Even though the administrative law judge ha[s] already made findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Personnel Commission ha[s] the ability to make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law if it cho[oses] to do so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    Eury v.

Here, the State Personnel Commission adopted the ALJ's findings of fact and reiterated them as its own, but then concluded that those facts did not establish just cause - an issue that was a question of law, as\n   <em>\n    Carroll\n   </em>\n   indicates. The trial court then agreed with the State Personnel Commission's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   As Early points out, nowhere in its brief on appeal does DSS present any argument that the trial court erred in deciding as a matter of law that the conduct set forth in the State Personnel Commission's findings of fact did not amount to just cause or that those findings of fact - which have not been specifically rejected by DSS at any time - were incorrect. Further, DSS does not attempt to defend its own determination regarding whether just cause existed by explaining to the Court why the findings of fact upon which it relied were sufficient to establish just cause. While DSS contended in oral argument that it had just cause, we are precluded from addressing this issue since its brief contained no such argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.R.App. P. 28(a) (\"Review is limited to questions so presented in the several briefs. Questions raised by assignments of error in appeals from trial tribunals but not then presented and discussed in a party's brief, are deemed abandoned.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   DSS does, in requesting a remand to OAH, state generally in its brief that \"[t]here was conflicting evidence on the issue of just cause.\" DSS, however, had the opportunity in its final decision to resolve any conflict in the evidence by rejecting the State Personnel Commission's findings of fact and making its own findings based on the record. It chose not to do so and instead relied, in support of its determination that Early's dismissal was supported by just cause, on only five findings of fact of the State Personnel Commission. Four of those findings relate only to the fact that Early was notified that she was fired and that her termination was then upheld through the appeal process, while the fifth relates to a meeting that occurred within DSS one to two weeks after Early's surgery and does not address (1) what DSS told Early, (2) whether Early reasonably believed that her request for leave had been granted, or (3) DSS' acknowledgment before OAH that the leave had originally been granted through 17 January 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   DSS does not make any argument on appeal that these findings of fact establish just cause. DSS' brief, in fact, cites no authority suggesting that it had just cause to terminate Early or that it should be given an opportunity to supplement its existing findings of fact. Under Rule 28(b)(6) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure, \"[a]ssignments of error . . . in support of which no reason or argument is stated or authority cited, will be taken as abandoned.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   While it might be tempting to address the question whether DSS had just cause to terminate Early, our Supreme Court has recently held: \"It is not the role of the appellate courts, however, to create an appeal for an appellant. As this case illustrates, the Rules of Appellate Procedure must be consistently applied; otherwise, the Rules become meaningless, and an appellee is left without notice of the basis upon which an appellate court might rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Viar v.

We, therefore, uphold the trial court's reversal of\n   DSS' decision that it possessed just cause to terminate Early.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Back Pay and Attorneys' Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   DSS' final assignment of error pertains to the trial court's award of back pay and attorneys' fees. In addition to reiterating its contention that a local government employee is not entitled to challenge her termination based on a lack of just cause, an argument rejected above, DSS also contends \"that it was never the intention of the legislature to award back pay and attorney's fees to local DSS employees.\" DSS further argues: \"[The] ALJ and the [State Personnel] Commission render advisory opinions. Neither they, nor Superior Court Judges have the authority to award back pay and attorney fees to local government employees pursuant to N.C.G.S. Chapter 126 or the North Carolina Administrative Code.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As DSS notes, any decision by the State Personnel Commission regarding back pay and attorneys' fees was advisory with respect to DSS. The trial court was required to review DSS' decision to reject that recommendation under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-51. While DSS presents arguments regarding the Commission's lack of authority to require a \"local appointing authority\" to pay back pay or attorneys' fees, it does not cite any authority for its contention that the \"the state cannot order when the County should compensate an employee for back pay and/or attorney fees.\" To the contrary, our courts have long held that \"counties[] make up the state and are, literally, the state itself. . . .

The General Assembly may, therefore, decide when a county may be sued and when it may be required to pay back pay and attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   With respect to back pay, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-37 provides the best indication whether the General Assembly intended for employees of \"local appointing authorit[ies]\" to be treated like State employees and be able to seek back pay upon prevailing in a claim under the SPA. Subsection (c) of that statute states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   If the local appointing authority is other than a board of county commissioners, the local appointing authority must give the county notice of the appeal taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. Notice must be given to the county manager or the chairman of the board of county commissioners by certified mail within 15 days of the receipt of the notice of appeal. The county may intervene in the appeal within 30 days of receipt of the notice. If the action is appealed to superior court the county may intervene in the superior court proceeding even if it has not intervened in the administrative proceeding.\n   <em>\n    The decision of the superior court shall be binding on the county even if the county does not intervene.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-37(c) (emphasis added). A major reason that a county would need to be informed and to have the opportunity to intervene is if a monetary award could be entered that would be paid from the county's coffers. There would also be little need for the provision making the superior court's decision binding on the county in the absence of the possibility of a monetary award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Indeed, this Court has held that a county is an aggrieved party under the Administrative Procedure Act for purposes of appealing to superior court an award of back wages and attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    In re Appeal of Brunswick County,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8523258\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/81/391/#p396\">\n    81 N.C.App. 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 396,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=344%20S.E.2d%20584\">\n    344 S.E.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 587 (1986).

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-36(c)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Because DSS presents no other argument as to why local government employees found to have been wrongfully discharged should not have the traditional back pay remedy available to them like other employees covered by the SPA, we hold that the trial court\n   properly considered whether DSS' decision to reject the State Personnel Commission's recommendation of back pay should be reversed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   25 N.C. Admin. Code 1B.0421 (2005) (discussing the State Personnel Commission's ability to award back pay and setting out a method for calculating it).

Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's determination that Early should receive back pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   With respect to attorneys' fees, DSS' contention that the trial court had no authority to award attorneys' fees disregards N.C.
