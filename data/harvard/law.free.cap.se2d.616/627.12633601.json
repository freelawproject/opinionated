Keeter,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8555510\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/42/642/#p644\">\n    42 N.C.App. 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 644-45,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=257%20S.E.2d%20480\">\n    257 S.E.2d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482 (1979). In this case, Juvenile contends that the evidence presented was insufficient to support his convictions of common law robbery and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to inflict serious injury based on an aiding and abetting theory. Because the record shows that Juvenile rendered no assistance to the perpetrator of the crime and instead assisted the victim, we reverse the trial court's adjudication and disposition orders with respect to the common law robbery charge. Furthermore, because the Juvenile Petition lists a nonexistent offense - assault with a deadly weapon with intent to inflict serious injury - we must vacate the trial court's orders on that nonexisting offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The evidence at the hearing tended to show that: On 11 November 2003, Juvenile and two older friends, G.G. and R.C., were walking home with three pit bull dogs. Each person walked one of the dogs on a leash. On the way home they passed Fernando \"Louis\" Gonzales standing outside his place of work talking on a cell phone. According to Mr. Gonzales, the three males walked passed him and immediately returned. Mr. Gonzales testified that the three males were dark-skinned and approximately fifteen, seventeen, and nineteen years of age, but he never identified Juvenile as one of the three males.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   R.C. asked Mr. Gonzales if he could use his cell phone. Mr. Gonzales said \"no,\" but told him they could use the office phone inside. Mr. Gonzales testified that the \"one that looked younger\" hit him in the face. Mr. Gonzales testified that another of the men hit him in the face and let go of the two dogs he was holding and the dogs started biting his feet. After he was knocked to the ground, Mr. Gonzales testified that one of the men was hitting him and two of the dogs were biting him. One man then tried to get the dogs off him. He testified that one of the men went through his pockets and took eighty dollars and a necklace. Mr. Gonzales required several stitches for his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Juvenile testified that after they saw Mr. Gonzales across the street, G.G. said to R.C. \"My pockets are feeling empty.\" The three then crossed the street, and R.C. asked Mr. Gonzales to use his cell phone. Mr. Gonzales called R.C. a \"punta,\" and then R.C. hit Mr. Gonzales. After R.C. and Mr. Gonzales started fighting, R.C. let go of the dog's leash he was holding. The dog attacked Mr. Gonzales. G.G. said to Mr. Gonzales \"Why you hit my brother?\" and then pushed him down. At this point, the dog G.G. was holding also got loose. R.C. was kicking Mr. Gonzales, and a dog started shaking Mr. Gonzales's pant leg and then grabbed Mr. Gonzales by the shoulder. Juvenile kicked the dog to get it off of Mr. Gonzales. Juvenile continued to hold the leash of the third dog. Juvenile observed G.G. grab Mr. Gonzales's coveralls, but testified that he did not know G.G. had taken money until the next day. In an earlier statement, Juvenile stated that G.G. ripped open Mr. Gonzales's coverall suit and reached into his pocket and got nineteen dollars in cash. Juvenile then ran home and R.C. and G.G. followed him. R.C. asked Juvenile's guardian if he could leave one of the dogs there, and she allowed that. R.C., G.G., and Juvenile then went to Bojangles where G.G. gave Juvenile one dollar to get food.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the close of both the State's evidence and all evidence, Juvenile made a motion to\n   dismiss for insufficiency of the evidence; both motions were denied. The trial court adjudicated Juvenile delinquent on the charges of common law robbery and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to inflict serious injury. Juvenile was placed on probation for twelve months along with the conditions of curfew, community service, restitution, and a mental health assessment. Juvenile appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, Juvenile first asserts that the trial court erred by denying his motions to dismiss the common law robbery petition, alleging that there was insufficient evidence that he aided and abetted the alleged robbery. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When reviewing a motion to dismiss, we view \"the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, giving the State the benefit of all reasonable inferences.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
