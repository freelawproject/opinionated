While in the courtroom, defendant became upset with the courtroom staff. The trial judge asked defendant to leave the courtroom and return when he calmed down. Instead, defendant walked out of the courtroom and away from the courthouse, heading north on U.S. Highway 13 from Hertford County toward Gates County. At about 10:30 a.m., Trooper Jason Jones of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol, was patrolling U.S. Highway 13 near Winton, North Carolina, when he saw defendant. Thinking defendant may have had car trouble, Trooper Jones asked defendant if he needed help. Defendant, who was holding a Bible, responded by asking Trooper Jones whether he knew \"the Lord?\" Trooper Jones responded, \"Yes\" and again asked defendant if he needed any help. Defendant said, \"No\" and Trooper Jones left. Defendant was not aggressive, nor did he appear to be angry or frightened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Later that morning at 11:45 a.m., Trooper Michael Warren saw defendant walking down U.S. Highway 13. Defendant motioned for Trooper Warren to pull over and he did so. Trooper Warren asked defendant his name and where he was going. Defendant asked Trooper Warren for a ride but did not indicate where he wanted to go. Trooper Warren then pulled away, heading north on U.S. Highway 13 and observed defendant also continue walking north.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At about noon that same day, Penny Atkins Rose was driving north on U.S. Highway 13. After crossing the bridge at Winton, Rose saw Abraham Boone at the side of the road on his hands and knees. He was missing one shoe and was not wearing a hat or glasses. She stopped and called 911 for assistance. She attempted to talk to him, but failed to understand Boone's responses as \"he seemed to slip into unconsciousness.\" Rose returned to her car and, concerned for Boone's survival, again called for assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Alice Sharpe, who was also driving by, realized there was an emergency and stopped to help. By that time, Boone was completely unconscious. Emergency personnel\n   testified Boone had no pulse and was not breathing by the time he arrived at the hospital. Medical testimony revealed Boone died as a result of a heart attack and that the scrapes and abrasions on Boone were consistent with a confrontation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Isaiah Harrell testified that on the afternoon of 6 September 2000 while at a stop sign his car was hit in the rear end by defendant. Defendant jumped out of the car he was driving, opened Harrell's door, hit Harrell in the stomach and pulled him out of his car. Defendant then got in Harrell's car and sped off, leaving Harrell standing in the intersection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Deputy Tim Lassiter, of the Hertford County Sheriff's Department received a call reporting a car jacking at about noon on 6 September 2000. Meanwhile, officers from the Ahoskie Police Department were chasing defendant who was driving recklessly at a high rate of speed. Deputy Lassiter saw defendant turn his car and crash directly into the vehicle of Deputy Mike Stephenson also of the Hertford County Sheriff's Department. After struggling with several officers, defendant was arrested and taken into custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Later that afternoon, defendant spent approximately half an hour giving a detailed statement to law enforcement officials. Defendant said he recalled seeing Troopers Jones and Warren, stating he thought at the time they were going to kill him. He also recalled flagging down Boone, pulling him out of the car and then driving off, leaving Boone \"beside the road laying down.\" He remembered observing that the car he had stolen from Boone was \"hot\" and wanting to get rid of it. Finally, he recounted taking Harrell's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant was served with warrants issued 6 September 2000 charging him with common law robbery and first-degree (felony) murder of Boone. Defendant was later indicted for one count of felony murder and one count of armed robbery as to Boone. Defendant was not charged with any offenses as to Harrell. On 18 September 2000, Gates County District Court Judge Carlton Cole issued an order for a forensic screening examination of defendant over defense counsel's objection. Three days later, on 21 September 2000, Ms. Chamberlee Trowell, forensic screening examiner and Licensed Psychologist Associate (L.P.A.), found defendant incapable of proceeding to trial, noting defendant \"would not cooperate\" during the assessment and was \"noncompliant with treatment and . . . medications\" for his previously diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia. In a report dated 28 May 2001, Dr. Hilkey, a forensic psychologist, indicated defendant was competent to stand trial after having interviewed him on 24 January and again on 21 March 2001. On 11 February 2002, defendant's motion for a pre-trial hearing to determine mental retardation came on for hearing in Chowan County\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Superior Court Judge J. Richard Parker ruled on defendant's motion and, on 18 February 2002, ordered the case tried as noncapital, finding defendant to be mentally retarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thereafter, defendant was evaluated by Dr. James G. Groce, a forensic psychiatrist who, in a report dated 18 June 2002, found defendant capable of proceeding to trial. Defendant was again examined on 2 July 2002 by Dr. Hilkey, who concluded defendant operated under a delusional belief system on the date of the offenses, but deferred assessment of his competency to stand trial until a date closer to trial. The day before trial on 4 August 2002, Dr. Hilkey evaluated defendant and reported \"despite defendant's apparent competency to proceed [to trial], he remains fixed in his delusional belief system.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant's first trial, held on 5 August 2002 in Gates County Superior Court before Judge Jerry Tillett, ended in a mistrial when the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The case was retried on 21 January 2003, before Judge J. Richard Parker. On 28 January 2003, the jury found defendant guilty of first-degree (felony) murder and armed robbery. The trial court sentenced\n   defendant to life in prison without parole on the first-degree (felony) murder conviction, and to a concurrent sentence of 100 to 129 months on the armed robbery conviction. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant raises five issues on appeal: (I) whether the trial court was required to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   grant defendant a competency hearing at trial; (II) whether the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict on the issue of insanity; (III) whether the trial court erred by denying defendant's request for jury instructions on diminished capacity; (IV) whether the trial court erred by instructing the jury that defendant's use of hands constituted armed robbery; and (V) whether the trial court failed to arrest judgment on the underlying armed robbery conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant asserts the trial court was required to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   grant defendant a competency hearing; that the trial court in fact had a constitutional duty to conduct a competency hearing during his January 2003 trial. We disagree. In reviewing the evidence before the trial court of defendant's competency and the applicable law, we are persuaded the trial court was not required to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   conduct a competency hearing, and therefore, did not err in failing to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1001:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (a) No person may be tried, convicted, sentenced, or punished for a crime when by reason of mental illness or defect he is unable to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to comprehend his own situation in reference to the proceedings, or to assist in his defense in a rational or reasonable manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1001 (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The question of capacity may be raised at any time by motion of the prosecutor, the defendant or defense counsel, or the court. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1002(a) (2003). Once a defendant's capacity to stand trial is questioned, the trial court must hold a hearing pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1002(b) (2003). \"A defendant has the burden of proof to show incapacity or that he is not competent to stand trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

When defense counsel informed the trial court defendant would be testifying, the trial court on\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   conducted a colloquy concerning the voluntariness of defendant's testimony and defendant's understanding of possible outcomes:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   THE COURT: Have you got some witnesses here to testify?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: Yes, sir, Your Honor, and before we proceed any further . . .

Mr. Staten, you have talked to your attorney concerning the question of whether or not you should testify or not [sic] in this case?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Staten: Yes sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: And you understand that if you do testify the State can ask you a lot of questions on cross-examination about your prior record and things of that nature?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mr. Staten: Yes sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: And you understand that may sway the jury somewhat?

You want to do it again today?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Mr. Staten: Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   THE COURT: All right. I just want you to understand what the consequences are of your decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Mr. Staten: Thank you.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   During the colloquy, defendant's replies were lucid and responsive, demonstrating his desire to testify and displaying his understanding of the consequences of doing so. In fact, such inquiry and response between the trial court and defendant are in the very nature of a competency hearing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., State v. Gates,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8523438\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/65/277/#p283\">\n    65 N.C.App. 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 282,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20S.E.2d%20498\">\n    309 S.E.2d 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 502 (1983) (Noting \"although [N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1002 (b)(3)] requires the court to conduct a hearing when a question is raised as to a defendant's capacity to stand trial no particular procedure is mandated. The method of inquiry is still largely within the\n   discretion of the court.\"). However, we refrain from making a determination of whether such a colloquy between the trial court and defendant was sufficient to conform to the type of competency hearing anticipated under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1002(b)(3), as the arguments in the briefs of the State and defendant appear to assume no competency hearing was held by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Therefore, our inquiry centers on whether constitutional due process required the trial court to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   conduct a competency hearing in this case. In considering this inquiry we acknowledge there are many cases which discuss capacity to proceed to trial, and note the dual nature courts face: on the one hand \"our Supreme Court has recognized that a defendant may waive the benefit of statutory constitutional provisions by express consent, failure to assert it in apt time, or by conduct inconsistent with a purpose to insist upon it.\"\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   at 567,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=231%20S.E.2d%20577\">\n    231 S.E.2d at 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted). On the other hand our Supreme Court \"has also recognized that a trial court has a constitutional duty to institute,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte,\n   </em>\n   a competency hearing\n   <em>\n    if there is substantial evidence before the court\n   </em>\n   indicating that the accused may be mentally incompetent.\"\n   <em>\n    Snipes\n   </em>\n   at ___,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=608%20S.E.2d%20381\">\n    608 S.E.2d at 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In the instant case, evidence before the trial court was not so substantial as to indicate defendant was mentally incompetent. Throughout the trial proceedings, defendant acted in a manner exhibiting competence. In his testimony he recounted in chronological order the events leading to Boone's death. He gave rational, responsive answers to questions during direct and cross examination and was able to recall and describe events in detail. In response to the trial court's request to \"simply answer counsel's questions\" defendant \"apologize[d] for [his] lengthy responses as [he was] only trying to explain.\" Although sometimes a bit bizarre, defendant's testimony for the most part was coherent and displayed defendant's understanding of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Nevertheless, defendant argues his \"psychotic testimony\" and mental health history raised a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   doubt, as was found in\n   <em>\n    McRae I,\n   </em>\n   such that he is entitled to a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See McRae I.\n   </em>\n   Based on the reasoning and result of\n   <em>\n    McRae I,\n   </em>\n   defendant would be entitled at most to an RCH, not a new trial. In\n   <em>\n    McRae I,\n   </em>\n   the defendant was deemed competent to stand trial after undergoing at least six psychiatric evaluations and three competency hearings, all finding him incompetent. A mistrial resulted when the jury was unable to reach a verdict. McRae was retried immediately, and even though he underwent a psychiatric evaluation between the two trials, the trial court did not conduct another competency hearing prior to the second trial.
