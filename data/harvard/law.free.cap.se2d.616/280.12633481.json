Judgment was arrested as to the six counts of lewd and lascivious conduct with a minor. Defendant appeals from judgment imposing two consecutive sentences of not less than 192 months and not more than 240 months of imprisonment and a third consecutive sentence of not less than 125 months and not more than 159 months of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The evidence at defendant's trial tended to show that KG, a ten-year-old child, lived in Fremont, North Carolina in the same neighborhood as defendant, his wife, and her three children from previous marriages. KM, the youngest of defendant's stepchildren, was eight years old at the time of the alleged events, and she was \"good friends\" with KG. KG testified that she spent one night every other weekend at defendant's house between December, 2002 and March, 2003. In March, KG told another friend on the school bus that defendant had touched her inappropriately, and the friend informed a teacher at KG's school. The teacher contacted the school social worker, who notified the Wayne County Department of Social Services (DSS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Roseanne Diorio, a social worker with DSS, interviewed defendant at his house with his wife present. Defendant said that KG followed him around, wrote him love letters, and always wanted to sit in his lap. He said she did not have a father figure in her life, and he believed she wanted him to play that role. He said KG had made such accusations before, but when he and his wife talked to her about it, she admitted she had lied. He denied all allegations of inappropriate activity. Ms. Diorio also interviewed defendant's wife and her two oldest children, each of whom stated that KG constantly followed defendant around and wrote him love letters. They said KG also wrote love letters to defendant's stepson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial, KG testified that the second time she visited KM's home, defendant called her into the living room, put his hand down the front of her shirt, and touched her chest through her clothes. The following weekend, when she visited defendant's home again, she testified that \"[h]e done the same thing. He went down my shirt again.\" That same weekend, KG said she and KM were playing in KM's room when defendant walked in and told KM to go talk to her mother. After KM left the room, KG said defendant \"was about to pull my pants down,\" but he heard KM coming back so he stopped. KG said defendant's hands \"almost\" went inside her pants. Later, she testified that on that occasion he did actually touch her \"private\" with his hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On \"another weekend,\" defendant told KG to go into the bathroom. Once there, KG testified defendant was \"pull[ing] my pants down and trying to lick it, but he heard [KM] coming so he didn't get a chance to lick it.\" Later she testified defendant did actually \"lick[] it\" while they were in the bathroom. She also testified that one night, she and KM were sleeping on the living room floor. KM was asleep, but KG woke up and heard defendant walking into the living room. He came over to her and pulled her pants down to her knees. Then, according to KG, he \"touched me in the inside.\" KG testified that defendant had touched her vagina with his hand \"[l]ike four times\" and with his mouth \"[a]bout maybe two times.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   KG also testified that she touched defendant's penis on two occasions. Once, KG said she was sitting on the couch when defendant \"sat down next to me and ... took my hand and put it down his pants,\" touching his \"private.\" Another time in KM's bedroom,\n   defendant \"just took my hand and put it down his pants and he told me to squeeze.\" In all, KG said she had seen defendant's penis \"[a]bout six times.\" When asked if she could say when any of the acts described occurred, KG could only say they happened during the time she was spending the night with KM between December and March.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Detective Tammy Odom of the Wayne County Sheriff's Department investigated the allegations against defendant. During an interview with KG, Detective Odom wrote out a statement for KG in which KG said that on one occasion, defendant \"reached up and put his hand down my shirt and inside my bra. He started feeling of my chest.\" KG stated that on another occasion, defendant \"stuck his hand down my pants and rubbed my private part. He did this for about a minute. After that he pulled his private part out. He grabbed my hand and put it on his private part. He told me to squeeze it.\" She also stated that the following morning defendant \"pulled my sweat pants down and my panties. He was bending down to lick my privates when [KM] walked in.\" In all, KG said in her statement, defendant \"touched my private part about six times and he has licked my private part about six times. He has made me touch and squeeze his private part about four times ... [and he] touched my chest one time....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Detective Odom also interviewed defendant regarding the allegations. Defendant gave a statement, written by Detective Odom and signed and initialed by defendant, in which he said, in pertinent part,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While [KG] was spending the night on three different times I pulled the head of my penis out and [KG] squeezed it. On three different times I touched [KG] on her vagina, on the inside of her clothes, with my fingers. One of these times I stuck my fingers inside of her vagina because she told me to. I tried to stop once and she wouldn't let me. This happened one time in the living room, one time in [KM]'s room, and one time in the children's bathroom. I have licked [KG]'s vagina three times. This has happened once in the living room, one time in [KM]'s room, and one time in the children's bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant was subsequently arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While defendant was in jail, Roseanne Diorio interviewed him a second time regarding the allegations. Defendant claimed that Detective Odom tricked him into confessing and had \"mixed his words up.\" He stated, however, that KG had once \"tried to stick her hands down his pants to touch his penis.\" On another occasion, he said, KG \"called him into the bathroom and when he got in there she had her pants and underwear pulled down to her knees.\" When Ms. Diorio asked if he had ever performed oral sex on KG, he stated that \"it had only happened once and he was really sorry about it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant was charged, in true bills of indictment, with eleven counts of first-degree sexual offense, two counts of attempted first-degree sexual offense, ten counts of taking indecent liberties with a minor, and ten counts of lewd and lascivious conduct with a minor. A jury found him guilty of six counts of first-degree sexual offense, two counts of attempted first-degree sexual offense, seven counts of taking indecent liberties with a minor, and six counts of lewd and lascivious conduct. Judgment was arrested on the six counts of lewd and lascivious conduct. The remaining convictions were consolidated into three judgments for which defendant received two consecutive sentences of not less than 192 months and not more than 240 months of imprisonment and a third consecutive sentence of not less than 125 months and not more than 159 months of imprisonment. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant makes the following arguments on appeal: (1) the trial court erred in allowing the State to ask KG leading questions on direct examination; (2) the trial court committed plain error by not dismissing one of the jurors when she disclosed during trial she knew one of the witnesses for the State; (3) the trial court erred by \"denying the defendant's motion to dismiss all or some of the charges against him at the close of the State's evidence and at the close of all the evidence, due to the insufficiency of the evidence;\" (4) the trial court committed plain\n   error by not distinguishing for the jury the charges against the defendant, thereby denying the defendant a unanimous jury verdict; and (5) the trial court committed plain error by entering judgments and other dispositions which were inconsistent with the court's rulings and the jury's verdicts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We first address whether or not the trial court erred by allowing the State to ask KG leading questions on direct examination. Although leading questions are not generally admitted on direct examination, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 611(c) (2003), \"[i]t is within the discretionary power of the trial court to allow leading questions on direct examination, and rulings on the use of such questions are reversible only for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Dalton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8520196\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/96/65/#p70\">\n    96 N.C.App. 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 70,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=384%20S.E.2d%20573\">\n    384 S.E.2d 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576 (1989) (citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Riddick,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4718276\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/315/749/\">\n    315 N.C. 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20S.E.2d%2055\">\n    340 S.E.2d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986)). It is well settled that where \"the witness has difficulty in understanding the question because of age or immaturity or where inquiry is made into a subject of delicate nature such as sexual matters, leading questions are necessary to develop the witness's testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Oliver,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12169578\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/85/1/#p9\">\n    85 N.C.App. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=354%20S.E.2d%20527\">\n    354 S.E.2d 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 532,\n   <em>\n    disc. rev. denied,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4729670,4730118,4726092,4725548,4724635\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/320/174/\">\n    320 N.C. 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=358%20S.E.2d%2064\">\n    358 S.E.2d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987);\n   <em>\n    see also State v. Wilson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2517775\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/322/91/#p96\">\n    322 N.C. 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=366%20S.E.2d%20701\">\n    366 S.E.2d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 704 (1988). In\n   <em>\n    Dalton,\n   </em>\n   this Court found no abuse of discretion where the prosecuting witness was fifteen years old at the time of trial, and her testimony \"pertained to sexual matters of a delicate, sensitive, and embarrassing nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Dalton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8520196\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/96/65/#p70\">\n    96 N.C.App. at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=384%20S.E.2d%20573\">\n    384 S.E.2d at 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, KG was eleven years old at the time of trial, four years younger than the witness in\n   <em>\n    Dalton,\n   </em>\n   and her testimony similarly dealt with sexual matters of a delicate nature. Furthermore, the record indicates the State did not ask leading questions throughout its examination of KG, but only where KG was hesitant to answer. We therefore find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in allowing the State to ask KG leading questions on direct examination. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant's next argument is that the trial court committed plain error by not dismissing a juror when she disclosed, during trial, that she knew one of the witnesses for the State. During the State's evidence, Juror Three sent a note to the trial court saying she had known Roseanne Diorio in high school and college. Ms. Diorio married since that time, and the juror did not recognize her new name during jury selection. The juror stated in her note that she would \"continue to be fair to both sides as my obligation as a juror.\" The trial court then questioned the juror as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: ... Do you, in fact, feel like that friendship would have any bearing on your ability to be fair and impartial in this matter?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   JUROR: No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   THE COURT: You just felt like that was your obligation to let us know, is that right?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   JUROR: Yes, because I didn't recognize the name due to her getting married.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   THE COURT: Does the counsel for either side have any questions for this juror?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   MR. GURLEY [counsel for defendant]: I do not, your honor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   MS. KABLER [counsel for the State]: No, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1212 sets forth reasons for which a party may challenge a juror for cause, including when a juror \"is unable to render a fair and impartial verdict.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1212(9) (2003). Defendant failed to challenge Juror Three upon her disclosure at trial; therefore, he has not preserved this assignment of error for review. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1211(c);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   N.C. R.App. P. 10(b)(1) (2003) (stating that \"[i]n order to preserve a question for appellate review, a party must have presented to the trial court a timely request, objection or motion, stating the specific grounds for the ruling the party desired the court to make if the specific grounds were not apparent from the context\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Apparently recognizing the consequences of his failure to challenge the juror, however, defendant argues the trial court should have excused the juror under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1211(d), which allows a judge to dismiss a juror for cause \"without challenge by any party if he determines that\n   grounds for challenge for cause are present.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1211(d) (2003). Defendant contends the proper standard of review for failure to dismiss a juror for cause is plain error. However, our Supreme Court has limited the application of plain error analysis to a trial court's instructions to the jury and rulings on the admissibility of evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the juror stated she believed she could continue to be fair and impartial to both parties. Defendant has failed to show either an abuse of discretion by the trial court or that he suffered any prejudice due to the continued service of this juror. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant's third argument is that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss all or some of the charges against him at the end of the State's evidence and at the end of all the evidence. Upon a motion to dismiss criminal charges, the trial court must determine whether there is substantial evidence of defendant's guilt of each essential element of the crime.\n   <em>\n    State v.

KG's testimony, both specific and generic, is sufficient to support a total of four charges of first-degree sexual offense. Defendant's statement, in which he admits to licking KG's vagina three times and touching her vagina three times, is evidence of six acts of first-degree sexual offense. From the record before us, it is clear the jury had no way to determine if any of the acts described by KG at trial were the same instances of abuse as those described by defendant in his statement. Therefore, evidence of anywhere between four and ten possible instances of first-degree sexual offense was presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   It is impossible to ascertain which of defendant's six convictions correspond with which of these possible instances of abuse. Although the indictment and verdict sheet attempt to identify each offense by date and act, the dates and acts described do not correspond with the evidence presented at trial. KG was only able to testify that the acts of first-degree sexual offense occurred during the period when she was spending the night at KM's house, which was between December, 2002 and March, 2003. Defendant's statement gave no indication as to when each particular act occurred, and no other witness could establish more specifically the dates of the offenses. The indictment and verdict sheet divide the charges of first-degree sexual offense by month, citing four offenses in January, four in February, and three in March. However, this division appears to be arbitrary, as the evidence did not put any of the incidents as occurring in any particular month. Defendant was convicted of the four January offenses, two by cunnilingus and two by inserting his finger into her vagina, and two February offenses, both by cunnilingus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We recognize that our case law does not require victims of child sexual abuse to allege dates with specificity.\n   <em>\n    State v.

It instructed the jury regarding the requirement of unanimity only as follows: \"[y]ou may not return a verdict until all 12 jurors agree unanimously as to each charge.

Defendant alleges he should be granted a new trial on these charges because of the general lack of unanimity and confusion of the jury. We disagree. At trial, KG testified that on one occasion, defendant \"tried\" to pull her pants down, and his hand \"almost\" went inside her pants. KG also testified that on another occasion, in the bathroom of defendant's house, defendant was pulling her pants down and \"trying to lick it,\" but was interrupted when he heard KM coming. These were the only two instances of attempted first-degree sexual offense presented to the jury, and the jury convicted defendant on both charges. We have previously found no risk of a lack of unanimity where the defendant is charged with and convicted of the same number of offenses, and the evidence supports that number of offenses.\n   <em>\n    State v. Wiggins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8959393\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/161/583/\">\n    161 N.C.App. 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=589%20S.E.2d%20402\">\n    589 S.E.2d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 409 (2003). We find no error in defendant's convictions of these offenses. However, because these offenses were joined, for the purpose of sentencing, with three counts of indecent liberties,\n   as to which we have granted defendant a new trial, we must remand these cases to the trial court for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant's fifth and final argument is that judgments in 03 CRS 53259-52 and 03 CRS 53264-52 are inconsistent with the jury's verdict sheets. Because we are granting defendant a new trial on most of the verdicts listed in these judgments, we need not address this argument.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-56\">03 CRS 53256 First-Degree Sexual Offense New Trial 03 CRS 53257 First-Degree Sexual Offense New Trial 03 CRS 53258 First-Degree Sexual Offense New Trial 03 CRS 53258 First-Degree Sexual Offense New Trial 03 CRS 53259 First-Degree Sexual Offense New Trial 03 CRS 53260 First-Degree Sexual Offense New Trial 03 CRS 53262 Indecent Liberties New Trial 03 CRS 53263 Indecent Liberties New Trial 03 CRS 53264 Indecent Liberties New Trial 03 CRS 53257 Indecent Liberties New Trial 03 CRS 53258 Indecent Liberties New Trial 03 CRS 53259 Indecent Liberties New Trial 03 CRS 53260 Indecent Liberties New Trial 03 CRS 53263 Attempted First-Degree Sexual Offense Remanded for Resentencing 03 CRS 53264 Attempted First-Degree Sexual Offense Remanded for Resentencing</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Judges HUDSON and JACKSON concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
