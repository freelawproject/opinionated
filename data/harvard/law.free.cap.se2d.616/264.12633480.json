The petition asserted that sufficient evidence exists to terminate respondent's parental rights to John pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(1), (2) and (6), in that respondent: (i) neglected John by failing to provide him with appropriate care, by subjecting him to an environment injurious to his emotional welfare, and by emotionally abusing John; (ii) willfully left John in foster care or placement out of the home for more than twelve months without making reasonable progress under the circumstances to correct those conditions which led to John's removal; and (iii) was incapable of providing for the proper care and supervision of John. The case proceeded to trial, and, after hearing arguments and receiving evidence from the parties, the trial court concluded that sufficient grounds exist to terminate respondent's parental rights pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(1), (2), and (6). After concluding that it was in the best interests of John to do so, the trial court entered an order terminating respondent's parental rights on 27 October 2003. It is from this order that respondent appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We note initially that respondent's brief contains arguments supporting only fourteen of the original fifteen assignments of error. Pursuant to N.C.R.App. P. 28(b)(6) (2005), the omitted assignment of error is deemed abandoned. Therefore, we limit our present review to those issues properly preserved by respondent for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The issues on appeal are whether the trial court erred by: (I) exercising personal jurisdiction over respondent; (II) denying respondent's request for a stay in the proceedings and thus exercising subject matter jurisdiction over the case; (III) denying respondent's motion to continue the trial; (IV) denying respondent's request for expenses; (V) denying respondent's motion to interview John; (VI) admitting into evidence prior disposition orders in the matter; (VII) admitting into evidence respondent's mental health records; (VIII) allowing two therapists to testify and render conclusions regarding their evaluations; (IX) excluding respondent from the courtroom during John's testimony; (X) concluding that respondent's parental rights should be terminated prior to a disposition hearing; (XI) concluding that it was in John's best interests to terminate respondent's parental rights; (XII) directing petitioner's attorney to draft the order for termination of parental rights; and (XIII) failing to enter the order terminating respondent's parental rights within thirty days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    I. Personal Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Respondent first argues that the trial court erred by exercising personal jurisdiction over her. Respondent asserts that the failure to properly serve John prevented the trial court from acquiring jurisdiction over respondent. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Upon the filing of a petition to terminate parental rights, the Juvenile Code requires that a summons regarding the proceeding be issued to the juvenile whose rights are to be terminated. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1106(a)(5) (2003). \"[T]he summons and other pleadings or papers directed to the juvenile shall be served upon the juvenile's guardian ad litem if one has been appointed[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the instant case, the record reflects that the summons required by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1106(a)(5) was served upon the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem's\n   </em>\n   attorney advocate rather than the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem.\n   </em>\n   Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that this was error, we note that the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    litem\n   </em>\n   did not object at trial to the sufficiency of service, nor does the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   argue on appeal that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over John. Instead, respondent objects to the sufficiency of the service, arguing that the failure to properly serve John constitutes grounds for reversal of the trial court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Only a `party aggrieved' may appeal from an order or judgment of the trial division.\"\n   <em>\n    Culton v.

In the instant case, respondent has failed to demonstrate any prejudice to her resulting from the alleged failure to properly serve John. Thus, we are unable to conclude that respondent was \"directly and injuriously\" affected by the alleged error, and, accordingly, we overrule this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    II. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Respondent presents two arguments asserting that the trial court erred by exercising subject matter jurisdiction over the case. Respondent first asserts that the trial court erred by denying her request for a stay in the termination proceeding pending this Court's determination of her appeal of previous orders. Respondent also asserts that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the case at the time of the termination hearing, \"pursuant to the decision of this [C]ourt captioned as\n   <em>\n    In re J.B.,\n   </em>\n   03-807[.]\" Because of the similarity of these two arguments, we have chosen to address them concurrently, and, in light of the record before us, we conclude that the trial court did not err.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re J.B.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897753\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/164/394/\">\n    164 N.C.App. 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20S.E.2d%20794\">\n    595 S.E.2d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (\"\n   <em>\n    J.B. I\n   </em>\n   \"), this Court reviewed a previous appeal by respondent stemming from trial court orders changing the permanency plan for John, releasing petitioner from all efforts to reunify respondent with John, and dismissing respondent's previous appeals regarding production of medical records and permanency planning hearings. Respondent contended in\n   <em>\n    J.B. I\n   </em>\n   \"that the trial court did not possess subject matter jurisdiction in this matter because [John] and respondent were residing outside of North Carolina at the time the proceedings in this case were initiated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 396,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20S.E.2d%20794\">\n    595 S.E.2d at 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After reviewing the record, we were unable to conclude whether the trial court possessed subject matter jurisdiction. We thus vacated the order and remanded the case with instructions to the trial court to \"make specific findings of fact to support its conclusion of law that it possessed subject matter jurisdiction under the [Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act] and [Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act] as outlined in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50A-201.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 398,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20S.E.2d%20794\">\n    595 S.E.2d at 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The record in the instant case reveals that, while respondent's prior appeal was pending, the trial court entered the instant order terminating respondent's parental rights. Respondent contends that the trial court was prohibited from entering an order terminating her parental rights while her prior appeal was pending before this Court. However, our Supreme Court has recently issued an opinion in\n   <em>\n    In re R.T.W.,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C. ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/\">\n    614 S.E.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (No. 417PA04), whereby the Court held that \"a trial court retains jurisdiction to terminate parental rights during the pendency of a custody order appeal in the same case.\" ___ N.C. at ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/\">\n    614 S.E.2d at 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court noted that \"[e]ach termination order relies upon an independent finding that clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supports at least one of the grounds for termination under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-1111[,]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/\">\n    614 S.E.2d at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and it concluded that, where a termination order is entered while a prior custody order is pending, \"[t]he termination order necessarily renders the pending appeal moot.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/\">\n    614 S.E.2d at 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the instant case, the trial court provided several findings of fact in support of its decision to exercise jurisdiction over the case in general and the termination proceedings in particular. Respondent does not object to any of these findings of fact on appeal. Therefore, in light of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the case and did not err in denying respondent's motion to stay\n   the termination proceeding. Accordingly, this argument is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    III. Motion to Continue\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Respondent also argues that the trial court erred by denying her motion to continue the termination hearing. Respondent asserts that the trial court was required to continue the termination hearing due to respondent's recent incarceration. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-803 (2003) provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The court may, for good cause, continue the hearing for as long as is reasonably required to receive additional evidence, reports, or assessments that the court has requested, or other information needed in the best interests of the juvenile and to allow for a reasonable time for the parties to conduct expeditious discovery. Otherwise, continuances shall be granted only in extraordinary circumstances when necessary for the proper administration of justice or in the best interests of the juvenile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A trial court's decision regarding a motion to continue is discretionary and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    In re Humphrey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191392\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/156/533/#p538\">\n    156 N.C.App. 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 538,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=577%20S.E.2d%20421\">\n    577 S.E.2d 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 425 (2003) (citing\n   <em>\n    Doby v.

However, as the trial court noted in the order terminating respondent's parental rights, the termination hearing had been rescheduled numerous times prior to that proceeding which eventually occurred the week of 21 July 2003. The termination hearing was originally scheduled for March 2003, but, upon agreement of the parties, the matter was continued until 21 April 2003. On 21 April 2003, respondent requested a continuance on the grounds that she had been injured in an automobile accident in Oregon and was unable to attend the termination hearing in North Carolina. She also expressed that she needed additional time to secure evidence for the hearing. The trial court granted respondent's motion and ordered that the termination hearing be rescheduled for 13 June 2003. However, on or about 23 May 2003, respondent returned to North Carolina from Oregon and allegedly kidnapped John. In its order terminating parental rights, the trial court made the following pertinent finding of fact:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On or about May 23, 2003, [respondent] came back to North Carolina and abducted [John] by waiting for him at his school bus stop and getting him in her vehicle and taking him to Oregon. This was at least the second time [respondent] had removed [John] from his foster placement and left the state with him. A felony warrant was issued against [respondent] and [respondent] and [John] were located in Oregon. On June 5, 2003 [respondent] was arrested for felony abduction and [John] was returned to North Carolina. [Respondent] initially resisted being ex[tradited] back to North Carolina, but she subsequently agreed to and was ex[tradited] back to North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Following her arrest for felony kidnapping, respondent filed a second motion to continue the termination hearing and challenged her extradition to North Carolina. The trial court granted respondent's second motion to continue and ordered that the termination hearing be rescheduled to commence on 21 July 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We note that respondent's incarceration in Oregon was the result of her own actions in abducting John, and we also note that the trial court granted respondent a continuance more than one month before her incarceration - a continuance sought by respondent for the express purpose of allowing her to gather the documents she now asserts she was unable to obtain. In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its\n   discretion by denying respondent's third motion to continue. Therefore, we overrule this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    IV. Request for Expenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Respondent further argues that the trial court erred by denying her request for expenses related to expert witness fees. Respondent asserts that she sufficiently demonstrated her need for assistance in procuring and paying for expert witness testimony and was thus entitled to expenses from the State. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7A-450 (2003) provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (b) Whenever a person, under the standards and procedures set out in this Subchapter, is determined to be an indigent person entitled to counsel, it is the responsibility of the State to provide him with counsel and the other necessary expenses of representation. The professional relationship of counsel so provided to the indigent person he represents is the same as if counsel had been privately retained by the indigent person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[T]he appointment of experts to assist an indigent in his defense depends really upon the facts and circumstances of each case and lies, finally, within the discretion of the trial judge.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although particularized need is a flexible concept and must be determined on a case-by-case basis, \"[m]ere hope or suspicion that favorable evidence is available is not enough to require that such help be provided[.]\" The trial court has discretion to determine whether a defendant has made an adequate showing of particularized need.

Moreover, we note that there is no indication in the record that respondent submitted any bills or costs related to depositions and records of her\n   current therapists, despite the trial court's instruction allowing respondent to do so. In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying respondent's request, and, accordingly, we overrule this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    V.

In a permanency planning and review order filed 17 April 2002, the trial court found that during supervised visits with John, petitioner required that respondent \"keep[] the focus of the visit on [John] and not on her own issues like mental or physical health, felony charges and placement issues for [John], so as to avoid causing [John] undue worry.\" The trial court thereafter ordered that \"[John's] therapist shall provide a written report regarding the appropriateness of [John's] participation in upcoming treatment team meetings and court hearings.\" In subsequent orders, the trial court continued to require the approval of John's therapists prior to John having contact with respondent. In a permanency planning review order entered 22 October 2002, the trial court extended a restraining order which prevented respondent from contacting John's father. At the time of the permanency planning review hearing, social workers were attempting to extend John's visits with his father, but \"this placement\" had been \"disrupted. . . to the detriment of [John]\" by respondent's \"continuing and escalating intrusive behaviors of allegedly contacting [John] at the day camp he attended, sending secret messages to [John] though his younger sister . . ., making repeated calls to [John's] new therapist's office, [and] contacting his counselors at the camp wanting information about [John's father's whereabouts].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In a permanency planning and review order entered 4 June 2003, the trial court granted a request to provide respondent with John's school and medical records, but the trial court required that \"any identifying information concerning the foster parents or where [John] lives\" be removed from the records prior to their presentation. The trial court later found that John's guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem,\n   </em>\n   social worker, and therapists were concerned that contact with respondent \"has given false hope and information to [John], and that this is causing confusion to [John], and causing him to be mistrustful with his social worker and his therapist.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Respondent's instant argument arises from a Motion To Allow Counsel To Interview\n   Child filed 11 April 2003. In that motion, respondent requested that the trial court allow her an \"opportunity to interview [John] in order to determine whether or not to present his testimony to the court.\" Respondent asserted that John was \"a fact witness to a number of allegations contained within the petition.\" Respondent noted the \"alleg[ation] that [respondent] had contact with [John] in violation of a court order during the summer of 2002 and that this contact jeopardized [John's] placement[,]\" and she asserted that John \"would provide the court the very best evidence as to the truth of these allegations.\" On 6 June 2003, the trial court entered an order denying respondent's motion to interview John, finding as fact that \"this motion has already been heard by this court and [John's] therapist is to inform this court when, and if, [John] should have contact with\" respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   After reviewing the record in the instant case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying respondent's request to interview John. As evidenced by multiple findings of fact contained within multiple court orders, any contact respondent had with John was disruptive to his own therapeutic progress. It is clear from the record that the trial court was concerned with respondent's behavior in attempting to learn of John's whereabouts. As detailed above, in the order terminating respondent's parental rights, the trial court found as fact that respondent abducted John \"for the second time\" on 23 May 2003, after \"waiting for him at his school bus stop and getting him in her vehicle and taking him to Oregon.\" In 2001, respondent removed John from foster care in North Carolina and absconded to a homeless shelter in South Carolina. As discussed below, the trial court did not prevent respondent from subpoenaing John to testify at the termination hearing. Therefore, in light of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court did not err by denying respondent's motion to interview John.

We note initially that respondent originally assigned error to the admissibility of the records on the basis that she was not given an opportunity to cross-examine the mental health officials who provided the records. However, in her brief, respondent asserts that the mental health records were inadmissible at the termination hearing because they were not covered under the statutory definition of \"hospital medical records.\" It is well established that \"the law does not permit parties to swap horses between courts in order to get a better mount\" in the appellate court.\n   <em>\n    Weil v.

Nevertheless, in our discretion pursuant to N.C.R.App. P. 2, we have chosen to review respondent's argument, and, as detailed below, we conclude that the trial court did not err.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The record indicates that the trial court ordered the production of respondent's mental health records at a permanency planning review hearing held prior to the termination hearing. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 45(c)(2) (2003) provides that where a custodian of hospital medical records is ordered to produce certain records in the custodian's custody, the custodian may tender to the court certified copies of the records requested. \"Any original or certified copy of records or an affidavit delivered according to the provisions of this subdivision, unless otherwise objectionable, shall be admissible in any action or proceeding without further certification or authentication.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=175%20S.E.%20836\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   N.C.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 122-8.1 and 90-109.1 are \"subject to the requirements of said statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=175%20S.E.%20836\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the instant case, respondent contends that the challenged medical records were inadmissible based upon the requirements of N.C. Gen.Stat. Chapter 122C, which replaced repealed Chapter 122. We cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 122C-3(9) (2003) defines \"confidential information\" as \"any information, whether recorded or not, relating to an individual served by a facility that was received in connection with the performance of any function of the facility.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 122C-52(b) (2003) provides that \"no individual having access to confidential information may disclose this information.\" However, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 122C-54 (2003) provides express exceptions to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 122C-52. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 122C-54(a) requires a medical facility to \"disclose confidential information if a court of competent jurisdiction issues an order compelling disclosure.\" In light of these statutory provisions, we conclude that petitioner was not precluded from admitting respondent's mental health records into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Furthermore, we note that in its order terminating respondent's parental rights, the trial court made the following pertinent findings of fact regarding respondent's mental health records:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   35. [Respondent's] mental health records were admitted into evidence at this hearing and were previously admitted into evidence in the underlying juvenile court action,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=01%20Johns.%20124\">\n    01 J 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and were summarized by the court in its order of March 13th &amp; 15th, 2002, which was entered by the court May 13, 2002, as follows: [Respondent] has had 10 mental health hospitalizations in this area since April 1999, approximately half of which were involuntary commitments for various periods of time. Approximately six (6) of these admissions involved some sort of self-inflicted injury of [respondent], all of which were not life\n   threatening. Of the remaining voluntary commitments, two (2) involved non-life threatening, self-inflicted injury by [respondent]. In addition, [respondent] has had four (4) prior mental health admissions in Oregon, three (3) for eating disorders and one (1) for depression. The dates of these admissions to the hospital occurred from March 1999 through November 2001. [Respondent] has been diagnosed with bulimia, borderline personality disorder, and major depression. The records also indicate a history of Percoset abuse and post traumatic stress disorder. It was noted that therapeutic trust was a formidable task for [respondent], as well as confusing boundaries between her and her therapist(s). In April 2000 Dr. Mike Hopping, Medical Director of Blue Ridge Center, stated in writing that [respondent] had \"successfully evaded all of our attempts to gain any sort of control over her self destructive behavior\", that she gave and then retracted releases of information, maintained another psychiatrist[] at one point, with whom Blue Ridge Center was not allowed to communicate with, attempted to prevent communication between Blue Ridge Center and in-patient units, and prevented Blue Ridge Center from talking to those who might be supportive to her in the community. It was his opinion that, at that time, long-term in-patient treatment for [respondent] would provide the only possibility for effective containment of her self-destructive or therapy interfering behaviors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   36. [Respondent] continues to exhibit the same types of behaviors that were concerning to the mental health professionals as stated above, and she has continued in her self-destructive and therapy interfering behaviors. She has never effectively addressed her mental health issues, and her mental health issues remain, her mental health issues are serious, her mental health issues seriously impede her ability to provide minimally acceptable parenting for [John], and her mental health issues have a detrimental impact on [John] when he is in her care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As detailed in finding of fact number thirty-five, the mental health records now challenged by respondent were originally admitted into evidence during a permanency planning review hearing held 13 March 2002 and 15 March 2002. Respondent did not appeal the trial court's subsequent order, and, as discussed above, we conclude that the trial court did not err by admitting into evidence prior disposition records in the matter. Because we also conclude that the trial court's termination of parental rights was based upon a determination independent of the prior disposition orders in the case, we further conclude that the trial court did not err by considering mental health records contained within the underlying file and previously admitted into evidence. Accordingly, we overrule this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    VIII. Testimony of Therapists\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Respondent next argues that the trial court erred by allowing Alan Dodson (\"Dodson\") and Gail Azar (\"Azar\") to testify and render conclusions regarding their evaluations. Respondent contends that neither therapist was a qualified expert witness, and that their diagnoses were based upon inadmissible evidence. We note that \"[i]n order to preserve a question for appellate review, a party must have presented to the trial court a timely request, objection or motion, stating the specific grounds for the ruling the party desired the court to make[.]\" N.C.R.App. P. 10(b)(1). In the instant case, respondent offered no objection during the hearing to either of the witnesses' qualifications, and, on appeal, she does not point to any testimony by the witnesses admitted over her objection. Therefore, we conclude that respondent has waived the right to challenge the witnesses' testimony on appeal, and, accordingly, we overrule this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    IX. Exclusion of Respondent From Courtroom\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Respondent next argues that the trial court erred by excluding her from the courtroom during John's testimony. Respondent asserts that the trial court was required to make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the fundamental fairness of its determination. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Because \"`persons faced with forced dissolution of their parental rights have a more critical need for procedural protections than do those resisting state intervention into ongoing family affairs[,]'\" this Court has previously held that \"`[w]hen the State moves to destroy weakened familial bonds, it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures,' which meet the rigors of the due process clause.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Murphy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8524830\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/105/651/#p653\">\n    105 N.C.App. 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 653,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=414%20S.E.2d%20396\">\n    414 S.E.2d 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 397 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Santosky v.

In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the risk of error from the procedure employed at trial was slight.

In the instant case, the trial court clearly indicated that it had determined that sufficient grounds exist to terminate respondent's parental rights pursuant to each of the statutory grounds alleged in the petition. The trial court directed petitioner to draft an order terminating respondent's parental rights, and it designated \"specific findings of fact\" it wanted included in the order. Following presentation of evidence and argument regarding John's best interests, the trial court concluded that \"[u]nder the statute I will terminate the parental rights of [respondent].\" In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court did not err in directing petitioner to draft the termination order on its behalf. Accordingly, we overrule this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    XIII. Entry of Order Terminating Parental Rights\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Respondent's final argument is that the trial court erred in entering the order terminating her parental rights. Respondent asserts that the trial court's order must be vacated because it was not filed within thirty days of the completion of the termination hearing. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1110(a) provides that \"[a]ny order [terminating parental rights] shall be reduced to writing, signed, and entered no later than 30 days following the completion of the termination of parental rights hearing.\" In the instant case, the termination hearing was completed on 23 July 2003 and the order was not filed until 27 October 2003. Thus, the trial court filed the order terminating respondent's parental rights outside of the thirty-day mandate of the statute. This Court has recently found prejudice and reversed termination orders where the orders were entered approximately six to seven months after the conclusion of the termination hearings.\n   <em>\n    See In re T.L.T.,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C.App. ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632830\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/612/436/\">\n    612 S.E.2d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (No. COA04-1084);\n   <em>\n    In re L.E.B.,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C.App. ___,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=610%20S.E.2d%20424\">\n    610 S.E.2d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (No. COA04-463). However, after reviewing the record in the instant case, we conclude that respondent has failed to sufficiently demonstrate such prejudice regarding the delay in the entry of the termination order.
