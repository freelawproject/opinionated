Here, Defendant argues,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that a witness tendered as an expert in forensic DNA analysis was not qualified to testify on population statistics. Given that our case law evidences the admissibility of testimony on population statistics by (forensic) DNA analysis experts and Defendant presents no authority to support his argument, we uphold the admission of the testimony on population statistics. But, for reasons given in\n   <em>\n    Allen,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C. at ___, 615 S.E.2d at ___, and\n   <em>\n    Speight,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C. at ___, 614 S.E.2d at ___, we must remand this case for resentencing because the trial court improperly found an aggravating factor and sentenced Defendant in the aggravated range in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Upon the verdict of a jury, Defendant was convicted of raping a thirteen-year-old female (\"the minor\") and sentenced to 360 to 441 months imprisonment without parole. The record reflects that the minor moved to North Carolina with her father in 2000 after her parents separated. Defendant, Charles Eugene Watts, is related to the minor. The minor began working for Defendant at his garage because her father was sick, his income was low, and the minor needed things for school. At the time, the minor was thirteen years old; Defendant was forty-seven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At trial, the minor provided the following testimony: Defendant began sexually assaulting her soon after she started working for him. Defendant kissed her, put his fingers into her vagina, and then raped her twice a day every weekday. Before Defendant raped her, the minor had not had sexual intercourse with anyone. Defendant told the minor that he would hurt her and her family if she told anybody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 7 September 2000, while driving the minor to school, Defendant grabbed the back of her head, pushed it into his lap, and forced her to perform oral sex on him. Defendant then drove to his garage, where he again raped the minor before taking her to school. She took the bus home from school, showered, and visited a neighbor, Susan Butler. She told Ms. Butler what had been happening. Testimony at trial established that Ms. Butler immediately talked to the minor's father; he, along with the minor and Ms. Butler, went to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, the police sent the minor to the hospital, where her underwear and physical samples were taken. A pregnancy test was administered, with a positive result. The treating obstetrician-gynecologist estimated the time of conception to be somewhere between 9 August and 19 August, during which time the minor was allegedly being raped by Defendant. The fetus was not viable, and an evacuation was performed. The products of conception extracted during the evacuation were preserved and picked up by the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant consented to giving a blood sample. He contended that he was sterile, denied having any sexual contact with the minor, contended that the minor had a bad reputation, and accused the minor of making sexual advances toward him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant was arrested and tried for statutory rape of a thirteen-year-old victim at the 10 June 2003 session of Superior Court, Scotland County. During the trial, the physician who performed the evacuation was asked to identify the products of conception, which were \"leaking somewhat.\" The trial court interrupted the examination, asking that the products be put in a cooler and a lid be placed on the cooler. The trial court recessed for five minutes in order for the bailiff to get \"spray\" and the trial judge then stated, \"For the record State's Exhibit Number 35 has a very unpleasant odor[.]\" Thereafter, a forensic DNA analyst who had examined the products of conception and blood samples of Defendant and the minor testified at trial that the probability of Defendant's paternity was 99.99 percent. Special Agent David Freeman, a forensic molecular geneticist with the State Bureau of Investigation, also testified at trial. He discussed DNA analysis conducted primarily by a colleague who was on vacation. Special Agent Freeman testified,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that the profile from the male fraction of the DNA taken from the minor's underwear was 4.48 million trillion times more likely to be from Defendant than from another unrelated individual within North Carolina's Caucasian population, 17.3 million trillion times more likely to be from Defendant than from another unrelated individual within North Carolina's African-American population, 5.59 million trillion times more likely to be from Defendant than from another unrelated individual within North Carolina's Caucasian Lumbee Indian population, and 20.7 million trillion times more likely to be from Defendant than from another unrelated individual within North Carolina's Hispanic population. Special Agent Freeman testified that, in his opinion, it was scientifically unlikely that the semen found on the minor's underwear originated from anyone other than Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   From the resulting conviction of statutory rape of a thirteen-year-old victim and sentence, Defendant appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his appeal, Defendant first contends that the trial court erred by denying his objection to Special Agent Freeman's testimony concerning his opinion about population statistics when he had not been tendered or qualified in that field. Defendant argued error as to Special Agent Freeman's statements that: (1) the profile from the male fraction of the DNA taken from the minor's underwear was 4.48 million trillion times more likely to be from Defendant than from another unrelated individual within North Carolina's Caucasian population; and (2) in\n   his opinion, it was scientifically unlikely that the semen found on the minor's underwear originated from anyone other than Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Preliminarily, we point out that Defendant lodged only general objections during Special Agent Freeman's testimony and did not ask to be heard when the objections were overruled. Moreover, defense counsel questioned Special Agent Freeman at length about population statistics. The transcript does not clearly demonstrate the grounds for the objections, and the testimony was not on its face admissible for no purpose. Defendant therefore failed to preserve this issue for appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This Court outlined the steps of DNA analysis as:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, the \"known\" and \"unknown\" samples of DNA molecules are chemically cut into fragments, separated into single strands, and lined up longest to shortest. A \"probing step\" follows to isolate those portions of DNA molecules which are \"variable,\" that is, differ from one individual to another. Four specific areas of the DNA molecule are usually \"probed\" in the RFLP procedure. Then a process called autoradiography yields an exposed film called an \"autorad\" showing a pattern of fuzzy lines or bands, commonly referred to as a \"DNA profile.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Bands derived from the known and unknown samples are thereafter compared visually. If the numbers and positions of the bands on the autorad appear consistent with one another (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   - \"line up\"), they are then sized by computerized measurement with reference to \"size markers\" or \"sizing ladders\" which also appear on autorads in three parallel lanes. After visual examination and computerized measurement, an \"interpretation\" is made as to whether, within a specified deviation or \"match window,\" a \"match\" may be declared. Under the F.B.I. protocol, a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5% is permitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Finally, the statistical significance of the \"match,\" that is, the probability of finding identical strands of DNA in someone other than the accused, is determined. This is accomplished by ascertaining the frequency with which a particular pattern of bands will appear within a relevant population,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   this latter being initially established by the race of the individual involved and by references to the pertinent data base compiled by the testing agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 660,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20S.E.2d%20884\">\n    436 S.E.2d at 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Indeed, the trial court established that Special Agent Freeman had a bachelor's degree in biochemistry, a master's and Ph.D. in microbiology, had undergone\n   additional forensic DNA training through the North Carolina Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Armed Forces, and had conducted DNA analysis in over 400 cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant asserts that \"there are three separate areas of expertise associated with DNA testimony. Those three are forensic serology, forensic DNA analysis, and population statistics[,]\" and that, because Special Agent Freeman was qualified only as a DNA analyst, \"he can testify about electrophoresis and performing a polymerase chain reaction\" but not about population statistics. Significantly, Defendant cites no authority in support of these contentions (in violation of Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(b)(6)). Given that this Court has found that a population-statistical analysis is the third step in DNA analysis, our case law evidences the admissibility of testimony on population statistics by (forensic) DNA analysis experts, and Defendant cites no authority in support of his argument, we uphold the trial court's ruling that Special Agent Freeman, who was qualified as an expert in DNA analysis, was qualified to testify as to the population statistics in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant next contends that the trial court erred by denying his objection to Special Agent Freeman's testimony about results of a DNA analysis conducted by an absent colleague. The record reflects that the DNA analysis, indicating that the male DNA found in the minor's underwear matched that of the Defendant, was initially conducted by Special Agent Freeman's colleague and was then reviewed by Special Agent Freeman, the leader of the State Bureau of Investigation's molecular genetics section. Defendant alleges that Special Agent Freeman testified as to his absent colleague's \"lab conclusion\" and thereby violated Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, particularly in light of\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

Had defense counsel stipulated to the chain of custody of the products of conception, testimony regarding the results of the paternity would still have come in. A forensic DNA analyst who had examined the products of conception and blood samples of Defendant and the minor testified that the probability of Defendant's paternity was 99.99 percent. Special Agent Freeman testified that the profile from the male fraction of the DNA taken from the minor's underwear was 4.48 million trillion times more likely to be from Defendant than from another unrelated individual within North Carolina's Caucasian population, 17.3 million trillion times more likely to be from Defendant than from another unrelated individual within North Carolina's African-American population, 5.59 million trillion times more likely to be from Defendant than from another unrelated individual within North Carolina's Caucasian Lumbee Indian population, and 20.7 million trillion times more likely to be from Defendant than from another unrelated individual within North Carolina's Hispanic population. Special Agent Freeman testified that, in his opinion, it was scientifically unlikely that the semen found on the minor's underwear originated from anyone other than Defendant. This evidence corroborated the minor's account of Defendant's criminal conduct. A stipulation to the chain of custody of the products of conception could not have negated the overwhelming evidence of Defendant's guilt.
