JONES, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Agust\u00edn Pineda-Arrellano (\u201cPineda\u201d) appeals his guilty plea conviction and sentence for illegal reentry. Pineda argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the courts treat a defendant\u2019s prior felony conviction as a statutory ground for a sentencing enhancement rather than as an element of the offense, which, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, should be presented to the jury. Pineda\u2019s case is one of hundreds, if not thousands, in this circuit in which counsel have raised this constitutional challenge. We take this opportunity to state that this issue no longer serves as a legitimate basis for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Pineda makes the familiar contention that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in light of the subsequent decision in <em>Apprendi. </em>We have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding precedent until and unless it is officially overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Pineda properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he nevertheless raised it as his sole appellate issue to preserve it for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">This court has patiently entertained the identical argument in countless cases. Now, however, a majority of the Supreme Court has reaffirmed <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in <em>James v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), stating that \u201cwe have held that prior convictions need not be treated as an element of the offense for Sixth Amendment purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1600 n. 8 (citing <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>). Because the Supreme Court treats <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>as binding precedent, Pineda\u2019s argument is fully foreclosed from further debate. That <em>James </em>interpreted the Armed Career Criminal Act is not a distinguishing feature from the illegal reentry statute under which this appellant was convicted, because both statutes enhance a defendant\u2019s punishment on account of certain prior felony convictions. Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s acknowledgment in footnote eight that <em>James </em>stipulated to a prior offense does not detract from the force of its simultaneous reliance on <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>We lower courts are not empowered to deconstruct such clear statements of governing authority by the Supreme Court. <em>See also United States v. Grisel, </em>488 F.3d 844, 845-46, 2007 WL 1599009, at *1 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (noting that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has never been overruled but has been applied repeatedly by the Supreme Court, most recently in <em>James); United States v. Davis, </em>487 F.3d 282, 287-88 (5th Cir.2007) (noting, after <em>James, </em>that the <em>Apprendi </em>Court \u201cexplicitly refrained from overruling <em>AT </em>mendarez-Torres\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">The dissent takes issue with our view that <em>James </em>has closed the book on reconsideration of <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>The Supreme Court\u2019s decision is hardly surprising, however. Despite the dissent\u2019s overstated claim that we are denying future defendants their appeal rights, few issues have less merit for a defendant than the potential overruling of <em>Almendarez-</em>Torres\u2014and defense counsel are well aware of this. If <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>were overruled based on <em>Apprendi, </em>prior felony crimes that could serve as the basis for sentence enhancements would have to be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. No defendant wants such an issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>before the jury! The carefully drafted restrictions on evidentiary admission of prior offenses (Fed.R.Evid.404(b)) emphasize the inherent prejudice in placing a defendant\u2019s criminal record before a jury. Justice Stevens acknowledged these realities when, <em>pre-James, </em>he stated that his disagreement with <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cis not a sufficient reason for revisiting the issue\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-3\">The denial of a jury trial on the narrow issues of fact concerning a defendant\u2019s prior conviction history ... will seldom create any significant risk of prejudice to the accused. Accordingly, there is no special justification for overruling <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>Moreover, countless judges in countless cases have relied on <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in making sentencing determinations. The doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>provides a sufficient basis for the denial of certiorari in these cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><em>Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 2874, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006)(statement of Justice Stevens respecting the denial of petition for writ Of certiorari).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">One might ask, then, why so many defendants in this circuit have pursued reconsideration of <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>Probably because, like the mountain, it\u2019s there, and it doesn\u2019t fit with the, logic of <em>Apprendi. </em>Defense counsel may also perceive some marginal tactical benefit in placing any roadblock in the way of expeditious conviction or punishment. No mat: ter what the underlying rationale may have been for challenging <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cto preserve the issue for further review,\u201d it is time to admit that the Supreme Court has spoken. In the future, barring new developments in Supreme Court jurisprudence, arguments seeking reconsideration of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>will be viewed with skepticism, much like arguments challenging the constitutionality of the federal income tax.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It would be prudent for appellants and their counsel not to damage their credibility with this court by asserting non-debatable arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">Based on the foregoing, Pineda\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\">. Who doubts that if, instead of receiving hundreds of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>briefs each year,- this court received a similar number of income tax protestor appeals, we would hesitate to limit these meritless filings?</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b654-11\">DENNIS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ASX\">concurring in affirming the conviction and sentence only:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">I concur only in the majority\u2019s holding that this court is bound by, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and that Mr. Pineda\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed. I emphatically do not join the majority\u2019s various statements regarding the continued validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>including especially its assertion that \u201cthis issue no longer serves as a legitimate basis for appeal.\u201d <em>See supra </em>at 625. The majority\u2019s language amounts only to a dictum that exceeds the authority of this court and conflicts with decisions of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">The majority\u2019s statement that challenges to <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cno longer serve[ ] as a legitimate basis for appeal\u201d is plainly a dictum, rather than a decision that establishes binding circuit precedent forbidding the filing of such appeals and arguments. The majority\u2019s holding simply affirms Mr. Pineda\u2019s conviction and sentence based on <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and thus adds no new precedent. The majority\u2019s statements regarding future appeals challenging <em>Almen-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>darez-Torres </em>are matters not resolved or determined in its holding and therefore amount only to dictum. In other words, the parties in the present case did not join issue on, and the majority did not decide, whether Mr. Pineda could appeal or argue for reconsideration of <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>In fact, Mr. Pineda did appeal and make an argument in brief on that issue. Furthermore, the government did not object or contest his right to do so; neither did the majority disallow his appeal or argument. Instead, the majority opinion acknowledges that he made the argument in order to preserve his right to ask for relief if the Supreme Court overrules <em>Almenda-rez-Torres. </em>Thus, the majority\u2019s dictum statement referring to the legitimacy of future appeals that seek to overrule <em>Al-mendarez-Torres </em>is an independent part of the majority opinion that does not affect Mr. Pineda\u2019s case in any way. Rather, the majority, without being requested to do so, simply uses this case as a convenient vehicle within which to express its opinion on a matter not resolved or determined by its holding, that is, to announce its dictum opinion as to the validity of future <em>Almen-darez-Torres </em>challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Moreover, the question of whether we will allow or consider appeals seeking reconsideration of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in the future is beyond this court\u2019s power to determine, because neither the Constitution nor the Congress has vested us with the plenary discretion to choose in advance the kinds of arguments and appeals that we will allow or consider.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To the contrary, federal law has made an appeal from a district court\u2019s judgment of conviction in a criminal case what is, in effect, a matter of right. <em>Coppedge v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 438, 441, 82 S.Ct. 917, 8 L.Ed.2d 21 (1962) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1294; Fed.R.Crim.P. 37(a)); <em>cf. Carroll v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 394, 400-01, 77 S.Ct. 1332, 1 L.Ed.2d 1442 (1957).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, a defendant in a federal criminal case has a right to have his conviction and sentence reviewed by a Court of Appeals, and need not petition that court for an exercise of its discretion to allow him to bring the case before the court. <em>Coppedge, </em>369 U.S. at 442, 82 S.Ct. 917; <em>see also Atilus v. United States, </em>406 F.2d 694, 697 (5th Cir.1969) (\u201c[Ejvery convicted person has an absolute right to an appeal.\u201d). The only requirements a defendant must meet for perfecting his appeal are those expressed as time limitations within which various procedural steps must be completed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">The majority does not cite, and I have been unable to find, any statute authoriz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>ing a federal Court of Appeals to issue an advisory in advance of filings that it will, in the future, view with disfavor a certain kind of appeal or argument by a defendant in a federal criminal case. Accordingly, the majority has, in my opinion, assumed a sweeping preemptive and discretionary power that neither the Constitution nor the Congress has vested in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that Congress has, under the <em>in forma pauperis </em>law, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, given federal courts narrowly defined authority to dismiss a case only after it has been filed, and only if the' court determines that a statutorily specified grounds for dismissal exists, <em>e.g., </em>that the action or appeal is frivolous or malicious. In particular, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) provides that a federal court shall dismiss a case at any time if it determines that \u201c(A) the allegation of poverty is untrue; or (B) the action or appeal\u2014(i) is frivolous or malicious; (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or (iii)seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, under \u00a7 1915(e)(2), a federal court is authorized and required to dismiss the case only after making an individualized determination that one of the statutory grounds for dismissal exists in that particular case. Consequently, neither \u00a7 1915(e)(2)\u2014nor any other authority\u2014 empowers a federal court of appeals to do what the majority, in effect, does here, that is, to proclaim that, in the future, all criminal defendants should not appeal or present argument on a particular issue of substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s dictum today does what the Supreme Court has expressly said we may not do\u2014presume to decide for the Court an issue that is exclusively within its prerogative. That is[ instead of simply deciding as we have in the past that we are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>as an exception to the principle of <em>Apprendi </em>until the inconsistency is squarely addressed and resolved by the Supreme Court, the majority undertakes to treat <em>AlmendarezTorres\u2019s </em>validity as inarguable as if it had been declared <em>stare decisis. </em>Such an approach is overambitious: as Justice Thomas has recently observed, it falls to the Supreme Court, and only the Supreme Court, to resolve the issue. <em>See Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 2874, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006) (dissent from denial of certiorari) (\u201cThe Court\u2019s duty to resolve this matter is particularly compelling, because we are the only court authorized to do so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">The majority\u2019s reliance upon unspecified and uncited federal income tax collection eases is badly misplaced. Even assuming that the majority\u2019s unnamed cases were decided correctly, it is difficult to see how, as civil cases, they could be authority for the majority\u2019s peremptory disallowance of federal criminal appeals of right. At stake in every serious criminal case</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-11\">are constitutional protections of surpassing importance: the proscription of any deprivation of liberty without due process of law, Arndt. 14, and the guarantee that [i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury, Arndt. 6. Taken together, these rights indisputably entitle a criminal defendant to a jury determination that [he] is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number><em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>530 U.S. 466, 476-77, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)(citing <em>United States v. Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. 506, 510, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995); <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 278, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970)) (footnote and internal quotations omitted). The majority doesn\u2019t even try to explain how the anonymous civil tax collection cases to which it refers are in anyway apposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully suggest that the majority should withdraw its misguided dictum. If the majority chooses to publish the dictum, however, government attorneys and defense counsel should not take it as having any legal or precedential effect upon proceedings within the context of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 for several reasons:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (1) this case is not subject to the <em>in forma pauperis </em>rules of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 because Mr. Pineda did not proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>here; (2) neither party has raised, briefed or even mentioned the subject <em>of </em>frivolousness under \u00a7 1915 in this case; and (3) the majority did not consider, address, of even mention the subject of frivolousness in its opinion. Indeed, the majority affirmed Mr. Pineda\u2019s conviction and sentence on the merits, rather than dismissing his appeal in this case. Finally, as discussed above, the majority\u2019s dictum is apparently based on the misguided notion that we have discretionary power, similar to that of the Supreme Court, to grant or deny what are, in effect, appeals of right in federal criminal cases according to our own standards and reasons, rather than those provided by Congress and the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Moreover, if this court is called upon to decide whether it is frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 for \u00e1 defendant in a particular federal criminal case to appeal his conviction or sentence'based solely on an argument to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>as intrinsically in conflict with <em>Apprendi </em>and other cases, we must decide according to the governing rules and standards established by the Supreme Court precedents. Under those principles, frivolousness does not depend on the likelihood of the appellant\u2019s success but on whether the appellant\u2019s argument has a rational basis in law and fact. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Coppedge,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">Since our statutes and rules make an appeal in a criminal case a matter of right, the burden of showing that that right has been abused through the prosecution of frivolous litigation should, at all times, be on the party making the suggestion of frivolity. <em>It is not the burden of the petitioner to show that his appeal has merit, in the sense that he is bound, or even likely, to prevail ultimately. He is to be heard, as is any appellant in a criminal case, if he </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>makes a rational argument on the law or facts.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-5\"><em>Coppedge, </em>369 U.S. at 447-48, 82 S.Ct. 917.(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Further, in <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, the Supreme Court stated that an appeal on a matter of law' is frivolous where \u201c[none] of the legal points [are] arguable on their merits.\u201d Also, in <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989), the Supreme Court had occasion to construe the meaning of \u201cfrivolous\u201d under former \u00a7 1915(d). The Court began by noting that \u201c[t]he Courts of Appeals have, quite correctly in our view, generally adopted as formulae for evaluating frivolousness under \u00a7 1915(d) close variants of the definition of legal frivolousness which we articulated in the Sixth Amendment case of <em>Anders v. California.\u201d Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827. The <em>Neitzke </em>Court went on to state that \u201ca complaint, containing as it does both factual allegations and legal conclusions, is frivolous where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827. The Court observed that the <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute \u201caccords judges ... the authority to dismiss a claim based on an indisputably meritless legal theory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 109 S.Ct. 1827.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">If and when we are confronted with a motion to dismiss an individual appeal challenging <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(B)(i), we will be required to decide the question by applying the principles established by the Supreme Court. Thus, the issue in such a case will probably hinge on whether the argument to overrule that challenge or argument is based on an \u201cindisputably a meritless legal theory,\u201d \u201claek[s] an arguable basis ... in law,\u201d and is altogether not a \u201crational argument.\u201d In deciding such a case we are required to bear in mind that a tie must go to the appellant, because \u201cour statutes and rules make an appeal in a criminal case a matter of right, [and] the burden of showing that that right has been abused through the prosecution of frivolous litigation should, \u00e1t all times, be on the party making the suggestion of frivolity.\u201d <em>Coppedge, </em>369 U.S. at 447-48, 82 S.Ct. 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">It is, of course, not appropriate to decide here whether an argument to overrule <em>Al-mendarez-Torres </em>can be declared frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, because this case does not present that question and we have not considered any briefs or oral argum\u00e9nt on the subject. But it should be pointed out generally, however, that frivolousness will not turn on the appellant\u2019s likelihood of ultimate success or on the odds against the Supreme Court overruling its challenged precedent, but on whether it is possible to make a rational argument for its reconsideration, overruling or limitation. If likelihood of ultimate success by an individual litigant in the Supreme Court were the criterion, Courts of Appeals could dismiss as frivolous substantial portions of their dockets, in light of the small chance that certiorari will be granted and result in a decision in any given case. Put in that light, an argument that the Supreme Court should reconsider <em>Almen-darez-Torres </em>does not on its face appear to be irrational or an indisputably merit-less legal theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the three blocs of Justices argued for three conflicting rationales. Justice Stevens, writing the controlling plurality opinion joined in by Justices Ginsburg and Souter, held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In doing so, he expressly let stand the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Tor-res, </em>\u201c[e]ven though it is arguable that [it] was incorrectly decided,\u201d and that it was inconsistent with the main underlying principle of its decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Justice Thomas, for himself and Justice Sealia, joined the opinion of the Court but wrote separately to explain his view that \u201cthe Constitution requires a broader rule than the Court adopts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 120 5.Ct. 2348. The broader rule espoused by Justices Thomas and Sealia is the same principle underlying Justice Stevens\u2019s holding without the exception allowing <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>to stand. \u201c[T]his traditional understanding\u2014that a \u2018crime\u2019 includes every fact that is by law a basis for imposing or increasing punishment\u2014continued well into the 20th-century, at least until the middle of the century .... Today\u2019s decision, far from being a sharp break with the past, marks nothing more than a return to the status quo ante\u2014the status quo that reflected the original meaning of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 517, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">A third view was expressed by the dissenters: Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justices O\u2019Connor, Kennedy, and Breyer. Their view was that the majority\u2019s opinions were inconsistent with the Court\u2019s precedents and that given its \u201cprevious approval of\u2014and the significant history .in this country of\u2014discretionary sentencing by judges, it is difficult to understand how the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments could possibly require the Court\u2019s ... rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Thus, the Justices in <em>Apprendi </em>divided according to their three conflicting but rational .viewpoints as to the proper interpretation of the Constitutional requirements of a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The logical or rational disconnect between the holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and the basic underlying principles of <em>Apprendi </em>and subsequent cases were clear in the Justices\u2019 opinions and cannot be denied. As late as 2005, Justice Thomas repeated his view that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201chas been eroded by this Court\u2019s subsequent Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, and a majority of the Court now recognizes that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was wrongly decided.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 27, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Indeed, no justice has ever argued that the two decisions are based on intrinsically compatible rationales or that they can be reconciled logically in any principled way. Justice Stevens recently indicated, in the context of denying certiorari, that he continued to see the two decisions as being in conflict but that he might vote to uphold <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>based on the doctrine of <em>stare decisis. Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 2874, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006). Justice Thomas, on the same subject, argued forcefully that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>should be overruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-13\">The Court\u2019s duty to resolve this matter is particularly compelling, because we are the only court authorized to do so. <em>See State Oil Co. v. Khan, </em>522 U.S. 3, 20, 118 S.Ct. 275, 139 L.Ed.2d 199 (1997) (\u201c[I]t is this Court\u2019s prerogative alone to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>overrule one of its precedents.\u201d)- And until we do so, countless criminal defendants will be denied the full protection afforded by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, notwithstanding the agreement of a majority of the Court that this result is unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Consequently, it is not unreasonable or irrational to contend that since only the Supreme Court can resolve the <em>Almenda-rez-Torres/Apprendi </em>conflict in principle, there will continue to be a rational basis for arguing for or against the viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until that conflict has been squarely addressed and resolved by overruling <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>declaring it <em>stare decisis, </em>or overruling <em>Apprendi. </em>Each view was rationally argued by the Justices in Apprendi and can still be so argued by litigants in criminal cases. We need go back only a month or so in the Supreme Court\u2019s recently ended term to see that even long standing precedents can yield to rational but unlikely-to-succeed arguments, and that the incidence of these waxes with each change in the court\u2019s composition, which in our world of mortals can occur at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Our previous panels have held consistently that the argument for reconsidering and correcting <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. In <em>United States v. Cervantes-Garcia, </em>260 F.3d 621 (2001) (unpublished, per curiam), the government moved for dismissal inasmuch as the Appellant had raised as his sole issue an argument controlled by <em>Al-mendarez-Torres. </em>Indeed, the appellant did not claim otherwise; he conceded that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was the controlling authority and foreclosed his argument. Nonetheless, he raised the argument to protect his right to further review. After careful consideration, we rejected the government\u2019s argument that the claim was frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. We pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">a member of the Supreme Court that decided <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has indicated in a related case that the decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was mistaken. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2367-80, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)(Thomas, J., concurring). <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was decided by a 5-4 vote with Justice Thomas a part of the majority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-9\"><em>Cervantes-Garcia, </em>260 F.3d at 621. For those reasons we held that \u201cwe reject the contention that Appellant\u2019s appeal is frivolous;\u201d we also rejected the government\u2019s motion to dismiss on those grounds. <em>Id. </em>Instead, we simply concluded that \u201cbecause it is unmistakably clear that <em>Almen-darez-Torres </em>controls the disposition of the case and we are bound thereby, we summarily affirm the judgment of the district court in lieu of dismissal of Appellant\u2019s appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Since then, we have consistently held only that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>issues are foreclosed on appeal, frequently acknowledging, when we do so, that the issue is being raised on appeal only to preserve it. <em>See United States v. Iniguez-Barba, </em>485 F.3d 790, 790 n. 1 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201cAs [the defendant] properly concedes, this argument is foreclosed ..., and he raises the argument only to preserve it.\u201d); <em>United States v. Ramos-Sanchez, </em>483 F.3d 400, 404 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]he Supreme Court rejected this argument in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>which we are obligated to follow.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Thus, considered in this perspective, the dictum in footnote 8 of the Supreme Court\u2019s majority opinion in <em>James v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) plainly does not squarely address or resolve the conflict between <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and the <em>Ap-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number><em>prend\u00ed </em>line of case law. The <em>James </em>footnote, in its entirety, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">To the extent that James contends that the simple fact of his prior conviction was required to be found by a jury, his position is baseless. James admitted the fact of his prior conviction in his guilty plea, and in any case, we have held that prior convictions need not be treated as an element of the offense for Sixth Amendment purposes. <em>Almenda-rez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">127 S.Ct. at 1600, n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The majority here reads the last phrase of the second sentence of footnote 8 in isolation and incorrectly treats it as a holding in the case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead, it is dictum. James\u2019s central holding was that the Florida attempted burglary was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA. Whether <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>should be overruled or continued as an exception to the <em>Apprendi </em>principle was not at issue in <em>James. </em>The reference in footnote 8 to <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was unnecessary because James\u2019s position was \u201cbaseless\u201d anyway due to his having admitted his prior conviction charged as an element of his indictment in his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Moreover, because the survival of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not at issue in <em>James, </em>its opponents, Justices Scalia and Thomas, and its proponents, Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Souter, had no reason to agree or disagree with the insignificant, peripheral dictum of footnote 8. (four of these five Justices dissented from the main holding in <em>James </em>and thus had no reason to take issue with matters peripheral to it). These five Justices, who made up the <em>Apprendi </em>majority, are the only ones who care strongly about whether <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>continues as an exception in <em>Apprendi. </em>The other Justices in <em>James, </em>who were either dissenters or successors of dissenters in <em>Apprendi, </em>may care little whether the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>exception to <em>Apprendi </em>survives, since they are likely to be against <em>Apprendi </em>with or without the exception. In sum, any Justice\u2019s concurrence in or dissent from <em>James\u2019 </em>central holding involving whether the Florida offense was a crime of violence signifies nothing about his or her opinion as to whether <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>should survive or perish.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">The majority here also seems to contend that James\u2019 situation <em>vis d vis </em>the ACCA is completely parallel to that of a defendant <em>vis a vis </em>the illegal reentry statute at issue in <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>This is simply not so. Under the provision of the ACCA at issue in <em>James, </em>the defendant\u2019s prior conviction is an element of the offense and must be included in the indictment, so that his guilty plea to the indictment makes an argument based on <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>baseless, moot and irrelevant, as it did in Mr. James\u2019s case. Under the illegal reentry statute, the defendant\u2019s prior conviction is not an element of the offense, not necessary to the indictment, and not neees-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>sarily included in the indictment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consequently, unlike <em>James, </em>the illegal reentry defendant usually, if not always, can make a rational and relevant argument that but for <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>he has been unconstitutionally deprived of his right to put the government to its proof before a jury and thereby possibly avoid a substantial enhancement of his sentence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">For these reasons, I concur in the majority\u2019s holding that Mr. Pineda\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed, but I respectfully disagree with its statements and dictum pertaining to the legitimacy of appeals of right filed in this court by federal criminal defendants urging the reconsideration and overruling of <em>Almendarez-Tor-res.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\">. Even the Supreme Court, which might have that power, has not to my knowledge issued such a peremptory order. Certainly, it has not with respect to appeals challenging <em>Al-mendarez-Torres.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\">. Section 3742(a), Title 28, U.S.C., establishes a similar right with regard to appeals from the judgment of sentence. <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2045-48, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996); <em>see also </em>15B Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 3918.8, p. 573 &amp; n. 1 (2007). In the Fifth Circuit, we have held that our jurisdiction to review sentencing issues derives from both statutes. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b655-14\">.\"First, a timely notice of appeal must be filed in the District Court to confer jurisdiction upon the Court of Appeals over the case.\u201d <em>Coppedge, </em>369 U.S. at 442 n. 3, 82 S.Ct. 917 (citing Fed.R.Crim.P. 37(a)); <em>United States v.

Contrary to the majority\u2019s misreading, I do not merely disagree with the majority on whether <em>James </em>\"closed the book\u201d on reconsideration of <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>Rather, as the two preceding sections make clear, I disagree with the majority's unauthorized attempt to predict what the Supreme Court will do in respect to <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and even more strongly with the majority\u2019s <em>ultra vires </em>statements discouraging appeals of right fully authorized by Congressional acts. In this part of my analysis, I address only the possible misguided motions to dismiss appeals as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 that may be filed in response to the majority\u2019s dictum and <em>ultra vires </em>statements. Until the <em>Almendarez-Torres- </em>issue is squarely addressed by a Supreme Court majority, I believe there is a rational, non-frivolous basis to appeal and challenge the holding in that case. Unlike, the majority, I do not presume to make book on future Supreme Court decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\">. Even though it is arguable that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided, and that a logical application of our reasoning today should apply if the recidivist issue were contested, <em>Apprendi </em>does not contest the decision\u2019s validity and we need not revisit it for purposes of our decision today to treat the case as a harrow exception to the general rule we recalled at the outset. Given its unique facts, it surely does not warrant rejection of the otherwise uniform course of decision during the entire history of our jurisprudence. <em>Id. </em>at 489-89, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b661-9\">. The majority also relies on two recent Circuit decisions as support: <em>United States v. Grisel, </em>488 F.3d 844, 845-46, 2007 WL 1599009, at *1 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (noting that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has never been overruled but has been applied repeatedly by the Supreme Court, most recently in <em>James </em>); and <em>United States v. Davis, </em>487 F.3d 282, 287-88 (5th Cir.2007) (noting, after James, that the Apprendi Court \"explicitly refrained from overruling <em>Almendarez-Torres\u201d). </em>The majority takes these holdings as standing for clear acknowledgment that the Supreme Court will never revisit <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>I cannot agree. These cases stand, rather, for the unremarkable principle that, until such time as the Supreme Court <em>does </em>reconsider the issue, we are bound to follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>as good law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b662-6\">. The majority's argument that the right to a jury trial on an alleged prior conviction invites prejudicial evidence into the main trial and therefore is a negligible or dispensable right is simply a repetition of an argument made for treating recidivism differently as relied upon in <em>Almendarez-Toires. </em>It, of course, has a rational basis; but so does Justice Thomas\u2019 counter-argument that \"this concern, of which earlier courts were well aware, does not make the traditional understanding of what an element is any less applicable to the fact of a prior conviction.\u201d <em>Ap-prendi, </em>530 U.S. at 521, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (Thomas, J., concurring); <em>see also id. </em>at n. 10. In any event, the resolution of this argument, like that of the larger conflict between the <em>Apprendi </em>principle and <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>of which it is a part, belongs to the Supreme Court not this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b662-17\">. The majority\u2019s reliance on Justice Stevens\u2019 statement of his individual reasons respecting the denial of petitions for certiorari in <em>Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006) is misplaced. Justice Stevens\u2019 statement for himself alone that \"the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>provides a sufficient basis for the denial of certiorari in these cases\u201d obviously does not constitute a resolution of the conflict between the <em>Apprendi </em>principle and <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>Denials of certiorari by the Court do not make law; and, of course, neither does the reason for such denial given by an individual Justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
