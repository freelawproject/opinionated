We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">According to her Amended Complaint, Epps \u201cwas employed by the County as a clerk in the Tax Commissioner\u2019s Office.\u201d R-12, Exh. A at 3. Watson, the tax commissioner for Madison County, Georgia, supervised Epps. Epps \u201cwas not in any decision making role within the department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. \u201cAll ministerial decisions relating to the Tax Commissioner\u2019s Office were made by Defendant Watson.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">During the 2004 election for tax commissioner, in which Watson ran as the incumbent, Epps allowed Watson\u2019s opponent to place campaign signage on her private property. Watson knew that Epps historically had allowed political candidates to place such signage on her property and Watson did not at anytime request permission to place campaign signage on Epps\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">In 2004, Watson was the incumbent in an election campaign and after Watson was re-elected, Watson stated \u201cI am going to clean house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. Watson dismissed Epps from her staff the day after her re-election. Watson stated that Epps was \u201cdoing a good job,\u201d but stated the reason for Epps\u2019 termination was \u201ca cold environment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. Epps sought to appeal her dismissal but could not because the tax commissioner\u2019s staff is not subject to the appeals process of Madison County. Epps subsequently filed suit in district court against Watson, both individually and as tax commissioner, alleging that she was dismissed from Watson\u2019s staff because she had allowed Watson\u2019s opponent to display political campaign signage on her private property and that she was denied due process in attempting to appeal her dismissal. Epps, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, sought to recover monetary damages from Watson, alleging that Watson violated her rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-10\">Watson filed a pre-answer motion to dismiss Epps\u2019 claims on the basis of qualified immunity from suit in her individual capacity. The district court denied Watson\u2019s motion and she filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-12\">\u201cWe have jurisdiction to review the denial of the defense of qualified immunity on interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>325 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny the defense of qualified immunity <em>de novo, </em>\u201caccepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Our circuit, however, imposes a heightened pleading requirement in section 1983 claims against individuals and plaintiffs cannot rely on \u201cvague or conelusory\u201d allegations. <em>See GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1367 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cSome factual detail in the pleadings is necessary to the adjudication of \u00a7 1983 claims. This is particularly true in cases involving qualified immunity, where we must determine whether a defendant\u2019s actions violated a clearly established right.\u201d); <em>Fullman v. Graddick, </em>739 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>553, 556-57 (11th Cir.1984) (holding that in civil rights actions \u201ca complaint will be dismissed as insufficient where the allegations it contains are vague and concluso^ ry.\u201d (citations omitted)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In such cases, the complaint must allege the relevant facts \u201cwith some specificity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cWe must also keep in mind the fact that we generally accord official conduct a presumption of legitimacy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dal-rymple v. Reno, </em>334 F.3d 991, 996 (11th Cir.2003) (alterations omitted) (citing <em>United States Dep\u2019t of State v. Ray, </em>502 U.S. 164, 179, 112 S.Ct. 541, 550, 116 L.Ed.2d 526 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">Within the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, as there is no record beyond the complaint, the well-pleaded factual allegations in the plaintiffs complaint are the focus of the determinations. <em>Id. </em>at 994-95. \u201cUnless the plaintiffs allegations state a claim of violation of clearly established law, a defendant pleading qualified immunity is entitled to dismissal before the commencement of discovery.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2815, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (citation omitted); <em>Behrens v. Pelletier, </em>516 U.S. 299, 309, 116 S.Ct. 834, 840, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996) (\u201cAt [the 12(b)(6)] stage, it is the defendant\u2019s conduct <em>as alleged in the complaint </em>that is scrutinized for \u2018objective legal reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-6\">\u201cThe Supreme Court has urged us to apply the affirmative defense of qualified immunity at the earliest possible stage in litigation because the defense is immunity from suit and not from damages only.\u201d <em>Marsh v. Butler County, Ala., </em>268 F.3d 1014, 1022 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(en banc) </em>(citations omitted). We have applied the qualified immunity defense at the 12(b)(6) stage before. <em>See, e.g., Chesser v. Sparks, </em>248 F.3d 1117 (11th Cir.2001) (reversing the district court\u2019s denial of official\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs freedom of expression and freedom of association claims on the basis of qualified immunity); <em>Denno v. Sch. Bd. of Volusia County, </em>218 F.3d 1267 (11th Cir.2000) (affirming the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim for the deprivation of First Amendment rights against the individual defendants); <em>Maggio v. Sipple, </em>211 F.3d 1346 (11th Cir.2000) (reversing the district court\u2019s failure to grant 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss because defendants were entitled to qualified immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-9\">A public official who asserts a defense of qualified immunity must establish that he was \u201cengaged in a \u2018discretionary function\u2019 when he performed the acts of which the plaintiff complains.\u201d <em>Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252, 1264 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). Where there is no dispute as to the discretionary nature of the actions complained of, like here, we look to determine (1) whether the plaintiff has factually alleged the deprivation of a constitutional right; and (2) whether that right was clearly established at the time of the violation. <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001); <em>Holloman, </em>370 F.3d at 1264. The plaintiff bears the burden of proof as to both of these determinations. <em>Dalrymple, </em>334 F.3d at 995 (\u201cOnce the government official has established that she was acting within her discretionary authority, the burden shifts to the plaintiff [] to-show that qualified immunity is not appropriate.\u201d (ci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>tation omitted)). With this two-step inquiry in mind, we turn to the question of whether Watson\u2019s decision to terminate Epps\u2019 employment violated the First Amendment right involved here\u2014the freedom of association\u2014in such a manner that a reasonable government official would have known.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">A <em>Epps </em>\u2019 <em>First Amendment Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">In her Amended Complaint, Epps alleged that she allowed Watson\u2019s opponent to place campaign signage on her private property. Moreover, Epps alleged that Watson knew that Epps had historically allowed political candidates to place such signage on her private property and Watson did not at anytime request permission to place campaign signage on Epps\u2019 property. Epps alleged that she was fired the day of Watson\u2019s re-election and was told by Watson that she was performing well at the time she was dismissed and the reason for the dismissal was a \u201ccold environment.\u201d R-12, Exh. A at 5-6. Watson contends Epps\u2019 First Amendment claim fails because the allegations in her Amended Complaint do not show a violation of freedom of association, and even if they did, Epps has not established that Watson had fair warning that dismissing Epps would violate clearly established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">1. Sufficiently Alleged Constitutional Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-7\">Epps alleged that she allowed Watson\u2019s opponents to place campaign signage on her property during Watson\u2019s 2004 campaign and the day after Watson won reelection she fired Epps. It is reasonable to infer from Epps\u2019 Amended Complaint that Epps contended that her indication of public support for Watson\u2019s challenger was the reason that Watson fired her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">In examining whether the Epps has alleged a constitutional violation, we first note that we agree with both the district court and counsel that this case is best construed as a pure political patronage case. <em>See Terry v. Cook, </em>866 F.2d 373, 377 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that when public employment is \u201cabsolutely conditioned on political allegiance and not upon the content of expressions of political beliefs,\u201d the political patronage analysis is appropriate). In such cases, we use the <em>Elrod-Branti </em>analysis in determining if patronage discharges were constitutional. In <em>Elrod, v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 2689, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), a plurality of the Supreme Court declared patronage dismissals unconstitutional, because the practice limited political belief and association, and therefore violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court, however, created a narrow exception, allowing patronage dismissals of those holding policymaking positions, reasoning that this exception would, in part, advance the important government goal of assuring \u201cthe implementation of policies of [a] new administration, policies presumably sanctioned by the electorate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 96 S.Ct. at 2687. Four years later, in <em>Branti v. Finkel, </em>445 U.S. 507, 518, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 1295, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980), the Court modified the test: \u201c[T]he ultimate inquiry is not whether the label \u2018policymaker\u2019 or \u2018confidential\u2019 fits a particular position; rather, the question is whether the hiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>In <em>Terry v. Cook, </em>we addressed what positions may permissibly be subject to political patronage action in the context of a county sheriffs office. 866 F.2d at 373. We held that \u201c[t]he closeness and cooperation required between sheriffs and their deputies\u201d necessitated \u201cabsolute authority\u201d by the sheriff over hiring and firing his deputies. <em>Id. </em>at 377. We reasoned that \u201ca deputy sheriff is the general agent of and empowered to enter into business transactions for the sheriff ... and the sheriff is civilly liable for actions committed by a deputy done in the performance of his duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). In contrast, we stated that \u201c[i]t has not been established that loyalty to an individual sheriff is an appropriate requirement for effective job performance for the [ ] positions of clerk, investigator, dispatcher, jailer, and process server.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377-78. Focusing oh five aforementioned positions\u2019 non-deputized status and clerical nature, we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-5\">Such positions traditionally revolve around limited objectives and defined duties and do not require those holding them to function as the alter ego of the sheriff or ensure that the policies and goals of the officer are implemented. Although it can be said that each job in the sheriffs office implements the policies of the office, the limited and defined roles these positions tend to play do not support the need for political loyalty to the individual sheriff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 378. As a result, we remanded the matter to the district court for \u201ca determination of the actual responsibilities of each position and whether political loyalty to the elected sheriff is a reasonably appropriate requirement for the effective performance of those jobs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">Here, the allegations in the Amended Complaint do not indicate that Epps\u2019 job was deputized or \u201crequirefd] [her] to function as the alter ego of the [Tax Commissioner] or ensure that the policies and goals of the office are implemented.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Instead, at this stage, there are only allegations that as a \u201cclerk,\u201d Epps \u201cwas not in any decision making role within the department,\u201d R-12, Exh. A at 4, a job that can reasonably be inferred to \u201ctraditionally revolve around limited objectives and defined duties.\u201d <em>See Terry, </em>866 F.2d at 378. As a result, construing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to Epps, we find that Epps has factually alleged the deprivation of a constitutional right to freely associate and the district court did not err in inferring a violation of Epps\u2019 First Amendment right of freedom of association.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">2. Clearly Established Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-10\">\u201cClearly established law\u201d is law that is sufficiently defined so as to provide public officials with \u201cfair notice\u201d that the conduct alleged is prohibited. <em>Hope v. Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 739, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 2515, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002) (\u201cFor a constitutional right to be clearly established, its contours must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right. This is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful; but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent.\u201d (internal citations and quotation omitted)). Citing <em>Terry, Elrod, </em>and <em>Branti, </em>Epps argues that the law in this instance is \u201cclearly established,\u201d that is, she asserts that \u201c[p]ublic employment may not be conditioned upon political affiliation to any party or individual.\u201d Appellee Br. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-11\">Prior to Epps\u2019 termination, we issued <em>Terry. </em>Although in the context of a sheriffs office instead of a tax commissioner, <em>Terry\u2019s </em>premise clearly established that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>\u201cthe limited and defined role[] [a clerk] tend[s] to play do[es] not support the need for political loyalty to the individual sheriff.\u201d See 866 F.2d at 878. \u201cAlthough the facts of the case are not identical,\u201d as here Epps was a clerk under the Tax Commissioner and not a sheriff, <em>Terry\u2019s </em>\u201cpremise has clear applicability in this case.\u201d See <em>Hope, </em>536 U.S. at 743, 122 S.Ct. at 2517.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">We find that Watson did have \u201cfair notice\u201d that such alleged conduct is unconstitutional, as the law here was \u201cclearly established.\u201d See <em>Hope, </em>536 U.S. at 739, 122 S.Ct. at 2515. As a result, Epps\u2019Amended Complaint has alleged a violation of a clearly established constitutional right. See <em>Williams v. Ala. State Univ., </em>102 F.3d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (stating that while qualified immunity is typically addressed at the summary judgment stage of the case, the defense may be raised and considered on a motion to dismiss; the motion will be granted if the \u201ccomplaint fails to allege the violation of a clearly established constitutional right.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">\n<em>B. Epps\u2019 Procedural Due Process Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">Epps alleged that no hearing was provided to her upon her firing in violation of her constitutional right to procedural due process. Watson asserts that Epps\u2019 procedural due process claim fails because her Amended Complaint is devoid of allegations describing a \u201cmerit system\u201d promulgated, or even adopted, by the Madison County Tax Commissioner. As a result, Watson asserts, under the heightened pleading requirement, Epps failed to adequately plead a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-7\">1. Sufficiently Alleged Constitutional Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-8\">To establish such a claim, the former clerk must show that she had a protected property interest in her employment. <em>See Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 571, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2706, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). \u201cState law determines whether a public employee has a property interest in his or her job.\u201d <em>Warren v. Crawford, </em>927 F.2d 559, 562 (11th Cir.1991). \u201cUnder Georgia law, a public employee generally has no protected property interest unless he or she is employed under a civil service system, which allows termination only for cause.\u201d <em>Brett v. Jefferson County, Ga., </em>123 F.3d 1429, 1433-34 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also Ross v. Clayton County, Ga., </em>173 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cGenerally, a public employee has a property interest in continued employment if state law or local ordinance in any way limits the power of the appointing body to dismiss an employee.\u201d (citation and internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-10\">Watson contends that while Epps attached the dismissal policy of Madison County to her Amended Complaint, the Tax Commissioner and Madison County are separate political entities and that O.C.G.A. \u00a7 47-2-292(a) provides that \u201c[a]ll tax commissioners ... and employees in their offices shall be subject to a merit system of personnel administration, as promulgated by each such office____\u201d As a result, Watson asserts that Epps failed to plead or otherwise show that the Madison County personnel policy applies to her employment on the staff of the Tax Commissioner. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-13\">Epps alleged in paragraph 30 of her Amended Complaint that \u201cDefendant Watson\u2019s employees are required to be subject to a merit system of employment; Defendant County has in place a merit system of employment. Defendants\u2019 failed to provide the hearing as requested.... \u201d R-12, Exh. A at 10. The prior paragraph \u201cplaces before the court Section 14(4), the dismissal policy of Madison County....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. Madison County personnel policy provides that county employees may be terminated for cause and that such em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>ployees are entitled to a hearing prior to termination. Drawing all inferences in favor of Epps, we find that Epps has sufficiently alleged that she was covered by a policy under which she could only be terminated for cause, that is, that the Madison County Tax Commissioner who \u201cunjustly terminated\u201d Epps had adopted the dismissal policy of Madison County.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">2. Clearly Established Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">Having sufficiently alleged a protected property interest, it is clearly established that an employee with a protected property interest in continued employment may not be terminated without due process of law. <em>See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 546, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1495, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985) (holding that public employee with property interest in continued employment is entitled, prior to termination, \u201cto oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer\u2019s evidence and an opportunity to present his side of the story\u201d). As a result, at this stage, Defendant Watson is not entitled to qualified immunity on Epps\u2019 procedural due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-8\">Under the alleged facts, a reasonable public official in Tax Commissioner Watson\u2019s place could not have believed that firing Epps from her job as a clerk did not violate First Amendment law. As a result, Tax Commissioner Watson is not entitled to dismissal on the basis of qualified immunity with respect to Epps\u2019 First Amendment claim at this stage of the case. Moreover, the Amended Complaint states a cause of action sufficient to withstand a 12(b)(6) motion regarding Epps\u2019 procedural due process claim. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying Louise Watson\u2019s motion to dismiss these claims based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1275-9\">EDMONDSON, Chief Judge, CONCURS in the result.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1270-8\">. At this procedural point, we, like the district court, accept as true the facts as set forth in Epps' Amended Complaint. <em>See Wilson v.
