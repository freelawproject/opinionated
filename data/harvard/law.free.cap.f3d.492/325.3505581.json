HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Milton Carbe appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of his Bivens<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. He alleged that he was subjected to unconstitutional conditions of confinement when the defendants ignored a mandatory evacuation order and left him and other inmates at the Beaumont prison during Hurricane Rita without, <em>inter alia, </em>adequate food, water, and ventilation. The court dismissed the complaint <em>sua sponte </em>prior to service on the defendants for failure to exhaust remedies. First there is a matter of jurisdiction and then we turn to the dismissal for want of exhaustion of remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Carbe argues that because he claimed monetary damages and requested a jury trial the magistrate judge lacked jurisdiction. According to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the matter was referred to him by the district court for review, report, and recommendation in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). The Supreme Court has interpreted \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) \u201cto authorize the nonconsensual reference of <em>all </em>prisoner petitions to a magistrate [judge].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The magistrate judge did not enter judgment pursuant to \u00a7 636(c), but only made \u201cfindings of fact\u201d and \u201crecommendations\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) and did not exceed his statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b355-18\">Carbe argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to exhaust before a responsive pleading was filed. This court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal of a prisoner\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-19\">The proper characterization under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of the Prison Litigation Reform Act\u2019s exhaustion requirement has been uncertain.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Supreme Court recently provided an answer in <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>holding that \u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and that inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We had held that a district court may dismiss a complaint, <em>sua sponte, </em>for failure to exhaust.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-20\">In PLRA cases, district courts in this circuit often hold <em>\u201cSpears </em>hearings\u201d to determine whether a case should be dismissed for various reasons before defendants are served.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While <em>Jones, </em>in insist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ing upon a return to the regular pleading order in the handling of the affirmative defense of failure to exhaust, does not otherwise cast doubt upon <em>Spears </em>hearings, a practice extensively used in this circuit for over twenty years, it does make clear that a court cannot in a <em>Spears </em>hearing before a responsive pleading is filed resolve the question of exhaustion. Any failure to exhaust must be asserted by the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under <em>Jones, </em>however, a court can dismiss a case prior to service on defendants for failure to state a claim, predicated on failure to exhaust, if the complaint itself makes clear that the prisoner failed to exhaust.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, however, Carbe\u2019s complaint is silent as to exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">It bears emphasis that a district court cannot by local rule sidestep <em>Jones </em>by requiring prisoners to affirmatively plead exhaustion. It is, at least now it is, an affirmative defense under the Federal Rules, a defense belonging to the state that is waived if not asserted. To the extent decisions of this court have suggested otherwise, they did not survive <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">We must then VACATE the judgment and REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-9\">. <em>Bivens v.
