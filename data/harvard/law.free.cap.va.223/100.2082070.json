(Record No. 811206)</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b160-14\">COMPTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ar1\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-15\">In this appeal of right, a public utility that provides water and sewer service only to a residential subdivision complains of the action of the State Corporation Commission in denying a portion of a requested sewer rate increase. The public service company as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>serts (1) that the action of the Commission deprives the company of its property without due process of law and (2) that the Commission\u2019s refusal, during the rate determination, to approve numerous items proposed as part of the company\u2019s operating costs constituted an abuse of the Commission\u2019s legislative discretion. We disagree with the utility on both counts and affirm the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">In June of 1980, appellant Lake of the Woods Utility Company instituted this proceeding by filing with the Commission an application under Code \u00a7 56-245 for a temporary emergency increase in rates for sewer service. The Company sought to revise its tariffs to raise the monthly charge to residential customers from $8 to $24, thus increasing gross annual revenues by $147,648. The Company stated its net operating income from the sewer service during the twelve months of 1979 was a loss of $205,698.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In July of 1980, the Commission denied the request for emergency relief, set a public hearing for November of 1980 to receive evidence on the proposed tariff revision, and directed its staff to investigate the appropriateness of interim relief under Code \u00a7 56-240. Subsequently, the Commission determined the Company had demonstrated that an increase in gross annual revenues of $147,648 would be justified after a full hearing. Thus, the Company was permitted to collect those revenues on an interim basis, subject to refund, for service rendered on and after August 1, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Then on July 29, 1980, the Company filed a revised schedule for a monthly charge of $40 designed to increase its gross annual revenues by another $147,648, in addition to the amount to be received through the interim rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The Commission referred the matter to a Hearing Examiner, who presided over the hearing on November 5. Subsequent to the hearing the Company, upon request of the Examiner, submitted additional data in January of 1981 and the Examiner filed his report in February. The Examiner found that certain proposed expense items should be either denied entirely or approved only in part. He also determined that the Company\u2019s net operating loss for the test year ending December 31, 1979 was only $110,428, that \u201cno return on rate base [was] appropriate for this Company,\u201d and that permitting the utility to earn additional revenue sufficient to cover the foregoing loss would \u201cconstitute fully adequate, just and reasonable rate relief in this case.\u201d The Examiner also found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>that the Company\u2019s gross additional revenue requirement based on test year operations was $114,671 and that the Company should be allowed, <em>inter alia, </em>to put rates in effect designed to produce that amount of additional revenue; the rate so designed is $20.43 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Filing exceptions in March of 1981 to the Examiner\u2019s Report were the Company and Lake of the Woods Association, an organization of the subdivision property owners that entered the proceeding as a Protestant. The Association asked the Commission to find that a monthly sewer charge of $9.48 is adequate to permit the Company to recover its justifiable operating expenses, or, in the alternative, to set a maximum rate of $12.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In the order appealed from filed April 1, 1981, supplemented later by a written opinion, the Commission unanimously adopted the Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings and required the Company to file revised tariffs and a proposed refund plan. The operation of the final order was suspended pending this appeal, thus leaving in effect the interim rates permitted by the Commission effective August 1, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The Association has appeared before us both as an appellant and appellee. Because the Association asserts as appellant it \u201cis willing to accept the decision of the Commission\u201d in the event of an affirmance, it is unnecessary for us to address further the Association\u2019s argument on its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The facts are undisputed. Lake of the Woods is a 2600-acre residential subdivision in Orange County consisting of approximately 4200 lots around a 500-acre lake. Development of the property began in 1967. All the lots have been sold and about 800 have been improved with dwellings. About 75 percent of the homes are occupied full time. In the recent past, new homes have been added to the subdivision at the rate of about 70 per year. There is little commercial development. The community, improved by hard surfaced roads, has numerous common use facilities such as swimming pools, a community building, a golf course, parks, playgrounds, and picnic areas. The Association operates and maintains these common use facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Lake of the Woods Utility Company provides water and sewer services to the community. At the end of the test year, December 31, 1979, there were 769 customers receiving service from the Company, and all but three used both water and sewer services. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>These three had their own septic tank systems and purchased only water service.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of AtPac Land Company of Santa Barbara, California. AtPac purchased the stock of the Company in late 1978 or early 1979 as one of a number of acquisitions from Boise Cascade Home and Land Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The water service provided by the Company is supplied by a conventional system of wells, storage tanks, and mains. No request for an increase in water rates has been made by the Company in this proceeding. Those rates have not been increased since commencement of water service in 1967. Customers who own lots but do not take water service are obligated to pay a water \u201cavailability charge\u201d of $4 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The sewer service, begun in 1969, is provided by an unusual vacuum system, used by only about six sewer companies in the United States. The soil in the area is not suited for individual septic tank systems and the hilly terrain prevented use of a conventional gravity flow sewer system. In the system used, sewage discharged from a residence flows by gravity to a nearby holding tank, usually shared by one other home. Vacuum pressure then pulls the sewage from the holding tank to one of 13 pumping stations. The substance then is pumped through a sewage force main into a larger gravity flow main connected to the sewage treatment plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">At the time of the hearing, the system employed nearly 300 electrically operated holding tank valves designed to open at appropriate times to allow the force of the vacuum to empty the tank. New valves currently installed are operated pneumatically without the need of electric power. Malfunctions frequently occur at the storage tanks resulting in overflowing tanks that must be pumped out by crews of workers with a tank truck. The Examiner found the entire system to be \u201clabor and energy intensive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Under the proposed revised schedule, the Company\u2019s requested 400 percent increase in basic sewer rates should cause a 116 percent increase in gross annual revenue, according to a Commission Staff accountant. No change was requested in a $3.75 per month sewer \u201cavailability charge,\u201d but the amended application sought increase in the sewer connection and installation fees to a total of $1450.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>At the hearing stage, the Association and the Attorney General of Virginia, who appeared before the Commission pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.1-133.1(a) to represent consumers\u2019 interests, urged the Commission to examine the Company\u2019s financial condition on a \u201ctotal company basis,\u201d instead of reviewing only the sewer phase of the Company\u2019s business as proposed in the Company\u2019s application. The Commission noted that the water and sewer systems serve virtually the same customers and that the two systems are maintained by the same personnel. Thus, the Commission concluded it would \u201cbe logical and eminently more fair to both Company and its customers, to determine Company\u2019s revenue requirements on a total Company basis.\u201d The Commission, however, concluded there was insufficient evidence in the record to employ that technique in this proceeding because the Company\u2019s water operations, and the allocation of the \u201cavailability charges\u201d between water and sewer, received little or no analysis from either the Commission Staff or the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Consequently, and focusing on the Company\u2019s sewer operations alone, the Commission found that the requested rate increase was \u201cexorbitant\u201d from the consumer\u2019s standpoint and that such an increase would be \u201cdevastating\u201d to the Lake of the Woods community. The evidence showed that the interim rates and the pendency of this proceeding had a \u201cdepressing effect\u201d on the continuing efforts to develop the subdivision and on the availability of mortgage money to finance residential construction. The record shows that the proposed rates are significantly higher than those in nearby areas and would probably make Lake of the Woods unattractive to prospective purchasers as well as discourage the present lot owners from building. The Commission also found that the Company\u2019s \u201cviability\u201d is tied to the vitality of the subdivision and that rates which \u201cstrangle\u201d growth, or cause an exodus of property owners, will not benefit the utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The Commission determined, <em>inter alia, </em>that the sewer system is \u201coverbuilt in relation to the present customers\u2019 needs\u201d; that the Company is overstaffed, inefficient, renders poor service and makes excessive, questionable use of the assistance of affiliated companies and a California consulting firm; and that the Company lacks on-site management personnel, which contributes to its other \u201cproblems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The Commission decided, therefore, that the utility should be authorized to revise its sewer tariffs to produce additional net rev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>enues in the amount recommended by the Hearing Examiner. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">\u201cThis will allow Company to \u2018break-even\u2019 based on the adjusted test year results but will not provide for a return on the questionable amount of Company\u2019s investment. Actually we entertain considerable fears that permitting a \u2018breakeven\u2019 result in this case may be somewhat generous. The impact on consumers of rates designed to produce this effect will still be burdensome, an increase from $8.00 per month to $20.43 per month. Nevertheless, based on the evidence in this record, we believe that such a finding strikes a reasonable balance between the interests of the consumer and Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">On appeal, the Company argues that by \u201cauthorizing a rate designed to produce a \u2018break-even\u2019 result here, the Commission is forcing the Company to continue to expend resources in providing utility service to the public without receiving any return whatsoever on its investment.\u201d Such a result, the Company urges, amounts to confiscation and thus deprives the utility of its property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The Company says \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that a utility is entitled to earn a return on its investment.\u201d It asserts the Commission \u201chas a duty to fix some rate of return\u201d and \u201cdoes not have the option of denying a return altogether.\u201d We fully agree with the Company\u2019s recitation of the foregoing truisms of public utility regulation when applied in the proper context. But the Company has overstated its case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The mere fact that the Commission has determined that the rate charged sewer customers should not include any return on the sewerage portion of the Company\u2019s rate base does not establish confiscation when, as here, the utility furnishes both water and sewer service, and the blended operation is profitable. The record shows that the combined operations of the Company have the same stockholders, the same management, the same administrative personnel, the same maintenance personnel, and essentially the same customers. As the Commission points out on brief, the Company \u201cagrees that its water and sewerage operations are a single, profit seeking enterprise.\u201d In one of its appellate briefs, the utility states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u201cThe Company is interested in adequate revenues, not the source of the revenues. If the Commission will authorize adequate revenues for the Company, they can, so far as the Company is concerned, be allocated between the two services in any fashion that the Commission elects or, in fact, can all be imposed on one service and the other service rendered without charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The Company\u2019s own figures demonstrate it is profitable. According to the utility\u2019s accounting evidence for its water operations, considered with the \u201cbreak-even\u201d sewer rate fixed by the Commission in this proceeding, the Company is authorized to earn a net operating income of $71,608. Also, based on the Company\u2019s own figures the water operations are earning a return of 13.17 percent. With the new sewer rate, the entire Company is earning a return of 2.97 percent. On these facts, the utility may not successfully demonstrate confiscation on the sole basis that the Commission did not fix a rate of return for the sewerage portion of its rate base. Confiscation must be proved with reference to the utility\u2019s entire rate base, defined as the value of a utility\u2019s property used and useful in providing its service, <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Chesapeake and Potomac Tel. Co. of Va., </em>215 Va. 549, 558, 211 S.E.2d 265, 271 (1975), and not with regard to only a portion of its total investment. <em>See Alabama Public Service Commission </em>v. <em>Southern Railway Co., </em>341 U.S. 341, 352 (1951) (concurring opinion); <em>Puget Sound Traction Co. </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>244 U.S. 574, 580-81 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The foregoing principle was codified by the General Assembly with the enactment of Code \u00a7 56-235.2, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201cAny rate, toll, charge or schedule of any public utility operating in this State shall be considered to be just and reasonable only if: (1) the public utility has demonstrated that such rates, tolls, charges or schedules <em>in the aggregate </em>provide revenues not in excess <em>of the aggregate </em>actual costs incurred by the public utility in serving customers within the jurisdiction of the Commission, subject to such normalization for nonrecurring costs and adjustments for known future increases in costs as the Commission may deem reasonable, <em>and a fair </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>return on the public utility\u2019s rate base </em>used to serve those jurisdictional customers;. . . .\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Consequently, reasonableness of public utility rates must be examined on the basis of aggregate revenues, aggregate costs, appropriate adjustments, and a fair return on the utility\u2019s total rate base. Likewise, proof of a utility\u2019s claim of confiscation must be based on an examination of the same aggregate and total criteria. This the Company has not done here, focusing instead on only a portion of the Company\u2019s total operation. Thus, we reject the utility\u2019s constitutional argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The Company also attacks the decision below on the ground that the Commission\u2019s determination to disallow several categories of the Company\u2019s operating expenses was arbitrary, unsupported by the evidence, and constituted an abuse of the Commission\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The utility objects, first, to the Commission\u2019s action in limiting the rate case expense to $3,000 when the Company proposed an allowance of $28,000, to be amortized over four years at $7,000 per year. Company witness, Robert L. Frasher, an accountant with Brockmeier Consulting Engineers, Incorporated, the California consulting firm retained by the utility, testified that the $28,000 was an \u201cestimate\u201d that was to include the time devoted to this proceeding by the Brockmeier firm, \u201cthe attorney\u2019s cost and any cost that would be incurred by any of the other parties.\u201d He also stated that his firm\u2019s time spent on the case \u201cwill approximate twenty-five thousand dollars.\u201d A Commission Staff witness testified the Company had \u201cbooked\u201d $19,640 for rate case expense as of August 31, 1980, and that he assumed the expense would equal $28,000 \u201cbefore this case is concluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The Commission ruled the proposed allowance for the cost was \u201cexcessive.\u201d Pointing out the suggested sum exceeds 11 percent of the sewer operations adjusted test year revenues as calculated by a Staff witness, the Commission properly noted that it was \u201cnot required to impose upon the ratepayers whatever a company might choose to spend for legal and accounting assistance in connection with a rate case.\u201d The Commission found that the consulting firm \u201cmerely prepared some very generalized accounting testimony . . . for which it expects to be paid $25,000 over and above the $15,000 annual retainer already charged by the firm.\u201d The Commission further said that Frasher\u2019s testimony was \u201cof limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>value,\u201d and stated \u201cwe fail to see why it was necessary for his firm to participate in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">While the Commission may not assume the duties or usurp the powers of utility management, the regulatory body has a reasonable discretion to disallow any part of expenses actually incurred where the evidence shows such expenses are exorbitant, unnecessary, wasteful, or extravagant. <em>Norfolk </em>v. <em>Chesapeake and Potomac Tel. Co. of Virginia, </em>192 Va. 292, 311-12, 64 S.E.2d 772, 783-84 (1951). Upon an analysis of the evidence pertaining to this expense for services rendered by a California consulting firm to this small Virginia utility, we cannot conclude the Commission abused its discretion in disapproving the item.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">We likewise reject the Company\u2019s complaint that the Commission erred in eliminating \u201call expenses for management services provided by the Company\u2019s affiliates.\u201d The Commission disallowed the Company\u2019s expenses incurred as the result of services rendered by several out-of-state companies that were affiliated with this utility, an enterprise that has only 15 on-site employees and less than 800 active customers. The affiliates rendered such sophisticated services as administration of employee benefit plans, administration of employee insurance plans, budget review, and day-to-day administrative and accounting assistance. We hold the Commission properly disallowed these expenses consistent with its statutory duties, first, to examine and approve a public service company\u2019s relations with affiliate interests, Code \u00a7 56-76 to -87, and, second, to exclude in whole or in part from the utility\u2019s accounts any payment to an affiliated interest for services rendered that is not consistent with the public interest. Code \u00a7 56-78. The Commission\u2019s decision on this item of expense was fully supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">We also disagree with the Company\u2019s argument that the Commission erred by rejecting the utility\u2019s proposed increase in operating expenses by $26,583 for increased cost of electric power. The Commission Staff made an electricity expense adjustment in a larger amount but labelled it a \u201cCompany projection.\u201d The Company based its calculations upon two assumptions that the Commission found \u201carbitrary and without justification\u201d: (1) that the utility\u2019s power usage will remain the same in the future as during the test year, and (2) that the electric rates used by the Company in making its calculation are representative of the future. The Commission pointed out the projection was not based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>upon a factual study and was not an \u201cannualization of. . .[a] known rate increase.\u201d Adjustments to test year results for known charges are proper, <em>Roanoke Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Division of Consumer Counsel, </em>219 Va. 1072, 1080, 254 S.E.2d 102, 107 (1979), but adjustments that are \u201cspeculative or cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty\u201d are prohibited. Code \u00a7 56-235.2. We cannot say the Commission acted arbitrarily in denying the foregoing adjustment in the absence of a definitive evidentiary basis for the Company\u2019s calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Finally, we also reject the Company\u2019s argument that the Commission incorrectly limited the Company\u2019s uncollectable sewer accounts expense to one percent of gross annual sewer revenues. The Company\u2019s books reflected a test-year uncollectable accounts expense for sewer operations of $23,924. Letters had been written to the delinquent customers without success; formal legal action had never been used to collect the debts. Most of the delinquents were \u201cavailability\u201d customers who had no service that could be terminated for nonpayment of charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The Commission endorsed the policy of its Staff, based on experience with other utilities, by allowing a \u201cbad debt\u201d expense of one percent of revenues, thus decreasing the Company\u2019s expense item by $21,403. Pointing out that \u201cbad debts are a fact of business life,\u201d the Commission said that in ratemaking \u201cwe are not bound to recognize Company\u2019s actual bad debt experience, but only a sum which we find reasonable.\u201d The Commission also stated that the utility has the burden to prove it is entitled \u201cto a level of bad debt expenses greater than that experienced by most utilities\u201d and that because the Company had made \u201conly a minimal attempt to collect delinquent accounts,\u201d the burden of proof had not been met to the Commission\u2019s satisfaction. We think this action was a proper exercise of the Commission\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the order appealed from will be affirmed. The proceeding will be remanded for such further action by the Commission as may be necessary to implement this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
