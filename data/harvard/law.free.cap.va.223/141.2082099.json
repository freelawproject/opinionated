Luchaka, and Olga G. Luchaka (the appellants) and Harold R. Gearhart executed and recorded a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>certificate in an effort to establish the River Bend Limited Partnership. Gearhart was listed as general partner and the appellants as limited partners. This certificate was signed and acknowledged by all the partners before a notary.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Thomas and Suzanne Johnson purchased a house from the partnership in 1975. Subsequently, they brought suit against the partners, alleging breach of warranty in the construction of the dwelling. The trial court found for the Johnsons and held the appellants liable as general partners, ruling that since they had not sworn to the statements in the certificate, a limited partnership had not been formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The appellants argue that an acknowledgment is constructively the same as swearing to a document and in any case meets the \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d test of \u00a7 50-45(2). We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">There is a marked difference between acknowledging a signature and signing a document under oath. An acknowledgment merely verifies that the person named executed the document in question. Code \u00a7 55-118.3. By swearing to a document, on the other hand, one vouches that the contents of the writing are true. A person who swears falsely may be guilty of a felony. Code \u00a7 18.2-434.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Support for our position is found in <em>Bergeson </em>v. <em>Life Insurance Corp. of America, </em>170 F. Supp. 150 (D. Utah 1958), <em>rev'd. on other grounds, </em>265 F.2d 227 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>360 U.S. 932 (1959). Dealing with the issue before us, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">In order for the liability of partners to be limited there must be substantial compliance with the statute providing for limited partnerships .... [The statute] requires that the certificate of partnership be signed and sworn to. This is not a mere formal requirement. There are good reasons why this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>statement should be sworn to, not least of which is to bring home to the signers the necessity of the certificate\u2019s being true and correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In 1981, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 50-45 to provide that the signers of the certificate should \u201cacknowledge\u201d rather than \u201cswear to\u201d it. Acts, 1981, ch. 277. In <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 16, 20, 215 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1975), we said: \u201c[I]n the field of statutory construction, a presumption normally arises that a change in law was intended when new provisions are added to prior legislation by an amendatory act.\u201d The 1981 amendment strengthens our view that the oath requirement of \u00a7 50-45 was not equivalent to an acknowledgment. We hold, therefore, that the appellants\u2019 failure to \u201cswear to\u201d the certificate was such a noncompliance with the requirements of Code \u00a7 50-45 as to render the certificate ineffective for the creation of a limited partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b200-13\"> \u00a7 50-45.
