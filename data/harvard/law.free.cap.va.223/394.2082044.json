V. McCoy, Jr.\u2019s bank account which the Bank, after McCoy\u2019s death, had transferred to a third party. In a bench trial, the trial court struck the Administratrix\u2019s evidence and granted summary judgment for the Bank. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">On March 28, 1975, McCoy opened an individual checking account with the Bank. Eighteen months later, McCoy telephoned Jimmy Vanover, the Bank president, stating that he had remarried and desired to change his account to a joint account. On October 11, 1976, he and \u201cKaye Stanley McCoy\u201d appeared at the Bank.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They added \u201cKaye McCoy\u2019s\u201d signature to the account card and requested new checks issued bearing both their names. The account card signed by McCoy is set forth as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">S.S. No. 230-36-7876 Firm Account [ ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">Individual Account [x]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">R. V.

V. McCoy, Jr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">s/ Kaye McCoy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">Box 734, Clintwood, Virginia 24228</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">On the reverse side of the account card, there is this notation: \u201cKaye McCoy\u2019s signature added Oct. 11, 1976.\u201d Vanover admitted that in another trial he testified that the Bank\u2019s practice was to note the word \u201cjoint\u201d on joint account cards. This notation did not appear on McCoy\u2019s account card.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Vanover\u2019s office lies next door to the apartment complex where McCoy lived. On December 4, 1976, Vanover was working in his office when he noticed an ambulance. Upon investigation, he learned of McCoy\u2019s death. The Administratrix received McCoy\u2019s personal effects and discovered the account\u2019s existence. She testified that she called Vanover on December 6, 1976, between 9:00 and 9:05 a.m. and instructed him not to honor any checks drawn on McCoy\u2019s account. According to Vanover, the Administratrix did not call him until 10:30 a.m., after \u201cKaye McCoy\u201d had cashed a check for $13,748.58. The Administratrix offered into evidence a cancelled check in the amount of $13,748.58, dated December 6, 1976, and drawn by \u201cKaye McCoy\u201d on McCoy\u2019s account payable to the Bank to close the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The trial court ruled that Code \u00a7 6.1-72<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (repealed, effective July 1, 1980) controlled, and struck the evidence of the Administratrix. It did not pass upon the ownership of the money between the estate of the decedent and the drawer of the check dated December 6, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">We first must determine what rights McCoy and Kaye Stanley had in the account. The account\u2019s signature card is a contract between a depositor and the Bank. <em>Thurston </em>v. <em>Maggard, </em>220 Va. 815, 818, 263 S.E.2d 64, 66 (1980). In <em>Colley </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>209 Va. 811, 814, 167 S.E.2d 317, 319 (1969), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>The rights of the parties here must be determined by rules pertaining to the interpretation of contracts .... It is for this reason that the provisions of the signature card become significant. The card constitutes the contract between the depositor of money, and the bank in which it is deposited, and it controls the terms and disposition of the account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">We hold that the trial court erroneously relied on Code \u00a7 6.1-72. That provision applied to deposits made \u201cunder the names of two or more persons.\u201d This account began as an individual account and remained unchanged. The account card, dated March 28, 1975, designates the account as an individual account in the name of R. V. McCoy, Jr., and lists only his social security number. The only change occurred 18 months later, when McCoy added \u201cKaye McCoy\u201d as an authorized signature and the Bank made a notation on the card\u2019s reverse side of the transaction date. If McCoy intended to convert the individual account to a joint account, he failed. He merely added a new authorized signature, but did not create a new account or amend the existing account.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Our next inquiry is whether the Bank properly paid a check issued after McCoy\u2019s death and signed by \u201cKaye McCoy.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> McCoy added the \u201cKaye McCoy\u201d signature for his personal convenience, thus establishing an agency relationship between himself and his girlfriend. Because death of a principal terminates an agent\u2019s authority, unless that authority is coupled with an interest, <em>King, Adm\u2019x. </em>v. <em>Beale, </em>198 Va. 802, 808-09, 96 S.E.2d 765, 770 (1957), \u201cKaye McCoy\u201d had no authority to write checks on the account after December 4, 1976. Simply put, \u201ca power ceases with the life of the person who gives it.\u201d <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Fawcett\u2019s Adm\u2019rs., </em>29 Va. (2 Leigh) 19, 23 (1830). Of course, Code \u00a7 8.4-405(1) provides that a customer\u2019s death will not revoke a bank\u2019s authority to pay a check until the bank knows of the death and has had a reasonable opportunity to act on it. In this case, the Bank had immediate, actual knowledge of McCoy\u2019s death and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>reasonable opportunity to act on this knowledge. It could have refused payment easily on the December 6 check.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">We conclude that \u201cKaye McCoy\u201d had the authority to sign checks on McCoy\u2019s account, that her authority ended at his death, and that the Bank knew of McCoy\u2019s death within a reasonable time to act on such knowledge. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter final judgment for the Administratrix in the amount of $13,748.58. This is without prejudice to the rights of the Bank to recover from the drawer of the check as provided in Code \u00a7 8.4-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-15\"> The evidence at trial revealed that McCoy and Kaye Stanley were living together unmarried.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b455-10\"> Code \u00a7 6.1-72 (Repealed effective July 1, 1980) <em>Deposits in names of two or more persons, or survivors; how discharged. </em>\u2014 When a deposit has been made, or shall hereafter be made, in any bank or trust company transacting business in this State, under the names of two or more persons, payable to either, or payable to the survivor or any survivor, such deposit, or any part thereof, or any interest or dividend thereon, may be paid to any of such persons, whether the other or others be living or not, and the receipt or acquittance of the person so paid shall be a valid, sufficient and complete release and discharge of the bank or trust company for any payment so made. The term \u201cdeposit\u201d shall include certificates of deposit, heretofore and hereafter issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b456-6\"> The Bank relies on Code \u00a7 8.4-405(2), which states: \u201cEven with knowledge a bank may for ten days after the date of death pay or certify checks drawn on or prior to that date unless ordered to stop payment by a person claiming an interest in the account.\u201d Because this provision specifically refers to checks drawn on or prior to the date of death, it cannot apply to this factual situation. McCoy died on December 4; \u201cKaye McCoy\u201d signed the check on December 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
