Complainant prayed that the court declare the agreement void, that Respondent be required to produce the agreement for cancellation, and that she be afforded other appropriate relief. Respondent denied the charges. After an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing on June 11, 1979, the trial court held that Complainant had not established her allegations and dismissed the bill of complaint. We affirm the decree of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>On or about February 1, 1974, Complainant, an 84-year-old widow residing on Shirley Plantation, Respondent\u2019s home, fell and broke her hip. She was hospitalized for approximately 60 days and then entered a Hopewell nursing home. The court appointed Respondent her committee, and he undertook the management of her affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In 1975, Respondent as committee, brought a suit to partition \u201cThe Forest\u201d, a large tract of land owned jointly by Complainant and another son, Shirley Harrison Carter. Respondent named as defendants Complainant and her three children, Shirley Harrison Carter, Gertrude Carter Macon, and himself. A court-ordered survey of the property precipitated a disagreement as to the boundary between \u201cThe Forest\u201d and two adjoining properties, \u201cShirley Woods\u201d which the Respondent owned, and \u201cHigh Hills\u201d which Shirley Harrison Carter owned. During the pendency of the partition suit, a new plat allocated the 36 acres now in controversy to the Complainant, and both Respondent and his brother, Shirley Harrison Carter, signed the plat acknowledging this fact. \u201cThe Forest\u201d was then partitioned by deed \u2014 187 acres to Shirley Harrison Carter and 223 acres to Complainant; the partition suit was dismissed; and on February 15, 1977, the court formally declared Complainant competent to manage her own affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Respondent grew dissatisfied with the allocation of the 36 acres to Complainant, and on March 11, he prepared a document for Complainant\u2019s signature disclaiming any intention to own the 36 acres in dispute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He carried the document to his mother in the nursing home. She signed it, and her sitter witnessed her signature. Then, Respondent telephoned his attorney and related the preceding events. His attorney advised him that the document would not accomplish his purpose. Respondent immediately prepared a second document, the \u201cboundary agreement,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>turned to the nursing home the same day, accompanied by an attorney and a Notary Public. Complainant executed the \u201cboundary agreement,\u201d and the Notary acknowledged her signature. On March 14, Respondent recorded the instrument. One week later, Complainant instituted this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Complainant stated in her May 31 deposition, taken in the presence of the trial judge, that she believed her children had affection for her; that she did not believe that any one of them would try, by fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, to do anything to her; that she recognized her signature oh the \u201cboundary agreement\u201d but that she had signed it without reading it. The sitter testified that Respondent persuaded Complainant to sign a document, telling her it was about \u201cgoing back to the South House,\u201d but when she (the sitter) signed the document, Respondent\u2019s briefcase covered the text. Respondent denied that he concealed the agreement and stated that he had returned to the nursing home that afternoon with the \u201cboundary agreement\u201d after consulting with his attorney. He testified that he read and explained the agreement to his mother and showed her a plat. He remembered her reading the agreement. The attorney testified that Complainant looked \u201cin real good shape\u201d and was \u201cvery keen\u201d; that she read the agreement and asked Respondent several questions, although he did not remember Respondent reading the document to her. The Notary substantially corroborated the attorney\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">We set forth our standard of review in <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>202 Va. 229, 234-35, 117 S.E.2d 63, 67 (1960). When a chancellor hears evidence, <em>ore tenus, </em>his decree acquires the same weight as a jury\u2019s verdict. We may only reverse the decree if it is plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>wrong or without evidence to support it. We examine the record in the light most favorable to the prevailing parties and determine whether substantial credible evidence supports the chancellor\u2019s decision. <em>Accord, White and P &amp; W Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>213 Va. 129, 189 S.E.2d 315 (1972); <em>Flippo </em>v. <em>Broome, </em>202 Va. 919, 121 S.E.2d 490 (1961); Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The Complainant argues that the relationship of the parties and her failure to read the document support her fraud allegations. We disagree. When a plaintiff alleges fraud or coercion, he has the burden of proving it by clear, cogent and convincing evidence. <em>Malbon </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>185 Va. 748, 40 S.E.2d 183 (1946), a case factually similar to the one before us, illustrates this principle. The plaintiff, Davis, an 80-year-old farmer, conveyed his land to Malbon, his grandson, in consideration of Malbon paying $336.11 in delinquent taxes and an outstanding $396 debt to a third person. Later, Davis testified that he only intended to record his debt to Malbon, not to convey the property. He denied that the attorney who drew up the deed read it to him. Testimony from those present at the transaction refuted Davis\u2019 testimony. The trial court found fraud and undue influence, but this court ruled that the evidence was insufficient to support that decision. We reasoned that adults deal with each other as adults. Differences in age and close relationship of blood do not destroy this rationale, especially when one party charges another with fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 756, 40 S.E.2d at 187. Merely showing that a mother-son relationship exists will not support a charge of either actual or constructive fraud. Further, Complainant\u2019s deposition belies her present assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Complainant next relies on her failure to read the \u201cboundary agreement.\u201d The long established rule in Virginia places the responsibility on the grantor to read the deed. Failure to read it will not relieve him of obligations entered under it, and will not constitute fraud unless the grantee prevented the grantor\u2019s reading or induced the grantor not to read it. <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Wynn, </em>137 Va. 186, 195-96, 119 S.E. 133, 136 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Further, Complainant contends that the lack of consideration for the transfer supports an inference of constructive fraud. The chancellor drew the contrary conclusion from the circumstances, and we think the evidence abundantly supports that conclusion. In <em>Planters Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>E. G. Heflin Co., </em>166 Va. 166, 173, 184 S.E. 216, 219 (1936), this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Mere failure of consideration or want of consideration will not ordinarily invalidate an executed contract. The owner of the historic estate . . . can give it away, and he can sell it for a peppercorn. Courts, though they have long arms, cannot relieve one of the consequences of a contract merely because it was unwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Complainant principally relies upon <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>193 Va. 735, 71 S.E.2d 181 (1952). We think her reliance is misplaced. In <em>Jackson, </em>a brother, acting as the financial adviser to his widowed sister, bought from her a tract of land for $275. Soon afterwards, he sold the land\u2019s timber for more than ten times the purchase price. The evidence further revealed that the land contained other valuable timber, a fact unknown to either party prior to the sale. The court found constructive fraud for three reasons: The intimate relationship of the parties, the grossly inadequate consideration, and the ignorance of both parties of the presence of the valuable timber on the tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The instant situation differs greatly. Respondent had a bona fide claim to the 36 acres, declaring that it had originally belonged to him and he had agreed to the allotment under the misapprehension that family peace would be restored; when that did not materialize, he sought restoration of what he had conveyed away. Familial amenities would suggest that he probably should have discussed the matter with his brother, sister, and brother-in-law, but the law does not compel this. The family relationship had deteriorated to the point where the parties were dealing with each other at arms\u2019 length. The chancellor, having personally heard the testimony of all the witnesses, was required to make findings of fact, and he concluded that no fraud, duress, deceit, or other impropriety had been employed by Respondent in the execution of the boundary agreement of March 11, 1977. His findings are amply supported by the evidence. Accordingly, the final decree of August 7, 1979, will be</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-15\"> Emily Harrison Carter died while this appeal was pending.
