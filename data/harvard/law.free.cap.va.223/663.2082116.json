The principal issue on appeal is whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">On July 15, 1980, about 3:00 p.m., the victim, Mary Elizabeth Pugh, was brought by ambulance from her home in Buena Vista to a Lexington hospital. The child was dead on arrival. The cause of death was acute laryngotracheal obstruction by black pepper.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">The autopsy showed she had sustained multiple abrasions and contusions \u201cof varying ages\u201d about her face, arms, chest, back, buttocks, and legs. Even though three years old, the child weighed merely 17 pounds and was two and one-half feet tall, having the stature of a two-year-old and the weight of an average nine-months-old infant. The child\u2019s torso \u201cwas skin and bones\u201d with no subcutaneous fat. \u201cIt looked like the baby had been starved,\u201d testified a physician in attendance at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">According to the medical examiner\u2019s report, the child\u2019s trachea was completely occluded \u201cby large quantities of black pepper\u201d extending downward into both bronchial branches. The respiratory passages were also blocked by pepper. In addition, the stomach was \u201ccompletely packed with large quantities of black pepper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>The record shows that the defendant, about 30 years of age with a seventh-grade education, lived separate from her husband under poor economic conditions in Buena Vista with four of her young children. During the early afternoon of the \u201cextremely hot\u201d day in question, defendant was at home with her mother and children when the victim \u201cjust kept fretting and crying.\u201d Defendant\u2019s mother noticed her daughter was very nervous and saw her smack the victim, observing bruises about the child\u2019s body. The mother left defendant\u2019s home about 12:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Shortly thereafter, the victim was still crying, \u201cwhining,\u201d and was attempting to drink from \u201cthe baby\u2019s bottle,\u201d contrary to defendant\u2019s instructions to her. According to a statement made by defendant to the police the day following the crime, the victim \u201cgot on my nerves and I just hit her.\u201d Defendant used her hands, \u201csometimes [her] fist\u201d to strike the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Then defendant forcibly put pepper into the child\u2019s mouth, stating she \u201cjust poured it from the box in her mouth.\u201d When asked the reason for placing the pepper in the child\u2019s mouth, defendant stated to the investigator, \u201cWell, people always told me to put soap or something like that in their mouth when they cuss ... to keep her from doing it.\u201d Defendant told the police, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to kill her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">About 2:45 p.m., \u201ca young boy\u201d telephoned the Buena Vista police dispatcher and reported \u201chis sister was asleep and they could not wake her up.\u201d The dispatcher, having difficulty understanding the caller, asked to talk to anyone else at the home. Then defendant came to the telephone and said, \u201cThis is Mrs. Pugh, my daughter is unconscious and I cannot wake her up.\u201d When asked whether the defendant was \u201cfrantic\u201d during her request for help, the dispatcher testified the \u201crequest was as matter of fact as though she was telling me the time of day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Shortly thereafter, defendant\u2019s nephew arrived at her home and found defendant giving the victim mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Defendant was \u201cvery ups\u00e9t,\u201d was crying, and was saying, \u201cMary, please breathe.\u201d In a few minutes, the first-aid squad arrived. Efforts to revive the child were unsuccessful. The victim then was taken to the hospital and defendant remained at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Defendant contends on appeal the evidence was insufficient to show she was \u201cmotivated\u201d by malice and thus the trial court erroneously convicted her of second-degree murder. Referring to the evidence, defendant notes that the day in question was \u201cuncom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>fortably hot;\u201d that the children were \u201cfussy because of the heat;\u201d that she was extremely upset; that she did not realize the quantity of pepper administered was a lethal dose; and that she used the pepper to make the child behave without the intent to cause death.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Defendant also argues that other evidence rebuts the existence of malice. She points to her efforts to revive the child, and says the attempt inadvertently packed pepper into the respiratory system rather than cleared the air passages so the child could breathe. She also notes the medical testimony by physicians who examined and treated her at Central State Hospital, where she was sent for a court-ordered examination. One physician said she was a very unhappy, depressed, and frustrated person living an impoverished existence who, in his opinion, lacked the \u201cintent to do harm to the child.\u201d We do not agree with defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">When sufficiency of the evidence is attacked, the judgment of the trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict, and will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 609, 613, 212 S.E.2d 268, 271 (1975). When, as here, conflicting inferences flow from the undisputed evidence, principles of appellate procedure require us to adopt those conclusions most favorable to the Commonwealth if fairly deducible from the proven facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">In Virginia, every unlawful homicide is presumed to be murder of the second degree. When the Commonwealth proves an unlawful homicide and establishes the accused as the criminal agent, the presumption, which is no more than an inference, arises, and the defendant has the burden of going forward with some evidence to show circumstances of \u201cjustification, excuse, or alleviation.\u201d <em>Hodge </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 338, 341, 343, 228 S.E.2d 692, 694, 696 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-32 distinguishes the degrees of murder but does not define it. Murder at common law is a homicide commited with malice, either express or implied. <em>Biddle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 14, 20, 141 S.E.2d 710, 714 (1965). And whether a defendant acted with malice is generally a question to be decided by the trier of fact. <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>131 Va. 709, 714, 109 S.E. 477, 478 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Express malice is evidenced when \u201cone person kills another with a sedate, deliberate mind, and formed design.\u201d <em>M\u2019Whirt\u2019s Case, </em>44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 594, 604 (1846). Implied malice exists when any purposeful, cruel act is committed by one individual against another without any, or without great provocation; \u201cin other words, if the punishment inflicted for a slight transgression is in its nature out of all reason and beyond all proportion to the offense offered, then the inference of law is that the perpetrator was actuated by malice.\u201d <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>167 Va. 451, 455, 187 S.E. 437, 439 (1936). Generally, implied malice is equivalent to \u201cconstructive, malice;\u201d that is, \u201cmalice as such does not exist but the law regards the circumstances of the act as so harmful that the law punishes the act as though malice did in fact exist.\u201d 1 <em>Whartons Criminal Law and Procedure </em>\u00a7 245 at 529 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The circumstances of this case plainly show that the defendant committed a heinous, cruel act, with hardly any provocation. The deed was wholly unreasonable, and beyond all proportion to any ordinary response to the conduct of a recalcitrant three-year-old. The frail child, obviously suffering from malnutrition and weighing only 17 pounds, was beaten by defendant with her hands and fist. The child must have been in a weakened condition not only from lack of food but from past blows to her face, arms, chest, back, buttocks, and legs. If that was not enough, the accused, by force, poured so much pepper into the child\u2019s mouth that her windpipe and her bronchial tubes were fully blocked by the substance. Moreover, the child\u2019s stomach was \u201ccompletely packed with large quantities\u201d of the pepper. While other inferences may flow from this evidence, we hold the trial court\u2019s conclusion that implied malice was shown beyond a reasonable doubt was fairly deducible from the proven facts, and we will not disturb the finding that defendant is guilty of murder of the second degree. <em>See generally </em>Annot,, 89 A.L.R.2d 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Defendant raises two other issues; neither has merit. She contends her uncounseled, post-crime statement to the police was involuntary. Before questioning defendant, the investigator fully advised her according to <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). The officer then conducted a balanced, compassionate interview, at the conclusion of which defendant acknowledged she had responded to the questions voluntarily. Having studied the entire statement in light of the conditions under which it was given, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>we think the trial judge properly admitted into evidence through testimony of the interrogator excerpts from defendant\u2019s interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Defendant also argues the trial court erroneously admitted into evidence a hearsay statement made by her estranged husband in the presence of a physician at the Lexington hospital. After he determined the child\u2019s condition on the day in question, the physician went to a hospital room adjoining the emergency room and said to the parents, \u201c \u2018Your child is dead,\u2019 \u201d stating the baby had died of asphyxiation. Immediately, the father \u201cacted very shocked,\u201d turned to the defendant, and said, \u201c \u2018Oh, no, not again.\u2019 \u201d This colloquy was admitted over defendant\u2019s objection through testimony of the physician, and properly so. The father\u2019s out-of-court declaration was admissible under the spontaneous, excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. The statement was prompted by a startling event, announcement of the unexpected death of one\u2019s child. It was not the product of premeditation, reflection, or design, and was made under such circumstances as to preclude the presumption it was uttered as the result of deliberation. <em>Goins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 285, 287, 237 S.E.2d 136, 138 (1977).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of conviction will be</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\"><em> </em>We likewise reject defendant's contention that the husband\u2019s extra-judicial statement should have been excluded as a privileged communication.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
