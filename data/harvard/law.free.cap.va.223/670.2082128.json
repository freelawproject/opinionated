The Department\u2019s intervention was prompted by discovery in the emergency room of a Martinsville hospital that one of the children had been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">The children were placed in foster care. In July of 1980, the petitions giving rise to this appeal were filed by the Department in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court of Henry County. As to each child, the Department sought \u201cplacement in permanent custody with termination of the parents residual rights.\u201d Following a hearing and review of a detailed report of the Department, the juvenile court granted the petitions and entered a \u201cCommitment for Adoption\u201d in each case in November of 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">The mother of the girls, the father being deceased, appealed the juvenile court orders and filed a motion in the circuit court for custody of her daughters. Upon review of the prior department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>report, of a written psychological evaluation of one of the children, of an update to the prior report, and upon consideration of the evidence presented during a January 1981 ore tenus hearing, the circuit judge terminated the mother\u2019s residual parental rights. The court ordered that the legal custody of the children be vested in the Department with full. authority to place the children for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Upon appeal, the sole issue is whether the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s ruling, based on Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">This is the first case with sufficiency of the evidence the issue that we have decided under subsection (B) since \u00a7 16.1-283 was enacted in 1977.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In pertinent part, the subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">\u201cThe residual parental rights of a parent ... of a child found by the court to be neglected or abused and placed in foster care as a result of . . . court commitment, . . . may be terminated if the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interests of the child and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">1.

It is not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in such neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow the child\u2019s safe return to . . . her parent . . . within a reasonable period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">\u201cProof of any of the following shall constitute prima facie evidence of the conditions set forth in subparagraph B 2 hereof:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">c. The parent or parents, without good cause, have not responded to or followed through with appropriate, available and reasonable rehabilitative efforts on the part of social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>designed to reduce, eliminate or prevent the neglect or abuse of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The facts are undisputed. The appellant-mother Hestelle Crews Richardson, age 26 at the time of the circuit court hearing, was married in 1972 to Robert Lee Crews when she was age 18, having completed the fourth grade at the age of 16. The children were born to the couple in 1973, 1976 and 1977. During the first part of the marriage, the Crewses lived in a trailer home \u201cbeside\u201d his parents. Later, marital problems developed and she went with the children to live with her mother. Crews was never regularly employed and refused to let his wife work.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In January of 1978, Crews was shot and killed by his wife\u2019s brother. After her husband\u2019s death, the wife lived several months with her mother, sleeping on the floor \u201con a pallet\u201d with the children. The children\u2019s mother then \u201cgot involved\u201d with Raymond David Crews, her brother-in-law, and began living with him with the children. For a while during this period she worked at \u201cNationwide Homes.\u201d The couple and the children were being supported in part by Social Security funds being paid monthly to the children for the death of their father. The total monthly amount was nearly $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Crews \u201cgot along good\u201d with the children and their mother for six or seven months. Then he became irritated because the children were \u201caround\u201d during mealtime. On November 27, 1978, Crews beat the youngest child \u201cfor not eating.\u201d According to the evidence, Crews believed \u201cthe children were supposed to eat as much as he did.\u201d The next day, the mother took the child to the Martinsville hospital and gave conflicting accounts of how the extensive bruising evident about the child\u2019s buttocks and left leg had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The child\u2019s condition was reported to the Department. The three children were immediately committed to the Department\u2019s temporary custody pending a thorough investigation of the circumstances under which the children were living. The other two children had not been abused but the Department found they had been neglected. All three children were dirty, were not properly clothed on the cold November day, were hungry, and \u201chad no stable living situation at that time.\u201d It was learned that the social services department of an adjoining county had received complaints about the \u201cfamily\u201d and the treatment of the children when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>they resided there prior to November of 1978. The Henry County Department then began \u201cworking with the mother\u201d so the children could be returned to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">After the children were removed from the mother\u2019s custody, she resumed living with Crews at a different location in Henry County. In January of 1979, Crews received a jail sentence upon conviction of abusing the child. After Crews served the sentence, the mother asked the Department \u201con many occasions\u201d that Crews be permitted to visit the children with her. Then, during February of 1979, the mother advised Crews she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to have no more to do with him.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Crews began threatening her, shooting at her on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In March of 1979, the mother married Jesse D. Richardson, who had been married twice before and had one child in each marriage. The validity of the present marriage is doubtful because the first divorce and the second marriage may not be legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">From April to June, 1979, Richardson was in jail for \u201cnonsupport.\u201d From August 1979 to June of 1980, he was incarcerated for arson and shooting into the home of the parents of Raymond Crews, the brother-in-law. During portions of these periods of Richardson\u2019s incarceration, the mother resumed seeing Crews and sought to have the Department permit Crews to visit the children. In May of 1979 Crews took her to a Danville hospital. She was sent to the Southern Virginia Mental Health Institute where she remained for almost two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">During the period from November of 1978, when the Department obtained temporary custody, until December of 1979, the mother \u201cworked really hard\u201d with the Department in an effort to regain custody of the children. She was employed briefly at the \u201cAmerican Furniture Factory\u201d and obtained a place to live separate from her relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">The mother\u2019s efforts were in response to the provisions of a plan established by the Department to assist the mother, the Department being concerned about the mother\u2019s previous instability and the poor living conditions for the children. According to the evidence, the Department made general counseling available to her, directed her to report to the Virginia Employment Commission, discussed vocational rehabilitation with her, gave her mental health counseling, referred her to a legal aid organization for assistance with her legal problems, referred her to the Health De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>partment for medical services, suggested adult education, and provided her rental assistance in locating a place to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">During this period, the children visited with the mother once each month during January, February, April, July, August and December of 1979. There has been no contact between the mother and children since 1979, except a visit in December of 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">From December 1979 to April of 1980, the mother did not contact the Department. She testified that she had changed her living arrangements, apparently moving to adjoining Pittsylvania County, that she had no funds to make long-distance telephone calls, and that she had no means of transportation available. Although many appointments were scheduled, the mother did not meet with a Department representative until May 30, 1980. Because of the mother\u2019s apparent lack of interest and because the children became \u201cextremely upset\u201d during the previous visitations, the Department decided to schedule no visitation until the court hearings could be held following institution of this proceeding in July of 1980. Testimony showed that as the result of 1979 visitation with the mother, the children had \u201ctemper tantrums, excessive crying for several days, regressing with bedwetting.\u201d During the December 1980 visitation, after the juvenile court hearing, two of the children did not recognize their mother initially, \u201cdid not get upset, [and] did not react.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">At the time of the January 1981 circuit court hearing, the children had adjusted \u201cextremely well\u201d in their foster homes. The oldest child \u201cis a very good student in school.\u201d The evidence further showed that Richardson, who has a mental disorder causing him to be \u201cextremely nervous at times,\u201d was employed as a truck driver at a salary of about $130 per week. He also receives about $150 per month for a military disability received in Vietnam. Richardson is required to pay over $200 per month support for the children of his previous marriages and was $4455 in arrears as of April 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">At the time of the hearing, the mother was unemployed and living with Richardson in his Henry County home near Irisburg. While the house has four rooms, it has \u201cno running water, no plumbing and an out house is in the back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Although during comments from the bench following the hearing the trial judge referred to subsection (C) of the statute, we are satisfied the court based the decision on subsection (B). This is because the provisions of the final order, entered about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>four months later, track the language of subsection (B). The court found by clear and convincing evidence that the infants are neglected children; that it is in their best interest for the mother\u2019s residual parental rights to be terminated; \u201cthat the neglect suffered by these children presents a substantial threat to their life, health and development, and it is not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in such neglect can be substantially corrected or eliminated as [to] allow the children\u2019s safe return to their mother; [and] that the mother has not responded to or followed through with appropriate, available, and reasonable rehabilitative efforts on the part of social, medical, mental health, or other rehabilitative agencies designed to reduce, eliminate, and prevent the neglect of the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">On appeal, the mother directs much of her argument to subsection (C) of the statute. This is irrelevant in view of the trial court\u2019s explicit holding based on (B) in the final order. Addressing subsection (B), the mother argues the evidence was insufficient because the Department offered no proof to rebut her testimony that she had ceased association with Crews, the individual \u201cwho caused her to lose custody of her children initially.\u201d She also argues the Department introduced no evidence that she \u201cfailed, without good cause, to comply with their guidelines for regaining custody.\u201d She contends the record is silent on a specific plan established by the Department and that, while she was referred to several agencies, the planning was left to her. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Referring to subsection (B), we see there is no controversy about sufficiency of the proof of certain statutory requisites. The mother does not attack the findings that the children were neglected and that such neglect presents a serious and substantial threat to their lives, health or development. Indeed, except by inference, she does not even dispute that the best interests of the children will be served by terminating her parental rights. She only argues that the proof fails to show that it is not reasonably likely the condition which resulted in the neglect can be corrected within a reasonable time, because there is no showing she has unjustifiably failed to respond to the rehabilitation efforts of the Department. The evidence clearly and convincingly demonstrates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In comments from the bench following the hearing, the trial judge emphasized the mother\u2019s unwillingness to create any stability in her life and to make any adequate plans to, within a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>able time, provide a suitable home environment for her children. The court pointed out that at the time of the hearing, held over two years after the children had been removed from her custody, the mother was actually in a worse position to provide a proper environment for the children than she had been in 1978. We agree with this assessment of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The neglect of the children grew out of the mother\u2019s transient, nomadic, unstable conduct, combined with her unwise selection of male companionship. The evidence shows that situation has not changed. The record establishes the Department was diligent in offering the mother a wide range of planned rehabilitative services designed to aid her in improving the conditions that brought about the neglect. She cooperated with the Department for a year but then failed to make any further effort, using as the excuse that she could not afford telephone calls to an adjoining county and had no means of transportation. A mother who had a sincere desire to maintain contact with and retain the right to her children would not be deterred by such minor obstacles, especially when the mails were available for communication to one who, as here, is able to read and write. In addition, even during the period she maintained contact with the Department, she sought repeatedly to inject into the visitation routine the very person, Crews, who was the abuser of one of her children. Moreover, even while she did not have the responsibility of caring for the children, the mother had no regular employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">In sum, the Department established that the mother, without good cause, failed to respond to their rehabilitative efforts. Under the statute, this is prima facie evidence of the conditions set forth in subparagraph (B)(2) of the statute. Consequently, and because the mother did not go forward with sufficient evidence to the contrary, the requirements of (B)(2) have been proven, that is, it is not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in the neglect can be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow the children\u2019s safe return to the mother within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">For these reasons, and because it is in the best interests of these children, we hold the trial court correctly terminated the mother\u2019s residual parental rights. Accordingly, the judgment appealed from will be</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b730-12\"> For cases decided under subsection (C) of the statute, see <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Lynchburg Div. of Social Serv., </em>223 Va. 213, 288 S.E.2d 399 (1982); <em>Toombs </em>v. <em>Lynchburg Div. of Social Serv., </em>223 Va. 225, 288 S.E.2d 405 (1982); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Lynchburg Div. of Social Serv., </em>223 Va. 235, 288 S.E.2d 410 (1982); <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Roanoke Dept. of Human Res., </em>220 Va. 921, 265 S.E.2d 692 (1980).

However, the mother thereafter \u201cworked really hard\u201d with the Department to regain custody of her children, married Richardson and ended her association with Crews. She testified that she complied with every suggestion the Department made. In December 1979 the Department\u2019s caseworker was \u201cfeeling very confident that she [the mother] would get the kids back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The Department\u2019s attitude toward her changed when it lost contact with her for the first four months of 1980. During this time Richardson was incarcerated. The mother was unable to find work and was forced to live in conditions of great poverty with a sister in Pittsylvania County. She testified that she had no money, had no access to a car, and that her sister refused to drive her to Martinsville. \u201cEvery time I would go to borrow a phone from somebody they\u2019d say I\u2019d run their bill up and I wasn\u2019t working, and I wouldn\u2019t pay for it.\u201d Although she was unable to make the necessary long distance calls, she did write a letter to the Department asking for an appointment. When this was arranged, she was unable to keep it because her sister \u201clet on like she didn\u2019t have no gas and the car wouldn\u2019t crank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The Department evidently rejected these explanations and filed petitions for termination of parental rights. Thereafter it was relatively easy for the Department to present evidence adverse to the mother, e.g., (1) the children were at first upset by her visitations but, as time passed, the younger two no longer recognized her, (2) the children were doing \u201cextremely well\u201d in foster homes, and (3) she is still poor and unemployed, and lives with Richardson in a house which lacks running water.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">These cases have a way of developing a tragic momentum of their own. No doubt the Department found good foster homes for the children in which they would adjust well, with the passage of time. It is also not surprising that visitations with their mother would at first upset them, and later become meaningless if their separation from her were sufficiently protracted. For all of this we have only the delays of litigation to blame. These children have now been away from their mother for over three and one-half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>years. The longer the separation lasts, the more insistent such evidence becomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The mother\u2019s relative poverty and fourth-grade education, contributing to her limited employment opportunities, go no further to disqualify her as a parent than does her home\u2019s lack of running water. We have not reached a point where the State may take over the children of those who have the misfortune to be poor.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The problems giving rise to the original custody placement were resolved. This case turns on whether the mother failed, \u201cwithout good cause, ... to follow through with appropriate, available and reasonable rehabilitative efforts\u201d proposed by the Department, and whether the termination of parental rights is \u201cin the best interests of the children].\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(2)(c). The Department has the burden of establishing these matters by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>I think it failed to do so. <em>See also: Santosky </em>v.
