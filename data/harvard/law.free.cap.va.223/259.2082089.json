See <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Rich. Newspapers, Inc., </em>223 Va. 245, 288 S.E.2d 415 (1982), and <em>City of Danville </em>v. <em>Laird, </em>223 Va. 271, 288 S.E.2d 429 (1982), both this day decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">In this case, Richard R. Nageotte and B. Calvin Burns filed in the trial court a bill of complaint, subsequently amended, against defendants, James B. Howard, Woodrow W. Saft, and Reginald P. Hayden, individually, and collectively as the Board of Supervisors of King George County, and John P. Harris, III, Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and County Attorney of King George County. The amended bill of complaint alleged that the Board violated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Act by conducting meetings without proper notice to the public, by failing to maintain and make available for inspection records of such meetings, and by holding executive or closed meetings in violation of Code \u00a7 2.1-344. Complainants sought to have the court invalidate all actions taken in violation of the Act, enjoin defendants from further violations, award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to complainants, determine that the violations were willful and knowing, and impose upon defendants in their individual capacities a civil penalty of not less than $25 nor more than $500 for such willful and knowing violations. An answer was filed on behalf of the defendants denying any violations of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The trial court, after hearing the evidence <em>ore tenus </em>on four separate dates, filed a written opinion dated May 22, 1979, ruling in favor of defendants. Complainants filed a motion to reconsider on the ground that the court\u2019s opinion failed to address certain meetings which complainants had alleged were held in violation of the Act. In its final order entered June 18, 1979, the court referred to complainants\u2019 motion to reconsider but implicitly overruled it by awarding judgment in favor of defendants and dismissing the cause with prejudice. We granted Nageotte and Burns an appeal limited to the questions whether the trial court erred in not finding that the Board violated the Act by not stating the specific purpose for going into executive session, and whether the court erred in finding that the Board did not violate the Act by holding specific meetings without giving public notice and recording minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">On November 9, 1978, the Board, consisting of three members, convened in a special meeting. The minutes of the meeting show that it was called for the purpose of discussing with representatives of DANO Resource Recovery, Inc., \u201cthe company\u2019s plans to locate in the county and the pertinent permits which must be obtained.\u201d After Board members had expressed a desire to consider with open minds the proposed DANO operation, which they recognized as a controversial issue, the DANO representatives made an extensive presentation. They explained that DANO proposed to transport solid waste and sewage sludge from Washington, D.C., for processing into usable compost with \u201cthree times the nutrient value of cow manure\u201d in a $10 million facility to be constructed in King George County. The representatives described various safety and screening measures to protect the public, and responded to questions. The minutes reflect the following actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Upon a motion by Mr. Saft, seconded by Mr. Hayden, and carried unanimously, the Board went into Executive Session to confer with legal counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">On a motion by Mr. Hayden, seconded by Mr. Saft, and carried unanimously, the Board returned to Public Session.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">Mr. Howard stated that during Executive Session the Board had received the advice of counsel and no decisions had been made by the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The meeting was adjourned at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The Executive Secretary of the County testified that the minutes of the November 9 meeting reflected typical motions of the Board to convene in executive session, and that such motions appeared consistently in the minutes. She said that she did not attend executive sessions and that no minutes were taken at such sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">On November 16, the Board held a regular meeting and considered many matters, including a presentation by the King George Environmental Association of a statement in opposition to the DANO proposal. Immediately following this presentation, the minutes show that on motion unanimously approved \u201cthe Board went into Executive Session to receive advice of legal counsel.\u201d Upon returning to public session, the chairman stated that \u201cduring Executive Session the Board had received the advice of counsel and no decisions were reached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Later in the meeting a second executive session was convened \u201cfor legal counsel.\u201d Upon returning to public session, the chairman reported that no decision had been reached in the closed session. The Board then approved motions directing the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney \u201cto contact the Attorney\u2019s General\u2019s office to arrange an appearance before the Board of Supervisors to render legal advice,\u201d and directing the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney to represent the defendants in a certain law action. The record shows that this law action was filed by Nageotte and Burns against members of the Board individually, alleging interference with a contract. A non-suit subsequently was taken in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">The Board convened in a regular meeting on January 4, 1979, at which many items of business were considered. After setting dates for public hearings concerning a possible application to a federal agency for a Community Development Grant, the Board approved a motion to go into executive session, \u201cfor legal counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>and to discuss personnel matters.\u201d Following the closed session the chairman stated that the Board in executive session had discussed \u201clegal and personnel matters and no decisions had been reached.\u201d The Board then passed a resolution concerning the location of a proposed new post office, and a detailed resolution opposing location by Southern Marine and Salvage Company of a composting facility (the DANO project).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">On January 18, the Board met again in regular session and discussed a variety of subjects. After approving a request to use a County facility, the Board went into executive session \u201cfor legal counsel.\u201d Returning to public session, the Chairman announced that the Board had gone into executive session \u201cfor legal counsel and no action had been taken or decisions made.\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney then advised the Board that upon investigation he had found discrepancies in the applications of Southern Marine and Salvage Company for permits for the DANO project. Thereupon, the Board approved a motion revoking the building permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In addition to the foregoing meetings of the Board, there was evidence that two members met with the County Administrator on the morning of November 12, a Sunday, and that all three members met in the office of the Attorney General of Virginia on November 20. No minutes were kept on either occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">At trial, Nageotte, representing himself and Burns, examined as adverse witnesses the Board members and others present during executive sessions of the Board, for the purpose of proving that in such sessions the Board members discussed and acted on nonexempt topics in violation of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board members testified, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>consistently with the Board minutes, that they discussed only legal matters relating to the DANO project. They declined to divulge the details or substance of their discussions with counsel on the ground that such information was privileged because of the attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">After hearing the witnesses, the trial court found that none of the discussions conducted in executive session violated the Act. Nageotte and Burns have not assigned error to this finding, but they challenge on appeal the adequacy of the motions to go into executive session.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In <em>Marsh </em>and <em>City of Danville, supra, </em>we held that a motion to meet in executive session that follows the language of the statutory exemption and identifies the agenda item or items to be discussed with legal counsel is sufficient. In the present case, none of the motions followed the language of the applicable statutory exemption. Since the November 9 meeting was a special meeting limited to consideration of the DANO project, the purpose of the executive session necessarily related to that business. Likewise, the first executive session convened at the November 16 meeting apparently was related to the DANO project because the closed session immediately followed the presentation of a statement opposing the project. At the January 4 and January 18 meetings there were no identifiable connections between the motions to go into executive session and business then under consideration by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">On appeal, the Board members contend that by stating that the executive sessions would be held for legal advice, or the equivalent, they adequately stated the purpose in compliance with \u00a7 2.1-344(b). They say that the statute does not require that the subject matter be stated. But, as we have ruled in <em>Marsh and-City of Danville, </em>we construe the Act to require that the purpose be identified with the applicable item of business on the agenda where the executive session is convened under the provisions of \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>2.1- 344(a)(6). One of the executive sessions, however, was convened to confer with counsel and also to consider personnel matters, presumably under \u00a7 2.1-344(a)(l). Assuming, without deciding, that two exempt topics could be discussed in the same session, we hold that it is not necessary to identify the personnel in convening an executive session to consider personnel matters. We perceive no legislative intent to require such an unnecessary and disruptive act as a prerequisite to invoking this exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The trial court acknowledged the deficiencies in the motions, and cautioned the Board to state in the future with greater specificity its purpose in convening in executive session. Nevertheless, the court ruled that there must be \u201cmore proof of violation of the Act than has been adduced ... to establish such wrongdoing as is alleged in Complainants\u2019 Bill of Complaint.\u201d In spite of the inadequacies in the motions to go into executive session, therefore, the court ruled that the evidence of violations was insufficient to entitle Nageotte and Burns to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Consistent with the principles set forth in <em>Marsh </em>and <em>City of Danville, </em>we hold that the Board\u2019s motions to go into executive session did not adequately comply with the provisions of Code \u00a7 2.1- 344(b). The trial court found no evidence of bad faith in the Board\u2019s motions to go into executive session at the meetings of November 9 and November 16. No such finding was made as to the motions made at the January 4 and January 18 meetings, but the record shows no evidence of bad faith in closing those meetings. The evidence is uncontradicted that the Board acted in accordance with the advice of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Nageotte and Burns sought in this proceeding to invalidate the Board\u2019s actions in respect to the DANO project. The Board minutes and the testimony of Board members, however, showed that the Board voted in open meeting on all matters relating to DANO in compliance with \u00a7 2.1-344(c). Therefore, the Board actions are not invalidated by violations of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Nageotte and Burns contend that the court erred in finding that the Board did not \u201cmeet\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2.1-341<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on November 12 and November 20. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The evidence as to the alleged meeting of November 12 was conflicting. Testimony by DANO officials tended to imply that the Board reversed itself on granting necessary permits between Friday, November 10, and Sunday, November 12. One DANO witness testified that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney told him on November 12, that a meeting took place at Hot Springs at 2:00 a.m. on that date. The evidence for the Board was that the two Board members who attended a Virginia Association of Counties conference at Hot Springs did not leave the county for that purpose until later that day. There was evidence that the two Board members met with the County Administrator on the morning of the 12th but only for the purpose of discussing matters unrelated to DANO concerning the Administrator\u2019s inability to accompany them to Hot Springs and topics that he wished to have considered at the conference. The Board members and the County Administrator testified that there had been no meeting and no directive concerning DANO over this weekend. The trial court resolved these issues of fact in favor of the Board and held that there were no \u201cmeetings\u201d held within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>As to the conference in the Attorney General\u2019s office on November 20, the evidence was that the meeting was only for the purpose of gathering information \u201cto find out again the role of the County meshing with the State agencies in this process\u201d of issuing certain permits for the DANO project. No public notice of the meeting was given and no minutes were kept. Representatives of several State agencies were present, and the public was not excluded. The only evidence on the issue was that the Board did not arrange the meeting to conduct any public business, but that it merely sought information as to the respective responsibilities of the State and the local governing body. The evidence supports the implicit finding by the trial court that this conference was not a \u201cmeeting\u201d as defined in \u00a7 2.1-341 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">In summary, the record shows that the Board, while acting in good faith with the advice of counsel, failed to comply with the provisions of the Act in convening executive sessions. Since there were no willful and knowing violations, there could be no imposition of civil penalties under \u00a7 2.1-346.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There were no discussions of nonexempt subjects in the executive sessions and no decisions were made in such sessions. Under \u00a7 2.1-344(c) the validity of actions taken by the Board in open meetings is not affected by violations of the Act, regardless of what was done or said in executive sessions. There were no \u201cmeetings\u201d within the meaning of the Act on November 12 or November 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">It is apparent, therefore, that Nageotte and Burns were not prejudiced by the Board\u2019s violation of the Act in approving closed sessions. Nevertheless, they have asked us to enjoin the Board from future violations of the Act. We decline to do so. The awarding of injunctive relief is generally discretionary. In this case, the trial court used precatory language \u201cto suggest that the purpose of future Executive Sessions be spelled out in as great detail as practicable.\u201d We see no necessity for enlarging this suggestion into the formal structure of an injunction. We are unwilling to impose a restraining order against a governing body which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>in good faith committed unsubstantial violations based on an erroneous construction of the Act. Under \u00a7 2.1-346, a single violation of the Act is sufficient to permit the granting of relief based on the inference that future violations will occur, but such an extraordinary and drastic remedy is not to be casually or perfunctorily ordered and it will not be granted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Finally, Nageotte and Burns have asked that we require the Board to pay their attorneys\u2019 fees and reasonable costs as authorized, but not mandated, by \u00a7 2.1-346. As concerned citizens, Nageotte and Burns had the right to challenge the Board\u2019s actions under the Act, and they did so <em>pro se. </em>The trial court in its written opinion referred to Nageotte\u2019s \u201cprobing, searching, lengthy and pounding\u201d examination of Board members and others as adverse witnesses for the \u201cmain purpose\u201d of eliciting admissions \u201cthat subjects were taken up\u201d in executive sessions in violation of the Act. Having failed in this main purpose, Nageotte and Burns have continued their efforts to establish that violations occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">We agree that violations occurred, but there were no willful and knowing violations, there were no violations that would invalidate Board actions with which Nageotte and Burns were concerned, and there were no violations justifying injunctive relief or the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Therefore, we hold that the error of the trial court in not finding that the motions to go into executive session were violative of the Act was harmless in the context of the unsubstantial nature of the violations and the relief sought in this case. We will affirm the final order of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\"> Code \u00a7 2.1-344 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u00a7 2.1-344.

Arkansas has a similar statute, cited in <em>Yandell </em>v. <em>Havana Bd. of Education, </em>266 Ark. 434, 585 S.W.2d 927 (1979). But even in the absence of such a statute the better-reasoned cases reach the same conclusion. Unless there is a specific statutory provision for invalidation, courts are \u201cgenerally wary\u201d of imposing \u201csuch penalty for violation of \u2018open meeting\u2019 or \u2018right to know\u2019 statutes.\u201d <em>Wilmington Federation of Teachers </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>374 A.2d 832, 835 (Del. 1977), citing <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Credit River Township, </em>299 Minn. 170, 217 N.W.2d 502 (1974), <em>Carter </em>v. <em>City of Nashua, </em>113 N.H. 407, 308 A.2d 847 (1973), <em>State ex rel.
