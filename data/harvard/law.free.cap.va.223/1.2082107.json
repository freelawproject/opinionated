Spencer, Assistant Attorney General (Marshall Coleman, Attorney General; Walter A. McFarlane, Deputy Attorney General, </em>on brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b60-10\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">Upon a plea of guilty, the trial court convicted the defendant, Mike Odell Midkiff, of driving under the influence of intoxicants. Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Following his conviction, the defendant moved the court to assign him to one of the alcohol programs authorized by Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1. The court denied the motion, sentenced the defendant to pay a fine of $200, and suspended his operator\u2019s license for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1 provides that a general district court or a circuit court may assign to an alcohol safety action program (ASAP) or a driver alcohol rehabilitation program any person charged with driving under the influence. Upon the person\u2019s successful completion of the program, the court may dismiss the charge or reduce it to a lesser offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">At the heart of the issue on appeal is an amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1 (a), effective July 1, 1980. In pertinent part, the amendment reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-14\">If such person has never entered into or been committed to a driver alcohol safety action program or driver alcohol rehabilitation program . . . upon motion of the accused or his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>counsel, <em>the court shall give mature consideration to the needs of such person in determining whether he be allowed to enter such program </em>.... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The defendant contends that the General Assembly intended by the use of the italicized language above to impose upon every court the duty to give \u201cgood faith, mature consideration to the motion of a defendant that he be placed in an appropriate program authorized by the statute.\u201d It was stipulated below, the defendant points out, that \u201cthere was an active alcohol safety action program and an alcohol rehabilitation program operating in Henry County.\u201d Yet, the defendant asserts, the records of the trial court show that \u201cno person convicted [in that court] of driving under the influence has ever been placed or assigned to [such] a program.\u201d Indeed, the defendant notes, the trial judge announced at a docket call in July, 1980, that \u201cno one convicted of driving under the influence would be assigned to an alcohol rehabilitation program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The defendant maintains that these facts indicate the trial court did not give \u201cgood faith consideration\u201d to his request for assignment to an alcohol program. Thus, the defendant concludes, the trial court\u2019s refusal of his motion \u201cdoes not really involve an abuse of discretion,\u201d but a \u201cfailure to exercise any discretion\u201d at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">We agree with the defendant that the 1980 amendment imposes upon a court in a drunk-driving case the duty to give \u201cgood faith consideration\u201d to a motion to assign the accused to an alcohol program authorized by Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We do not agree, however, that the trial court failed to exercise the discretion vested by the Code section, or that the court abused its discretion, when it denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">In the discussion concerning the motion, the question arose whether the 1980 amendment applied to the defendant\u2019s case, since he was charged before the effective date of the amendment. In disposing of the motion, however, the trial judge said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>that he would assume that \u201cthe amendment does apply.\u201d The judge then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">I listened to the evidence in this case very carefully and it strikes me as a very severe case of driving under the influence. The defendant was very much under the influence of intoxicants (0.16) and was operating his motor vehicle at 10:30 at night at a speed in excess of ninety miles an hour. To me this was an exceedingly dangerous situation .... Let me say for the record that I have maturely and seriously considered the needs of the defendant and [defense counsel\u2019s] request that the defendant be placed in an ASAP program, and the same will be denied for reasons set out above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">We accept at face value the trial judge\u2019s statement that he \u201cmaturely and seriously considered\u201d the defendant\u2019s motion for assignment to an alcohol program. For purposes of appeal, this statement demonstrates both that the judge gave \u201cgood faith consideration\u201d to the motion and that he exercised his discretion in its disposition. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b61-9\"> The defendant makes the additional argument that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1 has the effect of denying him equal protection of the laws. He concedes, however, that the statute is \u201cconstitutionally sound\u201d if we construe it to require \u201cgood faith mature consideration\u201d of a motion for assignment to an alcohol program. Because we construe the statute to require good faith consideration of such a motion, the constitutional question becomes moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
