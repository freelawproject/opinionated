The pertinent facts are not in conflict, and we hold the trial court\u2019s ruling was contrary to law applicable to this undisputed evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">Appellee Fenner V. Woolard, Jr., the defendant below, owned a parcel of land in the City of Virginia Beach. He had planned to construct a building on the property from which to conduct his business of furnishing and installing vinyl and carpet floor covering. During October of 1978, Woolard was \u201capproached\u201d by Mrs. Sherry Harrison, a real estate agent employed by plaintiff-appellant Metro Realty of Tidewater, Inc., trading as Century 21-Metro Realty, who asked whether he desired to sell the property. As the result of the inquiry, Woolard allowed her to seek a buyer on his behalf. Harrison, for her employer, prepared an \u201cOpen Listing Agreement\u201d dated October 14, 1978, to expire seven days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>lat\u00e9r, and delivered it to Woolard. The agreement provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201cIn the event that a Sales Contract is consummated on [the subject property] in the amount of $210,000 or at an agreed sales price, [the Seller] will pay a $10,000 flat fee . . . to Century 21-Metro Realty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">There was no additional provision relating to terms of payment of the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">On October 16, 1978, Harrison tendered to Woolard an \u201cOfficial Sales Contract\u201d executed on that day by three individual purchasers. The typed writing provided for a sale of the property for $210,000 to be paid as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">\u201c$2,100.00 with contract to apply to purchase price</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6E\">\u201c$18,900.00 additional cash at closing to apply to purchase price</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">\u201c$189,000.00 first deed of trust to be held by seller for a period of ten years at an interest rate of 9% per annum, together with the right of anticipation. Annual interest to be computed on the unpaid principal balance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The document also provided, <em>inter alia, </em>for closing of the transaction on or before November 15, 1978, and for payment by the seller to the real estate agent of a \u201c$10,000.00 FLAT FEE\u201d as commission for services rendered. As we shall see, this litigation developed over the subject of interest on installment payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">On Monday, October 16, Woolard executed the listing agreement but retained and did not sign the proposed sales contract. The terms of payment were not entirely acceptable to Woolard, so he contacted his accountant for advice concerning tax consequences of the sale. Woolard testified the accountant advised him \u201cto take five-year payments, five different years with interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AlU\">During the remainder of that week, Harrison talked with Woo-lard \u201cevery single day.\u201d During the conversations, Woolard relayed the accountant\u2019s recommendation that he \u201cshould only take five equal payments of $38,000 for five years\u201d and that he should not permit the buyers to have an unrestricted right of anticipation. Woolard conveyed his accountant\u2019s recommendation that Woolard have the benefit of \u201c \u2018a <em>5% </em>pay-off penalty\u2019 \u201d so that, for tax rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>sons, Woolard would \u201c \u2018have this extra cash if they pay it off, in order to use as a buffer.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">During \u201cthe middle of that week,\u201d Harrison visited Woolard\u2019s office to discuss the transaction. Because he was not present, Harrison left Woolard a pencilled note (later received in evidence as an exhibit) written on his business stationery, setting forth in detail her understanding of Woolard\u2019s preference for terms of payment to be incorporated into the proposed contract. Subsequently, Harrison returned to Woolard\u2019s office and they reviewed the note \u201cword for word together.\u201d Woolard was \u201cvery insistent,\u201d according to Harrison, \u201cthat he get no more, no less than . . . $38,000 a year, to the point where he insisted that [she] write it.\u201d Thus, Harrison wrote with a pen \u201cno more no less\u201d into the memorandum. According to Harrison\u2019s testimony, the subject of interest was never mentioned during that conversation; Woolard testified that at some unspecified time during that week he \u201ctried to get across to Mrs. Harrison [that the proposed contract] was acceptable to the interest she got me.\u201d Harrison testified Woolard \u201cwas dealing with his accountant who was telling him specifically what to tell me, which is what I was trying to help him put in writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ajq\">Following the conversation in Woolard\u2019s office, Harrison took the memorandum and reviewed with the buyers\u2019 attorney the draft language to be added to the proposed contract. Then, with the attorney\u2019s assistance, Harrison \u201cdrew up\u201d an addendum to the contract, using language that was almost verbatim the handwritten note.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">She returned to Woolard\u2019s office on Friday, October 20, and explained the addendum to him. Harrison, in Woolard\u2019s presence, lined out with a pen all the foregoing original terms of payment contained in the proposed contract. Next, Harrison wrote adjacent to the stricken language, \u201cADDENDUM ATTACHED INCORPORATED AND REFERENCE HEREIN:\u201d Woolard initialled the changes and signed the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Woolard then signed the addendum, a separate document. The pertinent portion of that writing provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">\u201cPurchase price to be paid as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">\u201c$2,100-with contract to apply to purchase price</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJf\">\u201c17,900-cash at settlement to apply to purchase price</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">\u201c190,000-to be secured by a first deed of trust to be held by seller and to be paid as follows: five (5) equal annual pay-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>merits of $38,000 no more, no less, the first payment due and payable on March 1, 1979 with each successive annual payment of $38,000 due and payable each March 1 until and including 1983. Prepayment of total loan balance allowable only after Jan. 1, 1980. In the event of resale, land lease, or development of this property subject to a prepayment penalty of 5% of the unpaid balance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Harrison immediately took the papers to the buyers. They initialled the contract changes, signed the addendum, and drew a check for $2100, transmitting it to their attorney in escrow. The agent then delivered a copy of the fully executed documents to Woolard.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Harrison departed and Woolard \u201cstart[ed] going over\u201d the documents. He testified he \u201cdetected something that I felt like it was a mistake on her part.\u201d He said he noticed that the nine percent interest provision had been stricken from the contract. Woolard was unable to reach Harrison again on that day but was successful in contacting her the following day, Saturday, October 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Upon Woolard\u2019s request, Harrison, insisting that \u201ca legally binding contract\u201d existed, later arranged for the buyers to agree to and execute a modification to the contract, intended to replace the addendum. The modification provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">\u201cPurchase price t\u00f3 be paid as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">\u201c$2,100.00-with contract to apply to purchase price</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">\u201c$ 17,900.00-cash at settlement to apply to purchase price</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYy\">\u201c$ 190,000.00-first deed of trust to be held by seller for a period of five years at an interest rate of 9% per annum. Said interest to begin accruing on unpaid principal balance March 1, 1979, annual principal payment in the amount of $38,000 plus any accrued interest is payable beginning March 1, 1979 and each successive year until debt is retired. Buyer reserves the right of anticipation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Harrison delivered the modification to Woolard who said, \u201c \u2018Well, it looks good, but I want to get hold of my attorney and my counsel.\u2019 \u201d Woolard did not sign the modification and consulted a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">Subsequently, Woolard\u2019s attorney, responding in February of 1979 to the buyers\u2019 demand to close the transaction, proposed certain additional changes to the modification. In turn, the buyers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>insisting the sales contract and addendum constituted the binding contract, threatened to sue the seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">On February 13, Harrison\u2019s employer filed the present contract action against Woolard in the amount of $10,000 seeking recovery of the commission due under the listing agreement. On March 12, Woolard\u2019s attorney submitted drafts of closing papers to the buyers\u2019 counsel that included provisions for payment of nine percent interest on the annual installments under a proposed deed of trust note. Responding, the buyers refused to close without assurance that the payments under the note would be \u201cinterest free as per the contract dated 16 October 1978.\u201d Then, Woolard filed a counterclaim in the present action seeking recovery of $52,000 against Metro Realty, alleging Harrison negligently failed to include provisions for interest payments in \u201ca certain document\u201d relating to the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Finally, the buyers, not wishing \u201cto incur the expense of complex litigation,\u201d offered to \u201crelease\u201d Woolard from the contract. Receiving no response to that suggestion, the buyers\u2019 attorney, in April of 1979, returned \u201cthe $2100 earnest money deposit,\u201d and the sale was never completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">At the conclusion of the trial, the court ruled from the bench in favor of Woolard on the plaintiffs claim, and in favor of Metro Realty on the counterclaim. Addressing the claim for the commission, the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">\u201cI just don\u2019t think it is reasonable for me to believe that Mr. Woolard would voluntarily enter into an agreement of this kind involving this amount of money for valuable land without providing for interest. It just does not seem reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">\u201cIt appears to me that it was Mrs. Harrison\u2019s fault that the interest was deleted in the addendum, while Mr. Woo-lard \u2014 maybe he should have picked it up before he signed it. He was more interested in the two other aspects, and I\u2019ve gone into those before: namely, the five years instead of the ten years, and the deletion of the right of anticipation. And that these were the things he was interested in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">\u201cAnd that I don\u2019t think that it would be fair for Mrs. Harrison or her company that she represents to collect a fee from this man, even though he probably should have picked it up. But in my opinion it was her error in deleting it and not his.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The basic question, of course, is whether, in the language of the listing agreement, \u201ca Sales Contract [was] consummated\u201d on the property in question. Apparently, the trial judge ruled that consummation may have, in fact, occurred on October 20 when the contract and addendum were initialled and signed by all the parties. As best we can interpret his comments, the trial court ostensibly determined, however, that the agent was not entitled to a commission because Harrison failed affirmatively to disclose to Woolard that the provision for interest on the deferred payments had been deleted from the contract and not included in the addendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">On appeal, Woolard seems to place the foregoing interpretation on the trial court\u2019s ruling because, in urging an affirmance, Woo-lard argues Harrison breached her \u201cduty of loyal service\u201d to him and failed \u201cto perform properly in connection with the sale,\u201d thus sacrificing the right to a commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The rule is plain that a broker, who is the agent of the owner in negotiating the sale of the owner\u2019s property, owes to the principal \u201cthe duty to exercise the utmost good faith towards him.\u201d <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Barbour, </em>188 Va. 53, 61, 49 S.E.2d 260, 264 (1948). In discharging such duty, the agent must disclose to the principal all facts within the agent\u2019s knowledge which are or may be material to the transaction, or which may influence the principal\u2019s action; should the agent fail to discharge that duty, the right to recover a commission is forfeited. <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>221 Va. 1051, 1054, 277 S.E.2d 189, 191 (1981). We think the agent here fully complied with such duty, the cases relied on by the owner being factually inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The undisputed evidence shows that during the week of October 16, Harrison painstakingly ascertained Woolard\u2019s preference about the terms of payment of the purchase price. Woolard, a layman, was in constant touch with his accountant, a professional advisor, and was relaying details to Harrison. Finally, toward the end of the week, Harrison reviewed in depth with Woo-lard the handwritten memorandum, the terms of which were subsequently incorporated, almost word-for-word, in the addendum; neither document provided for payment of interest and Harrison understood Woolard, for tax reasons, did not desire such a provision, that he wanted the annual payment to be \u201cno more, no less,\u201d than $38,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Moreover, the evidence shows, without a hint of any fraud, duress, or deception by Harrison, that Woolard voluntarily signed the contract, which had been in his possession four days, initialled the changes on the contract, and signed the addendum after it had been explained to him. Even if, in fact, Woolard intended at that time for the contract to provide for interest payments, he was nonetheless bound by his signature under these circumstances and could not have avoided the contract because of his unilateral mistake. In the absence of fraud, duress, or mutual mistake, a person \u201chaving the capacity to understand a written document who reads it, or, without reading it or having it read to him, signs it, is bound by his signature.\u201d <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>203 Md. 190, 199, 100 A.2d 3, 7 (1953); 13 S. Williston, <em>Law of Contracts </em>\u00a7 1577, at 501-03 (3d ed. 1970). The record shows Woolard, a mature businessman, had the capacity to understand the terms of both the contract and the addendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Confronted by this clear evidence, the trial court was wrong in finding that it was not \u201creasonable\u201d to believe Woolard would voluntarily enter into the contract \u201cwithout providing for interest,\u201d and in finding that deletion of the interest provision was Harrison\u2019s \u201cfault.\u201d To the contrary, we hold that Harrison completely discharged her fiduciary duty of disclosure, that the sales contract was \u201cconsummated,\u201d on October 20, and that Metro Realty is entitled to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Because of the view we take of the case, it is unnecessary to discuss cross-error assigned by defendant to the trial court\u2019s denial of the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Consequently, the judgment below will be affirmed, in part, reversed, in part, and final judgment will be entered here in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant for $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">\n<em>Affirmed, in part;</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aiu\">\n<em>reversed, in part;</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ArG\">\n<em>and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
