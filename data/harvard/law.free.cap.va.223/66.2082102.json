Whitley of capital murder in the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon and fixed his punishment at death. The trial court confirmed the conviction, considered the probation report, and imposed the sentence fixed by the jury. We have consolidated Whitley\u2019s statutory right of sentence review with his appeal from the conviction and accorded the case priority on our docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The evidence leaves no doubt that Whitley killed Phebe Parsons, his next-door neighbor. The 63 year-old widow lived alone, and the crime, committed the night of July 25, 1980, a Friday, was not discovered until the following Monday. The investigating officers found a mass of dried blood on the floor inside the front door and a trail of blood leading to Mrs. Parsons\u2019 nude body which was lying beneath a pile of clothes and other articles on the floor beside her bed. Her blood-soaked clothing and a link from a watchband (later identified as Whitley\u2019s) lay on the floor near the front door. The home was in disarray and the victim\u2019s wallet was missing from her purse which was hanging on a hook near the back door.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">An autopsy revealed a neck laceration <em>4</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>A\" </em>long, gaping to 2\", a ligature mark on the neck, a <em>Vi\u201d </em>cut on the forehead, and several abrasions and contusions on the upper back and right elbow. An umbrella of conventional design had been inserted into the vaginal cavity, puncturing the vaginal wall and bruising the small intestine. A collapsible umbrella had been forced into the rectal cavity, piercing the wall and damaging a major artery. The medical examiner testified that there was \u201cvery little evidence of hemorrhage\u201d in either cavity, a circumstance which indicated that \u201cthe individual had little, if any, heartbeat at the time they were inserted or was dead.\u201d In his opinion, death was caused by the neck wound or strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>According to several statements Whitley made to the police, all of which were admitted into evidence, Whitley had gone to Mrs. Parsons\u2019 home early in the evening of July 25 to use her telephone. He called his employer, Garry Monohan, who agreed to come to Whitley\u2019s home to repair his \u201cbroken down\u201d car. When two hours had passed and Monohan had not arrived, the defendant returned to Mrs. Parsons\u2019 home and made a second call. As he approached the front door to leave, Mrs. Parsons stopped him and \u201cwe were talking about my wife and going to church and everything and the next thing I know she was dead.\u201d Whitley explained to the officers that \u201cthere had been some trouble\u201d with his wife\u2019s 10 year-old daughter by a previous marriage and that both had left him.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Whitley admitted that he had choked Mrs. Parsons with his hands, strangled her with a rope, and cut her jugular vein with a Boy Scout pocketknife as she prayed for her life. He lifted her from the floor near the front door, dragged her to the bedroom, and attempted, without success, to place her on the bed. He did not remember removing her clothes or inserting the umbrellas in her body, and he denied that he had engaged in any sexual conduct. Abandoning his effort to get her body on the bed, he \u201cransacked\u201d the house, \u201clooking for a gun.\u201d Finding none, he took Mrs. Parsons\u2019 car keys and credit cards from her purse, replaced the purse on its hook, left by the back door, and fled in Mrs. Parsons\u2019 car. Arrested in Florida, Whitley confessed his guilt and waived extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Mrs. Parsons\u2019 daughter testified that, during the month before the murder, Whitley had indicated an interest in buying a car she owned. Called as a defense witness, Whitley\u2019s employer testified that he had paid Whitley his wages, $112.45, on the day of the crime. Monohan was never asked to verify Whitley\u2019s statement that he had telephoned him that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Addressing the conduct of the guilt phase of his trial, Whitley assigns multiple evidentiary and constitutional errors and asks us to reverse his conviction. In the alternative, he prays that we commute his sentence of death to imprisonment for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>I. THE GUILT TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">A. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-31 defines capital murder as a \u201cwillful, deliberate and premeditated killing\u201d in the commission of certain felonies. The defendant argues that \u201cthe Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was premeditated.\u201d While the intent to kill must be the product of premeditation, in the determination of premeditation <em>vel non </em>the interval between the formation of the intent and the killing itself is not a controlling consideration. <em>Hairston </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 429, 431-32, 230 S.E.2d 626, 628 (1976). Yet, time may be relevant. According to Whitley\u2019s own extra-judicial statements, he choked his victim with his hands; from some source undisclosed by the record, he obtained a rope and strangled her; then, taking his knife from his pocket, he cut her throat. Plainly, this was not a killing conceived and executed instantaneously. Whitley had ample time to meditate and deliberate, and the savage techniques he employed evince a calculated, persistent intent to kill a defenseless person.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The defendant contends that the statements he gave the police support a different theory, <em>viz., </em>that \u201csomething in Mr. Whitley\u2019s conversation with his victim about church and his wife and stepdaughter provoked the fatal attack,\u201d that the killing was an act of \u201cpassion and uncontrolled rage,\u201d and that this hypothesis is inconsistent with the jury\u2019s conclusion that the killing was premeditated. Obviously, the jury did not find this hypothesis reasonable, and we hold that the evidence was sufficient to sustain its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Challenging the sufficiency of the evidence on another point, the defendant maintains that his conviction of capital murder in the commission of armed robbery \u201ccannot be sustained unless there is evidence . . . that he formed the specific intent to steal from the victim either <em>before </em>or <em>during </em>the killing\u201d. If the intent was not formed until the victim was dead, he says, \u201cthe taking would at most constitute a larceny and the killing first-degree murder.\u201d Pointing to certain comments the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney made in closing argument which tend to endorse that view, Whitley relies upon the fact, uncontradicted of record, that all the property stolen was taken after Mrs. Parsons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>expired. Thus, he reasons, there was no evidence to prove that the murder was committed with intent to rob.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In oral argument, the Attorney General suggested that the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-31(d) could be construed to mean that first-degree murder is a capital offense when the killing and the crime of armed robbery are part of a continuing criminal enterprise. So construed, the statute does not require the Commonwealth to prove the coexistence of the intent to kill and the intent to steal. While such may be a viable construction, we need not decide that here. Reviewing the conviction under the statute as construed at trial, we consider whether the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that the murder was committed with intent to rob.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Clearly, the theft Whitley confessed constituted robbery rather than simple larceny. Robbery, defined at common-law as \u201cthe taking, with intent to steal, of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, against his will, by violence or intimidation\u201d, <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 18, 21, 235 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1977), is a crime against the person of the victim rather than a crime against property. While the violence or intimidation must precede or be concomitant with the taking, it is immaterial that the victim is dead when the theft occurs. For purposes of the common-law definition, a corpse is a \u201cperson\u201d if \u201cthe taking occurs minutes after the victim is killed\u201d. <em>Wm. Patterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 653, 664, 283 S.E.2d 212, 219 (1981). The question, then, is whether robbery was the motive for the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Criminal intent, a state of mind, may be, and often must be, shown by circumstantial evidence. <em>Ridley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 834, 836, 252 S.E.2d 313, 314 (1979). Whitley contends that, in light of the circumstances disclosed by his extra-judicial statements and the physical evidence, the jury should have found that the killing was the act of a \u201csexual psychopath\u201d and that the larceny was committed \u201conly as an after-thought.\u201d But the fact that the larceny did not occur until after he had killed his victim does not prove that his decision to steal was an after-thought. And the jury logically could have concluded that both sex and robbery motivated his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Moreover, Whitley\u2019s hypothesis, offered in mitigation of the grade of his offense, is legally significant only if it is reasonably supported by the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. His theory ignores certain facts bearing upon the question of intent. Whitley had expressed an interest in ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>quiring a car owned by Mrs. Parsons\u2019 daughter. On the night of the crime, Whitley\u2019s car was \u201cbroken down.\u201d His next-door neighbor owned a car. Whitley stole Mrs. Parsons\u2019 car. The jury was not required to believe Whitley\u2019s statement that his purpose in entering Mrs. Parsons\u2019 home was to use her telephone, and the jury doubtless noted that the person to whom the calls allegedly were made was never asked to verify the allegation. Considering the totality of the circumstances disclosed at trial, the jury could have concluded that the defendant needed the use of a car; that his purpose in going to his neighbor\u2019s home was to steal or borrow one; that his neighbor refused to give him the keys and turned the conversation to talk about his wife and \u201cgoing to church and everything;\u201d and that the defendant, frustrated, humiliated, and enraged, decided at that moment to kill her, ransack the house for the keys, and steal her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">We are of opinion that the evidence was fully sufficient to support the conclusion that Whitley murdered Mrs. Parsons with intent to rob her of her automobile.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">B. <em>Admissibility of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Overruling the defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>the trial court admitted into evidence a black-and-white photograph showing Mrs. Parsons\u2019 body in the gruesome condition in which it was found by the investigating officers. Assigning error to the ruling, Whitley argues that the photograph was inadmissible because it supplied no \u201cprobative evidence not provided by other evidence\u201d and, therefore, that \u201cthe prejudicial effect of the exhibit outweighs its probative value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>We find no merit in this assignment of error. In a recent capital case, we rejected the same argument addressed to the admission of similar photographs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">The admission of the photographs rested within the sound discretion of the trial court, and, in the absence of an abuse of discretion, we will not disturb the court\u2019s action. While the Commonwealth did have other evidence available to establish the elements of the offense, the photographs portrayed more graphically, but not more inflammatorily, than the testimony of any witness the methodical manner in which the killing of the victim was accomplished. Thus, the photographs were \u201c \u2018relevant and material to establish premeditation and malice and to show the degree of atrociousness of the crime.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\"><em>Waye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 692, 251 S.E.2d 202, 208, <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 924 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Raising another challenge to the presentation of evidence, the defendant says that \u201cthe Commonwealth\u2019s attempted introduction into evidence of other crimes involving Mr. Whitley deprived him of ... a fair trial and . . . due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">In the course of rebuttal to the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of one of the officers who had interviewed him, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney asked if Whitley had explained why his wife had left him. The officer replied: \u201cHe stated that there had been some trouble with his daughter and that she took the daughter.\u201d Asked if Whitley had told him \u201cwhat happened with the daughter\u201d or \u201cwhy the daughter had left\u201d, the officer answered, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">The defendant asserts that \u201cthe Commonwealth Attorney\u2019s questions were intended to imply sexual improprieties involving Mr. Whitley and his daughter\u201d; that \u201cjejvidence of prior bad acts is incompetent and inadmissible\u201d; and that the asking of the questions \u201cconstituted reversible error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">As the transcript of the officer\u2019s testimony on cross-examination reveals, the defendant had initiated the line of questioning pursued by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney in rebuttal. And we observe that, while defense counsel objected to his questions on relevancy grounds, he did not assign the ground he urges on appeal. Nor did he move for a mistrial or seek a curative instruction on account of the prejudice he now perceives. Aside from these con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>siderations, we demur to Whitley\u2019s due process complaint because he has shown no prejudice. As we read the dialogue, the implication raised by the questions and answers was speculative at most, and we cannot assume that the jury drew the inference Whitley suggests in hindsight.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">C. <em>Improper Argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">During summation in chief, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney said: \u201cIf at any moment before he kills her he intends to steal what she owns he is guilty of capital murder, that\u2019s the law. . . . He killed her, he stole from her. All we have to do is look at those facts and we say, could he possibly have intended that.\u201d This, the defendant contends, was a prejudicial misstatement of the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof. The Attorney General responds that the error, if any, was cured because the instructions (which were read to the jury by the trial judge and delivered in written form to the jury room) correctly defined the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">During rebuttal argument, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney stated: \u201cMembers of the jury, I waited in vain for counsel to give you some reason that this defendant . . . may have engaged in all of that violence before he stole this woman\u2019s property. As I say, I waited in vain.\u201d Whitley characterizes this statement as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Rebutting this view and invoking the test adopted in <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 905, 907, 234 S.E.2d 262, 263 (1977), the Attorney General argues that the statement was a comment on the failure of the defendant\u2019s <em>counsel </em>to offer some explanation during closing argument for the violence preceding the larceny and not a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The Attorney General\u2019s arguments appear persuasive. However, the record shows that the defendant voiced no objection to either statement, either at the time it was made or in post-conviction motions. Applying the contemporaneous objection rule, we decline to consider these issues on their merits. <em>Shifflett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 741, 744, 187 S.E.2d 174, 176 (1972); <em>Russo </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 251, 257-58, 148 S.E.2d 820, 825 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>II. CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES</p>\n<p id=\"AA\">A. <em>Facial Constitutionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The defendant asks us to adopt the view that the death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment \u201cin all cases\u201d. We reaffirm our prior decisions disavowing a <em>per se </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Even so, Whitley contends that \u201cthe Virginia capital murder statute is unconstitutional on its face\u201d. More precisely, he believes that the legislative gradation of homicide offenses is constitutionally infirm. A person convicted of one of the species of homicide defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-31 may be sentenced to death, regardless of the degree of vileness attending the killing, if the jury rests its decision upon the so-called \u201cdangerousness\u201d standard. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. On the other hand, a person convicted of first-degree murder is never subject to the supreme penalty, even when the vileness is greatest and the offense most heinous. Hence, Whitley argues, the homicide statutes permit juries to impose the death penalty arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the due process clause and the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">A criminal statute which affords a sentencing judge or jury an unbridled choice between the death penalty and a lesser sentence violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238 (1972). But sentencing discretion is constitutionally permissible if it is \u201csuitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action.\u201d <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 189 (1976). The <em>Gregg </em>court upheld Georgia\u2019s statutory system (revised in response to <em>Furman) </em>because it limited discretion to impose the death penalty to offenses involving \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d, established standards directing sentencing procedures, and authorized appellate review as a matter of right. In <em>Jurek </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262 (1976), the Supreme Court found that, while the Texas statute did not contain a particularized list of aggravating circumstances, its definitions of the five categories of capital murder required \u201cthat the jury find the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance before the death penalty may be imposed\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 270-71, and that these definitions satisfied the rule in <em>Gregg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Five of the seven definitions of capital murder in Code \u00a7 18.2-31 are substantially identical, and none are antithetical, to those approved in <em>Jurek. </em>See relevant provisions of the Texas statute, <em>id. </em>at 265, nl. And, of special significance to the issue Whitley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>raises here, the Texas statute, like our own, fixed the maximum penalty for non-capital murder at life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>For purposes of constitutional analysis, the two statutory schemes are indistinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Homicide statutes are designed to protect society. The need for protection varies with the gravity of the offense against society. The definition and gradation of offenses require public policy judgments. Such judgments are made for society by the legislative representatives it chooses. And such legislative judgments are constitutionally sufficient unless the courts can say that the severity of the penalty prescribed is not rationally related to the gravity of the attendant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The General Assembly has defined two grades of manslaughter, three grades of murder, and seven sub-species of the highest grade of murder. It has determined that, aside from the kind of violence employed, murder committed under any of seven selected circumstances is more culpable in terms of societal harm than other forms of murder, and, as a matter of public policy, has prescribed graduated penalties for different grades of homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">We believe the grades of the offense and their respective penalties are rationally related, and, considering the sentencing standards and procedures the capital murder statutes mandate, we hold that sentencing discretion is \u201csuitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action.\u201d <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">B. <em>Constitutionality As Applied</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Whitley next contends that the so-called \u201cvileness\u201d standard of Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2 is unconstitutional as applied in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">The jury based the death penalty upon the vileness standard rather than the dangerousness standard. Relying upon the plurality opinion in <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420 (1980), the defendant urges us to construe the vileness standard to mean that the death penalty is not a constitutionally-permissible sentencing option unless \u201c \u2018aggravated battery\u2019 be proven by evidence of serious physical abuse before death.\u201d Here, Whitley insists, \u201cthe evidence conclusively shows that the victim died prior to any physical abuse\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">The statutory construction Whitley urges, one announced by the Georgia Supreme Court in <em>Blake </em>v. <em>State, </em>239 Ga. 292, 236 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>S.E.2d 637 (1977), and noted in passing in <em>Godfrey, </em>was not the <em>ratione decidendi </em>in <em>Godfrey. </em>Godfrey\u2019s victim died almost instantaneously from a single gunshot, and the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased upon no more than a finding that the offense was \u2018outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman.\u2019 \u201d <em>Godfrey, </em>446 U.S. at 428. Such an amorphous finding, unrelated to any constituent element of the statutory definition, was constitutionally insufficient to support the death penalty. The Supreme Court was not required to decide, and did not decide, whether an aggravated battery must precede the victim\u2019s death in order to satisfy the vileness standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Nor need we decide that question here, for the evidence fully supports the conclusion that Mrs. Parsons\u2019 death was the result of aggravated battery upon her person. We do not refer to Whitley\u2019s violent abuse of her body cavities, even though the medical testimony does not exclude the possibility that her heart was still beating when the umbrellas were inserted. We have construed the term \u201caggravated battery\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2 to mean \u201ca battery which, qualitatively and quantitatively, is more culpable than the minimum necessary to accomplish an act of murder.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 478, 248 S.E.2d 135, 149 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979). According to Whitley\u2019s own account, he first choked his defenseless victim with his bare hands; next, he acquired a rope and strangled her; and then, taking his knife from his pocket, he cut her throat. Each of Whitley\u2019s several acts was deliberate, each was brutal and potentially fatal, and, together, all were more than the minimum necessary to accomplish the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We are of opinion that the jury properly could have found that Whitley\u2019s serial assaults upon Mrs. Parsons constituted an aggravated battery within the intendment of the statutory vileness standard, and we reject his constitutional complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>III. THE POST-CONVICTION HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5 provides that, after consideration of a report of a probation officer concerning \u201cthe history of the defendant and any and all other relevant facts\u201d, the trial judge \u201cmay set aside the sentence of death and impose a sentence of imprisonment for life.\u201d As Whitley points out, the narrative portion of the historical report revealed that he had been \u201caccused\u201d of three forcible sexual offenses, and Whitley argues that, notwithstanding the jury\u2019s failure to do so, the trial judge should have accepted his theory that sex rather than robbery was the motive for the killing. Accordingly, he asserts the trial judge erred in confirming the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">But the probation report also contained a long list of charges and convictions of automobile larceny, burglary, breaking and entering, and other crimes, as a result of which, Whitley had \u201cspent most of his adult life incarcerated in . . . Illinois or . . . Nevada\u201d. Such a history, inadmissible at the guilt trial, reinforces the jury\u2019s finding that the killing occurred in the commission of armed robbery of Mrs. Parsons\u2019 car, and we hold that the trial court committed no error in confirming the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">IV. THE PENALTY TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Under statutory mandate, we now review the record of both phases of the trial to determine whether the death penalty fixed by the jury and confirmed by the trial judge was the product of \u201cpassion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor\u201d or \u201cis excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d Code \u00a7 17-110.1C.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Renewing his argument that the motive for the killing was not robbery, Whitley contends that \u201cevidence and argument in the guilt phase which evidenced sexual abuses . . . were in no way probative of an intent to rob\u201d and that the effect thereof was \u201cto inflame the jury and to cause them to be prejudiced against Mr. Whitley.\u201d Whitley does not specify the \u201csexual abuses\u201d to which he refers. Those mentioned in the probation report were not before the jury. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4B. Those discussed in Part I B, <em>infra, </em>were not reasonably implied. We assume, then, that the defendant has reference to the medical evidence showing the abuses of Mrs. Parsons\u2019 body cavities.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Whitley did not challenge the admissibility of this evidence. Rather, he contends on appeal that it was prejudiciously inflammatory. We have no doubt that it offended the sensibilities of the jury. But while evidence of Whitley\u2019s use of the umbrellas was offensive, so was the evidence of his use of the rope and knife, assaults committed in pitiless disregard of a defenseless victim\u2019s pleas for mercy.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The defendant suggests nothing further to support his argument that the death penalty was the product of passion or prejudice, and, finding nothing of record, we turn to the final question.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Relying again upon his theory that Mrs. Parsons\u2019 death did not occur in the commission of armed robbery and, thus, that the killing did not constitute capital murder, Whitley argues that we must compare his case with other non-capital murder cases \u201cin which the victim was sexually abused but not raped or robbed.\u201d Such a comparison, he says, compels a conclusion that \u201cWhitley\u2019s sentence is clearly excessive and disproportionate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">But we have held that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that the murder occurred in the commission of armed robbery and that Whitley\u2019s multiple assaults constituted an aggravated battery within the contemplation of the vileness standard. Whitley\u2019s argument, therefore, rests upon a faulty premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">In order to guard against arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory imposition of the death penalty, Code \u00a7 17-110.1C2, E, requires that we compare the case under review with \u201csimilar cases\u201d and, in aid of that comparison, to \u201caccumulate the records of all capital felony cases ... as a guide in determining whether the sentence imposed in the case under review is excessive.\u201d In the first case decided after the effective date of that statute, we entered an order directing the Clerk of this Court to comply with the legislative directive. <em>See Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. at 482, n. 8, 248 S.E.2d at 151. The Clerk has done so. All capital murder cases, including not only those in which the death penalty was imposed and reviewed by this Court but also those in which the jury or trial judge imposed a life sentence and the defendant petitioned this Court for appeal of his conviction, have been inventoried and indexed apart from other criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">We have analyzed the facts and circumstances in each case. None is factually <em>identical </em>to Whitley\u2019s case. However, we have affirmed death sentences in several capital murder cases where the aggravated battery was fairly comparable to that Whitley com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>mitted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And it appears from our examination of capital cases where a life sentence was imposed that the lesser penalty was selected because the battery was less aggravated, or because the jury or trial judge found that the aggravating circumstances were outweighed by mitigating circumstances, or because the sentencing authority was moved by an impulse of mercy. Such discretion in the sentencing authority is not constitutionally infirm. The Constitution requires only that the jury\u2019s exercise of its discretion be properly guided. \u201cNothing in any of our cases suggests that the decision to afford an individual defendant mercy violates the Constitution.\u201d <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. at 199. <em>Accord, Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. at 479-80, 248 S.E.2d at 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Our analysis convinces us that the penalty imposed upon Whitley was not \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases\u201d, Code \u00a7 17-110.1C2, and we will affirm the conviction and uphold the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\"> Attacking the ruling against his motion to strike the evidence as insufficient, the defendant also charges that he was denied due process because, he says, the trial judge did not consider his motion maturely and ruled peremptorily \u201cwith one eye on the proceedings and one eye on the clock.\u201d The transcript of the proceedings does not support the charge. The comments made by the trial judge concerning the hour were related to his decision whether to attempt to complete the evidence that day or the next. At the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s argument on his motion, the transcript of which consumes 13 pages in the record, the trial judge denied the motion and assigned the reason for his ruling: \u201cViewing all the evidence that has been submitted it is my opinion that his intent and motive is entirely a jury question.\u201d It is obvious that the judge carefully considered the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence and, as we have indicated, his ruling was correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\"> On appeal, Whitley complains that the jury was not instructed on this definition. <em>See Godfrey, </em>446 U.S. at 437 (Marshall and Brennan, concurring). <em>Contra, James Dyral Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 563, 579-80, 273 S.E.2d 57, 67 (1980); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 201, 211, 257 S.E.2d 784, 790-91 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1049 (1980).
