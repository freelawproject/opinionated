We affirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">Appellee Fidelity Guaranty &amp; Insurance Underwriters, Incorporated, issued the employer an insurance policy effective February 22, 1979. The policy period was scheduled to expire February 22, 1980, but Fidelity renewed the term for another year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 1, 1980, Fidelity notified the employer that its policy was cancelled for non-payment of premium effective April 11, 1980. However, Fidelity failed to notify the Commission as required by Code \u00a7 65.1-105.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Shortly after the employer received notice of cancellation, it obtained an insurance binder from appellant Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Company. Hartford\u2019s binder was in full force and effect on June 2, 1980, the date of the industrial accident out of which this controversy arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The injured employee filed a claim, and the hearing commissioner entered an award against both Fidelity and Hartford. Upon its own motion, the full Commission convened a hearing \u201cto resolve the coverage question\u201d. In a final award, the Commission ruled that Hartford alone was liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Hartford maintains that Fidelity\u2019s failure to comply with the statutory notice provisions defeats its attempt to cancel its policy, that coverage under that policy remained in effect on the date of the industrial accident, and that Fidelity is jointly liable on the employee\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Hartford raises a question of first impression in this Court. Because of the diversity of statutory provisions and judicial opinions in other jurisdictions, we find little foreign authority to guide us in our decision. <em>Neeman </em>v. <em>Otoe County, </em>186 Neb. 370, 183 N.W.2d 269 (1971). Our decision rests upon what we perceive to be legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Our analysis begins with the premise, repeatedly affirmed in our decisions, that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was adopted for the protection of workers and their dependents. An employer subject to the Act must be and remain insured or self-insured. Code \u00a7 65.1-104.1. Code \u00a7 65.1-105 recognizes an insurer\u2019s right to cancel coverage for business reasons, but it requires the insurer to postpone the effective date of cancellation for a period of 10 or 30 days. The notice and delay requirements serve two functions. They give the employer an opportunity to acquire other insurance; and they make it possible for the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>sion timely to invoke its enforcement authority under \u00a7 65.1-106. As we construe this statutory scheme, the legislative intent was to protect the worker against a lapse in his employer\u2019s insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">If the employer in this case had not been covered by other insurance at the time of the accident and the claimant had asserted the statutory interpretation Hartford urges, we would hold that Fidelity\u2019s violation of the notice requirement would defeat its attempt to cancel and, in such event, that Fidelity would be liable on the employee\u2019s claim. But coverage did not lapse, the interests of the injured worker were protected under Hartford\u2019s binder, and the legislative goal was achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The Commission concluded that Hartford, having insured the risk for an agreed premium, should bear the loss alone, and we agree. The award will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-15\"> By assignment of cross-error, Fidelity questions the Commission\u2019s finding that it had renewed its policy. In the view we take of the case, it is unnecessary to consider this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b700-16\"> The statute provides in part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Every employer who . . . has . . . cancelled his insurance . . . shall immediately notify the Industrial Commission of such cancellation . . and every insurance carrier . . . shall in like manner notify the Industrial Commission immediately upon the cancellation of any policy issued by it . . . under the provisions of [the Workmen\u2019s Compensation] Act ....</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">No policy of insurance . . . issued under the provisions of this Act . . . shall be cancelled by the insurer issuing such policy . . . except on thirty days\u2019 notice to the employer and the Industrial Commission, unless the employer has obtained other insurance and the Industrial Commission is notified of that fact by the insurer assuming the risk, or unless said cancellation is for nonpayment of premiums; then ten days\u2019 notice shall be given the employer and Industrial Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
