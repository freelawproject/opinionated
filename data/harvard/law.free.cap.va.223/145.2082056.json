Elizabeth brought suit against Tivis Gilbert, Gorman Gilbert, Norman Gilbert, Ronald Bailey, Doug Wright and Enos Blankenship (the defendants) to recover damages for her personal injuries. She alleged that the defendants entered into a conspiracy to stop the Gray automobile by forcing it off the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Norman Gilbert was the only defendant to answer and appear at trial.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> He was represented at trial by counsel for Travelers Indemnity Company, which had issued a policy on the Gilbert vehicle. Following a jury trial, a verdict was returned in favor of Elizabeth for compensatory damages of $30,000 and awarding punitive damages against Tivis Gilbert in the amount of $15,000 and against each of the other defendants in the amount of $2,000, for a total verdict of $55,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Subsequently, a declaratory judgment action was brought to determine the liability of the insurance companies providing cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>age to the parties involved in the incident. Travelers denied coverage. If correct, the denial would leave Utica Mutual Insurance Company, the uninsured motorist carrier for Gray, liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The policy issued to Tivis Gilbert by Travelers was certified to the Division of Motor Vehicles as proof of Tivis\u2019 future financial responsibility. The Virginia Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, Code \u00a7 46.1-388, <em>et. seq., </em>requires that certain persons, whose privilege to drive has been suspended, furnish such proof prior to regaining the privilege. This proof is given by the insurance company\u2019s filing with the Division of Motor Vehicles a certificate known as an SR-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The general automobile liability policy issued in Virginia provides coverage for damages caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d or by an \u201caccident.\u201d We have held these terms to be synonymous and to refer to an incident that was unexpected from the viewpoint of the insured. <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Insurance Company, </em>218 Va. 718, 239 S.E.2d 902 (1978); <em>Travelers </em>v. <em>Obenshain, </em>219 Va. 44, 245 S.E.2d 247 (1978). An intentional act is neither an \u201coccurrence\u201d nor an \u201caccident\u201d and therefore is not covered by the standard policy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Utica asserts that, while this may be the general rule, a different result is mandated when a policy is certified under the Safety Responsibility Act. It argues that the Act is intended to protect the public from those drivers who have proven themselves to be a risk. For this reason, the term \u201caccident\u201d should be viewed from the standpoint of the public and not the insured. The trial court rejected this argument, and we concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Code \u00a7 46.1-511(a) states in part that under certified policies \u201c[t]he liability of any insurance carrier to the insured . . . becomes absolute when loss or damage covered by the policy occurs . ...\u201d A policy certified under the Act must protect against losses \u201ccaused by accident.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.1-504. This the Travelers\u2019 policy did by providing coverage for an \u201coccurrence\u201d defined in the policy as \u201can accident . . . which results in <em>bodily injury </em>or <em>property damage </em>neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">We find nothing in the Act which mandates that certified policies provide greater protection to the insured than the standard policy. Nor do we find language in Travelers\u2019 policy which affords such coverage. The term \u201caccident\u201d does not take on a different meaning merely because a policy is certified. We hold therefore that the policy issued by Travelers did not afford coverage for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>intentional acts of its insured. The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b204-13\"> The appellant argues that the court had no jurisdiction over certain of the defendants. We find no merit in this assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
