(Record No. 802047)</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b296-6\">CARRICO, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-i\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Lorene P. Harris and Eli Woodson are the unmarried parents of Eli Woodson Harris, born September 5, 1976, and Gwendolyn Darshella Harris, born July 24, 1977. Upon the petitions of the Lynchburg Division of Social Services and pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial court terminated Harris\u2019 and Wood-son\u2019s residual parental rights and authorized the Division to place the children for adoption. Harris and Woodson were granted separate appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Harris is the mother of two other children, Moncil and Rayneil, both older than Eli and Gwen. Harris\u2019 parental rights to Moncil were terminated in January, 1977. Rayneil, acknowledged by Woodson as his child, was placed in the custody of Woodson\u2019s mother pursuant to court order, and the child remained there at the time of the hearing in the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">On January 17, 1977, young Eli was hospitalized, suffering from pneumonia and a \u201cfailure to thrive.\u201d Upon his release, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>was placed in a foster home. On February 7, he was committed to the Division. On April 1, he was returned to his mother on a trial basis. After the Division received and substantiated two \u201cprotective service complaints,\u201d both Eli and Gwen were removed from the mother\u2019s home in October, 1977. The children were placed in foster care, where they have remained since.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Both before and after this placement, and especially during the autumn of 1976 and the winter of 1977, the Division provided extensive services to Harris. These services included job training, job placement, and referrals and transportation to community and charitable agencies and organizations. While some of these services were not repeated in 1978, the Division continued to assist Harris in solving food, fuel, and housing problems and in referring her to \u201cecumenical [and] charitable organizations.\u201d The Division concentrated its efforts upon helping Harris establish a stable home so the children could be returned to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Harris was unemployed while the children were in her custody; her only source of income was a monthly check of $158 for aid to dependent children. After Eli and Gwen were removed from Harris\u2019 home, she held a variety of jobs, including work as a kitchen helper, in an effort to improve her financial situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The Division arranged for visitation between Harris and the children, but there were \u201cnumerous problems,\u201d including Harris\u2019 failure to keep appointments for visits. At times, the Division provided food and fuel so the children could visit Harris in her home. Initially, Harris visited the children sporadically, but she began in March, 1978, to visit them once a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">In August, 1978, Harris was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest. Subsequently, she was convicted and sentenced to a term of five years in prison. She still was incarcerated at the time of the hearing in the trial court, but her application for parole was scheduled for consideration in two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">While in prison, Harris worked in the prison laundry and as a key punch operator. She obtained a \u201cGeneral Educational Development Diploma\u201d and a \u201cCertificate in Secretarial Science.\u201d She corresponded frequently with the social worker assigned to her children, inquiring about their well-being and sending them messages on holidays and birthdays. At her request, the children visited her in prison once in 1979 and three times in 1980. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>planned to establish normal parental relations with the children upon her release.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Meanwhile, on October 1, 1978, Woodson had been committed to jail for a misdemeanor. While in jail, he did not contact his children or inquire about them. Following his release in April, 1979, he obtained regular employment at a Holiday Inn and began making payments to his mother for the support of his daughter Rayneil. For a time he lived alone, but he later moved in with his mother, and Rayneil has \u201cprospered\u201d in their care.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">On February 5, 1980, Woodson was contacted by the Division with respect to the termination of his parental rights to Eli and Gwen. Prior to that time, he was not aware that he had any rights to the children, and he had not attempted to visit them. Nor had he ever contributed to their support. After the Division\u2019s contact, Woodson began visiting the children, and he established and made regular contributions to savings accounts for them. While the children did not regard Woodson as their \u201cpsychological parent\u201d and were \u201cdistant\u201d initially, his relationship with them improved steadily.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">On March 19, 1980, upon petitions filed by the Division, the juvenile and domestic relations district court entered orders terminating Harris\u2019 and Woodson\u2019s residual parental rights to Eli and Gwen and authorizing the Division to place the children for adoption. Woodson opposed termination and appealed the juvenile court\u2019s orders. While the appeal was pending, he continued to visit the children, and he contributed $210 toward their support.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Harris also opposed termination and appealed the juvenile court\u2019s orders. Following a hearing, the circuit court entered orders on September 23, 1980, reciting that termination of parental rights was in the children\u2019s best interests and that the parents, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2) and \u201cwithout good cause, [had] been unwilling or unable within a reasonable period to remedy substantially the conditions which led to [the children\u2019s] foster care placement, notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies to such end.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Citing our 1975 decision in <em>Rocka </em>v. <em>Roanoke Co. Dep\u2019t of Welfare, </em>215 Va. 515, 211 S.E.2d 76 (1975), Harris and Woodson both contend that their residual parental rights cannot be ter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>minated absent a specific finding of parental unfitness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They say the trial court made no such finding with respect to either parent, but merely found the existence of the factors listed in \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2). Nothing in this new Code section, Harris and Wood-son maintain, alters the <em>Rocka </em>requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">We disagree. In a related case decided today, we held that the enactment of \u00a7 16.1-28 3 (C)(2) eliminated the necessity for a specific finding of parental unfitness in termination proceedings between parents and social agencies. A finding that the factors listed in \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2) exist, we said, is tantamount to a finding of parental unfitness. <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Serv., 223 </em>Va. 213, 220, 228 S.E.2d 399, 403 (1982). <em>See also Toombs </em>v. <em>Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Serv., 223 </em>Va. 225, 232 n.2, 228 S.E.2d 405, 409 n.2 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Both Harris and Woodson contend next that the orders terminating their parental rights are unsupported by the clear and convincing evidence required by \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2). Their arguments on this point diverge, however, and will be treated separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Harris argues that the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s findings that she was unwilling or unable, without good cause and despite the assistance of rehabilitative agencies, to remedy the conditions that led to Eli\u2019s and Gwen\u2019s placement in foster care. Rather, Harris says, the evidence displays a \u201csustained level of cooperation with the Division . . . and a high degree of attentiveness to the development of her children\u201d; she made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d toward improving living conditions for the children; she \u201csought to address her housing problems\u201d; she obtained a variety of jobs; and she advanced her education and skills through her prison courses and employment. Furthermore, Harris asserts, she showed consistent and active interest in her children, and she planned, when released from prison, to establish normal relations with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Harris argues further that, while the Division assisted her extensively prior to the time she lost custody of Eli and Gwen, it only referred her to other agencies or organizations after that time and made no \u201csignificant efforts\u201d itself to help remedy the problems that led to foster care. Harris admits \u201cthere was little beyond post-release planning the Division could have done\u201d while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>she was incarcerated. She says, however, that, because the Division failed to make reasonable and appropriate efforts on her behalf prior to her incarceration, the trial court should not have terminated her rights but should have required the Division to assist her upon her ultimate release.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Concluding this argument, Harris says that her incarceration was the primary cause of her inability to remedy the conditions that led to foster care. Hence, she submits, her failure to remedy the conditions was not without good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We disagree with Harris. We believe that the record contains clear and convincing evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s findings in her case. Harris lost her first child, Moncil, to foster care in February, 1974. Beginning the following September, the Division assisted Harris in efforts to remedy the conditions in her home. This assistance was extensive, but obviously futile; Moncil never returned home and Eli, Gwen, and Rayneil all had to be removed. Thereafter, the Division continued to assist Harris with what we believe were \u201csignificant efforts.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the Division did not repeat all the services it previously rendered Harris, it concentrated its efforts toward helping her establish a stable home so Eli and Gwen could be returned to her. Notwithstanding the Division\u2019s assistance, Harris was still in no position to resume care of her children when she was arrested in August, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Harris concedes that, while incarcerated, she could not have established a suitable home for Eli and Gwen, but she says that her punishment should not be enhanced by terminating her rights to the children without reason. We agree with that proposition. We will not allow Harris, however, to use her incarceration as reason to excuse her prior neglectful treatment of her children or to say that her failure to remedy the conditions in her home was without good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">This brings us to Woodson\u2019s argument concerning the sufficiency of the evidence. He says absolutely no evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that rehabilitative agencies made reasona<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ble and appropriate efforts to assist him in remedying the conditions that led to Eli\u2019s and Gwen\u2019s foster care placement. The rendering of such assistance is a prerequisite to termination of parental rights under \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2), Woodson submits, and, hence, the orders terminating his rights must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">The Division does not contend it offered or provided Woodson any assistance. It says it made out a prima facie case for termination pursuant to the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2) when it showed that Woodson had failed, without good cause, to communicate with Eli and Gwen for a period of twelve months or to make reasonable progress, under a foster care plan, toward the elimination of the conditions that led to the children\u2019s foster care placement. In any event, the Division maintains, Woodson never contacted it or requested any assistance, and it should not be required to force its services upon a parent who does not want them.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">While the Division makes no claim Woodson was ever aware of a foster care plan, we will assume for the purposes of this discussion that the Division did make out a prima facie case for termination of Woodson\u2019s parental rights. But where, as here, there is undisputed evidence that a parent has not been offered or provided services, the prima facie case is overcome, and the party moving for termination is put to the burden of proving the factors listed in \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2). And, in the absence of such proof, reversal of a termination order is required. <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Roanoke Dept. of Human Res., </em>220 Va. 921, 265 S.E.2d 692 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">This is not to say that the Division must force its services upon an unwilling or disinterested parent. But that is not the situation here; because Woodson was not offered any services, we have no way of knowing whether he would have been willing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>interested. We believe he is entitled to the offer and to an opportunity to show what progress he can make with the assistance of the Division and other agencies toward establishing, within a reasonable period, a suitable home for Eli and Gwen. This requires reversal of the orders terminating Woodson\u2019s rights to Eli and Gwen and rem\u00e1nd of the case with direction to permit Woodson the specified opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">This result in Woodson\u2019s case activates Harris\u2019 final contention. She argues that we should not deny her relief while granting relief to Woodson. We reject the argument. Code \u00a7 16.1-283(A) provides that the court \u201cmay terminate the residual parental rights of one parent without affecting the rights of the other parent.\u201d We believe the situation presented here requires the action permitted by this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">For the reasons assigned, the orders terminating Harris\u2019 residual parental rights to Eli and Gwen will be affirmed. The orders terminating Woodson\u2019s rights will be reversed, and his case will be remanded for the relief indicated previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Record No. 802043 - <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Record No. 802047 - <em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-10\"> \u00a7 16.1-283. <em>Termination of residual parental </em>rights.\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">* ** *</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">C.
