We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">The minor was charged with burglary\u2014a violation of section 459 of the Penal Code. After a hearing, she was found not guilty of burglary but guilty of tresspass as defined in subdivision (j) of section 602 of the Penal Code. This case is on all fours with <em>In re Carlo S. </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 377 [156 Cal.Rptr. 442]. In that case a minor was charged with assault under section 245 of the Penal Code; he was found guilty of a violation of section 148 of that code\u2014a nonincluded and uncharged offense. The minor had stood silent when the ruling was announced. The appellate court reversed.  Here the offense of which the minor was found guilty\u2014subdivision (j) of section 602 of the Penal Code\u2014is not an included offense within a charge of burglary. <em>(People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>v. <em>Harris </em>(1961) 191 Cal.App.2d 754 [12 Cal.Rptr. 916].)
