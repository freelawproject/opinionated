J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWq\">By this petition the People challenge a Monterey County Superior Court ruling which dismissed a kidnaping charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>and removed the \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d allegations from a first degree murder prosecution against Dale Clayton Gibson. In ruling in Mr. Gibson\u2019s favor on his Penal Code section 995 motion to dismiss the kidnaping charge and strike the special circumstances* the trial court did not evaluate the evidence independently, but found itself bound by what it characterized as \u201cfactual determinations\u201d of the magistrate. We have concluded that it was not so bound and that the writ should issue in order to permit a redetermination of Mr. Gibson\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The purported \u201cfactual determinations\u201d of the magistrate consisted of the following comments made at the conclusion of the preliminary hearing: \u201cNow, as far as Mr. Gibson is concerned, the only evidence we have on Mr. Gibson is the fact that there is a body out there, that it\u2019s his wife, and she\u2019s been shot, apparently, with a high velocity projectile and that it went through her skull and killed her. From that point on, all we have is oral admissions of the defendant and, of course, they are to be viewed very carefully. One, there are two witnesses that are very doubtful in my mind whether they could be mistaken or their memories are very weak. There is [sic] enough witnesses to come in to indicate to me that Mr. Gibson did in fact say, T killed her.\u2019 There are other statements which are admissions as well which seem to indicate that yes, in fact, he did kill her. It\u2019s extremely weak. For the purposes of the preliminary hearing, it seems to me that there is enough to get it over the hurdle. Now, as far as the special circumstances, the fact that we have a body out there on the coast that\u2019s been killed by a high velocity projectile to the skull, I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t find from that any financial gain situation. I can\u2019t find from that any lying-in-wait situation. I can\u2019t find from that any kidnaping situation. I can\u2019t find any heinous, atrocious, and cruel killing and, of course, I can\u2019t tie in the last one with regards to the Enfield rifle. So, there is [sic] no special circumstances insofar as Mr. Gibson is concerned. As far as Count number II, the kidnapping, there\u2019s no evidence to show that Mr. Gibson in any way kidnapped his wife. So, it\u2019s just a nonspecial circumstance murder that I feel that Mr. Gibson is involved in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 660 [94 Cal.Rptr. 289, 483 P.2d 1241], the Supreme Court made clear that if the magistrate makes specific factual findings adverse to the prosecution, it may not then refile in its information charges the magistrate\u2019s findings caused him to dismiss.  The rule and its converse were restated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Farley </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 215, 221 [96 Cal.Rptr. 478], as follows: \u201cFrom the foregoing rationale we perceive the practical rule to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>that in cases where the magistrate makes factual findings which are fatal to the asserted conclusion that a particular offense was committed, the district attorney may not recharge that offense in the information. A clear example of this would be where the magistrate expresses disbelief of a witness whose testimony is essential to the establishment of some element of the corpus delicti.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u201cWhere, however, the magistrate either expressly or impliedly accepts the evidence and simply reaches an ultimate legal conclusion therefrom \u2014i.e., whether or not such evidence adds up to reasonable cause that the offense had been committed-\u2014such conclusion is open to challenge by inclusion in the information which action is thereafter subject to attack in the superior court under Penal Code section 995, and ultimately to appellate review.\u201d But the difficulties in applying the rules were noted in <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 36 Cal.App.3d 977, 981 [111 Cal.Rptr. 797], where the court stated: \u201cOur difficulty in finding clear guidance from the <em>Jones </em>opinion arises in part because of the unusually simple and clear-cut factual issue in that case, and the unusually specific finding made by the magistrate there. The <em>Jones </em>case depended upon the credibility of a single witness. The magistrate based his ruling upon the express finding that this witness did not tell the truth as to certain critical matters. In the case at bench, the magistrate\u2019s remarks leave considerable room for interpretation, as is often true of the impromptu statements of lawyers and judges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The magistrate\u2019s comments in this case were a mixture of suggestions about his factual findings and statements about his conclusions concerning reasonable cause. The trial court attempted to guess which witnesses the magistrate found doubtful, and having made its guess felt bound by the magistrate\u2019s findings. But where guesswork is required to determine what the magistrate found, there is no finding worthy of the deference required by the <em>Jones </em>decision. When forced to guess in this manner the superior court may find itself determining reasonable cause on the basis of evidence the magistrate disbelieved and without reliance upon evidence the magistrate found persuasive. If it does this, it is neither reviewing the magistrate\u2019s determination of reasonable cause nor making an independent determination. In essence it is abdicating its review function in favor of detective work concerning the magistrate\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">We have concluded that Mr. Gibson\u2019s Penal Code section 995 motion was improperly granted as to both the kidnaping charge and the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>circumstance allegations and that the trial court should reconsider the motion without regard to the purported \u201cfindings\u201d of the magistrate. We express no view concerning whether the record reveals reasonable cause to support the dismissed allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">We have reached our conclusions after full briefing by the parties. The result is clear. The court sees no purpose to be served by issuing an alternative writ, which would only cause further delay in the trial of Mr. Gibson. We therefore issue a peremptory writ in the first instance (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1088; <em>San Diego Wholesale Credit Men\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 458 [110 Cal.Rptr. 657]; <em>Goodenough </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 692, 697 [96 Cal.Rptr. 165]).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue, directing the trial court to vacate its order granting Dale Clayton Gibson\u2019s motion to dismiss and to reconsider the motion in light of the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Feinberg, J., and Scott, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
