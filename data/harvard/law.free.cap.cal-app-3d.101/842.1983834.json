Appellants are individuals, and an association of individuals, who own and live on residential parcels in the immediate vicinity of the tract. They petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate requiring the City to vacate the permit. Their petition named Almad\u00e9n as \u201cReal Party In Interest\u201d and the City, its planning commission, and its planning director as respondents. All four answered the petition. After a nonjury trial, the court filed exhaustively detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law adverse to appellants and entered judgment denying their petition. They appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">The material facts, and the pertinent provisions of state and local law, are not disputed. The record supports the following recitals, which principally quote the trial court\u2019s findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">Almad\u00e9n owned the eight-acre tract at all pertinent times. On April 27, 1977, it submitted to the City an application for a site development permit for the construction of a shopping center on the tract and a separate application \u201cfor environmental clearance\u201d of the project. The application for environmental clearance was presented and processed pursuant to provisions of article XX of the San Jose Municipal Code which the City had enacted by way of implementing parallel provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, div. 13, commencing with \u00a7 21000 [hereinafter CEQA]) and the State EIR Guidelines promulgated by the Secretary of the Resources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>Agency pursuant to CEQA. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 14, commencing with \u00a7 15000.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">When the second application was submitted, a committee of the City\u2019s planning department conducted an \u201cinitial study\u201d to determine whether the proposed project required the preparation of an \u201cenvironmental impact report\u201d or, in the alternative, a \u201cnegative declaration.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the basis of information compiled in the study, the committee recommended to the planning director that a negative declaration be prepared. He prepared a declaration in which he tentatively certified his determination that the project, as described in it, would \u201cnot have a significant effect on the environment.\u201d He also prepared a document giving notice of the declaration under the caption \u201cPublic Notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">CEQA and the State EIR Guidelines provide that advance \u201cpublic notice\u201d of a proposed negative declaration shall be given by one of three alternative methods which include \u201c[djirect mailing to owners of contiguous property.\u201d (\u00a7 21092.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Substantially identical provisions ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>pear in section 20302.1, subdivision (d), of the San Jose Municipal <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">In processing an application for environmental clearance such as Almaden\u2019s, the City followed the policy of giving notice of a proposed EIR or negative declaration by the method of \u201cdirect mailing to owners of property contiguous to the project,\u201d and not by any other method. (See fns. 3 and 4, ante.) It also required the applicant to identify the parcels of \u201ccontiguous\u201d property involved; to ascertain the names and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>addresses of their owners from the \u201cequalized assessment roll\u201d maintained by the Santa Clara County Assessor; and to deliver to the City\u2019s planning department stamped envelopes, addressed to the persons thus identified, for use in mailing the notice. The City\u2019s deputy planning director testified that this practice was employed because \u201cthe last equalized assessment roll is.. .the most available and most accessible on a continuing basis record of owners of property.\u201d He also testified that the City similarly \u201crelied upon\u201d the equalized assessment roll to identify persons to whom notices were to be given in \u201cother permit processes\u201d involving such matters as rezoning and variances.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">In compliance with the City\u2019s requirements, a consultant employed by Almad\u00e9n first determined that there were eleven parcels of land \u201ccontiguous\u201d to the eight-acre tract where the proposed shopping center was to be built. He then obtained the names and addresses of their owners as shown in the current equalized assessment roll, prepared 11 stamped envelopes addressed to these persons, and delivered the envelopes to the City\u2019s planning department as part of the application for environmental clearance filed there on April 27, 1977. Using these envelopes, the planning director mailed out copies of the \u201cPublic Notice\u201d and the proposed negative declaration on May 13, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The \u201cPublic Notice\u201d informed each addressee of the proposed negative declaration enclosed with it. Pursuant to section 20302.1 of the San Jose Municipal Code, the notice stated that the declaration was to be \u201cconsidered for adoption\u201d on May 20, 1977; that \u201ccomments\u201d on it were invited; and that its adoption on May 20, 1977, might be protested in writing \u201cprior to May 31, 1977 to be heard by the City Planning Commission.\u201d (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>It also stated that payment of a \u201c$50 protest fee\u201d was required. The proposed negative declaration enclosed with the notice informed the addressee that a \u201cprotest of a Negative Declaration will be heard by the City Planning Commission at the earliest possible date.\u201d (See ibid.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The planning director adopted the proposed negative declaration on May 20, 1977, as noticed. No one protested it in writing prior to May 31, 1977. It therefore became final on that date by operation of San Jose Municipal Code section 20302.1, subdivision (e). Belated opposition to the application for a site development permit developed later, but the City eventually granted it. A permit was issued to Almad\u00e9n on October 17, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>It was also established at the trial, however, that the \u201cPublic Notice\u201d and the proposed negative declaration had not been mailed to all the owners of property \u201ccontiguous\u201d to the project site on May 13, 1977, because some of them were not identified as such on the equalized assessment roll from which their names and addresses were obtained by Almaden\u2019s consultant. The Santa Clara County Assessor compiled and published the roll pursuant to statute. (See Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, pt. 2, ch. 3, art. 6 [Assessment Roll], commencing with \u00a7 601; see also <em>id., </em>\u00a7 2050 et seq.) He published it annually, on or about July 1, for the tax year commencing on that date. The roll published each July 1 was the \u201ccurrent official equalized assessment roll\u201d until the publication of the next one a year later. The roll \u201cas published\u201d was \u201csold to governmental agencies and members of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">The roll identified all parcels of land in Santa Clara County with numbers assigned to them by the assessor. It also showed the name and address of the record owner of each parcel as of the March 1 preceding the July 1 publication date. In this chronology, the roll currently in effect in April and May of 1977 (when Almaden\u2019s application for environmental clearance was submitted and processed) was the 1976-1977 roll published by the assessor on July 1, 1976, showing record ownerships as of March 1, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The names and addresses of owners shown on that roll were thus frozen as of March 1, 1976, but the assessor also maintained records, called \u201cupdates,\u201d which reflected changes in the record ownership of any parcel during the 1976-1977 tax year. His staff ascertained changes in the county recorder\u2019s office daily, noted them as \u201cupdates\u201d in his records for the affected parcels, and reproduced them on microfiche every four weeks. The \u201cupdates\u201d were not part of the \u201cofficial equalized assessment roll.\u201d The assessor accordingly did not distribute them from his office, but he made them readily available to the public there. \u201cUpon request,\u201d personnel of the office would \u201ctell members of the public how to find more up-to-date information than that contained in the equalized assessment roll.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">One of the eleven \u201ccontiguous\u201d parcels identified by Almaden\u2019s consultant was designated on the 1976-1977 equalized assessment roll as No. 581-10-069. It had been owned of record by Jimmy and Sue Morrison on March 1, 1976. The roll accordingly showed their names as its owners and stated their address. Appellants Stephen and Noel William<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>son became the record owners of parcel No. 581-10-069 on September 22, 1976. The record on appeal does not show when the Williamsons were first identified as such in the assessor\u2019s office, but it was established without dispute that the microfiche \u201cupdates\u201d showed their names as the owners of the parcel, and their mailing address, at least as early as February 25, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Almaden\u2019s consultant identified the Morrisons as the owners of parcel No. 581-10-069 when he resorted to the 1976-1977 equalized assessment roll as such. He did not learn that the Williamsons owned the parcel currently (i.e., in April of 1977) because he examined a copy of the roll he kept in his office. He did not look elsewhere, and he testified that he was unaware of the \u201cupdates\u201d which were available in the assessor\u2019s office. The City\u2019s deputy planning director testified that the planning department sometimes checked lists of \u201ccontiguous property owners... for accuracy once they\u2019re delivered to it.\u201d The department similarly used its own copy of the current equalized assessment roll for this purpose, and did not maintain updated records of parcel ownership. The deputy director was also unaware of the \u201cupdates\u201d or their availability at the assessor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In consequence of these events and omissions, the stamped envelope prepared by Almad\u00e9n for the owner of parcel No. 581-10-069 was addressed to the Morrisons; the planning director mailed the notice and proposed negative declaration to them as its owners; and no notice was mailed to the Williamsons, at any time, despite the fact that they had owned the parcel for almost eight months when the mailing took place. They received no notice of Almaden\u2019s proposed construction project until a neighbor informed them of it in June of 1977, after the negative declaration had been adopted without protest. They both testified that they would have protested the proposed negative declaration, and paid the protest fee, if they had received timely notice of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">\n<em>The Trial Court\u2019s Determinations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Appellants asserted below that the City\u2019s failure to include the Williamsons in the mailing of May 13, 1977, had the effect of invalidating all the subsequent administrative proceedings. After reciting most of the above-summarized events in its findings of fact, the trial court rejected this contention in four further \u201cfindings.\u201d They included conclusions of law, and the court substantially reiterated them as such, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>but the court\u2019s essential determinations are more clearly stated in the four \u201cfindings.\u201d We quote them as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\">\u201c23. In giving Notice of Preparation of Negative Declaration for this project, the City of San Jose and its agents used the current Equalized Assessment Roll... to determine the identity and addresses of landowners contiguous to the project for purposes of conveying Notice...; and this means of giving notice was adequate and reasonable for this purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">\u201c30. The use by the City... of the last Equalized Assessment Roll for determining the owners of.. .parcels contiguous to the project for the purposes of giving notice under San Jose Municipal Code section 20302.1(d) is reasonable, not an abuse of discretion, and not a violation of due process of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">\u201c32. The meaning of the term \u2018owners of property contiguous to the project\u2019 as that term is used in San Jose Municipal Code section 20302.1, which is applied by the City.. .Planning Department, is owners as shown on the last Equalized Assessment Roll of properties adjacent to or directly across a city street from the project.... The... [interpretation of this term]... applied by the.. .Planning Department. ..[is].. .reasonable and consistent with Article XX of the San Jose Municipal Code, the California Environmental Quality Act.. .and the Guidelines for Implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act... promulgated by the Secretary for Resources, and said definitions are adopted by this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">\u201c50. Petitioners [i.e., appellants] have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies in opposing the granting of the site development permit and the adoption of a Negative Declaration thereon in that they failed to file a timely protest as required by San Jose Municipal Code section 20302.1.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">The judgment denying appellants\u2019 petition for a writ of mandate was entered on the basis of these determinations. They filed a timely notice of appeal and petitioned this court for a \u201cstay order\u201d pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 923. We granted the petition and made an order staying enforcement of the judgment, and the operation of the site development permit and all related permits, until the further order of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>\n<em>Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Appellants contend that the negative declaration which was adopted and purportedly became final in May of 1977 was void, and that the site development permit issued later is void in consequence, because notice of the declaration as proposed was not mailed to the Williamsons on May 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Section 21092, Guideline 15083, subdivision (d), and San Jose Municipal Code section 20301.1, subdivision (d), uniformly permitted the City to give \u201cpublic notice\u201d of the proposed negative declaration by newspaper publication in the area where Almaden\u2019s tract is located, <em>or </em>by posting the tract and its vicinity, <em>or </em>by \u201cdirect mailing\u201d to the owners of property \u201ccontiguous\u201d to it. (See fns. 3 and 4, <em>ante.) </em>The City having selected the \u201cdirect mailing\u201d method in this case, as in others, appellants first urge that its failure to mail the notice to the William-sons was fatal to the subsequent administrative proceedings because the language of all three enactments is otherwise \u201cmandatory\u201d and not \u201cdirectory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Subject to the optional choice of method, each of the three enactments provides that notice \u201cshall\u201d be given by one of the prescribed methods or another. The interpretation of section 21092, and of CEQA generally, is controlled by omnibus sections of the Public Resources Code which provide that \u201c\u2018[s]hall\u2019 is mandatory\u201d in its construction except where \u201cthe context otherwise requires.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 5, 15.) The State EIR Guidelines include a similar provision for their construction. (See Guideline 15015, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The language of San Jose Municipal Code section 20302.1 is to be read subject to these provisions because it is wholly derived from the two state sources. (See fn. 1, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The provisions establish that the notice requirements in the three enactments are \u201cmandatory\u201d to the extent that the City was under an \u201cobligatory duty\u201d to comply with them. It does not necessarily follow that they are \u201cmandatory\u201d in the sense that failure to comply with them will have the effect of \u201cinvalidating the governmental action[s]\u201d to which they relate. <em>(Morris </em>v. <em>County of Marin </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 901, 908 [136 Cal.Rptr. 251, 559 P.2d 606].) Whether they are \u201cmanda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>tory\u201d in that consequential sense is to be determined from the legislative intent underlying their enactment. <em>(Pulcifer </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 258, 262 [175 P.2d 1]; see <em>Morris </em>v. <em>County of Marin, supra, </em>at pp. 908-910.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">\u201cIn the absence of express language, the intent must be gathered from the terms of the statute construed as a whole, from the nature and character of the act to be done, and from the consequences which would follow the doing or failure to do the particular act at the required time. When the object is to subserve some public purpose, the provision may be held directory or mandatory as will best accomplish that purpose, and the courts will look to see whether the provision is of the essence of the thing to be accomplished.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>(Pulcifer </em>v. <em>County of Alameda, supra, 29 </em>Cal.2d 258 at p. 262 [quoted with approval in <em>Morris </em>v. <em>County of Marin, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 901 at p. 910]. See also <em>People </em>v. <em>McGee </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 948, 961-962 [140 Cal.Rptr. 657, 568 P.2d 382].)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The Legislature has determined in CEQA itself, at exhaustive length, that the enactment serves a high public purpose in providing for the protection of the environment and the maintenance of its quality. (\u00a7\u00a7 21000-21003.) CEQA effectively imposes upon every \u201cpublic agency\u201d a duty to disapprove a project, if it will have significant effects on the environment as proposed, unless and until the agency has considered \u201cfeasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures which will avoid or substantially lessen such significant effects.\u201d (\u00a7 21002.) The agency\u2019s decision to prepare an EIR invokes the duty. (See \u00a7\u00a7 21002.1, 21061.) The adoption of a negative declaration operates to dispense with the duty because it is a decision that the proposed project will not affect the environment at all. (See \u00a7 21064.) Its terminal effect on the environmental review process means that it is vitally important to the purpose of CEQA. (See <em>No Oil, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 80-81, 85-86 [118 Cal.Rptr. 34, 529 P.2d 66]; Comment, <em>Environmental Decision Making Under CEQA: A Quest For Uniformity </em>(1977) 24 UCLA L.Rev. 838, 857-866.) The opportunities to protest it, and to be heard before its finality, are consequently important to that purpose as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Section 21092 and Guideline 15083, subdivision (d), offer these opportunities by providing for \u201cpublic notice\u201d of a proposed negative declaration \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time prior to final adoption.\u201d (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>Neither source expressly provides for protest and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>hearing at that time, but the availability of both is a logical extension of the requirement that notice be given in advance of \u201cfinal adoption.\u201d CEQA broadly invokes the policy of permitting full public participation throughout the environmental review process it commands. (See, e.g., \u00a7 21000, subd. (e); \u00a7 21003, subd. (b).) The State EIR Guidelines urge this policy upon all public agencies pursuing the process, and address it to the negative declaration stage in particular. (See Guidelines 15164 and 15083, subd. (e).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The City has effectuated the policy at that stage by providing in San Jose Municipal Code section 20302.1, subdivisions (e) through (g), that a proposed negative declaration may be protested and that it will not become final until protests are heard by the planning commission. (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em> In the definitive language of the Supreme Court decisions previously quoted, the protest procedure \u201csubserves the public purpose\u201d of CEQA itself. Because the purpose will be utterly frustrated by a failure to comply with the provisions of law requiring \u201cpublic notice\u201d of a proposed negative declaration, and of the protest and hearing procedure established locally, those provisions are \u201cof the essence of the thing to be accomplished.\u201d <em>(Pulcifer </em>v. <em>County of Alameda, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 258 at p. 262.) They are accordingly \u201cmandatory\u201d in the sense that noncompliance with them will have the effect of \u201cinvalidating the governmental action[s]\u201d which follow. <em>(Morris </em>v. <em>County of Marin, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 901 at p. 908.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The trial court apparently took this view, but determined in effect that the City <em>complied </em>with the requirement of \u201cdirect mailing\u201d to the owners of \u201ccontiguous\u201d property when it mailed notice of the proposed negative declaration to those \u201cowners\u201d as they were shown on the last equalized assessment roll published by the Santa Clara County Assessor. (See finding No. 32, quoted <em>ante.) </em>We disagree with this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>The term \u201cowner\u201d is not defined in CEQA, nor in the State EIR Guidelines, nor in the pertinent provisions of the San Jose Municipal Code, but it is not qualified in point of time where it appears in any of them. The requirement that \u201cpublic notice\u201d of a proposed negative declaration be given is obviously intended to reach those members of segments of the public who have a current interest in the declaration and its consequences. The equalized assessment roll is by definition an annual, one-time compilation of the \u201cowners\u201d of affected land as they appeared of record at a fixed date which might be one year or more past at any point during the life of the roll. A person identified on it as an \u201cowner\u201d of a particular parcel, but who had divested himself of its ownership since the roll was published, is unlikely to be interested in an environmental decision that no longer affects him.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The practice of mailing notices to persons who <em>were </em>\u201cowners\u201d thus involves an immeasurable risk that the result will be\u2014as it was here\u2014a failure to communicate with persons who have a stake in the. noticed action because they <em>are </em>\u201cowners.\u201d The risk is such that the practice is essentially unreliable as a generator of public participation in the environmental review process as contemplated in CEQA (see \u00a7 21000, subd. (e); \u00a7 21003, subd. (b)), and of the public response to a proposed negative declaration which is expressly anticipated in the State EIR Guidelines and in San Jose Municipal Code section 20302.1. (See fns. 6 and 4, <em>ante.) </em>The practice is accordingly inconsistent with these sources, and with the patent purpose of the notice requirements exacted in all of them. It is accordingly to be deemed noncompliance with the \u201cdirect mailing\u201d method once that method has been selected as the sources permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Respondents defend the trial court\u2019s determination to the contrary by arguing that the mandatory requirements are designed to give \u201cpublic notice\u201d of a proposed negative declaration, as distinguished from notice to identifiable individuals who must be reached without exception; that the communication of notice by \u201cdirect mailing\u201d to <em>some </em>of the contiguous owners was at least as effective as the limited notice likely to be achieved through the alternatively permissible methods of publication or posting; and that various other statutes permit notices to be given to \u201cowners\u201d of property as shown on the current equalized assessment roll for the county involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The first two arguments urge the essential point that <em>substantial </em>compliance with the \u201cdirect mailing\u201d method will obviate <em>noncom</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>pliance with it once that method has been selected at the City\u2019s option. It is true that \u201cpublic notice\u201d of a proposed negative declaration is the stated objective of section 21092, of Guideline 15083, subdivision (d), and of San Jose Municipal Code section 20302.1, subdivision (d). (See fns. 3 and 4, <em>ante.) </em>It is also true that published or posted notice may fall short of achieving that objective to the extent that it will not be seen or read by all persons it is intended to reach. (See, e.g., <em>In re La Opinion </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 1012, 1019 [89 Cal.Rptr. 404].) However, the Legislature has effectively determined in section 21092 that the \u201cdirect mailing\u201d method, once permissibly selected, will achieve the objective of \u201cpublic notice\u201d only if it is to be a class defined as the \u201cowners\u201d of contiguous property. Because the term designating the class is all-inclusive, it must be deemed exclusive as well. Moreover, the acceptance of <em>substantial </em>compliance on the facts of one case will permit its rejection or extension on the facts of another. The consequent disparity in the enforcement of CEQA could frustrate uniformity in its application. Substantial compliance with the \u201cdirect mailing\u201d method of giving notice is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The Legislature has occasionally provided that the \u201cowners\u201d of property who are entitled to certain notices may be identified from the \u201cequalized assessment roll.\u201d (See, e.g., Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 35311, 53521, 58108, 65905.) Each of those provisions reflects a legislative determination that the roll is an adequate source for the particular purpose. The determination is explicit and isolated in each instance, it has not been made in section 21092, and its appearance elsewhere has no effect here.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">It may be pointed out that strict enforcement of the \u201cdirect mailing\u201d method of giving notice of a proposed negative declaration or EIR will not substantially increase the administrative burden to be borne by public agencies electing to use that method. A routine check among the current \u201cupdates\u201d in the Santa Clara County Assessor\u2019s office would have turned up the names and addresses of the Williamsons in short order. Any risk of a current time lag in such \u201cupdates,\u201d however brief, may be avoided by resort to the optionally alternative methods of giving notice by publication or posting. The cost of either may be imposed on the applicant involved. (See \u00a7 21089.) The shortcomings of either, as a medium for giving actual notice, are matters to be addressed by the Legislature. It having defined a class to whom notice must be given if the \u201cdirect mailing\u201d method is employed, there is no plausible justification for identifying members of the class by consulting an obsolete record source.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>Section 21168.5 permits a court to reverse a decision by a public agency for \u201cprejudicial abuse of discretion\u201d in the administration of CEQA. It also provides that \u201c[a]buse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law.... \u201d The City\u2019s noncompliance with section 21092, in giving notice of the proposed negative declaration by the otherwise permissible method of \u201cdirect mailing,\u201d constituted a failure to proceed in the manner required by law. (Cf. <em>No Oil, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 68 at p. 88.) Appellants\u2019 challenge of the proceedings which followed, including the site development permit issued by the City, is therefore valid.
