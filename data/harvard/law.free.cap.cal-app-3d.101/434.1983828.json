All bidders except appellant and the Sterns dropped out of the bidding when it reached $2.7 million. Appellant made a final bid of $3.25 million, and the Sterns then made their successful overbid of $3.26 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">At this juncture, after stating that it wished the final terms and conditions put in writing before it would confirm the sale, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>nevertheless proceeded to confirm the sale, as a minute entry evidences, \u201cfor $3,260,000 on terms as stated for the record.\u201d The terms referred to were the amendments earlier alluded to and which were stated \u201cfor the record\u201d in court by counsel for respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">On September 29, 1978, appellant filed a petition to vacate the sale, alleging in essence that, following confirmation, the estates\u2019 representatives and the Sterns had made radical changes in the terms of sale which, had they been proposed to appellant, would have justified the latter\u2019s raising his bid to $3.27 million. A few weeks later, on October 13, 1978, respondents and the Sterns filed a stipulated order confirming their sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">On the same date, October 13, 1978, the court heard and denied appellant\u2019s motion to vacate under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The notice of appeal, we observe, is from the order filed October 13 confirming sale of real property,  Appellant\u2019s view is that he has standing because the Court of Appeal denied respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss said appeal. But such denial imported no resolution of the appeal, since the motion was rejected without opinion or comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">An order confirming a sale of real property is appealable under Probate Code section 1240 (cf. <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1933) 218 Cal. 364 [23 P.2d 283] by any \u201caggrieved party.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 902.) An \u201caggrieved party\u201d is one having an interest in the subject matter recognizable by law, and injuriously affected by the judgment or order. (Cf. <em>Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 158 [143 Cal.Rptr. 633].)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Appellant here is demonstrably not an aggrieved party. On the day of his first appearance in the action, May 12, 1978, when he filed an increased bid in the confirmation hearing and was outbid, appellant had, at best, a <em>prospective </em>interest in the subject sale. Upon being outbid, his interest in the proceedings terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Cases cited by appellant to the contrary are inapposite. Thus, in <em>Estate of Bradley </em>(1914) 168 Cal. 655 [144 P. 136] and <em>In re Pearsons </em>(1893) 98 Cal. 603 [33 P. 451], original purchasers in return of sales were aggrieved parties, having acquired rights to the property at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>pursuant to binding executory contracts, and subject only to probate confirmation. (Cf. 24 Cal.Jur.3d, Decedents\u2019 Estates, \u00a7 548, pp. 880-882.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In <em>Estate of Cole </em>(1954) 124 Cal.App.2d 615 [269 P.2d 73], it is true, the appeal was by an unsuccessful bidder from an order confirming sale of real property, but the court assumed standing and the question was neither presented nor discussed. Instead, the issue presented was an asserted violation of Probate Code section 785 grounded in the contention that the trial court refused to accept the highest bid because it erroneously considered that the unsuccessful bid, being subject to a brokers\u2019 commission, was not the net high bid. The standing issue was never tendered and the court held that the high bid was that which, net of commission, realized the greater benefit to the estate, as of the time of the confirmation hearing. (Cf. 1 Miller &amp; Starr, Current Law of Cal. Real Estate (rev.ed. 1975) Specific Real Estate Contracts, \u00a7 2:49, pp. 298-299, respecting legislative amendment of Prob. Code, \u00a7 785 in response to <em>Estate of Cole, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">We believe that no California case authority stands for the proposition, asserted by appellant, that an unsuccessful bidder at probate sale has standing to appeal an order confirming sale of estate property, as an \u201caggrieved party,\u201d merely by virtue of having participated as an unsuccessful bidder at the confirmation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">As Witkin has said, \u201cA person not a party to the action as originally commenced or tried may make himself a party to the <em>record, </em>subsequent to judgment in the action, by moving to vacate.\u201d (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 115, p. 4115.) Witkin also observes: \u201cThe general rule allowing appeals from orders granting or denying... motions to vacate.. .does not apply in probate, and such orders are nonappealable... [\u00b6] And an exception is recognized where the motion to vacate is the only way in which an aggrieved party can protect his rights; denial of the motion in such a case is appealable.\u201d (Witkin, op.cit., \u00a7 108, p. 4109; see also <em>Estate of Baker </em>(1915) 170 Cal. 578 [150 P. 989] [motion to vacate ex parte order dismissing will contest].)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">We likewise find no error in the fact appellant received no notice of the order confirming the sale to the Stems, since the claim of entitlement to notice is founded on the erroneous assumption that appellant was party to the estate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Having failed to appeal from denial of the motion to vacate, appellant lacks standing in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Racanelli, P.J., and Grodin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 22, 1980, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 27, 1980.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
