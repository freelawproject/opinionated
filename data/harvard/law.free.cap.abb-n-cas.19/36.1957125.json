Stolzel and Arthur F. Stolzel, as devisees and legatees under an instrument claimed to have been executed by this decedent on July 17,1883, as a second codicil to a paper heretofore admitted to probate as his last will and testament, commenced in June last a proceeding in this court for the probate of such second codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">It is alleged in their petition that the decedent died in February, 1885, in the city of Hew York; that he left in the said city personal assets of great value ; that the paper under which the petitioners claim came into being in the . city of Vienna, in the Empire of Austria; that it is holographic, and bears the signature of decedent as its maker ; that though it does not purport to have been executed in the presence of any person as a subscribing witness, it is nevertheless valid and effectual, because it was executed in accordance with the laws of the said Empire of Austria, in which decedent then had his residence and permanent domicil; that it is not produced before the surrogate for the reason that it is in the possession of a certain Austrian court in the petition specified, which court will not suffer it to be removed from its files.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Answers have been interposed on behalf of certain persons interested under the will as proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">It is insisted by the respondents that this court is without jurisdiction in the premises :</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">First.\u2014Because of the non-production of the instrument \u25a0whose probate is sought, and</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Second.\u2014Because of the conceded fact that such instrument is without subscribing witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">First. Is the actual production of a testamentary paper before the surrogate essential to the exercise of his jurisdiction to grant or to refuse probate ? Certainly not in all cases. Section 2621 of the Code of Civil Procedure expressly declares that \u201c a lost or destroyed will \u201d can be proved in a surrogate\u2019s court. But the respondent\u2019s claim that only such cases as are covered by section 2621 are excepted from what'they insist is the general rule, that without the physical presence of the paper sought to be established as a will, the surrogate is powerless to adjudicate upon its title to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">If there had been no change in the statutes touching the jurisdiction of this court since the arising of the situation upon which the court of appeals comments in Russell <em>v. </em>Hartt (87 N. Y. 19), the question here presented would be susceptible of an easy solution. That situation was as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">The surrogate of Ulster county had admitted to probate an instrument that had never been produced before him, and that could not be produced for the reason that it was in the custody of a court in Scotland which refused to give it up. That instrument disposed of real and personal property in Scotland, and of other real and personal property in the State of \u00a1New York. It had been executed in accordance with the formalities both of the Scotch law and of the law of this State. The subscribing witnesses were examined in Scotland under a commission issued by the surrogate, and their depositions were admitted at the trial and constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the evidence by which the decree appealed from was supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">In the course of an opinion in which all his associate judges concurred, Finch, J., pronounced chapter 460 of the act of May 16, 1837, broad enough in its terms to authorize the surrogate to take proofs of an existent will without requiring its production.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The provisions to which the learned judge referred were manifestly those contained in the 1st, 71st and 77th sections of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Section 1st gave to the surrogate of each county authority \u201c to take the proof of last wills and testaments of all deceased persons in the following cases \u2014(naming them.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Section 71st expressly abrogated the limitation imposed upon the surrogate\u2019s authority by sec. 1, tit. 1, chap. 2, part 3 of the Revised Statutes, to the effect that \u201c no surrogate shall, under pretext of incidental power or constructive authority, exercise any jurisdiction whatever not expressly given by some statute of this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Section 77th provided that, \u201c on any proceedings or matter in controversy before a surrogate, when the testimony of a witness in any other State or territory of the United States, or any foreign place, is required by any party to such proceeding or controversy, the surrogate may issue a commission to take such testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">The act of 1837 was repealed in terms by the general repealing act of May 10, 1880 (L. 1880, chap. 245), but the provisions upon which rests the decision in Russell <em>v. </em>Hartt, were substantially re-enacted in the Code of Civil Procedure :</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">First. Section 1 of the old law reappears as section 2476 of the Code. To the surrogate\u2019s court.of each county the latter statute gives \u201cjurisdiction, exclusive of every other surrogate\u2019s court to take the proof of a will, .... in either of the following cases : \u201d\u2014(specifying them.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">A comparison of the language just quoted with the language of section 1 of the act of 1837, <em>supra, </em>does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>even faintly suggest the notion that by the later statute the legislature intended to restrain the surrogate\u2019s probate jurisdiction within narrower limits than had been fixed by the earlier. Unqualified authority <em>\u201c </em>to take the proof of a will \u201d would surely be no less comprehensive than unqualified authority \u201c to take the proof of last wills and testaments of all deceased persons; \u201d and while the authority conferred by neither of the statutes under consideration is unqualified, but in both of them is limited to certain specified <em>\u201c </em>following cases,\u201d it will appear, when the two sets of \u201cfollowing cases\u201d are juxtaposited, that while the.field of the surrogate\u2019s jurisdiction has been in no respect narrowed, it has been in some respects enlarged by the later enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Second. It cannot be claimed that any change has been wrought in the character and the extent of the authority of this court by the repeal of section 71 of the act of 1837, which itself repealed the inhibition of the Revised Statutes against the exercise by the surrogate of \u201c incidental powers ; \u201d for, by subdivision 11 of section 2481 of the Code, the -surrogate is authorized \u201c to proceed in all matters subject to the cognizance of his court,\u201d where it is not otherwise prescribed by statute, \u201c according to the course and practice of a court having by the common law jurisdiction of such matters, and to exercise such incidental powers as are necessary to carry into effect the powers expressly conferred.\u201d It is true that section 2472 of the Code, which is now the source of the surrogate\u2019s general jurisdiction, and which in its first subdivision empowers him \u201c to take the proof of wills \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>to admit wills to probate,\u201d declares in its concluding sentence that the jurisdiction thus conferred \u201c must be exercised in the cases and in the manner prescribed by statute.\u201d But a like restriction, in words almost identical, was imposed by section 1, tit. 1, chap. II, part 3 of the Revised Statutes (3 Banks, 6th ed. 326), and remained unaltered upon the statute book until it was displaced by the corresponding provision of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Third. Section 77 of the act of 1837 gave the surrogate authority to issue commissions for the examination of witnesses in other States or countries. It will of Course be conceded that powers no less ample are now conferred by the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">[See section 2538, making applicable to surrogates\u2019 courts article 2nd of tit. 3 of chapter IX, which relates to \u201c depositions taken without the State for use within the State.\u201d]</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">I have thus demonstrated that if the decision in Russell <em>v. </em>Hartt is not to be taken as controlling my disposition of the principal matter here in controversy, it is for some reason quite apart from any supposed variations between those sections of the act of 1837 upon which the decision rests, and cognate provisions in the law as it stands to-day.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">But the parties opposing the probate of the alleged codicil insist that lack of jurisdiction in the surrogate\u2019s court to prove a testamentary paper not produced, and not sought to be established as lost or destroyed, is made apparent by reference to section 1861 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">This section\" forms a part of art. 3, tit. 3, chap. XV. The chapter is wholly concerned with certain special provisions regulating'\u201c <em>Actions </em>/\u201d the title is styled \u201c <em>Actions </em>relating to the estate of a decedentthe article is entitled \u201c <em>Actions </em>to establish or impeach a willthe section provides that in certain specified classes of cases one may maintain an <em>action </em>to procure a judgment establishing a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The first and second of these classes are described as follows : \u201c Where a will of real or personal property or both has been executed in such a manner and under such circumstances that it might, under the laws of the State, be admitted to probate in a surrogate\u2019s court, but the original will,\u201d either (a) \u201cis in another State or country,.under such circumstances that it cannot be obtained for that purpose,\u201d or (b) \u201chas been lost or destroyed by accident or design.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">The third class is thus defined : \u201c Where a will of personal property, made by a person who resided without the State at the time of the execution thereof, or at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>his death, has been duly executed according to the laws of the State or country in which it was executed, or in which the testator resided at the time of his death, and the case is not one where the will can be admitted to probate in a surrogate\u2019s court under the laws of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The language of the first part of the first and the last part of the last subdivision certainly seems to involve the notion that inability to produce a will because of its detention in another State or country, operates to prevent its admission to probate in a surrogate\u2019s court, even though that court would else have undoubted jurisdiction in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">If, however, the statutes which confer upon the surrogate his authority in matters of probate, contain no such restrictions and limitations as regards wills not produced in his court, but on the contrary, are couched in terms sufficiently broad and general to justify him in taking the proofs of such instruments, it is plain, I think, that he is not to be ousted of his jurisdiction by mere inference and implication from words used by the legislature in conferring jurisdiction upon other tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Suppose that among the cases specified in section 1861, as warranting the maintenance of an action to establish a will, was the case following: <em>\u201c </em>Where a will has been executed under such circumstances that it might, under the laws of the State, be admitted to probate in a surrogate\u2019s-court, <em>but </em>\u201d such will is worded in the German language, or is written on blue paper; it could scarcely be claimed that such a provision would, of itself, deprive the surrogate of authority to take proof of wills written on blue paper, or of wills expressed in the German tongue. There is no such virtue in a <em>but. </em>And that \u201c but \u201d has no such virtue, as it is employed in this section, becomes manifest upon consideration of the last clause of its first subdivision\u2014the clause relating to lost wills and wills that have been destroyed. The punctuation of the section is so faulty that upon a casual reading one may fail to note, that that clause, like the one preceding, is connected with clause first by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>word \u201c but.\u201d [I have made that fact conspicuous by the insertion of the word \u201c either \u201d before the words \u201c is in another State or country \u201d in the foregoing quotation from the Statute.]</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The implication that procedure by action is the <em>only </em>procedure whereby lost and destroyed wills can be proved, and that surrogates\u2019 courts are therefore powerless in the premises, is no less definite and positive than the implication that an <em>action </em>is the only proceeding for establishing wills detained in a foreign state or country, and for that cause not producible. But there is not the slightest ground for supposing that the legislature or the codifiers intended that the provision which thus empowers courts of general jurisdiction to establish a lost or destroyed will should be taken as involving a denial of like authority to the surrogate. On the contrary, section 2621 of the Code, which went into operation simultaneously with section 1861? expressly provides that <em>\u201c </em>a lost or destroyed will can be admitted to probate in a surrogate\u2019s court.\u201d And it would appear from Mr. Throop\u2019s note to section 1861 that the latter section does not embody an afterthought of the codifiers, but that, when the phraseology of the earlier was under consideration, the commissioners had in mind the extension to all surrogates\u2019 courts, of that power of proving lost and destroyed wills which had been exercised by the surrogate of this county since 1870.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">That section 1861 should not receive the interpretation claimed for it by these contestants is apparent from another consideration. An examination of the statutes for which it has been substituted will show, that those statutes furnished the appellant in Bussell <em>v. </em>Hartt with arguments against the authority there exercised by the surrogate, no less forcible than the arguments based in the case at bar upon the supposed restrictive language of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Section 1861 is in the main a re-enactment, with modifications, of sections <em>63a, 68a </em>and 63b, tit. 1, chap. VI, part 2, Rev. Stat. (3 Banks, 6th ed., 70 and 71).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Section 63a provided that \u201c a will duly executed according to the laws of this State, where the witnesses to the same reside without the jurisdiction of this State, or a duly exemplified or authenticated copy thereof, where the original will is in the possession of a court or tribunal of justice in another country or State whence the same cannot be obtained, may be proved in the court of chancery, upon a commission to be issued for that purpose on application to the chancellor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Section 68a provided that \u201c wills of personal estate duly executed by persons residing out of this State, according to the laws of the State or country in which the same were made, may be proved under a commission to be issued by the chancellor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Neither of these sections contains- any express, reference to the circumstance to which they both owe their origin\u2014 the lack of power in the surrogate\u2019s court of that time 'to issue a commission for the examination of witnesses without the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Sections 63a-68a did not form a part of the Revised \u00a1Statutes as originally enacted, but were inserted afterwards (\u00a7 16, chap. 320, <em>Laws of </em>1830). In commenting upon their object and effect the revisers say: \u201cThere was no provision in the old statute, nor is any contained in the new, relative to the proof of foreign wills. The above sections will remedy the omission in a manner which, it is believed, will be entirely safe \u201d (5 <em>Edm. Stat. </em>631).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The sections here referred to continued in force uninterruptedly until their repeal in 1880, and that, too, without any modification except such as was occasioned by the abolition of the court of chancery, and the transference of \u25a0 its powers and jurisdiction to the supreme court (\u00a7 16, chap. 280, <em>Laws of </em>1847).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">That these sections lodged, first in the chancery court and thereafter in its successor, exclusive jurisdiction of wills not producible because of their detention in a foreign tribunal, and of wills whose probate involved the examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>tion of witnesses without the State, was strenuously urged before the court of appeals in Russell <em>v. </em>Hartt.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">But Finch, J., pronouncing the court\u2019s opinion, expressly sanctions the contention of the respondents in that proceeding, that before the enactment of chapter 320 <em>(supra), </em>the surrogate\u2019s court had had jurisdiction to take proof of foreign wills, and continued to have it thereafter, but that this jurisdiction was <em>\u201c </em>so hampered and rendered ineffectual, in cases where the witnessess could not be produced, by the inability of the court to issue a commission, as to make necessary and occasion \u201d the grant of authority to the chancellor. This view of the matter was very clearly and forcibly enunciated by Surrogate Bradford in Isham <em>v. </em>Gibbons (1 <em>Bradf. </em>69), cited with approval in Russell <em>v. </em>Hartt.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">I am satisfied that there are no such differences between sections 63a-69a, as thus construed, and section 1861 of the Code, as to warrant the notion that, by the latter enactment, the legislature intended to hedge about the probate jurisdiction of the surrogate with restrictions such as had never theretofore been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Counsel for the contestants lay some stress upon the direction contained in section 2635 of the Code, to the effect that except where special provision is otherwise made by law, a written will, after it has been proved, \u201c must be retained by the surrogate until the expiration of - one year after it has been recorded . . . and must then be returned upon demand to the person who delivered it,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">This provision has taken the place of section 54, tit. 1, chap. VI, part 2, of the Revised Statutes (2 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>66), which declared that <em>\u201c </em>all wills, whenever proved according to law, except such as are required to be deposited, shall, after being recorded, be returned upon demand to the person who delivered the same,\u201d etc., etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">The language of section 2635 involves no stronger implication that the production of a will must precede its admission to probate, than is involved in the provisions above quoted from the Bevised Statutes, and the latter pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>visions were in force when the will which occasioned the controversy-in Russell <em>v. </em>Hartt was admitted to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">It would be profitless to make detailed comment upon the results of comparing, section by section, the terminology of the Code with that of the various statutes which it has supplanted. To any person who will undertake that com-' parison, it will clearly appear that, both in spirit and in letter, the later enactments contemplate an expansion rather than a contraction of the authority of this court. If there be any difference at all, therefore, between the present situation and that which existed at the entry of the decree in Russell <em>v. </em>Hartt, it is a difference which makes the decision in that case all the more controlling in-this.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Second. The claim that this proceeding should be dismissed because the codicil, for whose probate it asks, is unattested, rests upon a very slender foundation. I have already referred to the provisions in sections 2472 and 2476 of the Code of Civil Procedure, one of which gives to the surrogates of the State general authority to <em>\u201c </em>take the proof of wills \u201d and \u201c to admit wills to probate,\u201d and the other of which specifies the cases in which that authority may be exercised in any particular county by the surrogate of such county.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">One of the cases thus specified is described as follows : <em>\u201c </em>Where the decedent, not being a resident of the State, died within that county, leaving personal property within the State.\u201d The case at bar, assuming, as it must of course be assumed for present purposes, that the allegations of the .petition are true, indisputably falls within that description.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">Row, there is in the Code another section (\u00a7 2611) whose last five words, are claimed to deprive surrogates of the power of proving any wills whatever, except such as are attested by at least two subscribing witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">It is certainly the chief, if not the exclusive, purpose of the section referred to, to prescribe by what law, foreign or domestic, the validity of the execution of-a will shall be tested. It substantially declares that a will\" of personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>property shall he deemed sufficiently executed in any of the following cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">First. Where it has been executed in conformity with the laws of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Second. Where it has been executed without the limits of this State\" but in some other State of this country or in the Dominion of Canada or in the Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and. according to the laws of the place of its execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Third. Where it has been executed, not in conformity with the laws of this State, but in conformity with the law of its maker\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Section 2611 is, in the main, a mere recasting of chapter 118 of the Laws of 1876, a statute which was in force from the time of its enactment until the adoption of the Code. It must certainly be admitted on all hands that, during this interval, the personal-property will of a decedent who resided at the time of its execution in any State or territory of this country, would have been admissible in a surrogate\u2019s court, despite the non-observance by the testator of the formalities of execution prescribed by our own laws, if he had duly observed the formalities of execution prescribed by the law of his domicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Now, there were, during that interval at least ten of the States and two of the territories of the United States in which holographic wills, that bore the name of no subscribing witness, were entitled to probate. And such is the case to-day. Those States and Territories are Arkansas, California, Dakota, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">If these contestants put a correct interpretation upon section 2611, an unattested holographic will, executed by a resident of any of those localities, must necessarily fail of probate in this court, for the reason that the only provision for probate in that section is a provision-that a will may be proved- <em>\u201c </em>as prescribed in this article \u201d (article 1 of title 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>of chap. XVIII), and that in such article, as they claim, no procedure is established for proving testamentary papers unattested by witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">If the latter of these two contentions were strictly correct, it would not, in my judgment, follow that such wills must needs be rejected, unless in article 1, <em>supra, </em>or elsewhere upon the statute book, there appears some provision which prohibits their probate in surrogates\u2019 courts. If general jurisdiction in the premises is lodged in those courts, and the legislature have neglected to point out the precise way in which that jurisdiction can be exercised, the surrogate is at liberty to adopt such modes of procedure as the exigencies of the case demand. This would merely require a resort to the incidental powers with which he is vested by section 2481 of the Code (Isham <em>v. </em>Gibbons, 1 <em>Bradf. </em>69 ; Pew <em>v. </em>Hastings, 1 <em>Barb. Ch. </em>452 ; Brick\u2019s Estate, 15 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>12; Tompkins v. Moseman, 5 <em>Redf. </em>402; Kohler <em>v. </em>Knapp, 1 <em>Bradf. </em>241; Sipperly <em>v. </em>Baucus, 24 <em>N. Y. </em>46).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In Seaman <em>v. </em>Duryea (10 <em>Barb. </em>523), affirmed in the court of appeals (11 <em>N. Y. </em>324), it was held that, although surrogates\u2019 courts were courts whose jurisdiction was derived altogether from the statutes, nevertheless\" the authority to do certain acts or to exert a certain degree of power, need not be given in express words. If the authority may be fairly and reasonably inferred from the general language of the statutes, or if it be necessary to accomplish its objects, and to the just and useful exercise of the powers expressly given, it may be taken as granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">In Campbell <em>v. </em>Logan (2 <em>Bradf. </em>90), Surrogate Bbadfoed said: \u201cThe Bevised Statutes define the jurisdiction of the surrogate and direct its exercise \u2018 in the cases and in the manner prescribed by the statutes of the State,\u2019 but the power to take the proof of wills being given generally, the mode of its exercise in a case not provided for by statute, must be regulated by the court in the exercise of a sound discretion, according to the peculiar circumstances of each particular case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Bnt not only is it true that no statute forbids the surrogate to admit to probate an unattested will of personal property executed in accordance with the law of the testator\u2019s domicil; it is also true that the procedure established by article 1, <em>supra, </em>does not pretend to relate exclusively to wills that have subscribing witnesses. Some of the provisions of that article, for example, sections 2618, 2619, and 2620, especially concern wills of that description, and prescribe under what circumstances subscribing witnesses must be examined, and under what circumstances their examination may be dispensed with. But other provisions of the article are broad enough to include every species of will covered by the terms of section 2611.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Section 2614 declares the requirements of the petition for probate. It contains no intimation of a limitation to attested wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Section 2622 establishes as the only prerequisite for the-admission of any will described in section 2611 that the surrogate shall <em>\u201c </em>inquire particularly into all the facts and circumstances and must be satisfied of the genuineness of the will and the validity of its execution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Section 2623 provides that \u201c if it appears to the surrogate that the will was duly executed, and that the testator, at the time of executing it, was in all respects competent to malee a will, and not under restraint, it must be admitted to probate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">I am of the opinion that neither of the objections of these respondents is well taken. They must, therefore, be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">II. <em>June, </em>1887.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">From the order denying the motion to dismiss the proceedings the executor appealed to the general term of the supreme court.</p>\n<author id=\"b97-10\">Van Brunt, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Am\">It may not be at all necessary to add anything to the opinion which has been rendered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the surrogate upon the disposition of this motion. It may be proper, however, to consider, in view of the intimation of the court of appeals in the case of Younger <em>v. </em>Duffie (94 <em>N. Y. </em>535), whether any change has been made by the Code <em>of Civil </em>Procedure in the practice and powers of the surrogate as they existed at the time that the question in the case of Russell <em>v. </em>Hartt (87 N. <em>Y. </em>19), arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">It is admitted by the counsel for the appellants that, if no change has been made in the jurisdiction of the surrogate\u2019s court by the present Code, the decision in the case of Russell v. Hartt, must be deemed conclusive as to the existence of jurisdiction in the surrogate\u2019s court to entertain the application in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">It is to be observed that the decision in Russell <em>v. </em>Hartt, seems to be based largely upon the ground of the extension of jurisdiction in the surrogate\u2019s court by the provisions of chapter 460 of the laws of 1837. The objection was taken that, except in a case where a will of personal estate duly \u25a0executed in this State by a person not' a resident of this .State shall in the first instance have been duly admitted to probate in the court of a foreign State or country, no authority has ever been given to a surrogate to act on a will the \u25a0original of which could not be produced before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The court held that the act is broad enough to cover the case, as it expressly authorizes the surrogate of each county to take proof of the wills of all deceased persons where the testator, not being an inhabitant of this.State, shall die out of the State leaving assets in the county of such surrogate, and then restores the incidental powers of surrogates, and authorizes them to issue commissions to take testimony in foreign countries. The court further held that as the surrogate has the power to issue commissions to take testimony in foreign countries, the issuance of such a commission makes the \u25a0commissioners officers of the court for the purpose for which it was issued, and that in the execution of the authority conferred, the commissioners stand in the place of and represent \u25a0 the court, and that the exhibition of an original will before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>them 'was substantially a production of the will before the court. In the case at bar the jurisdictional facts, although different, come under the same section of the act of 1837 as is mentioned in the case of Russell <em>v. </em>Hartt. Section 2476 of the Code seems to be substantially an equivalent to the section of the act of 1837 referred to in the case cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The decision, therefore, in the case above mentioned, is distinctly to the effect that the production of an original will before commissioners appointed by the surrogate to take evidence, is substantially a production of the will before the surrogate\u2019s court, and therefore the provisions of the Code, which appear to require the production of a will in any case before the surrogate, are complied with by the production of the will before the commissioners appointed by the surrogate to take proof in reference to its execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The case of Younger <em>v. </em>Duffie (94 <em>N. Y. </em>535), does not, in any respect conflict with this view. The question there before the court was as to the jurisdiction of the supreme court to entertain an action to prove a will, the original of which remained on file in the archives of the notary\u2019s office at the city of Cadiz in Spain, from which the same could not by reason of the laws of Spain be taken for the purpose of being admitted to probate under the laws of the State of New York, or for any other purpose whatsoever. The court simply decided that the fact that the will could not be obtained for production in the surrogate\u2019s court of Bielimond county gave the supreme court jurisdiction to entertain an action under the provisions of section 1861 of the Code of Civil Procedure. But it was not decided, and it was not intended to be decided, that the surrogate\u2019s court was deprived of jurisdiction to entertain proceedings for the probate of the will, simply because the will itself was not produced before the surrogate of that county.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">There is no evidence of any intention upon the part of the legislature by the enactment of section 1861 to deprive the surrogate\u2019s court of any jurisdiction which it otherwise had, but simply to confer jurisdiction upon courts to enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>tain an action to procure a judgment, establishing a will under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">It would be a forced application of the rule of repeal by implication to hold that, because of supposed inconsistencies between the provisions of section 1861 of the Code and the jurisdiction which the surrogates\u2019 courts had been accustomed to exercise, and which they would be undoubtedly held to have the right to continue to exercise were it not for these apparent inconsistencies, the jurisdiction of the surrogates\u2019 court had been thereby abridged.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Full force and effect can be given to section 1861 without in any respect infringing upon that jurisdiction which had been recognized by the court df appeals to exist in surrogates\u2019 courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Daniels and Bartlett, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
