(32 <em>Hun, </em>4), a suit brought to restrain the removal of two instruments in plaintiff\u2019s place of business, it was held that a public corporation should make no distinction in respect to persons who wish to partake of the privileges which it was created to furnish, and owes the duty impartially to grant to all, who comply with its rules, the privileges furnished.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-5\">In Smith v. Gold &amp; Stock Telegraph Co. (42 <em>Hun, </em>454), plaintiff brought suit to restrain the removal of a \u201c ticker,\u201d or reporting instrument, maintained and operated by the defendant, and from doing or failing to do any act which would in any way interfere with the receipt by plaintiff of the quotations of the New York Stock Exchange.\u201d The court (pp. 455-6) said : <em>\u201c </em>It has been settled for hundreds of years that an innkeeper is bound to receive the guest who applies for accomodations. So is it well settled that a common carrier'must receive and transport goods offered him for that purpose impartially and without discrimination between parties applying. These obligations do not rest on contract, but on the ground that when one is engaged in a business, public in its nature, he must, if public policy requires, serve the public impartially. The occasions for the application of this familiar principle are- by no means diminished by the formation of corporations which carry on a great part of the business of the country. And in applying these rules to a corporation, the charter of the corporation is not solely to be consulted in arriving at the measure of its obligations to the public. When the charter provides that a corporation shall engage in some specified public occupation, no doubt a reference thereto will be an easy way to establish its obligations to perform such service. But we do not accede to the doctrine that when engaged in a business concerning the performance of which its charter is silent, a corporation is freed from the obligations which ordinarily attach to a natural person engaging in such occupation. Had defendants in. the present action answered that collecting and distributing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>commercial intelligence being foreign to the objects for which they are incorporated, they had in consequence abandoned that branch of their business and withdrawn their \u2018tickers\u2019 from all offices except the plaintiffs, we should not hold that they could be compelled to carry on the business for his benefit. But so long as collecting and supplying quotations is carried on by them, as it is conceded to be at present, they should render equal and impartial service to those who comply with reasonable regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-6\">In State <em>ex rel. </em>American Union Telegraph Co. <em>v. </em>Bell Telephone Co. (11 <em>Cent. Law J. </em>359), the relator applied for a <em>mandamus </em>compelling the defendant to place a telephone in its office. \u00a1Respondent filed its return \u201c alleging that it had acquired the right to use the telephone under a license granted by the American Telephone Company, the owner of the patent,-by whose terms it was provided, 1. That the respondent\u2019s \"patrons should not use the telephone for \u201c transmitting messages for which any toll is paid to any one but the respondent, nor for transmitting market quotations, or news for sale or publication; \u201d 2. That the respondent should not connect any of its offices with any telegraph company\u2019s office or line, and that no' telegraph company should be allowed to become a subscriber. The court (Thayeb, J.), ruled that the second clause, if enforced as valid, would compel the respondent to discriminate against a class of individuals or corporations,\u2014to withhold facilties for the transaction of business from one class of citizens which it accords to others. This was contrary to law and public policy. A public servant cannot avoid the performance of any part of the duty it owes to the entire public,-by any contract or obligation which it may enter into, even with the patentee of an invention. If this were not so, such corporations might readily avoid the performance of any public duty that became inconvenient or burdensome and it would become possible to discriminate at pleasure, either against individuals or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>classes. This conclusion did not deprive tin invento!' of any of the privileges intended to be secured to him by letters-patent. lie may grant an exclusive or a restricted license. But such conditions which it may contain will be inoperative if they go beyond the limit of the governmental grant and seek to compel the licensee to disregard a public duty. The court, therefore, awarded a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus, </em>compelling the respondent to place a telephone in the relator\u2019s office, on the same terms that it supplied instruments to other subscribers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-4\">In Louisville Transfer Co. <em>v. </em>Am. Dist Tel. Co. (24 <em>Alb). L. J. </em>283-4), it was held: \u201cThat the employment of a telephone company is public, and such a company is bound to serve the public without discrimination. The plaintiffs were proprietors of public omnibuses and carriages, and the defendants were a telephone company and also proprietors of public carriages. The defendants were restrained from removing their telephones from the plaintiffs\u2019 offices, and from refusing to transact the plaintiffs\u2019 telephone business pursuant to a contract \u25a0 between the parties. The court, Edwaeds, Chancellor, said: \u2018 That the real contention between the plaintiffs and defendants is confined to their carriage and coupe services; defendant insisting that as against plaintiff, a rival in that business, it has the right to a monopoly in the use of its own telephone methods of communicating and receiving orders for coupes ; that a mere rival in one branch of its business cannot force it to afford it the facilties which it has provided for another branch of its business. Upon the facts appearing upon the petition and affidavits of plaintiff, it is the opinion of the court that defendant is engaged in two distinct employments\u2014one in operating a telephone exchange, and the other in operating a carriage or coupe service. Plaintiff and defendant are nut rivals in the former business, and as to that part of defendant\u2019s business, it occupies the same position toward plaintiff as it does toward the rest of the public ; that defendant is a <em>quasi </em>public servant, and as such is bound to serve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>general public, including plaintiff, on reasonable terms, with impartiality; that defendant is governed by the principles of .the law of common carriers. See Bennett <em>v. </em>Dutton, 10 N. <em>H. </em>481; New England Express Co. <em>v. </em>Maine Central R. R. Co., 57 <em>Me. </em>188; S. C., 2 <em>Am. Rep. </em>31; Sanford v. Railroad Co., 24 <em>Penn. St. </em>378; and MacDuffie v. Railroad, 52 <em>N. H. </em>447 ; S. C., 13 <em>Am. Rep. </em>72; Munn <em>v. </em>Illinois, 4 <em>Otto, </em>113. The principles announced in an opinion by Judge Thayek, in American Union Telegraph Co. <em>v. </em>Bell Telephone Co,, should determine this .controversy. The move fact that defendant may possess <em>dual </em>powers, and is operating or carrying on two distinct kinds of business, cannot exempt it from the general rule goveriug such corporations, with reference to the general public; and to deteaniue the rights of the plaintiff, defendant must be considered as a telephone company and as a transfer company. See Claxton\u2019s Admr. <em>v. </em>Lexington &amp; Big Sandy R. R. Co., 13 <em>Bush. </em>638. The law must adapt itself to the new subjects that arc brought within the rango of judicial action. And courts must reason by analogy from things that are settled, in order to establish principles to govern things that are unsettled. (4 <em>Am. L. Reg. </em>[N. S.], 193). The rule that defendant is bound to serve all the public alike, under like circumstances, is the one applied by the court in this case, and plaintiff is a part of the public, and defendant, as to its telephonic business, is a distinct person from itself as a transfer company, so far as the rights of others are to be determined. The rights of plaintiff do not depend upon contracts, but the general principles before stated. Defendant had a right to terminate its contract with plaintiff, but as it holds out as the servant of the public, it must act with perfect impartiality toward its customers.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b520-5\">In the Bell Telephone Company <em>v. </em>State <em>ex rel. </em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio Tel. Co. (7 <em>East. Rep. </em>672 ; 35 <em>Alb. L. J. </em>4), the facts were that \u201c the Baltimore <em>&amp; </em>Ohio Telegraph Co. applied to the Bell Telephone Company of Philadelphia\u2014both corporations chartered under the general Penn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>sylvania corporation act of 1874\u2014Jora telephone instrument and telephone connection at its Philadelphia office, and offered to compensate in the usual rates paid by others. The telephone company refused to comply with the request, \u2022whereupon the telegraph company applied for a <em>mandamus. </em>The telephone company resisted upon the grounds that it occupied merely the station of a licensee of the telephone instruments, etc., they belonging- to a Massachusetts corporation, and that, by the terms of its contract under which it received its license, it was not allowed to rent the use of its telephone appliances and facilities to persons transmitting news, messages, etc., for compensation in competition with a certain corporation, \u2018to wit,\u2019 the Western Union Telegraph Co. Held, that the telephone company could not thus shield itself from the performance of its duty to serve the public impartially' and without discrimination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-5\">The cases were reviewed at length by the court below (7 <em>East. Rep. </em>pp. 674-7) and its conclusion approved by the supreme court (p. 679).</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-6\">In State <em>ex rel. </em>American Union Telegraph Co. <em>v. </em>Bell Telephone Co. (36 <em>Ohio St. </em>296), it was held that \u201ceach company operating a line or system of telephones in this State is required to receive dispatches from and for telegraph and other companies without discrimination. A contract between the telephone company and the owner of telephone instruments to the effect, that in the use of such instruments by the company, discrimination shall be made as between telegraph companies, is void as against public policy as declared by the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-7\">See the doctrine fully discussed in Jordan <em>v. </em>Overseers of Dayton (4 Ohio, 294) and Patterson <em>v. </em>Kentucky (97 <em>U. S. </em>501). The doctrine of these cases may be stated thus: the right, to enjoy a new and useful invention may be secured to the inventor and protected by national authority against all interference ; but the use of tangible property which comes into existence by the application of the discovery is not beyond the control of State legislation, simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>because the patentee acquires a monopoly in his discovery. \u201c The sole operation of the statute is to enable him to prevent others from using the products of his labors without his \u25a0consent; but his own right of using it is not enlarged or , affected.\u201d The property of an inventor in a patent machine, like all other property, remains subject to the paramount claims of society, and in the manner of its use may be controlled and regulated by State laws when the public welfare requires it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-5\">II. Mandamus is a proper remedy. State <em>ex rel. </em>Am. Union <em>v. </em>Bell Telephone, 11 <em>Cent. L.

Y. </em>294, 299-300 ; People <em>v. </em>Albany, etc., 24 <em>N. Y. </em>261. The damages are too uncertain and too difficult of ascertainment for a suit at law to afford an adequate or complete remedy. Morey <em>v. </em>Metropolitan Gaslight, 38 <em>Super. Ct. (J. &amp; S.) </em>185, 188-190; Smith <em>v. </em>Gold <em>&amp; </em>Stock, 42 <em>Hun, </em>456. \u201c Private persons -may, without the intervention of the government law-officer, move for a man\"damus to enforce a public duty not due to the government as such.\u201d Union Pacific <em>v. </em>Hall, 91 <em>U. S. </em>343, 355, and numerous authorities cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-7\">So mandamus lies to compel a railroad company to build a fence between its line and that of an adjoining owner (Queen <em>v. </em>Trustees, 1 <em>Q.

A peremptory \"mandamus will not issue except in a case of clear and unquestionable legal right (People <em>ex rel. </em>Slavin <em>v. </em>Wendell, 71 <em>N. Y. </em>171).</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-10\">II. The defendant is itself a licensee, holding its right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>to use the telephone under strict limitations. The patentee has a right to limit the use of the telephone (Seymour <em>v. </em>McCormick, 16 <em>How. </em>[U. <em>S.] </em>480-9 ; Bloomer <em>v. </em>McQuewen, 14 <em>How. </em>[U.<em> </em>S.] 530-49; Adams <em>v. </em>Burk, 17 <em>Wall. </em>[U. S.] 453). No statute can compel the licensee to exercise any greater right than he has lawfully acquired. It cannot compel him to trespass upon the reserved rights of the licensor; it cannot compel him to confer a right he does not himself possess (American Rapid Telegraph Co. <em>v. </em>Connecticut Telephone Co., 49 <em>Conn. </em>352; S. C., 44 <em>Am. Rep. </em>237). There cannot be such a dedication to public use in a patented article of this kind as to cause the patentee to lose control over it, and subject it to tlio use of any and every one who applies for it. Its only value to the patentee or to any one is by having a large number of persons use it, but by thus putting it to the only practicable use it is capable of, the owner of the patent does not lose control over it and subject himself to all the obligations of a common carrier ; if that were so his patent would be no protection to him at all. The reasoning of the case of Munn <em>v. </em>Illinois, 94 <em>U. S. </em>113, cannot apply to a patented article. That ease arose out-of State legislation regulating warehouse charges, and the court re stated the common law doctrine as to private property devoted to public use'as follows:\u2014\u201cwhen the owner of property devotes it to a use in which the public has an interest, he in effect grants\u201dto the public an interest in such use and must to the extent of that interest submit to be controlled by the public, for the common good, so long as he maintains the use. He may withdraw his grant by discontinuing the use.\u201d This rule cannot apply to a patented article like the one in question; because, first: permitting a large number of people to use is not granting it to the public; second : because the method of protecting mentioned is not available, because to discontinue its public use is to practically destroy it. It is not an invention that can be made use of in private; it is for the purpose of enabling -many people to communicate with each other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>III. The relator has no right to the use of the defendant\u2019s property to enable it to compete with the defendant, or to interfere with the defendant\u2019s business of collecting messages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-5\">An inn-beeper is not obliged to admit and entertain one engaged in soliciting his customers for another inn (Jencks <em>v. </em>Coleman, 2 Sumner, 221). A carrier may carry on a business not inconsistent with that of a common carrier, and may exclude one who attempts to carry on the same business (Barry <em>v. </em>O. B. H. Steamboat Co., 67 <em>N. Y. </em>301). The defendant has a right to protect itself, to use its license for its own profit. It has a right in connection with the business to engage in getting messages to be taken to telegraph offices, and relator has no right to be placed in a position to interfere with that business (Barry <em>v. </em>O. B. H. Steamboat Co., 67 <em>N. Y. </em>301). The carrying of messages as contemplated by the relator will interfere with defendant\u2019s business ; where now it gets toll on each message it will be deprived of it. It has a right to limit the subscriber to his owirindividual use (Shepard <em>v. </em>Gold <em>&amp; </em>Stock Tel. Co., 38 <em>Hun, </em>338).</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b514-14\"> See brief of counsel for relator reviewing cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b524-6\">Parker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWv\">The relator is engaged in the transmission of messages by telegraph ; the defendant, in the transmission of human speech by means of the telephone. In addition, both relator and defendant carry on a general messenger business in the city of Albany, and each are duly organized under and by virtue of statutes of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">By the moving papers it appears that the relator demanded of the defendant that one of its telephones be placed in .the office of The Postal Telegraph Cable Company, and at the same time offered to pay any sum required for the privilege of having and using such telephone, and further promised to \u201ccomply with all the rules and regulations, regulating and controlling all persons, corporations and companies having or using said telephone,\u201d and that the defendant refused, and still refuses, to comply with such demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Thereupon the relator moved the court fora, peremptory mandamus directing the defendant, on payment to it, by relator, of its usual charges and compliance with its proper regulations, to place one of its telephones in relator\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The owner of a patent has the right to determine whether or not any use.shall be made of his invention, and, if . any, what such use shall be. When however he determines upon its use his legal duty to the public requires that all persons shall, in respect to it, be treated alike, without, injurious discrimination as to rates or conditions. A common carrier is bound to carry all articles within the line of its business, for all persons upon the terms usually imposed (Bank <em>v. </em>Adams Express Co. 1 <em>Flippin </em>[S. C.] 212). When a railroad company establishes commutation rates for a given locality it lias no right to refuse to sell a commutation ticket to a particular individual of such locality (Atwater <em>v. </em>Delaware, Lackawanna R. R., 4 <em>East. Rep. </em>186). A gas company must furnish gas at the' same rates to all consumers who apply and are ready and willing to pay therefor (Shepard <em>v. </em>Milwaukee, 6 Wis. 539 ; People <em>ex rel. </em>Kennedy <em>v. </em>Manhattan Gas Co., 45 <em>Barb. </em>136). And a telephone company is not permitted to withhold facilities for the transaction of business from one class \"of citizens which it accords to others (State <em>ex rel. </em>American U. T. Co. <em>v. </em>Bell T. Co., 11 <em>Cent. L. J. </em>359).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The authorities cited establish the principle that a public servant, as the defendant is, cannot so use the invention protected by the government, as to withhold from one citizen the advantages which it accords to another; and it follows that the relator in this case on compliance with the usual terms, and reasonable regulations of the defendant, is entitled to have mandamus issue directing the placing of one of its telephones in relator\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">. The defendant\u2019s papers contain a copy of the agreement which.it requires its subscribers to sign before giving to them a telephone for use, such agreement containing the rules and regulations, which the defendant has determined must form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>a condition precedent to the placing or using o\u00ed' one of its telephones.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Upon the argument, relator\u2019s counsel contended that a portion thereof was unreasonable, and that to comply therewith Would substantially deprive his client from receiving any benefit to its business by the use of the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The clauses in the agreement to which, objection was 1 'made wore : First, \u201c They are not to be used for .... any part of the work of collecting, transmitting, or delivering any message in respect of which -any toll' has been -or is to be paid to any party other, than the Exchange.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Second. \u00a1Nor for calling messengers except from the Central Offioe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">As to the first: Both parties are engaged in the attempt to extend their business to the utmost possible limit. They are alik,e interested in securing as many customers as possible'for their respective lines, and to a considerable extent they are competitors in the same territory for tlie business of transmitting messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">\u00a1\u00a1Slow, while the rule is well settled that a common carrier must serve the public impartially, still it must be borne in mind that its duty is to the public, and not to other and competing common candors. One common carrier cannot demand, as a right, that it be permitted to use a rival common carrier\u2019s property for the benefit of its own business-(Express Cases, 117 <em>U. S. </em>1 ; Jencks <em>v. </em>Coleman, <em>2 Sumner, </em>221; Barry <em>v. </em>O. B. H. Steamboat Co., 67 <em>N. Y. </em>301).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">The relator in this case, however, contends that the statute, under which the defendant-was incorporated, makes it the duty of the defendant to permit such use of its telephone as the relator\u2019s business requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The statute, among other things, provides that \u201c it shall be the duty of the owner or the association owning any telegraph line doing business within this State, to receive dispatches from and for other telegraph lines and associations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>and from and for any individual, and on payment of their usual charges for individuals, for transmitting dispatches, as established by the rules and regulations of such telegraph line, to transmit the same with impartiality and good faith.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>,</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">It is.clear thai. the provision quoted makes it the duty of the defendant to transmit over its wires, any and all messages which the - relator may desire to have transmitted, on payment of their usual charges to individuals. It seems equally clear that it was not intended to and does not, authorize the relator to transmit its own messages over defendant\u2019s wires, on payment of the merely nominal sum required of its ordinary subscribers.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Such a rule would result unjustly to the defendant, as it would enable the relator to enter into competition with defendant in the transmission of messages over its own wires. With equal propriety it could demand that it be connected with the wires of the Western Union Telegraph Company, on payment of a proper charge, and that then it he permitted to use in its own way, and at its own convenience, the wires and property of its competitor for its business.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Such a construction as the relator contends for is not in accordance with either the letter or spirit of the statute. What the statute commands of corporations doing business in this State is, that they shall, send any message presented by another telegraph company, for tlyit purpose, on payment of the proper and usual charges. Should defendant -.refuse at any time to send a message presented by the relator for that purpose, the law affords an adequate remedy for the violation of the statute. No' claim is made that the defendant has ever -refused to send messages for the relator, and the only question in respect to the transmission of messages in controversy here is, Can the relator demand the right' to transmit them according to its own pleasure <em>% </em>Neither the rules established by the courts, nor the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>referred to justify such a holding, and in that respect, therefore, the rules and regulations of 0the defendant seem to be reasonable and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The objection that so much of defendant\u2019s regulations as prevents the use of the telephone by a subscriber for the purpose of calling messengers except from the Central office, is unreasonable, seems to me to be well taken. The defend-' ant urges that the messenger business as conducted by it is \u00a1profitable, and for that reason it is desirable that it should be retained as free from competition-as possible ; and in aid of its position invokes the rule as established by the courts, that it owes no such duty to its rival as the permission to use its property\" for the purpose of a competing business, would constitute. The rule cannot be questioned, but the \u2022application is faulty. The messenger business, although /carried on by the same company and at the same offices, is nevertheless a distinct and separate business, and in no wise \"essential to the conduct of the defendant\u2019s system of transmitting messages by telephone, for which purpose it was incorporated. To extend the rule protecting its business from rivals, so as to include any other business in which it might see fit to engage, could result in great injustice to the public. A livery stable, provision store, meat market, and other classes of -business \"could be added in the course of time, and by amending their rules so as to include each new business in the samepmmncr as the messenger service is now attempted to be protected, a monopoly could be created at the expense of tradesmen and merchants, and to the detriment of the public generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In Louisville Transfer Co. <em>v. </em>Am. Dist. Tel. Co. (24 <em>Alb. L. J. </em>283-4), both parties were engaged in the carriage and conp\u00e9 service, and the defendant insisted upon the right to a monopoly in the use of its own telephone methods of communicating and receiving orders for coup\u00e9s. The court held otherwise, and granted an injunction restraining defendant \"from removing the telephone, and from refusing to transact plaintiff\u2019s business. The decision of the court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>that case Is applicable to the question here involved, and its p/easoning is approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">It follows : First. That the relator is entitled to a mandamus directing and commanding the defendant to place a telephone in its office on compliance with defendant\u2019s rules and regulations, and payment by it of defendant\u2019s proper charges;</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Second. That so much of defendant\u2019s regulations as provide that the telephone shall not be nsed ior calling messengers except from the Central Office,\u201d are unreasonable, and need not ho acceded to by the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Third. As it was stated upon the argument that a review of the decision was intended, an application for a stay under section 2989 <em>(Code Civ. Pro.) </em>will be enter\u00e1is w-b</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Order to be settled on four days\u2019 notice by either party.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b526-11\"> The telephone company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\"> <em>L. </em>1845, c. 265, \u00a7 11, as amend, by <em>L. </em>1855, c. 559; same stat. 2 <em>R.
