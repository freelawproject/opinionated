FALLON, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b647-19\">With interim settlement payments scheduled to begin on August 28, 2008, the Court finds that it is appropriate at this time to address the issue of individual attorneys\u2019 fees. For the reasons listed below, the Court orders that individual attorneys\u2019 fees for all counsel representing claimants enrolled in the Yioxx Settlement Program will be capped at 32% plus reasonable costs. At a later date, after giving the parties due notice and an opportunity to be heard, the Court will determine the amount of fees and costs to be awarded to those attorneys who performed common benefit work. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, these latter amounts will be deducted from the individual plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>1. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">To put this matter in perspective, a brief review of this litigation is appropriate. This multidistrict products liability litigation involves the prescription drug Vioxx, known generically as Rofecoxib. Merck, a New Jersey corporation, researched, designed, manufactured, marketed, and distributed Vioxx to relieve pain and inflammation resulting from osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, menstrual pain, and migraine headaches. On May 20, 1999, the Food and Drug Administration approved Vioxx for sale in the United States. Vioxx remained publicly available until September 30, 2004, when Merck withdrew it from the market after data from a clinical trial known as APPROVe indicated that the use of Vioxx increased the risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events such as myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) and ischemic strokes. Thereafter, thousands of individual suits and numerous class actions were filed against Merck in state and federal courts throughout the country alleging various products liability, tort, fraud, and warranty claims. It is estimated that 105 million prescriptions for Vioxx were written in the United States between May 20, 1999 and September 30, 2004. Based on this estimate, it is thought that approximately 20 million patients have taken Vioxx in the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">On February 16, 2005, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation conferred multi-district litigation status on Vioxx lawsuits filed in federal court and transferred all such cases to this Court to coordinate discovery and to consolidate pretrial matters pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407. <em>See In re Vioxx Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>360 F.Supp.2d 1352 (J.P.M.L.2005). One month later, on March 18, 2005, this Court held the first status conference in the Vioxx MDL to consider strategies for moving forward with the proceedings. Shortly thereafter, the Court appointed committees of counsel to represent the parties and to meet with the Court once every month to review the status of the litigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">One of this Court\u2019s first priorities was to assist the parties in selecting and preparing certain test cases to proceed as bellwether trials. In total, this Court conducted six Vioxx bellwether trials.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The first of the bellwether trials took place in Houston, Texas, while this Court was displaced following Hurricane Katrina. The five subsequent bellwether trials took place in New Orleans, Louisiana. Only one of the trials resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff. Of the five remaining trials, one resulted in a hung jury and four resulted in verdicts for the defendant. During the same period that this Court conducted its six bellwether trials, approximately thirteen additional Vioxx-related cases were tried before juries in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>the state courts of Texas, New Jersey, California, Alabama, Illinois, and Florida. With the benefit of experience from these bellwether trials, as well as the encouragement of the several coordinated courts, the parties soon began settlement discussions in earnest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">On November 9, 2007, Merck and the NPC formally announced that they had reached a Settlement Agreement. <em>See </em>Settlement Agreement, <em>In re Vioxx Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>MDL 1657 (E.D.La. Nov. 9, 2007) (\u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d), <em>available at </em>http://www.browngreer.com/vioxx settlement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The private Settlement Agreement establishes a pre-funded program for resolving pending or tolled state and federal Vioxx claims against Merck as of the date of the settlement, involving claims of heart attack (\u201cMI\u201d), ischemic stroke (\u201cIS\u201d), and sudden cardiac death (\u201cSCD\u201d), for an overall amount of $4.85 billion. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 \u201cRe-cit\u00e1is\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Settlement Agreement expressly contemplates that this Court shall oversee various aspects of the administration of settlement proceedings, including appointing a Fee Allocation Committee, allocating a percentage of the settlement proceeds to a Common Benefit Fund, and modifying any provisions of the Settlement Agreement that are otherwise unenforceable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, this Court has consistently exercised its inherent authority over the MDL proceedings in coordination with its express authority under the terms of the Settlement Agreement to ensure that the settlement proceedings move forward in a uniform and efficient manner.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The Settlement Agreement provides a schedule for the disbursement of interim payments to certain eligible claimants. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4.1. In order to qualify for interim payments, eligible claimants must fulfill specific registration and filing obligations. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, eligible MI claimants who timely fulfill all of their filing obligations may qualify to receive interim payments beginning on August, 1, 2008, or the date on which the Claims Administrator has determined pre-review points awards for at least 2,500 MI claimants, whichever is later. <em>Id. </em>The schedule for distributing interim payments to claimants is conditioned on Merck\u2019s decision to waive its walk away privileges. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">On July 17, 2008, Merck formally announced that it was satisfied that the thresholds necessary to trigger funding of the Vioxx Settlement Program would be met. <em>See Minute Entry, July 17, 2008, </em>Rec. Doc. 15862 (July 17, 2008). Merck further advised that it intended to waive its walk away privileges and that it would commence funding the Vioxx Settlement Program by depositing an initial sum of $500 million into the settlement fund, clearing the way for distribution of interim payments to eligible claimants. <em>Id. </em>On August 20, 2008, the Claims Administrator reported to the Court that it had successfully reviewed approximately 2,750 claims for interim payments. <em>See Minute Entry, August 20, 2008, </em>Rec. Doc. 15674 (Aug. 20, 2008). The Claims Administrator further advised that interim payments were scheduled to begin as early as August 28, 2008. <em>Id. </em>In light of the upcoming disbursement of interim settlement payments, it is appropriate at this time to address the issue of individual attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">II. LAW &amp; ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">As an initial matter, the Court notes that addressing the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees in the context of the Vioxx global settlement will require a two-step process. The first step involves examining the reasonableness of all the contingent fee contracts in the global settlement and setting an appropriate limitation on the amount of fees that attorneys may charge claimants. The second step of the process will involve allocating a percentage of those fees for the Common Benefit Fund to be distributed to those who performed common benefit work. After notifying the parties and all counsel and offering them an opportunity to be heard, the Court will issue a separate order addressing the Common Benefit Fund. At this time, the Court will only address the reasonableness of contingent fee contracts in the context of the global settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">The Court will begin its analysis by reviewing the basis of its authority for examining the contingent fee contracts in this setting. After briefly reviewing the basis of its authority, the Court will then examine the contingent fee contracts and set a reasonable limitation on the amount that individual attorneys may charge claimants enrolled in the global settlement, regardless of whether their cases were filed in state or federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">A. The basis of this Court\u2019s authority to review contingent fee contracts for reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">Contingent fee contracts have long been accepted in the United States because \u201cthey provide many litigants with the only practical means by which they can secure legal services to enforce their claims.\u201d <em>Cappel v. Adams, </em>434 F.2d 1278, 1280 (5th Cir.1970).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, \u201c[c]ontingent fees may be disallowed as between attorney and client in spite of contingent fee retainer agreements, where the amount becomes large enough to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>out of all proportion to the value of the professional services rendered.\u201d <em>Gair v. Peck, </em>6 N.Y.2d 97, 188 N.Y.S.2d 491, 160 N.E.2d 43, 48 (N.Y.1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In addressing contingent fees, the Court is mindful that tort litigation \u2014 and particularly mass tort litigation \u2014 has a dual role in our society: (1) to compensate people who are harmed; and (2) to prevent future injuries by deterring harmful conduct. <em>See Contingent Fees in Mass Tort Litigation, </em>42 ToRT Trial &amp; Ins. Prao. L.J. 105, 109-10 (2006). These are laudable goals and ones which should be encouraged. Undercompensating attorneys who handle such litigation would result in too few meritorious private suits being brought and less competent representation in the cases that are brought. <em>Id. </em>Overcompensating attorneys, however, would also be harmful, as it would encourage frivolous lawsuits and result in unfair recovery for injured litigants. <em>Id. </em>The courts must, therefore, endeavor to strike a fair balance between these two opposing policy concerns.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Before examining the contingent fee contracts in the context of the global settlement, it is first necessary to determine whether this Court has authority to inquire into the reasonableness of contingent fee agreements between the claimants and their attorneys. This determination requires an analysis of the Court\u2019s equitable powers, its inherent supervisory authority, and its express authority under the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Each of these will be discussed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">1. The Court\u2019s equitable authority to oversee administration of the global settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure expressly provide that district courts may require reasonable fees in class actions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(g)(l)(C)(iii); Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(h); <em>see also </em>Manual For Complex Litigation (Fourth) \u00a7 22.927 (2004). In the <em>Zyprexa </em>MDL, the court found that several factors counseled in favor of treating the case as a quasi-class action, subjecting the settlement program to review under the court\u2019s general equitable powers. <em>See In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>424 F.Supp.2d 488, 491 (E.D.N.Y.2006). In particular, the court in <em>Zyprexa </em>noted as persuasive \u201c[t]he large number of plaintiffs subject to the same settlement matrix approved by the court; the utilization of special masters appointed by the court to control discovery and to assist in reaching and administering a settlement; the court\u2019s order for a huge escrow fund; and other interventions by the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, the court found that the settlement was subject to the court\u2019s \u201cimposition of fiduciary standards to ensure fair treatment to all parties and counsel regarding fees and expenses.\u201d <em>See id.; see also In re Guidant Corp. Implantable Defibrillators Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>MDL No. 05-1708, 2008 WL 682174, at *18 (D.Minn. Mar. 7, 2008) (characterizing a mass tort proceeding as a quasi-class action and subjecting the global settlement to the court\u2019s equitable authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">Turning to the instant case, the Court notes that there are substantial similarities between the global settlement currently before the Court and the global settlement at issue in <em>Zyprexa. </em>First, the court in <em>Zyprexa </em>found that the case could be treated as a quasi-class action in part because of \u201c[t]he large number of plaintiffs subject to the same settlement matrix approved by the court.\u201d <em>In re Zyprexa, </em>424 F.Supp.2d at 491. Similarly, there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>approximately 50,000 eligible claimants currently enrolled in the Vioxx Settlement Program, all of whom are subject to the same settlement matrix for awarding points and valuating claims. Second, like the court in <em>Zyprexa, </em>which utilized special masters \u201cto control discovery and to assist in reaching and administering a settlement,\u201d this Court has benefited from the efforts of special masters throughout the course of the MDL proceedings and the settlement administration. <em>See, e.g., Order, </em>Rec. Doc. 13228 (Jan. 14, 2008) (appointing Mr. Patrick A. Juneau to act as Special Master pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement). Moreover, the $4.85 billion settlement fund in the instant case is similar to the large settlement fund held in escrow in <em>Zyprexa. </em>In light of these factors, the Court finds that the Vioxx global settlement may properly be analyzed as occurring in a quasi-class action, giving the Court equitable authority to review contingent fee contracts for reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">2. The Court\u2019s inherent authority to exercise ethical supervision over the parties</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">In addition to this Court\u2019s equitable authority over the global settlement, the Court also has the inherent authority and concomitant duty to exercise ethical supervision over the parties. <em>See In re Zyprexa, </em>424 F.Supp.2d at 492 (\u201cThe judiciary has well-established authority to exercise ethical supervision of the bar in both individual and mass actions.\u201d); <em>see also Karim v. Finch Shipping Co., Ltd., </em>233 F.Supp.2d 807, 810 (E.D.La.2002), <em>aff'd, </em>374 F.3d 302 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cAmong the broad equitable powers of a federal court is its supervisory capacity over an attorney\u2019s contingent fee contracts.\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Pursuant to the Court\u2019s supervisory authority, the Court may address the reasonableness of contingent fee contracts even if the parties have not raised the issue. <em>See Rosquist v. Soo Line R.R., </em>692 F.2d 1107, 1111 (7th Cir.1982) (\u201cEven when the validity of the fee contract itself has not been challenged by the parties, it is within the court\u2019s inherent power of supervision over the bar to examine the attorney\u2019s fee for conformance with the reasonable standard of the Code of Ethics.\u201d). District courts necessarily retain the authority to examine attorney fees sua sponte because the attorneys\u2019 interests in this regard are in conflict with those of their clients. <em>See In re Guidant, </em>2008 WL 682174, at *18 (\u201c[A]s for the representative counsel involved, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel have a built-in conflict of interest that is directly opposed to that of their clients.\u201d); <em>In re Zyprexa, </em>424 F.Supp.2d at 491-92 (\u201c[Pjlaintiffs\u2019 counsel have a built-in conflict of interest; and the defendant is buying peace and is generally disinterested in how the fund is divided so long as it does not jeopardize the settlement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>With large corporations now seeking to achieve global peace by resolving mass tort litigations simultaneously in state and federal courts, settlement agreements such as the one currently before the Court will likely become more common. <em>See, e.g., In re Guidant, </em>2008 WL 682174, at *3 (noting that the parties \u201ccontemplated a global settlement covering Plaintiffs from both the MDL and state cases, and included Plaintiffs whose cases had been filed or transferred to the MDL, Plaintiffs whose cases were filed outside the MDL in state court proceedings, and potential Plaintiffs who had not yet filed their cases\u201d). As these global settlements occur more frequently, however, and as the public consciousness focuses more closely on the outcome of mass tort litigations, there will also be a growing need to protect the public\u2019s trust in the judicial process. <em>See In re Zyprexa, </em>424 F.Supp.2d at 494 (\u201cPublic understanding of the fairness of the judicial process in handling mass torts \u2014 and particularly those involving pharmaceuticals with potential widespread health consequences \u2014 is a significant aspect of complex national litigations involving thousands of parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The potential harm to the public\u2019s perception of the judicial process is especially acute in the instant case because of the large number of claimants participating in the settlement. <em>See id. </em>at 493 (\u201cThe risk of excessive fees is a special concern here because of the mass nature of the case.\u201d). The approximately 50,000 plaintiffs and the $4.85 billion settlement fund have captured the public\u2019s attention, resulting in a heightened degree of public scrutiny on the settlement proceedings and the judicial process in general. Disproportionate results and inconsistent standards threaten to damage the public\u2019s faith in the judicial resolution of mass tort litigation by creating an impression of inherent unfairness. <em>Id. </em>at 494 (\u201cLitigations like the present one are an important tool for the protection of consumers in our modern corporate society, and they must be conducted so that they will not be viewed as abusive by the public; they are in fact highly beneficial to the public when adequately controlled.\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cThese considerations are enhanced where, as here, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has assembled all related federal cases for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings ... [to] <em>promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions.\u2019\u201d Id. </em>at 493 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">In addition, many of the Vioxx claimants are elderly and in poor health, making it more difficult for them to negotiate fair contingent fee contracts. <em>See id. </em>at 491 (\u201cMany of the individual plaintiffs are both mentally and physically ill and are largely without power or knowledge to negotiate fair fees\u201d); <em>see also In re Guidant, </em>2008 WL 682174, at *18 (same). In order to qualify for the settlement, a claimant or the claimant\u2019s representative must first demonstrate that the claimant suffered a heart attack, ischemic stroke, or sudden cardiac death after taking Yioxx. As a result, all of the claimants in the global settlement have suffered life-threatening injuries. Under such circumstances, the supervisory court has an increased responsibility to ensure that the fees are both consistent and reasonable. For these rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>sons, the Court finds that it has the inherent authority and responsibility to examine the individual contingent fee contracts for fairness and consistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">3. The Court\u2019s express authority pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The terms of the Settlement Agreement in this case provide further support for the Court\u2019s authority to examine the reasonableness of the contingent fee contracts. The Settlement Agreement expressly grants this Court the authority to oversee various aspects of the global settlement administration. For example, the Settlement Agreement contemplates that this Court will appoint an Allocation Committee to assist in determining the appropriate amount of fees to be deposited into the Common Benefit Fund. <em>See </em>Settlement Agreement \u00a7 9.2.4. The Agreement also contemplates that this Court will consider the Committee\u2019s recommendations in making a final determination of common benefit fees as well as deciding how those fees should be distributed to individual attorneys for their common benefit work. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 9.2.5. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, these amounts will be deducted directly from the attorneys\u2019 fees after the Court\u2019s final determination regarding the Common Benefit Fund. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 9.2.1 (\u201cAny sum paid as a common benefit fee shall be deducted from the total amount of counsel fees payable under individual plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s retainer agreement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">In addition, the Settlement Agreement also establishes that this Court has the express authority to modify any provision of the Agreement in certain limited circumstances if the Court determines that the provision \u201cis prohibited or unenforceable to any extent or in any particular context but in some modified form would be enforceable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 16.42. To the extent that the Settlement Agreement would be unenforceable if it resulted in excessive or unreasonable attorneys\u2019 fees that threaten the public interest and reflect poorly on the courts, this Court may address those fees in order to ensure fairness to all parties. As a result, the Court finds that it may examine the reasonableness of contingent fee contracts in order to protect the claimants and enforce the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">In light of this Court\u2019s equitable authority over the settlement, its inherent authority to exercise ethical supervision over the parties, and its express authority under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Court finds that it has the authority to examine the contingent fee contracts in the global settlement for reasonableness, regardless of whether the claimants filed their cases in state or federal courts. <em>See In re Guidant, </em>2008 WL 682174, at *19 (capping contingent fees in global settlement pursuant to \u201cthe Court\u2019s general equitable powers, the Court\u2019s inherent authority to exercise ethical supervision over [the] global settlement, and the Court\u2019s inherent authority to review contingency fees for fairness\u201d). In the interest of fairness and uniformity, it is both necessary and desirable that a single court be able to set a reasonable limitation on contingent fees in this global settlement proceeding. Having overseen not only the course of the MDL proceedings but also the administration of the Vioxx Settlement Program, this Court is uniquely situated to examine the reasonableness of attorneys\u2019 fees for claimants enrolled in the global settlement. Further, in light of the upcoming distribution of interim settlement payments, the Court finds that it is appropriate at this time to set a reasonable limitation on the contingent fees that attorneys may charge to claimants participating in the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>B. Applying the Court\u2019s authority to examine contingent fee contracts in the global settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">In order to determine a reasonable limitation on individual contingent fee contracts, the Court will look for guidance to comparable limitations on contingent fees. First, the Court will examine state statutes and rules that cap contingent fee arrangements. Second, the Court will review the manner in which other district courts have approached the issue of contingent fee arrangements in the context of similar global settlements. Finally, the Court will consider the unique contours of the Vioxx global settlement in light of these comparative sources in order to set a reasonable limitation on individual contingent fees in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">1. State statutes and rules placing limitations on contingent fees</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Because this MDL proceeding is essentially a series of diversity jurisdiction cases, it is appropriate for the Court to consider state statutes in examining whether the contingent fee contracts are fair or reasonable. <em>See In re Zyprexa, </em>424 F.Supp.2d at 494. New Jersey\u2019s approach to contingent fees provides considerable guidance for this Court in determining the appropriate contingent fees in this case. <em>See </em>N.J. R. Ct. 1:21-7. The Court notes that the New Jersey rule is particularly persuasive in this context because New Jersey is one of the primary coordinate jurisdictions in the Vioxx litigation. In New Jersey, an attorney in a products liability action \u201cshall not contract for, charge, or collect a contingent fee in excess of the following: (1) 33/6% on the first $500,000 recovered; (2) 30% on the next $500,000 recovered; (3) 25% on the next $500,000 recovered; (4) 20% on the next $500,000 recovered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The New Jersey statute further provides that counsel must apply to the court for a reasonable fee on all amounts in excess of $2 million, and may not charge more than 25% where the amount recovered is \u201cfor the benefit of a client who was a minor or mentally incapacitated when the contingent fee arrangement was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The New Jersey rule therefore provides strong support for limiting attorneys\u2019 contingent fees to a reasonable amount in the context of the global settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">In addition, the Court is further persuaded by similar rules in California and Texas, the other primary coordinate jurisdictions in the Vioxx litigation. <em>See </em>Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 6146(a) (providing a sliding scale framework for limiting contingent fees in actions against health care providers); Tex. Lab.Code Ann. \u00a7 408.221 (limiting contingent fee arrangements in worker\u2019s compensation lawsuits to 25% of the plaintiffs net recovery). Other states have also adopted similar rules or statutes placing comparable limitations on contingent fee arrangements. <em>See, e.g., </em>Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 52-251c(b) (limiting contingent fees in personal injury and wrongful death cases to 33%% of the first $300,000; 25% of the next $300,000; 20% of the next $300,000; 15% of the next $300,000; and 10% of any amount exceeding $1.2 million); Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 8.121 (limiting contingent fees in personal injury or wrongful death suits to a maximum of 33%% of the net recovery); <em>see also In re Zyprexa, </em>424 F.Supp.2d at 495 (conducting a survey of the states and noting that \u201c[t]he trend in the states is to limit contingent fees in substantial cases to 33 %% or less of net recovery where fees are large\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">2. Decisions by other courts in similar situations</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">The instant case presents something of a matter of first impression, due in large part to the global nature of the settlement, the large number of plaintiffs participating in the settlement, and the considerable amount of money in the settlement fund. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>With little precedent bearing directly on the facts of the instant case, the Court finds guidance in the decisions of other district courts dealing with similar global settlements. For example, the MDL court in <em>Guidant </em>examined contingent fee arrangements in the context of a comparable global settlement resolving state and federal claims. <em>See In re Guidant, </em>2008 WL 682174, at *3 (noting that the global settlement covered \u201cPlaintiffs from both the MDL and state cases, and included Plaintiffs whose cases had been filed or transferred to the MDL, Plaintiffs whose cases were filed outside the MDL in state court proceedings, and potential Plaintiffs who had not yet filed their cases\u201d). The global settlement agreement in <em>Guidant </em>provided the district court with authority over the administration of the settlement proceedings, including the authority to decide the amount of fees for common benefit payment. <em>Id. </em>at *4. In determining the amount of the common benefit payment fees, the court also addressed the reasonableness of contingent fee contracts, taking into consideration the economies of scale provided by the coordinated proceedings and the global settlement. <em>Id. </em>at *17-19. Accordingly, the court capped all individual case contingency fees at 20%, reserving to the parties the right to petition to the special masters for an upward departure subject to certain limiting factors. <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to the court\u2019s limitations, however, no counsel could recover more than 33]\u00e9% in contingent fees. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The court\u2019s approach to attorney fees in <em>Guidant </em>is consistent with the decisions of other courts in similar circumstances. For example, in the <em>In re Silicone Gel Breast Implant </em>MDL, the court recognized a settlement class and allocated 25% of the $4.2 billion settlement fund for attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>In re Silicone Gel Breast Implant Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>MDL No. 926, 1994 WL 114580, at *4 (N.D.Ala.1994). Although the settlement ultimately fell through for other reasons, the court suggested that individual contingent fees should be capped at approximately 25% of each plaintiffs net recovery because of the considerable benefits provided by the economies of scale unique to that litigation. <em>See id.', see also </em>Paul D. Rheingold, Litigating Mass ToRT Cases \u00a7 7:52 (2006) (describing in detail the court\u2019s proposed framework for apportioning fees). Similarly, in <em>Zy-prexa </em>the court addressed the issue of contingent fees by conducting a thorough analysis of the complexity of the issues of the case, the economies of scale offered by the global settlement, and the persuasive authority of several state rules and statutes. <em>In re Zyprexa, </em>424 F.Supp.2d at 496. Given the unique contours of that case, the court in <em>Zyprexa </em>capped contingent fees at 35%, reserving the right to depart upward to 37.5% or downward to 30% based on the facts of each individual case. <em>Id. </em>These decisions provide helpful guidance for the Court in approaching the fee determination in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">3. Determining reasonable fees in the context of the Vioxx global settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">As an initial matter, the Court notes that this is essentially a products liability case, and all products liability cases pose significant challenges to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. The risk of loss for plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in these cases is considerable. In addition, the basic challenges inherent in any products liability case were compounded in this case by a host of complex legal issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>unique to the instant litigation, including (to name only a few) the learned intermediary doctrine, contributory negligence, causation, federal preemption laws, and Merck\u2019s assertion of attorney-client privilege with respect to thousands of documents in its possession. The risks associated with pursuing these cases became even more daunting in light of the verdicts returned by juries in this Court\u2019s bellwether trials \u2014 only one of the six trials resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff. On a single-case basis, therefore, reasonable contingent fees might range from 33% to 40% of the total recovery for each claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In setting a reasonable limitation on contingent fees, the Court is also mindful of the many contributions made by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in furtherance of the administration of the global settlement proceedings. Without the dedication of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel from across the nation, the approximately 50,000 claimants currently enrolled in the settlement would have faced considerable difficulties in securing and producing the appropriate records necessary to enroll in the settlement. Nevertheless, the Court must assess the reasonableness of the contingent fees in light of the fact that the economies of scale have led to a global settlement offering considerable benefit to the attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Instead of pursuing individual discovery, filing individual motions, engaging in individual settlement negotiations, or preparing individual trial plans, attorneys for eligible claimants who wish to participate in the settlement need only enroll the claimants in the settlement and then carefully monitor their progress through the claims valuation process. These economies of scale must cut both ways. The attorneys have benefited from a uniform and highly efficient resolution procedure; the claimants should similarly benefit from fees reduced to reflect that uniformity and efficiency. Even though the unique facts of certain cases may have initially warranted disparate contingent fee arrangements, these individual characteristics no longer control the calculus for determining reasonable fees. <em>See In re Guidant, </em>2008 WL 682174, at *18 (\u201cBecause of the mass nature of this MDL, the fact that several firms/attorneys benefited from economies of scale, and the fact that many did or should have benefited in different degrees from the coordinated discovery, motion practice, and/or global settlement negotiations, there is a high likelihood that the previously negotiated contingency fee contracts would result in excessive fees.\u201d); <em>In re Zyprexa, </em>424 F.Supp.2d at 493 (\u201c[Tjhese firms all benefitted from the effectiveness of coordinated discovery carried out in conjunction with the plaintiffs\u2019 steering committee and from other economies of scale, suggesting a need for reconsideration of fee arrangements that may have been fair when the individual litiga-tions were commenced.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">In consideration of the various state rules dealing with contingent fees and the decisions of other district courts faced with comparable situations, the Court finds that the individual contingent fee arrangements for attorneys representing claimants enrolled in the Vioxx global settlement should be capped at 32% plus reasonable costs.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In reaching this determination, the Court acknowledges the complexity and risk involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>pursuing these cases as well as the fact that any award for common benefit work will later be deducted from this sum.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nevertheless, in light of the large number of plaintiffs, the global settlement, the considerable settlement fund, and the unique contours of this litigation, the Court finds that this is a fair and reasonable framework for apportioning fees. Although perhaps a reduction from the standard 33$% to 40% contingent fee applicable on a single-case basis, this reduction will not result in a paltry award for the attorneys. With a total settlement fund of $4.85 billion, limiting attorneys\u2019 fees to 32% of the net recovery means that the attorneys in this case will receive more than $1.55 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In consideration of the economies of scale offered by the global settlement proceedings and all of the above expressed reasons, IT IS ORDERED that contingent fee arrangements for all attorneys representing claimants in the Vioxx global settlement shall be capped at 32% plus reasonable costs. At a later date after due notice and an opportunity for all counsel to be heard, the Court will determine the appropriate sum for common benefit work. This sum will be deducted from the above amount, reducing the individual attorneys\u2019 fees across the board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-12\">. Given the nature of the interim payment schedule, it bears emphasizing that no claimant shall pay more than 32% of their total award towards attorneys' fees, and any future award of common benefit fees will come from the individual attorneys\u2019 shares of their claimants' awards. Because at the present time only interim payments are being distributed, the mechanics of withholding any common benefit fee charge will be finalized upon the ultimate calculation of claimants' total awards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-5\">.

The Court notes that although many of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys in the Vioxx litigation have entered into contingent fee contracts for 33 )6% of the claimant's net recovery, there are many other attorneys who have 40% and even 50% contingent fee contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b656-5\">. <em>See also Contingent Fees in Mass Tort Litigation, supra, </em>at 116-20 (collecting cases and examining resolutions of contingent fee arrangements); Paul D.

It bears repeating that under no circumstances shall any claimant pay more than 32% of their total award towards attorneys\u2019 fees (not including costs). A percentage of the individual attorneys\u2019 fees will be used to pay the Common Benefit Fund. Because only interim payments are currently being distributed, the mechanics of withholding common benefit fees will be finalized upon the ultimate calculation of claimants\u2019 total awards.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
