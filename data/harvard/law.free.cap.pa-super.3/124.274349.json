O. Kennedy, a member of the Lancaster bar, without any authority from her, and without her knowledge or consent, entered satisfaction of said judgment; that Kennedy was not employed by her for the purpose of entering satisfaction; that he was not authorized to enter an appearance for her; that she never received any money in payment of the judgment; that she did not know of the satisfaction of the judgment until about December 1, 1893; that Kennedy never informed her that he had entered satisfaction of the judgment, but for the purpose and with intent to deceive and defraud her, paid to her the interest on April 1, 1892, and April 1, 1893, telling her that Herr had paid him her interest; and prayed for a rule to show cause why the said entry of satisfaction of said judgment should not be stricken off, and that it should remain a lien against Aaron Herr.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-5\">\u201c A rule was granted, to which Aaron Herr filed an answer stating: That Kennedy was a regular member of the bar on April 1,1892, when he paid to him the principal and interest of the judgment; that Kennedy was the attorney and agent generally for Sarah Himes and invested money for her; that the money for which he gave the judgment to Sarah Himes he received from G.

Her advanced age is sufficient excuse for not remembering several large loans made through Iris <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>direction and under his care, as shown by the records. In this case, the defendant was not a client of Kennedy, but hearing that he had control of the money to be invested, sought him as the representative of the money, and after negotiations gave on April 1, 1886, to Kennedy his judgment bond (in which Sarah Himes is the obligee) and received from him his individual check for $500. Judgment was entered in common pleas of Lancaster county, arid on February 2, 1891, the judgment was revived and its lien continued by an amicable scire facias without knowledge of the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">The court made absolute the rule to strike off satisfaction of judgment.

The court below, in the opinion filed, imposed the whole burden of inquiry upon the borrower. \u201c Kennedy did not tell him whose money it was and he did not know until he saw the bond. After he saw the bond he knew the money came from Mrs. Himes. He does not say he ever made inquiry where Mrs. Himes resided or whether he should pay the money to her. He never asked Kennedy or inquired whether he had authority to receive the money and enter satisfaction on the record or not. He paid the money and took his chance. His negligence was his undoing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">This was too severe a test of his duty and liability. Conversely it could be said Mrs. Himes knew when the loan was made in 1886 that Herr was to be her debtor and sent the money to Kennedy for delivery to Herr; knew the judgment yas entered because she had a certificate ; approved of the payment of interest annually to Kennedy and accepted it from him; knew or should have known of the revival of the judgment by Kennedy; and when informed of the satisfaction of the judgment by Kennedy in December, 1893, and his receipt of this money, recognized the indebtedness as being that of her grandnephew, who for seven years had looked after this and other loans for her, and not Aaron Herr, whom she had never seen, by making a claim for this, with other money, and accepting in satisfaction of this very claim, a deed (dated January 2, 1894, with a consideration mentioned at $2,603.25 \u201cmade up of a mortgage of $2,000 against Hofmaster and the judgment of Aaron Herr for $500 and other items) \u201d from him, with a full understanding of her act, when represented by competent counsel, to satisfy these claims, she accepted his interest in a farm in Salisbury township, and a transfer of his interest in the fee in the Lechler estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The authorities cited by appellee do not apply to this case. It is different in its facts from any presented. During the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>whole course of the business, Sarah Himes authorized such a course of business to be established and continued, as to\u2019warrant a man of ordinary caution in believing that Kennedy was her trusted representative, in the care of this investment; and when his default was discovered, at once ratified his act of receiving the money for her, by accepting from him a deed in satisfaction of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The extent of an agent\u2019s powers depends upon the authority under which he acts. Tins may be shown by his written instructions or his course of dealing. It is true the public are not always bound by the private instructions of the agent; and may hold the principal responsible, though the particular acts are in excess of his private instructions. It applies to cases where the agent has been held out to the world as such by the principal, allowed to exercise enlarged powers from time to time, and his acts therein have been ratified by his principal: American Life Ins. Co. v. Shultz, 82 Pa. 46; Schrack v. McKnight, 84 Pa. 29; Hubbard v. Tenbrook, 28 W. N. C. 351.</p>\n<p id=\"Alq\">The records of the county show that from 1879 to 1892 G. C. Kennedy, acting for Sarah Himes, entered, satisfied, released, transferred, revived and otherwise cared for eight judgments and mortgages aggregating $16,600, some by virtue of a special power of attorney, and others as attorney at law. None of these was repudiated and her ratification of his act is to be presumed from the absence of dissent, which is equivalent to precedent authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Under the special facts in this case, the court erred in making the rule absolute, and the decree is reversed, costs to be paid by the appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
