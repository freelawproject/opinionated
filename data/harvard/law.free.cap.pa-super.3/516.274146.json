Before Dunham, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-14\">The facts sufficiently appear in the opinion of the court below which is in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-15\">From the agreement of parties, and the papers submitted, the facts in the case are as follows, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-16\">On the 11th day of December, 1883, the heirs of Henry Stark, deceased, leased to Benj. R. Bedford, for a period of ten years, a certain piece of land in Tunkhannock borough, at a yearly rental of $60.00, payable quarterly in advance. It was also a part of the said lease that Bedford should erect a brick building upon the leased premises, and that he, Bedford, might renew the lease, for a further period of five years after its expiration, and at the end of the term of the lease, the heirs of Henry Stark, deceased, had the privilege of taking the building, erected upon the premises, \u201c at a value to be fixed thereon by three disinterested appraisers.\u201d And in case the improvements are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>not taken at the appraisement then Bedford to have the right to remove the same \u201c within one month after the end of the term or expiration of the lease.\u201d This lease was assigned by B. R. Bedford to Pierre Asheld, and was continued by agreement for five years, or until December 11, 1898.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-3\">Judgments were entered against Pierre Asheld, and upon March, 31, 1896, two fi. fas. were placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands, one in favor of F. B. Hight, for $385, which was received by the sheriff at 6:41 A. M., and one in favor of Helen J. Asheld, for $256.65, which was received by the sheriff at 6:12 o\u2019clock P. M. of said day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-4\">Upon these fi. fas. the sheriff levied upon the property of Pierre Asheld, situated upon the leased premises, on the 1st day of April, and sold the same upon the 8th day of April, 1896, as shown by his return, the whole sale amounting to the sum of $474.06.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-5\">At this sale notice was given the sheriff that the property levied upon was subject to a lien for rent prior to all other liens, amounting to $127.30, with interest, and demanding that the sheriff pay this sum to them out of the proceeds of the sale of the property levied upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-6\">The amount due the heirs of Henry Stark for rent at the time of the levy, it is agreed by all parties, was for two years\u2019 rent at $60.00 per year, or $120.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-7\">The personal property, situated in the house, upon the premises, sold for $44.06, and the balance of the fund is raised from the sale of the \u201c brick building, etc., and leasehold interest of land with Henry Stark estate, deceased,\u201d which amounted to $430.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-8\">On the part of the execution creditors of Pierre Asheld it is claimed that the landlord is entitled, under the acts of 1772 and 1836, to but one year\u2019s rent out of the proceeds of the sale, or the sum of $60.00, and that the balance should go to the execution creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-9\">Upon the part of the heirs of Henry Stark, deceased, it is claimed that the amount realized from the sale of the leasehold estate of the defendant in the execution should be applied first, to the payment of the rent due, without regard to the length of time the rent is due for, and, in support of this proposition, have cited a large number of cases, most of which are cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>where the real estate itself has been sold, and where rent was reserved, or ground rent. These cases are not at all applicable to the case at hand, however, and do not in any way rule this case. Wood\u2019s Appeal, 30 Pa. 274, and some others cited, were cases where the lease was for coal property, and where the lessee was taking portions of the real estate, and upon that account were held to be in the nature of ground rent. No case has been cited where, as in this case, the rental was merely for the use and occupancy of the land, where the sale of the leasehold rights of the lessee was applied to more than one year\u2019s rent. Yet we are not prepared to say, that where the fund for distribution is raised by sale of such rights, clearly, and so that the amount so raised could be ascertained and shown, that the landlord would not be entitled to the payment of his rent from that fund, without regard to the time for which such rent was due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-5\">In the present case the fund, $430, is raised by sale of a brick building, clearly personal property as much as any other property of defendant in the execution, upon the premises, and \u201c leasehold interest of land with Henry Stark estate, deceased.\u201d How much of this fund then, is raised by the sale of the building, and how much by sale of the leasehold? We are utterly unable to determine. And if a landlord cannot receive his rent out of a sale of personal property, where the rent is for real estate and personal property so mixed up as that it cannot be told how much is for the premises and how much is for the use of personalty, we think by the same reasoning, that where the fund is so mixed up that no one can tell from what source the same is realized, or how much from each source, that the court should not assume that a sufficient amount was received from a particular source to pay the full amount of rent in arrears. We therefore distribute the fund in court as follows, viz :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-6\">Amount in Court......$448.98</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-7\">To heirs of Henry Stark, dec\u2019d, for one year\u2019s rent....... . 60.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-9\">Leaving to apply on executions . . . 388.98</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-10\">To F.

J., as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-5\">In this case, after hearing the parties on a reargument of the case, and carefully considering the authorities again, we are more than ever convinced of the correctness of our former ruling in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-6\">[It is only in cases Avhere the landlord reserves in his lease the right to forfeit the lease upon nonpayment of the rent, and the right to re-enter and repossess himself of the premises, that it has ever been held that the landlord has a lien upon the fund raised by sale of the leasehold. In this case no such right was reserved by the landlord.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-7\">It is true the lessor agrees to quit if he does not pay the rent. He also agrees to pay the rent. But if he fails to do either, the landlord has only the right to such remedies as the law affords him. The distribution heretofore made is, therefore, confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-8\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) in making the distribution, as appears in the opinion of the court; (2) to a portion of the charge as set out in the second opinion, reciting same; (3-5) to the specific awards in the distribution, recited in the opinion; (6) in overruling the 4th exception to the report of distribution, which exception is as follows : \u201c In holding that the brick building did not constitute a part of the leasehold; and in holding that the brick building was personal property as distinguished from the leasehold, prior to its severance, under the. terms of the lease by the parties.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-9\">(7) In overruling the 3d exception, which exception is as follows: \u201c In holding there was no evidence showing what part of the iund, represented the value of, and was derived from, the leasehold interest, so called, as distinguished from the brick building on the premises, described in the lease.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-10\"><em>James W.

A building erected on a chattel is itself a chattel: Gaule v. Bilyeau, 25 Pa. 521. If this were not so as a matter of law, the lease of the 11th of December, 1888, between James B. Stark et al. and Benjamin R. Bedford, extended by an' agreement of Pierre Aslield, the assignee of Bedford, for five years from the 11th of December, 1893, to the 11th of December, 1898, made the building which was to be erected upon the leased premises personal property. The act of June 16, 1836 P. L. 755, provides that the amount of rent for which the goods and chattels taken by virtue of an execution and liable to the distress of the landlord shall be preferred shall be limited to the amount due for one year. It was held in Pattison v. McGregor, 9 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 180, that this act did not apply to the ground rent landlord and for a very obvious reason, for, if the owner of the fee and the owner of the ground rent were both entitled to have a year\u2019s rent reserved as a preference, the very object of the limitation in the act of 1836 above referred to would be defeated. But there is, therefore, no analogy between a ground rent reserved and the present case. It iclaimed by the appellant in tins case that he was entitled to be first paid out of the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale the sum of $120, being the amount of two j'-ears\u2019 rent, and this claim is based upon two considerations: First, because the sheriff returns that he sold the leasehold interest of land with a building thereon for $430. That \u201c there was no severance of the building from the leasehold. They were essentially one and were sold as one.\u201d And, second, that the clause in the lease under which the lessee, who was the defendant in the execution agreed \u201c on breach of any condition to quit and give up peaceable possession of the premises to the appellants on ten days\u2019 notice in writing \u201d was equivalent to the right of the lessor to re-enter and take possession of the premises. Neither of these positions is in our opinion sound. The leasehold interest is the estate which was conveyed by the lessor to the lessee. It does not embrace the house which was erected by the lessee and which, under the lease, he has the right to remove, unless the lessor should at the expiration of the lease exercise the option therein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>given him and take the building at an appraisement for which the lease provides. The agreement to quit on ten days\u2019 notice conferred no right upon the lessors to re-enter and take possession without more. In case of a breach, they would have been compelled to resort to an action for damages, or, if they desired to secure possession, to obtain it under a landlord and tenant\u2019s proceeding or by ejectment. If, therefore, the cases of Wood\u2019s Appeal, 30 Pa. 274, Spangler\u2019s Appeal, 30 Pa. 277, and Miners\u2019 Bank v. Heilner, 47 Pa. 452, went to the extent claimed by the plaintiffs and were in other respects in point, they would not be applicable here. If it had been the intention of the plaintiffs to claim out of the proceeds of the sale the entire amount of rent due and not the amount allowed under the statutory preference of the act of 1836, they might have raised the question more clearly, when the notice of the rent due was given at the sheriff\u2019s sale, by demanding a severance of the leasehold from the building and having it sold separately. There is no evidence in the record anywhere to show the amount for which the leasehold was sold. The plaintiffs in their argument now endeavor to suppty the lack of evidence upon this subject by calculating the value of the unexpired time of the lease at the annual rental value fixed therein; but there is nothing whatever to show that it sold at that price or that it would have sold at that price, if there had been a severance between the leasehold estate and the other property upon the premises at the time of the sale. This covers all the errors assigned by the plaintiff and, as we can discover nothing erroneous in the distribution made by the trial judge in the court below, the decree of distribution made by him is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
