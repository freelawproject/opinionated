J., dismissed the bill ip. the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-14\">The bill in this case was filed to restrain the board of health of the city of Philadelphia from filling up and abating a certain privy well, the existence of which after cleaning had been declared to be a nuisance prejudicial to the public health.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>FINDING OF FACTS.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-4\">The facts are not in dispute, and are admitted by both sides. The plaintiff is the owner of a dwelling-house, situate at No. 732 Carver street, and one Sanders Newmeyer is the owner of premises No. 731 South street, the rear portion of said premises adjoining the rear portion of the premises of the plaintiff. The said privy well is situated partly on the premises of the plaintiff and partly on the premises of the said Newmeyer, the said well having been used in common by the owners and occupants of the respective premises for twenty -years and upwards up to the year 1894. During the month of June, 1894, said well, in pursuance of a complaint, was ordered to be cleaned by the board of health.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">The well was cleaned, and subsequently the board of health, after an inspection, was ^of opinion that the cleaning of the well did not abate the nuisance. The said board of health thereupon ordered the well to be abandoned and filled with clean earth. The plaintiff thereupon filed this bill, praying for an injunction to restrain the board of health from filling the well, on the ground that while the board of health had authority to remove the cause of any nuisance arising from said well, by ordering it to be cleaned, scoured, or cemented, it had no power or authority to order the well to be filled. \u201c The plaintiff offers to show that said well was similar in construction and condition to all such wells now in daily use in the city of Philadelphia, and that said well was not in itself a nuisance, and that any objection that could be made against it on the ground of its being a nuisance could be removed by cleaning, scouring or cementing it, and the plaintiff voluntarily offered to do these things.\u201d [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-6\">This offer was overruled, and exception was taken thereto by plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-7\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-8\">The court is of the opinion that the order of the board of health directing said well to be filled and the nuisance abated, was conclusive as to the question whether cleaning, scouring and cementing would remove the cause of the nuisance, and that the board of health had authority to order the well to be filled up, if, in their opinion, it was a nuisance, and that the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>priety of its action in that regard could not be inquired into by any court of justice in the absence of positive fraud or bad faith. The bill is dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-3\">Bill dismissed, the court certifying that the amount involved in the bill does not exceed the sum of $1,000, exclusive of costs. Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-4\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were, (1) in finding and holding as matter of law that the board of health had authority to order said well to be abated and filled up ; (2) in rejecting plaintiff\u2019s offer of evidence as recited in the opinion of the court below; (3, 4) to the conclusions of law of the court below; (5) dismissing plaintiff\u2019s bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-5\"><em>Thomas Earle </em>White, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A34\">The power given to a municipal body to abate nuisances in any manner it may deem expedient is not an unrestricted power; such means only are intended as are necessary for the public good. The abatement must be limited by its necessity, and no wanton or unnecessary injury to the property or rights of individuals must be committed : Babcock v. Buffalo, 56 N. Y. 268 ; Eddy v.

Borough, 3 Lancaster Law Review, 107, that \u201cthe discretion of a municipal corporation will not be controlled by injunction; \u201d and again, \u201c to warrant the granting of an injunction to restrain' municipal action, it must clearly appear that the officers of the corporation are acting in excess of the powers granted by law.\u201d Tittle v.

The act of January 29,1818, P. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>38, provides, inter alia, as follows : \u201c It shall be the duty of the said board of health to cause all offensive or putrid substances, and all nuisances which may have \u00e1 tendency in their opinion t'o endanger the health of the citizens, to be removed from the streets, lanes, alleys, highways, wharves, docks or any other part or parts of the city of Philadelphia, and to cause such of the privies within the limits aforesaid to be emptied or corrected with lime or otherwise at the expense of the individuals who are the owners of the houses to which .the said privies are appurtenant, as the board shall from time to time deem necessary for the health of the inhabitants thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The act of April 5, 1849, P. L. 346, provides, inter alia, as follows: \u201c The board of health shall have full power and authority\u2019to remove the <em>cause </em>of all nuisances, that exist now, or may be hereafter created, hi the same manner and by the same authority as the existing laws now authorize them to remove all nuisances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">This bill was filed by the appellant to prevent the filling of a privy vault or well, partly on his premises, with clean earth in order to prevent a nuisance in a thickly populated part of the city of Philadelphia. The facts found by the trial judge, which are not in dispute, show that during the month of June, 1894, said well, in pursuance of a complaint, was ordered to be cleaned by direction of the board of health; that the well was cleaned, and subsequently the board, after an inspection, were of Opinion that the cleaning of the well did not abate the nuisance. The board of health thereupon ordered the well to be abandoned and filled with clean earth.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">A privy well may or may not be a nuisance per se according to circumstances. According to the facts of this case, ample authority is vested by the legislature! in, the board of health to determine the character and location of the \\Vell in question and to order and direct the necessary things to be done in order to prevent the nuisance. By the acts of assembly that discretion is vested in the board of health, and it is not for this court to disturb or question the exercise o.f that discretion. In this case the board declared that the cleaning of the well did not abate the nuisance, and so it is found as matter of fact. This being so, the board had the right to take the next step and order the well filled with clean earth.-</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>In Philadelphia v. Provident Trust Company, 132 Pa. 224, the board went one step- further, and in the exercise of its discretion directed the erection of water closets and connections after having directed the cleaning of the well. This, it was held, was in excess of delegated authority. In that case it was an admitted fact that the cleaning abated the nuisance. In this case it is a matter of fact that the cleaning was not sufficient without filling, which, in its discretion, the board of health properly ordered to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">That \u201c no wanton or unnecessary injury to the property or rights of individuals must be committed in the abatement of nuisances,\u201d as held in Babcock v. Buffalo, 56 N. Y. 268, is undoubted law, but the facts in this case show no wanton or unnecessary injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In Kennedy v. Board of Health, 2 Pa. 366, the court held that the board of health \u201chave final jurisdiction in determining the fact of nuisances which they order to be removed.\u201d In that case the defendant maintained upon a vacant lot in Philadelphia a stagnant pool of water which the board of health deemed a nuisance and ordered the defendant to fill it with-earth that the nuisance might be abated.- Failing to do so, the board of health caused it to be filled with two hundred and fifty-four (254) loads of earth, and filed a lien against the lot for the recovery of the cost of filling, which on appeal was sustained. Had Kennedy been directed to clean the stagnant pool, and this means having proved ineffectual on investigation by the board of health, and the filling subsequently ordered, can it be successfully asserted that the act of cleaning could be interposed as a defense to the scire facias on the lien for the filling of the pool? We think not; this case is ruled by Kennedy v. Board of Health, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
