Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-401 through 10-414 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (the Maryland Act), \u201cprecludes the admission in evidence in a Maryland court of the contents of an electronically recorded telephone conversation between a person in the District of Columbia and a person in Maryland if (1) the recording was made by the person in the District of Columbia without the knowledge and consent of the other person and without the authorization required by \u00a7 10-408 [of the Courts Article] but (2) the making of the recording was permissible under the law of the District of Columbia.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The relevant facts, as set forth in the certification order, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">\u201cIn April, 1989, Corporal John Bartlett of the Prince George\u2019s County Police was introduced by an FBI agent to Peter Dilliner, a paid informant who lives in the District of Columbia. Bartlett wanted to arrange a drug transaction in his jurisdiction. For a fee of $2,500, Dilliner agreed to have a drug dealer set up a buy of two kilograms of cocaine in Prince George\u2019s County. Dilliner was acquainted with ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>pellant Asfaw, and enlisted Asfaw\u2019s help in obtaining the cocaine without disclosing the police involvement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">\u201cDilliner engaged in several telephone conversations with Asfaw and a person known to Dilliner as \u2018Maurice,\u2019 believed by Dilliner to be the appellant Mustafa. From his home in the District of Columbia, Dilliner telephoned Asfaw \u2018ten or twelve times\u2019 at Asfaw's business address in Maryland. He also received calls at his home from Asfaw and Maurice. Dilliner said he did not know where the incoming calls from either defendant originated but, according to Bartlett, all of the telephone conversations were between D.C. and Prince George\u2019s County. Using his own tape recorder attached to his telephone in the District of Columbia, Dilliner recorded all of his telephone conversations with Asfaw and Maurice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">\u201cDilliner acknowledged that he recorded the conversations without authorization from or knowledge of the recording by Officer Bartlett. He said he advised Bartlett two days after he discussed the cocaine purchase with Asfaw that he was taping the telephone calls, but Bartlett claimed that he did not learn of the taping until after the arrest of the various participants. In either event, the initial taping was not authorized by the police. Nevertheless, Dilliner gave the tape to Corporal Bartlett, and its existence was disclosed to appellants as a result of their requests for discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">\u201cBoth Mustafa and Asfaw filed pre-trial motions to suppress the recorded telephone conversations. Those motions were denied, and at the ensuing jury trial [in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County] the recordings were admitted into evidence over objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Mustafa was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of cocaine, and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The conviction for possession of cocaine was merged into the conviction for possession with intent to distribute. Asfaw was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. After sentences were imposed, Mustafa and Asfaw appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2521 (1979, 1990 Cum.Supp.) provides uniform minimum standards governing the interception and use of oral, wire, and electronic communications in connection with the prosecution of certain criminal offenses. The federal act seeks to protect the privacy of the individual while at the same time aiding in the enforcement of the criminal laws. <em>United States v. Kahn, </em>415 U.S. 143, 94 S.Ct. 977, 39 L.Ed.2d 225 (1974); <em>Ricks v. State, </em>312 Md. 11, 13, 537 A.2d 612, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 832, 109 S.Ct. 90, 102 L.Ed.2d 66 (1988). Title III requires an effectuating state law before it can be applied within the state. <em>State v. Siegel, </em>266 Md. 256, 271-72, 292 A.2d 86 (1972). The state law may not be less but may be more restrictive than the federal law. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(2); <em>Ricks, supra, </em>312 Md. at 14, 537 A.2d 612. The Maryland Act was modeled on the federal act and closely tracks its provisions; however, the Maryland legislature has made some of the provisions of the State Act more restrictive than the federal law. <em>See Wood v. State, </em>290 Md. 579, 583, 431 A.2d 93 (1981); <em>State v. Baldwin, </em>289 Md. 635, 641, 426 A.2d 916, <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 852, 102 S.Ct. 295, 70 L.Ed.2d 144 (1981); <em>State v. Bailey, </em>289 Md. 143, 151, 422 A.2d 1021 (1980); <em>A Diagnosis, Dissection, and Prognosis of Maryland\u2019s New Wiretap and Electronic Surveillance Law, </em>8 U.BaltL.Rev. 183, 191 n. 45 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Subject to other provisions of the Maryland Act, \u00a7 10-402(a)(l), (2) and (3), respectively, make it unlawful for any person to willfully intercept, disclose, or use any wire, oral, or electronic communication. Section 10-402(c)(2) provides that it is lawful for an investigative or law enforcement officer acting in a criminal investigation, or any person acting under the prior direction of that officer, to intercept such communications in order to provide evidence of the commission of a number of specifically enumerated criminal offenses, including trafficking in controlled danger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ous substances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This provision requires that the person intercepting the communication be a party \u201cto the communication or [that] one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to the interception.\u201d Thus, where a police informant, as in this case, does not act under the prior direction of an investigative or law enforcement officer when intercepting a communication, the provisions of \u00a7 10-402(c)(2) do not legalize the disclosure of that communication in a Maryland court.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Maryland's two-party consent provision, a departure from the federal act, is contained in \u00a7 10-402(c)(3); it makes it unlawful, with other exceptions not here pertinent, for a \u201cperson\u201d to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication unless the person \u201cis a party to the communication and where all of the parties to the communication have given prior consent to the interception.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Section 10-405 provides, as to an intercepted communication, that \u201cno part of the contents of the communication and no evidence derived therefrom may be received in evidence in any trial ... if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of [the Act].\u201d Section 10-407 contains a number of provisions, none of which are apposite to the facts in the present case, authorizing disclosure of the contents of communications intercepted in accordance with the provisions of the Maryland Act, or of evidence derived therefrom. Specifically, \u00a7 10-407(c) permits such disclosure by a person in a Maryland court if the communication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>was intercepted \u201cby any means authorized by this subtitle.\u201d Section 10-407(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">\u201cAny investigative or law enforcement officer [of another state] ... who has lawfully received any information concerning wire, oral or electronic communication or evidence lawfully derived therefrom, which would have been lawful for a law enforcement officer of this State pursuant to \u00a7 10-402(c)(2) ... to receive, may disclose the contents of that communication or the derivative evidence while giving testimony [in court].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Under the federal law, a wire or oral communication may be intercepted by a person acting under color of law if the person is a party to the communication, or if one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to the interception. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(e). Even a party not acting under color of law may intercept a wire or oral communication if a party to the communication or if one of the parties to the communication has given consent, as long as the purpose of the interception is not in violation of state or federal law. \u00a7 2511(2)(d). The Maryland Act, on the other hand, specifies that except in connection with the offenses enumerated in \u00a7 10-402(c)(2) (which include trafficking in controlled dangerous substances), oral, wire, or electronic communications may be intercepted only if the interceptor is a party to the communication and <em>all </em>of the parties to the communication have given prior consent to the interception, and the interception is for a lawful purpose. As earlier observed, Dilliner was not acting at the direction of an investigative or law enforcement officer when he intercepted the communications in this case; hence, two-party consent was required before the intercepted communications were admissible in a Maryland court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The parties agree that Dilliner\u2019s use of a tape recorder attached to his telephone in the District of Columbia to intercept the communications here involved was lawful under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(c) and (d). They also agree that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>interception would not have been lawful had it been made in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Appellants contend that the admission of Dilliner\u2019s tape recordings in evidence was improper because \u00a7 10-407(c) permits the disclosure of intercepted information only if it is derived \u201cin accordance with the provisions of this subtitle.\u201d They argue that because the interception was not in compliance with Maryland\u2019s two party consent provisions, the evidence should have been excluded at trial. Moreover, they urge that \u00a7 10-407(f) requires the exclusion of the phone conversations recorded in the District of Columbia. They claim that this subsection only permits law enforcement officers to testify about wire, oral, or electronic communications, or evidence derived therefrom, \u201cwhich would have been lawful for a law enforcement officer of this State pursuant to \u00a7 10-402(c)(2) of this subtitle to receive.\u201d Appellants suggest that this provision mandates that because the taping was not lawful under the more restrictive Maryland law, it should not have been admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The State contends that the exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence lawfully intercepted outside of Maryland because the law of the locality where the interception occurred governs its validity. It relies upon <em>Stowe v. Devoy, </em>588 F.2d 336 (2nd Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 931, 99 S.Ct. 2862, 61 L.Ed.2d 299 (1979). The State posits that the Maryland Act merely provides that the contents of the intercepted communications are inadmissible if disclosure is in violation of the Maryland Act. The State argues that there was no violation of the Maryland Act because the statute\u2019s reach does not extend beyond the territorial jurisdiction of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Whether Maryland\u2019s more restrictive two-party consent provision precludes the admission in evidence of a communication which, although validly intercepted under the law of the District of Columbia, violates Maryland\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>statute is essentially a matter of statutory construction. In interpreting the Act\u2019s provisions, our goal is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature. Our focus is, therefore, centered upon the statute\u2019s purpose or policy. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628 (1987). <em>See also Harford County v. University, </em>318 Md. 525, 539, 569 A.2d 649 (1990); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Mohler, </em>318 Md. 219, 225, 567 A.2d 929 (1990). Where statutory language is unambiguous, and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, the words will be accorded their ordinary significance. <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Burke, </em>321 Md. 699, 706, 584 A.2d 702 (1991); <em>Tatum v. Gigliotti, </em>321 Md. 623, 628, 583 A.2d 1062 (1991); <em>Trimble v. State, </em>321 Md. 248, 265, 582 A.2d 794 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Both the state and federal laws make it unlawful to \u201c[wjillfully intercept ... any wire, oral, or electronic communication\u201d unless otherwise specifically authorized. \u00a7 10-402(a); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(l)(a), (b). Both the state and federal laws contain an exclusionary rule for evidence seized in violation of their provisions. \u00a7 10-405; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2515. The purpose of these exclusionary rules is \u201cto deter law enforcement officers from violating privacy rights by ensuring that the courts do not become partners in illegal police conduct,\u201d <em>Sanders v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 156, 167, 469 A.2d 476, <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 656, 474 A.2d 1345 (1984) (citing <em>People v. Fidler, </em>72 Ill.App.3d 924, 29 Ill.Dec. 51, 52, 391 N.E.2d 210, 211 (1979)); <em>see also Re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>613 F.2d 1171, 1175 (D.C.Cir.1979); <em>Re Proceedings to Enforce Grand Jury Subpoenas, </em>430 F.Supp. 1071, 1072-73 (D.C.Pa.1977). We necessarily consider the application of the exclusionary rule in the context of the privacy interest in communications which the Maryland Act is designed to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The exclusionary provision in \u00a7 10-405 of the Maryland Act precludes the admission of evidence which was not lawfully intercepted. The language of this section is unambiguous, and provides for no exceptions. There is no indication that the legislature intended to adopt anything but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u201call-encompassing exclusionary rule which it unequivocally fashioned in \u00a7 10-405.\u201d <em>Wood v. State, supra, </em>290 Md. at 584, 431 A.2d 93. Indeed, the provisions of the Maryland Act constitute a declaration of the public policy of this State. <em>See Harrison v. Mont. Co. Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 442, 460, 456 A.2d 894 (1983); <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 45, 432 A.2d 464 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">One of the clear purposes of the more restrictive consent provision of the Maryland Act is to prevent \u201cthe unauthorized interception of communications where one of the parties has a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Benford v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., </em>554 F.Supp. 145, 151 (D.Md.1982). The two-party consent provision of the Maryland Act is aimed at providing greater protection for the privacy interest in communications than the federal law. Because such an interception is not permissible under the Maryland Act, it may not be lawfully disclosed in a Maryland court under \u00a7 10-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">While \u00a7 10-407(f) of the Maryland Act applies to officers from other jurisdictions, and not to informants, the language of this section also supports the view that the General Assembly intended to permit the admission of the challenged evidence in this State only if it comports with \u00a7 10-407\u2019s provisions governing lawful disclosure. Thus, evidence intercepted pursuant to more lenient statutory enactments of other jurisdictions must comply with Maryland\u2019s more restrictive standards before it may be lawfully disclosed in a Maryland court. In the words of \u00a7 10-407(f), law enforcement officers of other jurisdictions may only disclose the contents of a communication or the derivative evidence in a proceeding in this State if it \u201cwould have been lawful for a law enforcement officer of this State pursuant to \u00a7 10-402(c)(2) of this subtitle to receive.\u201d <em>See Sanders v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 156, 469 A.2d 476 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">It is plain that the legislative intent in the Maryland Act was to inhibit the disclosure in Maryland courts of the content of communications not intercepted in conformity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>with the public policy of this State as evidenced by the provisions of its governing law. In other words, the Maryland Act precludes the admission of a communication intercepted, no matter where, under circumstances inconsistent with this State\u2019s substantive law. Under the facts in the present case, it would not have been lawful under the Maryland Act to disclose the content of the intercepted communications, even though lawfully intercepted in the District of Columbia, because the intercepting party under \u00a7 10-402(c)(2) was neither a law enforcement officer, nor a person acting under the direction of a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The dissenting opinion in this case relies upon <em>People v. Barrow, </em>133 Ill.2d 226, 257-58, 139 Ill.Dec. 728, 741-42, 549 N.E.2d 240, 253-54 (1989); <em>Commonwealth v. Bennett, </em>245 Pa.Super. 457, 460-62, 369 A.2d 493, 494-95 (1976); and <em>State v. Mayes, </em>20 Wash.App. 184, 579 P.2d 999, 1004-05 (1978) to support the proposition that the Maryland Act should not be interpreted to preclude the use, in a Maryland court, of communications lawfully intercepted in another state. The state statutes interpreted in those cases contain exclusionary provisions less restrictive than those of the Maryland Act. Specifically, the wiretapping and electronic surveillance statutes in Illinois and Washington, <em>see Bennett </em>and <em>Mayes, </em>contain no provisions comparable to \u00a7 10-407(f), which links the admissibility of evidence in this State to compliance with the Maryland Act. Ill.Rev.Stat. 1983, ch. 38, par. 14-1 <em>et seq.; </em>Wash.Rev.Code, \u00a7 9.73010 <em>et seq. </em>(1989). Pennsylvania's statute in <em>Barrow </em>expressly authorizes disclosure by anyone who has obtained knowledge \u201cby any means authorized by the laws of another state or the Federal government.\u201d 18 Pa.Cons.Stat. \u00a7 5717(c) (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">We recognize that Maryland may not ordinarily proscribe conduct occurring outside its boundaries. Quite plainly, however, it may regulate the admissibility of evidence in its courts. In this regard, the State\u2019s reliance upon <em>Stowe v. Devoy, supra, </em>is misplaced; that case implicated the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>sions of the federal act as to the admissibility of evidence in a federal court extradition case, which was obtained from a wiretap lawfully occurring in a foreign country. The case is inapposite on its facts and has no bearing upon the proper interpretation of the Maryland Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Thus, under the certified facts in this case, we conclude that the Maryland Act precludes the disclosure in a Maryland court of communications seized by Dilliner, who was not acting under the direction or supervision of an investigative or law enforcement officer. Accordingly, for the reasons stated, the trial court erred in admitting the tape recordings in evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">CERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED AS HEREIN SET FORTH; CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.

The interception involved in this case was not within any of the enumerated exceptions. Therefore, the majority reasons that the interception must have been \u201cin violation of\u201d the Maryland Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">I disagree. The interception with which we are concerned occurred in the District of Columbia. Section 10-401(3) provides that \u201c \u2018[ijntercepf means the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.\u201d Both parties agree that the interception, although it would not have been lawful if made in Maryland, was lawful when made in the District of Columbia. The Maryland Act defines unlawful acts of interception and disclosure in \u00a7 10-402(a). In \u00a7 10-402(b), the Act provides that \u201c[a]ny person who violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of a felony and is subject to imprisonment for not more than 5 years or a fine of not more than $10,000, or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The Maryland Act, making certain interceptions felonies, does not reach the interception made in this case. Dilliner could not be convicted of the felony of intercepting this conversation. He did not, in short, violate the Maryland Act when he made an interception in the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The exclusion of evidence mandated by \u00a7 10-405 is limited to situations where the interception was \u201cin violation of\u201d the Maryland Act, and that is not the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">I do not suggest that the General Assembly lacks authority to exclude evidence of this kind, at least when offered by the State. I am convinced, however, that it did not do so here. The exclusion mandated by the statute is limited to information obtained through interceptions in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the Act, <em>i.e., </em>interceptions for which one could be prosecuted under the Act. Exclusionary rules exact a heavy penalty. Reliable evidence, often essential to a successful prosecution, may be lost. Experience has taught us that in some instances the imposition of an exclusionary rule may be required to deter law enforcement officers from violating certain constitutional rights. <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 656, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1692, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961). Where, however, the goal of deterrence will not be advanced, exclusion may not be appropriate. <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 916-22, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 3417-20, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Other state courts have held that evidence gathered by officers of a foreign state, and in accordance with the laws of that foreign state, is properly admitted in the forum state, although the complained-of action would violate the forum state\u2019s eavesdropping statute. <em>See People v. Barrow, </em>133 Ill.2d 226, 257-58, 139 Ill.Dec. 728, 741-42, 549 N.E.2d 240, 253-54 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 3257, 111 L.Ed.2d 767 (1990) (evidence was not \u201cobtained in violation\u201d of Illinois law within meaning of Illinois exclusionary provision where evidence was validly intercepted in Maryland, even though interception would have been invalid if accomplished in Illinois); <em>Commonwealth v. Bennett, </em>245 Pa.Super. 457, 460-62, 369 A.2d 493, 494-95 (1976) (information obtained from wiretap, valid where conducted in New Jersey but which would have been unlawful if conducted in Pennsylvania, is admissible in Pennsylvania prosecution\u2014\u201cany other conclusion would result in an unwarranted extension of the exclusionary rule\u201d); <em>State v. Mayes, </em>20 Wash.App. 184, 579 P.2d 999, 1004-05 (1978) (Washington statute prohibiting admissibility of information obtained from interceptions made \u201cin violation of\u201d the statute does not require exclusion of evidence obtained from interception made in California and valid under California law).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The interception in this case was entirely lawful when and where made. Exclusion of the evidence is not, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>needed to punish a violation of law or to deter others from similar conduct. The majority\u2019s holding, it should be noted, would apply with equal force to a communication occurring entirely within the District of Columbia. The legislature fashioned an exclusionary rule applicable to all interceptions occurring within the State of Maryland. So interpreted, \u00a7 10-405 has a valid and understandable purpose. The majority unnecessarily extends the exclusionary rule to activities which would have constituted a violation of Maryland law if they had occurred here, rather than limiting the exclusion, as the legislature has done, to actions that do, in fact, violate the Maryland Act. In so doing, the majority enlarges the exclusionary rule beyond the apparent intent of the legislature, and beyond the ordinary purpose and function of an exclusionary rule of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">I would instruct the Court of Special Appeals that the Maryland Act does not exclude evidence of the telephone conversation involved in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-12\">. Sections 10-401 through 10-414 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1989 Repl.Vol.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\">. I do not address the question of whether Maryland could impose criminal sanctions for the extra-territorial interception of conversations involving persons physically located within this State. The Maryland Act does not attempt to make this distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
