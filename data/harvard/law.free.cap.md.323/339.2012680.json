The trial court, being of the view that each type of activity constituted a separate and distinct crime, imposed the maximum ten-year prison sentence under the statute for each type of activity and made the sentences consecutive, for a total of twenty years imprisonment for violation of \u00a7 464B.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The principal issue before us is whether the General Assembly in Art. 27, \u00a7 464B, intended to create a single offense which can be committed in different ways or, instead, intended to create several distinct offenses. If the statute creates only one offense, double jeopardy principles would require that the same acts of the defendant not be subject to multiple punishments under the statute. <em>See, e.g., Middleton v. State, </em>318 Md. 749, 757, 760-761, 569 A.2d 1276, 1279-1281 (1990); <em>Randall Book Corp. v. State, </em>316 Md. 315, 322-324, 558 A.2d 715, 719-720 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">This case also presents the questions of whether the defendant\u2019s convictions for the common law offense of battery and the statutory offense of carrying a weapon openly with an intent to injure (Art. 27, \u00a7 36) merged, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>sentencing purposes, into the conviction or convictions under Art. 27, \u00a7 464B.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">On February 7,1987, the defendant Lloyd Eugene Biggus lured the victim, a thirteen-year-old boy whose nickname was \u201cBobby,\u201d to Biggus\u2019s apartment, claiming to need Bobby\u2019s help in clearing some boxes out of the apartment. The State\u2019s evidence showed that once Bobby was inside the apartment, Biggus displayed a \u201cutility knife or a razor knife\u201d to the victim and told him to take off his clothes or Biggus would \u201ccut [him] up and put [him] in the trunk.\u201d The testimony at trial also indicated that Biggus displayed a hypodermic needle. The victim removed his clothing, and thereafter Biggus used his finger to penetrate the victim\u2019s anus.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Biggus momentarily left the victim alone in the bathroom where the sexual assault had occurred. The victim, in a state of complete undress, attempted to flee from the apartment. He was, however, prevented from leaving by Biggus, who \u201cgrabbed\u201d the victim and \u201cpunched\u201d him on the head in order to subdue him. At this point, Biggus\u2019s wife entered the room and told him to release the victim. Biggus complied, and the victim fled the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">A criminal information containing eight counts was filed against Biggus in the Circuit Court for Frederick County. Count one charged \u201cthird degree sexual offense\u201d in that Biggus \u201cunlawfully did engage in sexual contact with\u201d Bobby \u201cby employing and displaying a dangerous and deadly weapon----\u201d <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 464B(a)(l)(i). The second count also charged \u201cthird degree sexual offense\u201d in that Biggus \u201cunlawfully did engage in sexual contact with\u201d Bobby, \u201ca child under the age of fourteen (14) years, the defendant performing the contact [being] four (4) or more years older than the victim____\u201d <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 464B(a)(3). Count three charged a fourth degree sexual offense in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 464C; count four charged attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>second degree sexual offense in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 464A; count five charged attempted sodomy, and count six charged attempted unnatural and perverted sexual practices. Biggus was accused in count seven with a violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 36(a), which prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>carrying a weapon openly with the intent unlawfully to injure another person. Common law battery was charged in count eight.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Prior to the commencement of Biggus\u2019s trial, the State nol prossed counts five and six (attempted sodomy and attempted unnatural and perverted sexual practices). The defendant pled not guilty to the remaining counts and elected a jury trial. At the close of the State\u2019s case, the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal was granted as to count four, charging an attempted second degree sexual offense. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">As previously indicated, the circuit court imposed two consecutive ten-year prison sentences for the convictions under the first two counts, each charging \u201cthird degree sexual offense.\u201d The circuit court merged the conviction on count three (fourth degree sexual offense) into the third degree sexual offense conviction on count one. Biggus was sentenced to a third consecutive ten year prison sentence for battery. For the conviction on the weapons charge, Biggus was sentenced to three years imprisonment, to run concurrently with the three ten-year consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion. Regarding the two convictions for third degree sexual offense, the intermediate appellate court agreed with the circuit court that each subsection of Art. 27, \u00a7 464B, sets forth a distinct and separately punishable offense, even though there is only a single incident of sexual contact. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals also rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments that the battery conviction and the conviction for carrying a weapon openly with intent to injure merged into a conviction for third degree sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Thereafter, we granted the defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. 316 Md. 425, 559 A.2d 375 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The statutory language and legislative history refute the view espoused by both courts below that Art. 27, \u00a7 464B, creates distinct and separately punishable offenses based on the same sexual contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The definition of a \u201cthird degree sexual offense\u201d is set forth in subsection (a) of \u00a7 464B, and the penalty is set forth in subsection (b). Subsection (a) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akq\">\u201c\u00a7 464B. Third degree sexual offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">\u201c(a) <em>What </em>Constitutes.\u2014A person is guilty of a sexual offense in the third degree if the person engages in sexual contact:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">(1) With another person against the will and without the consent of the other person, and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-11\">(1) Employs or displays a dangerous or deadly weapon or an article which the other person reasonably concludes is a dangerous or deadly weapon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-12\">(ii) Inflicts suffocation, strangulation, disfigurement or serious physical injury upon the other person or upon anyone else in the course of committing that offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-13\">(iii) Threatens or places the victim in fear that the victim or any person known to the victim will be imminently subjected to death, suffocation, strangulation, disfigurement, serious physical injury, or kidnapping; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-14\">(iv) Commits the offense aided and abetted by one or more other persons; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-15\">(2) With another person who is mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless, and the person knows or should reasonably know the other per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>son is mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">(3) With another person who is under 14 years of age and the person performing the sexual contact is four or more years older than the victim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The basic language of subsection (a), that one is guilty of <em>a </em>sexual offense in the third degree if he engages in sexual contact in the following ways, on its face appears to create a single offense. In the subsequent language setting forth the six different ways in which the sexual contact is unlawful, each of the six paragraphs beginning with (l)(i) and ending with (3) are separated by the word \u201cor.\u201d This clearly indicates alternative ways in which the single offense can be committed. Moreover, the Legislature was certainly aware that there could be some overlap and that the same sexual contact could fall within two or more of the six paragraphs. For example, sexual contacts falling within (a)(l)(i) will also usually fall within (a)(l)(iii). Nevertheless, the Legislature employed language indicating that a single offense was being created.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">This conclusion is reinforced by Art. 27, \u00a7 461C, prescribing the general form of the charging document for rape or a sexual offense. Section 461C states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">\u00a7 461C. General form of indictment, information or warrant for rape or sexual offense; bill of particulars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">\u201c(a) In any indictment, information, or warrant charging rape or a sexual offense, it shall be sufficient to use a form substantially to the following effect:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">\u2018That A-B on the.......day of........., 19____, in the County (City) aforesaid did unlawfully commit a rape or sexual offense upon C-D, in violation of Article 27, Section (here state section violated), of the Annotated Code of Maryland; contrary to the form of the Act of Assembly in such case made and provided and against the peace, government and dignity of the State.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">(b) In any case in which this general form of indictment, information, or warrant is used to charge a rape or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>a sexual offense, the defendant is entitled to a bill of particulars specifically setting forth the allegations against him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The language of \u00a7 461C reflects the intent that the sections of the \u201cSexual Offenses\u201d subtitle of Article 27 which define substantive offenses, namely \u00a7\u00a7 462, 463, 464, 464A, 464B, and 464C, were each intended to define a single offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute equates \u201ca rape\u201d or \u201ca sexual offense\u201d with the section violated. The specific manner in which that section was violated, or the specific subsection, is obviously not contemplated as the offense. Instead, it is a detail to be supplied by the statutory right to a bill of particulars if a bill is requested by the defendant. <em>See State v. Mulkey, </em>316 Md. 475, 481-482, 489, 560 A.2d 24, 27, 30-31 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The legislative history underlying the current \u201cSexual Offenses\u201d subtitle of Art. 27 confirms that \u00a7 464B was intended to create a single offense. Former Maryland Senate President Steny H. Hoyer, now a member of the United States House of Representatives, chaired a Special Committee on Rape and Related Offenses. Maryland\u2019s consolidated sex offense statutory scheme, consisting of the \u201cSexual Offenses\u201d subtitle of Article 27, was the product of this committee. In order to explain the workings of the new legislation, Senator Hoyer and others prepared a document entitled <em>New Rape and Sexual Offense Legislation, </em>dated July 1, 1976. The document contained definitions and charts which described the various provisions of the sexual offense legislation. The chart illustrating \u00a7 464B clearly shows that the different ways of violating the provision were intended to be alternative methods which result in the commission of only one offense, regardless of the fact that a certain act meets the requirements of more than one alternative method. <em>See Rape and Other Sexual Offense Law Reform in Maryland, 1976-1977, </em>7 U.Balt.L.Rev. 151, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>167-169 (1977) (charts prepared by the Hon. Steny Hoyer reprinted as an appendix).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Courts elsewhere, in construing statutes similar to Art. 27, \u00a7 464B, have reached similar conclusions. In <em>People v. Johnson, </em>406 Mich. 320, 279 N.W.2d 534 (1979), the Supreme Court of Michigan addressed the issue of whether the legislature, in enacting the first-degree criminal sexual conduct statute, Mich.Comp.Laws \u00a7 750.520b, \u201cintended] that a single sexual penetration, accompanied by more than one of the statute\u2019s enumerated special circumstances, [would] result in multiple criminal charges for purposes of ... conviction and sentencing.\u201d 406 Mich, at 323, 279 N.W.2d at 535. The court found nothing in the language of the statute or in the legislative history to suggest that the legislature intended multiple convictions based on a single act of penetration. 406 Mich, at 330-331, 279 N.W.2d at 538. The court held that \u201c[t]he fact that a sexual penetration happens to be accompanied by more than one of the aggravating circumstances enumerated in the statute may well ease the burden upon the prosecution in attaining a conviction under [the statute], but it may give rise to only one criminal charge for purposes of ... conviction, and sentencing.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also People v. Rogers, </em>142 Mich. App. 88, 368 N.W.2d 900 (1985). Cases in other jurisdictions are to the same effect. <em>See, e.g., People v. Collins, </em>54 Cal.2d 57, 59, 4 Cal.Rptr. 158, 160, 351 P.2d 326, 328 (1960); <em>People v. Craig, </em>17 Cal.2d 453, 110 P.2d 403 (1941); <em>George v. State, </em>488 So.2d 589 (Fla.App.1986); <em>State v. Ponte-Alfonzo, </em>348 N.W.2d 734, 736 (Minn.1984); <em>State v. Smith, </em>299 N.W.2d 504, 506 (Minn.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Finally, in construing a statute dealing with a different type of criminal activity, but structured very much like Art. 27, \u00a7 464B, this Court has held that the statute creates a single offense which can be committed in alternative ways. <em>See Hagans v. State, </em>316 Md. 429, 438, 559 A.2d 792, 796 (1989); <em>Rice v. State, </em>311 Md. 116, 532 A.2d 1357 (1987); <em>Jones v. State, </em>303 Md. 323, 326-327, 493 A.2d 1062, 1063-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>1064 (1985), all dealing with the consolidated theft statute, Art. 27, \u00a7 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In the present case the defendant Biggus was found guilty of a single incident of unlawful sexual contact. Therefore, he was subject to a single maximum prison term of ten years for violating Art. 27, \u00a7 464B.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Unlike the issue dealt with in part II above, the question of whether separate sentences should have been imposed for a third degree sexual offense and for battery does not involve the examination of a statutory provision to determine whether a single offense or multiple offenses were created. Third degree sexual offense and battery are clearly distinct criminal offenses, even if based on the same act or acts. The former is entirely a creature of statute, Art. 27, \u00a7 464B. The latter is a common law offense which has not been addressed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Nevertheless, when the same act or acts of the defendant constitute different criminal offenses or different degrees of the same offense, Maryland common law principles will often require that one offense be merged into the other for sentencing purposes, so that separate sentences are not imposed for the same act or acts. The general matter of merger, and the standards for determining whether one offense should merge into another for purposes of sentencing, were extensively reviewed in <em>Williams v. State, </em>323 Md. 312, 593 A.2d 671 (1991), just filed. <em>See also, e.g., Snowden v. State, </em>321 Md. 612, 583 A.2d 1056 (1991); <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 582 A.2d 525 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">The usual standard for determining whether one offense merges into another, where convictions on both are based on the same act or acts, is the so-called \u201crequired evidence test.\u201d This test \u201cfocuses upon the elements of each offense; if all of the elements of one offense are included in the other offense, so that only the latter offense contains a distinct element or distinct elements, the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>merges into the latter.\u201d <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>307 Md. 501, 517, 515 A.2d 465, 473 (1986). Under this test, it is clear that the battery conviction merged into the third degree sexual offense conviction, and that a separate sentence should not have been imposed for battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">With respect to common law battery, \u201c \u2018[i]t is well settled that any unlawful force used against a person of another, no matter how slight, will constitute a battery.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vogel v. State, </em>315 Md. 458, 460-461 n. 3, 554 A.2d 1231, 1232 n. 3 (1989), quoting <em>Kellum v. State, </em>223 Md. 80, 85, 162 A.2d 473, 476 (1960). <em>See Snowden v. State, supra, </em>321 Md. at 617, 583 A.2d at 1059. In addition, \u201c[although intent is an element of the crime of battery, the intent need only be for the touching itself; there is no requirement of intent to cause a specific injury.\u201d <em>State v. Duckett, </em>306 Md. 503, 510, 510 A.2d 253, 257 (1986). Therefore, the intentional unlawful digital anal penetration of the victim by Biggus was a battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">A third degree sexual offense under Art. 27, \u00a7 464B, also requires an unlawful touching. It requires a specific type of touching, namely a \u201csexual contact.\u201d Furthermore, it must be unlawful in one of the ways specified in \u00a7 464B. Thus, the offense under \u00a7 464B has additional elements which are not required for a battery. Nonetheless, the unlawful sexual contact required for a violation of \u00a7 464B constitutes a battery. Consequently, the elements of a battery are included within a third degree sexual offense, and there is a merger under the required evidence test.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Moreover, Maryland cases have consistently taken the position that, where a defendant is convicted of a sexual offense and a common law assault or battery, and the threat of force or force or sexual contact involved in the sexual offense is also the basis for the assault or battery conviction, the assault or battery merges into the sexual offense under the required evidence test. <em>See State v. Allewalt, </em>308 Md. 89, 110, 517 A.2d 741, 752 (1986); <em>Brooks v. State, </em>284 Md. 416, 422 n. 2, 397 A.2d 596, 599 n. 2 (1979); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>Green v. State, </em>243 Md. 75, 80-81, 220 A.2d 131, 135 (1966); <em>Bane v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 135, 140 n. 3, 533 A.2d 309, 311 n. 3 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">As the conviction for third degree sexual offense and the conviction for battery were both based on the same incident of digital anal penetration,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and because the battery conviction merges into the sexual offense conviction under the required evidence test, Biggus\u2019s sentence for battery must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Biggus\u2019s final argument is that his conviction for carrying a dangerous weapon openly with intent to injure, in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 36(a), should merge into his third degree sexual offense conviction under Art. 27, \u00a7 464B. He again relies upon the required evidence test, as well as upon the so-called \u201crule of lenity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">If Biggus\u2019s third degree sexual offense conviction had been based solely on count one, charging an unlawful sexual contact \u201cby employing and displaying a dangerous and deadly weapon,\u201d and if he had been acquitted on count two, his merger argument would be persuasive. It would appear that, under the required evidence test, a \u00a7 36(a) conviction for wearing or carrying a dangerous or deadly weapon openly with the intent or purpose of unlawfully injuring any person would merge into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u00a7 464B(a)(l)(i) sexual offense conviction. The relevant elements of the \u00a7 36(a) offense are: (1) wearing or carrying openly, (2) any dangerous or deadly weapon of any kind whatsoever, (3) with the intent or purpose of injuring any person in an unlawful manner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All of these elements seem to be included in the \u00a7 464B(a)(l)(i) offense. Section 464B(a)(l)(i)\u2019s requirement of employing or displaying a weapon embraces wearing openly or carrying openly a weapon.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The \u201cdangerous or deadly weapon\u201d element of \u00a7 464B(a)(l)(i) is essentially the same as the \u201cdangerous or deadly weapon\u201d element within the meaning of \u00a7 36(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Finally, the purpose of forcing the victim to engage in unlawful sexual contact, required by \u00a7 464B(a)(l)(i), is a purpose to injure within the meaning of \u00a7 36(a). The fact that the type of injury under \u00a7 464B(a)(l)(i) must be a nonconsensual sexual contact is simply an additional element associated with the \u00a7 464B(a)(l)(i) offense. The relevant elements of the \u00a7 36(a) offense are in substance included within the \u00a7 464B(a)(l)(i) offense, and, therefore, the former would merge into the latter under the required evidence test.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Biggus, however, was not convicted of a third degree sexual offense solely under \u00a7 464B(a)(l)(i). The jury, by its verdict on count two, also found Biggus guilty of a third degree sexual offense under \u00a7 464B(a)(3) which punishes a sexual contact with a victim under 14 years of age where the defendant is four or more years older than the victim. Under the required evidence test, the \u00a7 36(a) weapon offense clearly would not merge into a third degree sexual offense based on \u00a7 464(a)(3). Each has entirely distinct elements. Wearing or carrying openly a deadly or dangerous weapon, which is critical to the \u00a7 36(a) offense, is in no manner an element of a third degree sexual offense under \u00a7 464B(a)(3). Sexual contact and the prescribed age <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>factors, however, are the elements of the \u00a7 464B(a)(8) offense not present in the \u00a7 36(a) crime. As each has distinct elements, there would be no merger under the required evidence test.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">As discussed in Part II of this opinion, although Art. 27, \u00a7 464B, creates a single crime of third degree sexual offense, the crime can be committed in different ways. The two ways relevant in this case, embodied in \u00a7 464B(a)(l)(i) and \u00a7 464B(a)(3), have alternative elements. Furthermore, as shown above, the \u00a7 36(a) weapon offense would, under the required evidence test, merge into a \u00a7 464B(a)(l)(i) third degree sexual offense but would not merge into a \u00a7 464B(a)(3) third degree sexual offense. Where a greater offense can be committed in alternative ways, and where a lesser offense would merge into the greater under one alternative but not under another alternative, the critical question becomes the basis for the conviction of the greater offense. In this case, since the jury clearly found that Biggus had committed a third degree sexual offense under \u00a7 4646(a)(3), and since the elements of the \u00a7 36(a) offense are not contained in the \u00a7 464B(a)(3) offense, there is no merger under the required evidence test. <em>See, e.g., State v. Frye, </em>283 Md. 709, 393 A.2d 1372 (1978); <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 373 A.2d 262 (1977); <em>Walker v. State, 53 </em>Md.App. 171, 203-204, 452 A.2d 1234, 1251 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>296 Md. 63 (1983) (applying the principles of the <em>Newton </em>case and stating that a \u00a7 36(a) conviction would not merge into a first degree rape conviction in light of the alternative bases for the rape conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Even though the \u00a7 36(a) weapon conviction does not merge into the \u00a7 464B third degree sexual offense conviction under the required evidence test, our inquiry is not at an end. As we have just pointed out in <em>Williams v. State, supra, </em>323 Md. at 316-317, 593 A.2d at 673, and in numerous other cases there cited, while the required evidence test is the normal standard for determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>there should be a merger when the same act or acts give rise to different offenses, it is not the exclusive standard. When two offenses based on the same act or acts do not merge under the required evidence test, we have applied as a principle of statutory construction the \u201crule of lenity.\u201d Under this rule, doubts as to whether the legislature intended multiple punishments for the same act or acts will generally be resolved in favor of merger and against multiple punishments. The rule of lenity, however, like other principles of statutory construction, is neither absolute nor exclusive. In addition to the rule of lenity, we have examined the positions taken by courts elsewhere, looked to whether the type of conduct has traditionally resulted in multiple punishments, and considered the fairness of multiple punishments in the particular situation. <em>Williams v. State, supra, </em>323 Md. at 317, 593 A.2d at 673; <em>Monoker v. State, supra, </em>321 Md. at 222-223, 582 A.2d at 529; <em>White v. State, </em>318 Md. 740, 745-746, 569 A.2d 1271, 1274 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In light of the above-mentioned considerations, we hold that an Art. 27, \u00a7 36(a), weapon conviction does not for sentencing purposes merge into a third degree sexual offense conviction based in whole or in part on Art. 27, \u00a7 464B(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Unlike the provisions of the handgun statute,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the General Assembly did not in Art. 27, \u00a7 36(a), specifically address convictions under different statutes or address multiple sentences. Nevertheless, the Legislature in \u00a7 36(a), after specifying the range of imprisonment for a violation, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">\u201c[I]n case of conviction, if it shall appear from the evidence that such weapon was carried, concealed or openly, with the deliberate purpose of injuring the person or destroying the life of another, the court shall impose the highest sentence of imprisonment prescribed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>This expresses a sentiment somewhat inconsistent with merger under the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Furthermore, Maryland cases have uniformly refused to merge \u00a7 36(a) convictions into convictions for other offenses where such merger was not mandated by the required evidence test. <em>Brooks v. State, supra, </em>284 Md. at 422-424, 397 A.2d at 599-600; <em>Nance v. State, </em>77 Md.App. 259, 267, 549 A.2d 1182, 1185-1186 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>314 Md. 629, 552 A.2d 894 (1989); <em>Selby v.

State, supra, </em>53 Md.App. at 204, 452 A.2d at 1251.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The General Assembly has taken no action to change the result of those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">A primary purpose of statutes proscribing the carrying or employment of dangerous or deadly weapons is to discourage their use in criminal activity. Where the underlying criminal activity does not itself necessarily involve the carrying or use of dangerous or deadly weapon, the carrying or use of a dangerous or deadly weapon, in violation of a statute like \u00a7 36(a), is an aggravating factor warranting punishment in addition to the punishment imposed for the underlying criminal activity. When someone commits a crime such as that proscribed by Art. 27, \u00a7 464B(a)(3), and also employs a dangerous or deadly weapon in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 36(a), there is no unfairness associated with the imposition of separate sentences for each offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.

Although the information does not indicate the precise basis for the charge of battery, it is clear from the trial transcript, and particularly the prosecuting attorney\u2019s closing argument, that the State\u2019s accusation of battery was based on the alleged digital anal penetration and not upon Biggus\u2019s later grabbing the victim and punching him in the head in order to prevent him from fleeing the apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\">. The offenses are as follows: first degree rape (\u00a7 462), second degree rape (\u00a7 463), first degree sexual offense (\u00a7 464), second degree sexual offense (\u00a7 464A), third degree sexual offense (\u00a7 464B), and fourth degree sexual offense (\u00a7 464C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b406-10\">. <em>See </em>footnote 2, <em>supra. </em>If the charge and guilty verdict of battery had not been based on the digital anal penetration, but instead had been based on the later acts of grabbing the victim and punching him in the head in order to prevent his escape, separate convictions and sentences for a third degree sexual offense and for battery would have been permissible. <em>See </em>the discussion in <em>Snowden </em>v. <em>State, </em>321 Md. 612, 620-623, 583 A.2d 1056, 1060-1062 (1991) (McAuliffe, J\u201e concurring). On the other hand, if there had been ambiguity as to the basis for the battery conviction, it would have been resolved in favor of the defendant and, thus, in favor of a single sentence. <em>Snowden, </em>321 Md. at 618-619, 583 A.2d at 1059-1060, and cases there cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b407-5\">. Art. 27, \u00a7 36(a) states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">\u201c(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014Every person who shall wear or carry any dirk knife, bowie knife, switchblade knife, star knife, sandclub, metal knuckles, razor, nunchaku, or any other dangerous or deadly weapon of any kind, whatsoever (penknives without switchblade and handguns, excepted) concealed upon or about his person, and every person who shall wear or carry any such weapon, chemical mace or tear gas device openly with the intent or purpose of injuring any person in any unlawful manner, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or be imprisoned in jail, or sentenced to the Maryland Department of Correction for not more than three years; and in case of conviction, if it shall appear from the evidence that such weapon was carried, concealed or openly, with the deliberate purpose of injuring the person or destroying the life of another, the court shall impose the highest sentence of imprisonment prescribed. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">As the above-quoted language indicates, the statute also proscribes wearing or carrying a concealed weapon. Nevertheless, \u201c[wjhen a multi-purpose criminal statute is involved, we refine [the required evidence test] by looking at the alternative elements relevant to the case at hand.\u201d <em>Nightingale v. State, </em>312 Md. 699, 705, 542 A.2d 373, 376 (1988). <em>See also, e.g., Middleton v. State, </em>318 Md. 749, 758, 569 A.2d 1276, 1280 (1990), <em>State v.

The Court of Special Appeals, however, in <em>Nance v. State, </em>77 Md. App. 259, 266, 549 A.2d 1182, 1185 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>314 Md. 629, 552 A.2d 894 (1989), seemed to reach a contrary conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\">. There are specific exceptions to the weapons covered by \u00a7 36(a). In order to obtain a conviction under \u00a7 36(a), the State must establish that the dangerous or deadly weapon did not fall within the exception for penknives without switchblades or handguns. <em>See Washington v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>State, </em>293 Md. 465, 474-475, 445 A.2d 684, 689 (1982); <em>Mackall v. State, </em>283 Md. 100, 387 A.2d 762 (1978). Nevertheless, it is not necessary for the State in the charging document to charge that the weapon was not a penknife or handgun. <em>Hall v. State, </em>302 Md. 806, 808-809, 490 A.2d 1287, 1288 (1985). The basic weapon element of \u00a7 36(a) is \u201cany other dangerous or deadly weapon of any kind, whatsoever,\u201d and it is the same as the weapon element of \u00a7 464B(a)(l)(i). In light of this, we do not believe that the State\u2019s need to show that the weapon did not fall within two exceptions, or, in other words, the State\u2019s need to prove a negative, should be regarded as a distinct element of the \u00a7 36(a) offense for purposes of the required evidence test. The cases dealing with the elements of \u00a7 36(a) for purposes of merger have not treated the exceptions to the weapons coverage as a distinct element within the meaning of the required evidence test. <em>See Brooks v.
