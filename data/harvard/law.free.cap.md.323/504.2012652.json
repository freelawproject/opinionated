The Board held that the content of the applications was governed by an amendment to the zoning ordinance that was enacted after the applications had been filed. We shall hold that applying the amendment in that retrospective fashion was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">The Carroll County Zoning Ordinance (the Ordinance) identifies \u201cextractive operations\u201d for special treatment. Prior to February 24, 1988, \u00a7 20.14 of the Ordinance defined extractive operations as \u201c[t]he extracting or mining of sand, gravel, limestone, soapstone, or building stone.\u201d In an agricultural district extractive-type industries are permitted only as conditional uses. Such uses require Board authorization, subject to the requirements of \u00a7 14.4 of the Ordinance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 6.8(f). Prior to February 24, 1988, Ordinance \u00a7 14, Division IV set forth certain general regulations for extractive operations and processing, but it estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>lished no special requirement for the information which was to accompany an application for a conditional use for extractive operations. At that time instructions in the Board form of March 1983, \u201cApplication for Hearing,\u201d listed information to be presented, apparently with applications for hearings of any type.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">On February 24, 1988, the petitioners, The Arundel Corporation and Tidewater Quarries, Inc. (collectively, Arundel), filed with the Board two applications for hearing for conditional uses for extractive-type industries. One application related to approximately 265 acres and the other, titled \u201cAmended Application for Hearing,\u201d related to an approximately 125 acre site.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">While these applications were pending, but prior to hearing thereon, the respondent, County Commissioners of Carroll County, Maryland (the County), enacted Ordinance No. T-75 which, <em>inter alia, </em>added a new \u00a7 14.43 to the Zoning Ordinance. In outline, new \u00a7 14.43 provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atb\">\u201cDOCUMENTATION TO ACCOMPANY A PETITION FOR AN \u2018AE\u2019 DESIGNATION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">A Petition for an \u2018AE\u2019 designation shall be accompanied by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">(a) A detailed site development plan____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">(b) A copy of all necessary State permits or letters of certification from each State agency that it ... is prepared to issue its permit____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">(c) A comprehensive hydrogeologic study____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">(d) The approved land reclamation and restoration plan required by State law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-12\">(e) A map of the proposed truck haul routes____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-13\">(f) A noise analysis____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>(g) A description of dust control measures to be employed on site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">(h) Hours of operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">(i) A description of environmental impacts and planned mitigation measures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">(j) Any additional information as may be required by the Planning Commission or the County Commissioners.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The effective date provision of T-75 reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">\u201cThis ordinance shall become effective immediately. ... If this ordinance is not filed or published it shall be effective in any event.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Ordinance T-75 was adopted at a public meeting on March 28, and executed by the County Commissioners on March 31. Notice of adoption was published on May 2, and the ordinance was filed with the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Carroll County on May 31, 1988. In this case the circuit court held that Ordinance T-75 became effective March 28, 1988. We shall assume, without deciding, that that is the effective date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">On May 5 a representative of the Board attempted to return the Arundel applications to its counsel, but counsel refused to accept them. Then, on June 10, 1988, the Board wrote to counsel for Arundel, stating in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atq\">\u201cOrdinance T-75, adopted and effective March 28, 1988, governs ... the Board in processing the applications for public hearings. The amendment provides no exception for processing, for public hearing, applications filed before the effective date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">\u201cAs neither application complies with the provisions of Article 6, Section 6.3(f) and Article 14, Division IV, Section 14.43 of the zoning ordinance, the Board is without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>jurisdiction to: (1) process the applications for public hearing, and (2) hold the public hearings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Then, by letter of June 24, 1988, the Board advised Arundel\u2019s counsel that the June 10 letter \u201cconstitutes the Board\u2019s official and final decision in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Arundel noted an administrative appeal under Md.Code (1957, 1988 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 4.08, and the County intervened. In its legal memoranda to the circuit court Arundel argued three points in addition to unlawful retrospective application of Ordinance T-75: (1) that T-75\u2019s subject matter was preempted by state statutes dealing with natural resources; (2) that Ordinance T-75 undertook to regulate beyond the County\u2019s zoning power; and (3) that Ordinance T-75 was void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The circuit court ruled that new \u00a7 14.43 of the Ordinance contained \u201csubstantial alterations of then-existing zoning law, significantly increasing the burden on [Arundel].\u201d This the circuit court viewed to be \u201cbasically unfair\u201d when retroactively applied. That court reversed the order of the Board \u201crefusing to process two Applications ... for a Conditional Use to permit quarrying and extractive-type industries in Carroll County\u2019s Agricultural District.\u201d The cases were remanded to the Board \u201cwith instruction that it consider the Applications in accordance with the relevant provisions of the County Zoning Ordinance in effect on February 24, 1988.\u201d The circuit court did not consider the additional issues which Arundel had raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The County appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Arundel cross-appealed, arguing preemption, an exceeding of zoning power, and vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">The Court of Special Appeals held \u201cthat Ordinance T-75 does not affect matters or rights of substance. It is a change in the Zoning Ordinance affecting procedure only, and, as such, may be applied to pending actions.\u201d <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Carroll County v. Arundel Corp., </em>82 Md.App. 418, 426, 571 A.2d 1270, 1274 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Alternatively, the Court of Special Appeals held that a prospective application of T-75, pursuant to <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Riverdale Heights Volunteer Fire Co., </em>308 Md. 556, 520 A.2d 1319 (1987), would produce the same result. Pointing out that no decision had been made whether the conditional uses would be granted, the intermediate appellate court said that \u201cwhen it first came time to render a decision, the existing law was Ordinance T-75. Such law must be applied.\u201d 82 Md.App. at 427, 571 A.2d at 1274. As a further, alternative holding, the court said that even if there were a retroactive application of Ordinance T-75, it \u201cwould not be \u2018basically unfair\u2019 as proscribed in <em>T &amp; R Joint Ventures v. Office, Planning &amp; Zoning, </em>[47 Md.App. 395, 424 A.2d 384 (1980) ].\u201d 82 Md. App. at 427, 571 A.2d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The Court of Special Appeals remanded the cases to the circuit court to decide the validity of Ordinance T-75 \u201cin light of the preemption, vagueness and due process challenges argued by [Arundel].\u201d 82 Md.App. at 428, 571 A.2d at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We granted Arundel\u2019s petition for certiorari. In its brief to this Court, Arundel, in addition to contending that the Board illegally applied Ordinance T-75 retrospectively, argues the preemption, exceeding zoning power, and vagueness issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The order of the Board from which this administrative appeal was noted dismissed Arundel\u2019s applications because they did not comply with new \u00a7 14.43 of the Ordinance. The Board\u2019s articulated reasons for its decision do not suggest that the applications for hearing failed to comply with the law in effect when the applications were filed. Ordinance T-75, adopted March 28, 1988, more than one month after the applications were filed, plainly states that it \u201cshall become effective immediately.\u201d Its text contains no language attempting to give Ordinance T-75 a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>retrospective application to the content of applications previously filed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">\u201cAs a general rule, statutes are presumed to operate prospectively and are to be construed accordingly. The presumption against retrospectivity is rebutted only where there are clear expressions in the statute to the contrary. Moreover, even where permissible, retrospective application is not found except upon the plainest mandate in the legislation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Riverdale Heights Volunteer Fire Co., </em>308 Md. at 560-61, 520 A.2d at 1321-22 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\"><em>Mason v. State, </em>309 Md. 215, 522 A.2d 1344 (1987), illustrates the above-quoted rules. Chapter 647 of the Acts of 1986 amended the Maryland Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act effective July 1, 1986, by providing that \u201c \u2018[a] person may not file more than two petitions, arising out of each trial, for relief under [that act].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 522 A.2d at 1345. Mason had filed two petitions prior to July 1, 1986. He filed another petition in September 1986 which the circuit court rejected. This Court reversed. Giving the act prospective application, we held that the limitation applied to petitions filed after its effective date. Consequently Mason\u2019s September 1986 petition was his first subject to the new limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">In the instant matter, the Board dismissed the Arundel applications because they did not contain the data, exhibits, and reports specified in new \u00a7 14.43 of the Ordinance. That is a retrospective application of Ordinance T-75, the terms of which operate only prospectively. Ordinance T-75 does not establish filing requirements for applications filed prior to its effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Consequently, these cases must be remanded to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">The only decision by the Board in this case is that Arundel\u2019s applications, filed in February 1988, would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>processed, but would, in effect, be dismissed, because they did not comply with the later enacted requirements. Arundel argues, however, that new \u00a7 14.43 \u201cimposes additional elements which must be proven by an applicant for mineral extraction conditional uses in Carroll County such as compliance with complex state laws and regulations regarding surface mining, land reclamation, water appropriation, etc.\u201d Brief of Petitioners at 11. That is not what the Board held in the order appealed by Arundel. Arundel\u2019s applications never got to the stage of a hearing on the merits. Whether the Board, on remand, will construe new \u00a7 14.43 as establishing standards to be met in order to qualify for the requested conditional use approvals, and whether the Board will apply those standards to Arundel\u2019s applications, are issues that are not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Arundel seeks to use the Board\u2019s order to obtain an adjudication on a question going to the, as yet undecided, merits. Arundel is anticipating that \u00a7 14.43 will be construed as establishing standards for the grant of a conditional use in \u201cAE\u201d cases and then will be applied to the Arundel applications. This is not a case in which those anticipated issues need be decided for the guidance of the Board on remand. Counsel for the County assert that \u201cprior to Ordinance T-75, the Board had the obligation, under what is now \u00a7 17.7 of the Zoning Ordinance, to obtain and consider evidence on the same matters as those addressed by Ordinance T-75____\u201d Brief of Respondent at 12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals seemed to indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>agreement with this argument of the County in the course of holding that Ordinance T-75 was procedural only. 82 Md.App. at 425-26 &amp; n. 4, 571 A.2d at 1273-74 &amp; n. 4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Inasmuch as the County\u2019s position is that Ordinance \u00a7 17.7, which antedated Arundel\u2019s applications, imposed the same requirements for proof that new \u00a7 14.43 imposes for documentation accompanying an application, whether \u00a7 14.43 also imposes decisional standards, and whether those standards may be applied to Arundel\u2019s applications, are issues that the Board may never reach on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Arundel\u2019s arguments based on preemption, exceeding zoning powers, and vagueness are not before us on this administrative appeal. They have not been addressed by the agency under the statutory procedure of Art. 66B, \u00a7 4.07(d) for this special kind of case. \u201c \u2018[A] litigant must ordinarily pursue that form of remedy and not bypass the administrative official.\u2019 \u201d <em>Muhl v. Magan, </em>313 Md. 462, 480, 545 A.2d 1321, 1330 (1988) (quoting <em>Oxtoby v. McGowan, </em>294 Md. 83, 447 A.2d 860 (1982)). Exhaustion of administrative remedies is the general rule where the issue is one of statutory construction, <em>see Muhl, </em>313 Md. at 481-82, 545 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>A.2d at 1331, and where the agency\u2019s action is challenged on constitutional grounds, <em>see Prince George\u2019s County v. Blumberg, </em>288 Md. 275, 293, 418 A.2d 1155, 1165 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1083, 101 S.Ct. 869, 66 L.Ed.2d 808 (1981). But, even if some constitutional issue sought to be raised at the present time by Arundel were not subject to the exhaustion requirement, <em>cf. Blumberg, </em>288 Md. at 284-85, 418 A.2d at 1161 (direct attack on power of legislative body to pass the legislation), Arundel\u2019s attacks, raised for the first time in the circuit court, are still premature. It may be that the Board will decide Arundel\u2019s requests for conditional uses without ever relying on provisions, if any, of Ordinance T-75 that are not within prior law.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED.
