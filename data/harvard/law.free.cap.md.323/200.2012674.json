Zdravkovich (Zdravkovich) was before the District Court of Maryland as both a plaintiff and a defendant in two consolidated actions. He was present at the 8:30 a.m. docket call, but later that morning at approximately 11:00 a.m. when his cases were recalled for trial, neither he nor his attorney were present in the courtroom. The cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>proceeded in his absence. A default judgment was entered against Zdravkovich for $2,959.50 in the case in which he was a defendant, and judgment for the defendant was entered in the case in which he was a plaintiff. To further compound Zdravkovich\u2019s losses, in the case in which he was a defendant the District Court also assessed $2,000.00 attorney\u2019s fees against him because \u201che has not shown good faith.\u201d Later that morning, when Zdravkovich arrived back in the courtroom, he was told by the judge what had transpired and that he could appeal the judgments to the circuit court\u2014which he did. On appeal, the circuit court not only affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgments and assessment of attorney\u2019s fees, but the circuit court also assessed additional attorneys\u2019 fees against Zdravkovich for taking the appeal. Zdravkovich, who also happens to be a member of the bar of Maryland, petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted. The petition seeks review of the manner of entry of the judgments in the District Court, as well as the assessments of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Since these cases were never tried on the merits, the facts underlying the controversy between the parties have never been determined. Some facts, however, are not in dispute. It is clear that Zdravkovich entered into a lease purchase agreement (the agreement) for a telex machine with Integrity Credit Corporation (Integrity) as the lessor. The agreement recites that American Communication Terminals, Inc. (Terminals) is the vendor of the telex machine. That agreement was never admitted into evidence, but it is included in the record as part of the pleadings. The agreement was the result of negotiations between Zdravkovich, Haldun Eren, and Patrick T. O\u2019Connor (O\u2019Connor). O\u2019Connor is the president of Terminals. An unresolved area of dispute is whether there was an oral agreement that Zdravkovich had the right to terminate the agreement at any time. Zdravkovich\u2019s claim that he had the right to terminate the agreement at any time is not part of, and may be inconsistent with, the written agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Apparently, Zdravkovich became dissatisfied with the machine and wrote to Integrity and Terminals that he wanted to terminate the agreement. He also stopped making payments. Sometime later, a suit was filed in the District Court by Bell Atlantic Tricon Leasing Corporation, Inc. (Tricon) against Zdravkovich (the Tricon case) seeking damages for breach of the agreement. Zdravkovich filed several pleadings claiming that he had a right to terminate the agreement and that the Tricon case should be dismissed because 1) there was no allegation of, or evidence of, any assignment from Integrity to Tricon, and 2) Tricon could not maintain the action, pursuant to Maryland Code (1975, 1985 Repl.Vol), Corporations and Associations Article, \u00a7 7-301, since Integrity\u2019s right to do business in Maryland had been revoked. Zdravkovich also filed a separate action for fraud and breach of contract against Integrity, Terminals, and O\u2019Connor (the O\u2019Connor case) alleging that Integrity, Terminals, and O\u2019Connor represented that he could terminate the agreement at any time. Integrity could not be served, but Terminals and O\u2019Connor filed notices of intention to defend. On Zdravkovich\u2019s motion, the Tricon case and the O\u2019Connor case were consolidated for trial in the District Court. Several other preliminary motions were filed, and there was at least one continuance obtained by Zdravkovich. Three weeks before the scheduled trial date, Zdravkovich filed another motion for continuance alleging, among other reasons, that his attorney \u201cwould be out of the area on the scheduled trial date, as a result of a long standing commitment.\u201d Three days before trial, Zdravkovich\u2019s motion for continuance was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">On the day set for trial of the consolidated cases, Zdravkovich and the attorneys representing Tricon, Terminals, and O\u2019Connor all answered the 8:30 a.m. docket call. Following the docket call, Zdravkovich left the courtroom and went upstairs to represent a client in a domestic relations hearing in a circuit court case before Judge Casula. Zdravkovich apparently told the district court clerk that he would be in a hearing before Judge Casula. When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>cases were recalled in the District Court at approximately 11:00 a.m., the following is an excerpt of what occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-4\">Judge: Is Mr. Zdravkovich\u2019s presence required here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s Counsel: Yes, it is, Your Honor, he is the plaintiff in the case against my clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">Tricon\u2019s Counsel: And he is the defendant in my client\u2019s case against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">Judge: And he\u2019s trying a case in circuit court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">Clerk: Yes, he\u2019s still with Judge Casula.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">Judge: Anyone have any requests to make?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-10\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s Counsel: I\u2019m going to request, Your Honor, that the case against my clients be dismissed. He had moved for a continuance which was denied in this case. He had plenty of opportunity to make arrangements to be present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-11\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-12\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s Counsel: May I request as to the defendants [Terminals] and [O\u2019Connor] that a judgment be entered in their favor for failure of the plaintiff to appear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-13\"><em>Hi </em># * \u00a3 He *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-14\">Judge: Judgment in favor of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-15\">* # * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-16\">Judge: Terminals and [O\u2019Connor] only\u2014judgment. Judgment by default is that in favor of the defendant in this case. Now where are we?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-18\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-19\">Tricon\u2019s Counsel: Again in my case, which is 21228, since Zdravkovich is not here, I\u2019m asking that the court enter a default judgment in favor of [Tricon].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-20\">Judge: In what amount?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-21\">Tricon\u2019s Counsel: In the amount of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-22\">Judge: Do you have a worksheet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-23\">$ $ % \u2666 \u2666 \u2666</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-24\">Tricon\u2019s Counsel: In the amount of $2,959.50.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-25\">Judge: And you\u2019re entitled to costs in this as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Tricon\u2019s Counsel: My costs uh-and in this case, Your Honor, I may be out of line, but I really feel compelled to ask for attorney\u2019s fees above and beyond the amount of the $705.00 that we originally ask for in our first filing of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">Judge: And you\u2019re asking for how much?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">Tricon\u2019s Counsel: Well I\u2019m asking for $2,000.00. Here\u2019s why I think I should get it because I refer you to the independent action that Mr. Zdravkovich himself filed. In Count I paragraph 8, it says, as a result of this breach-no, no, no-paragraph 7, plaintiff had to employ an attorney to defend him in this action notwithstanding the fact that plaintiff has never entered into a contract with [Tricon]. Apparently the work Mr. Zdravkovich performed up until this point, which was a motion to dismiss, which was denied, a motion for continuance, which was granted, and this complaint, apparently he feels that\u2019s worth two thousand dollars. Now considering the fact that this is the third time that I have been involved in this case, that I have had a witness come down from New Jersey twice, and that he has pulled other people down from Baltimore. If he feels what he has done up until this point is worth two thousand dollars, I feel I should get two thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">Judge: I think in this case the uh plaintiff [sic], Mr. Zdravkovich, has not shown good faith with the court, has not appeared, has not requested a continuance, although this member of the court routinely grants them. I was a practicing attorney for many years. I understand the problems of scheduling, particularly in a jurisdiction this crowded. I find that Mr. Zdravkovich has not shown good faith in this matter. I am going to award attorney fees in the amount that he thought was reasonable, two thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">Tricon\u2019s Counsel: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Judge: Judgment will be entered in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant in that amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Sometime later that morning, when Zdravkovich appeared in the District Court, he was told by the judge what had transpired in his absence and that he had thirty days to note an appeal. Zdravkovich did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">On appeal to the circuit court, Zdravkovich fared no better than he had in District Court. The circuit court affirmed the judgment in favor of Tricon for $2,959.50, as well as the award of $2,000.00 attorney\u2019s fees. The court also affirmed the judgment in favor of O\u2019Connor and Terminals in the O\u2019Connor case. Immediately after the circuit court decision, counsel in the Tricon case and counsel in the O\u2019Connor case both filed motions for attorney\u2019s fees. Counsel for Tricon alleged that the appeal was frivolous and that an award of attorney\u2019s fees was \u201cfurther justified as a sanction against defendant Zdravkovich for bringing this appeal in the first place and, hopefully, as a deterrent to continuing his efforts further.\u201d Both attorneys filed affidavits of counsel fees. Counsel for O\u2019Connor sought $1,050.00 attorney\u2019s fees and counsel for Tricon sought $1,425.00. Zdravkovich filed oppositions to the motions for attorney\u2019s fees, as well as an extensive memorandum in opposition to the motions for attorney\u2019s fees. Without a hearing, the circuit court judge signed orders assessing $1,300.00 attorney\u2019s fees against Zdravkovich for the Tricon case appeal and $1,050.00 attorney\u2019s fees for the O\u2019Connor case appeal. Those orders contain no findings of fact or reasons for the imposition of sanctions other than one statement in the O\u2019Connor case order that it was entered \u201c[u]pon consideration of the Motion for Order for Attorneys \u25a0Fees filed herein ... and for the reasons stated therein....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">THE DEFAULT JUDGMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"AIqk\">Maryland Rule 3-509 sets out procedures for entry of a default judgment when a defendant fails to appear in court. Rule 3-306 also provides for judgment on affidavit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>but the judgments in the instant case were not based on affidavit. The only affidavit in the Tricon case was signed by Tricon\u2019s attorney. Counsel acknowledged that the affidavit was deficient and judgment on affidavit was not sought. Tricon sought and obtained a judgment by default.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Rule 3-509(a) provides for trial on default when a defendant \u201chas failed to appear in court at the time set for trial.\u201d We will assume <em>arguendo </em>that Zdravkovich failed to appear at the time set for trial. The rule does not authorize the court to simply enter judgment for the plaintiff in the amount requested by plaintiffs attorney. Rule 3-509(a) still requires a hearing prior to entering a judgment by default when there was no request for judgment on affidavit filed and a defendant fails to appear for trial. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201c(1) if the defendant did not file a timely notice of intention to defend, the plaintiff shall not be required to prove the liability of the defendant, but shall be required to prove damages;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">(2) if the defendant filed a timely notice of intention to defend, the plaintiff shall be required to introduce prima facie evidence of the defendant\u2019s liability and to prove damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The District Court docket entries reflect that Zdravkovich filed a notice of intention to defend; therefore, Tricon should have been required to introduce prima facie evidence of Zdravkovich\u2019s liability. Regardless of whether Zdravkovich filed a notice of intention to defend, the plaintiff is still required to prove damages. Tricon contends that there was sufficient proof of damages in the District Court. Rule 3-509(a) requires that, before a default judgment is entered, a plaintiff must \u201cprove damages.\u201d There was some suggestion that Tricon had a witness available in the District Court and a worksheet to establish damages, but did not call the witness or file the worksheet because Zdravkovich was not present and there was no objection to counsel\u2019s proffer of damages. In <em>Philip White, Etc. v. Baricev/Waguespack, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>410 So.2d 1247 (La.Ct.App.1982), a default judgment case similar to the instant case, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">\u201cThe transcript shows that <em>plaintiffs counsel stated to the trial court </em>that a document was attached to the petition showing there is an unpaid balance on open account in the sum of $1,545.00 owed to it by Baricev/Waguespack, Ltd. This document is nowhere in the record. In any event, an itemized statement of account without an affidavit or testimony attesting to its correctness provides an insufficient basis upon which to confirm a judgment by default.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1248. Rule 3-509(a) requires <em>proof o\u00ed </em>damages not a mere proffer of damages. There is no evidence in the record to support a damage award of $2,959.50. This is not a case of inadequate proof of damages; it is a case of total failure to prove damages. A mere announcement by counsel as to the amount of damages the plaintiff seeks does not constitute proof of damages. The failure to offer any evidence, other than counsel\u2019s statement as to the amount of damages sought, required reversal of the judgment obtained by Tricon against Zdravkovich.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">We should point out that, if Tricon had filed a motion for judgment on affidavit and a proper affidavit under Rule 3-306, it may have been entitled to judgment. See also Rule 3-509(b) which allows proof of damages by affidavit in actions \u201cfor property damage.\u201d Tricon was not entitled to judgment pursuant to Rule 3-306 or Rule 3-509 as it failed to comply with those rules. The circuit court erred in affirming the Tricon judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The judgment in favor of the defendants in Zdravkovich\u2019s suit against O\u2019Connor and Terminals was not a judgment by default under Rule 3-509. That rule does not deal with the failure of a plaintiff to appear. The court could, however, grant a judgment in favor of the defendants based on plaintiff\u2019s failure to prove a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Zdravkovich\u2019s appeal was based on a meager district court record. The better procedure would have been to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>a motion for new trial pursuant to Rule 3-533 and supplement the record with proffers of why he was not in court, how long he was gone, the merits of his case, and why justice would require a new trial. The bare record from the District Court does not establish that the trial judge abused his discretion by proceeding with the trial in the O\u2019Connor case in Zdravkovich\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">ASSESSMENT OF COUNSEL FEES</p>\n<p id=\"AcT\">Maryland Rule 1-341 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">\u201cIn any civil action, if the court finds that the conduct of any party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or without substantial justification the court may require the offending party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay to the adverse party the costs of the proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by the adverse party in opposing it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Rule 1-341 can be an effective tool for the deterrence of unnecessary or abusive litigation. Unfortunately, like many tools, if improperly used or if abused, it is capable of inflicting excessive or unwarranted injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The assessments of attorneys\u2019 fees against Zdravkovich in both the district and circuit courts can only be described as unwarranted. The District Court failed to afford Zdravkovich the procedural safeguards to which an attorney or litigant is entitled before imposing sanctions in the form of attorneys\u2019 fees. The district and circuit judges both apparently applied the wrong standard, or no standard at all, in determining whether attorneys\u2019 fees should be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The constitutional guarantee of due process is applicable to an assessment of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Rule 1-341. <em>Talley v. Talley, </em>317 Md. 428, 434-35, 564 A.2d 777, 780-81 (1989). Due process requires, at a minimum, that before sanctions are imposed pursuant to Rule 1-341, there must be notice and an opportunity to respond. <em>Id.; Blanton v. Equitable Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n, </em>61 Md.App. 158, 166, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>485 A.2d 694, 698-99 (1985); <em>see also Miranda v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co., </em>710 F.2d 516, 522-23 (1983). Although we need not decide in the instant case, a hearing may also be required if properly requested. <em>See Talley, </em>317 Md. at 435, 564 A.2d at 780-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">In the District Court, Zdravkovich had no notice that attorney\u2019s fees would be assessed pursuant to Rule 1-341. He was on notice that attorney\u2019s fees were being sought under the agreement, but the agreement called for \u201creasonable collection expenses and attorney\u2019s fees of 20% of the total unpaid rental for the balance of the term of the lease.\u201d In its complaint, Tricon sought 20% attorney\u2019s fees which it computed to be $705.86. The attorney\u2019s fees awarded, in the amount of $2,000.00, were over 66% of the judgment and were assessed, not because of any contractual obligation, but because Zdravkovich \u201chas not shown good faith.\u201d The lack of notice and opportunity to respond requires that the District Court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The imposition of sanctions pursuant to Rule 1-341 requires an explicit finding that a claim or defense was \u201cin bad faith or without substantial justification.\u201d The record must reflect that the trial judge made the requisite findings, as well as the basis for those findings. In <em>Talley, </em>Judge McAuliffe, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">\u201cThe justification for this requirement [of an evidentiary finding of bad faith or lack of substantial justification] lies not only in the clear language of the rule, but also in the logic that before such an extraordinary sanction is imposed there should be evidence that there has been a clear focus upon the criteria justifying it and a specific finding that these criteria have been met. Moreover, some brief exposition of the facts upon which the finding is based and an articulation of the particular finding involved are necessary for subsequent review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">317 Md. at 436, 564 A.2d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The District Court\u2019s finding that Zdravkovich \u201chas not shown good faith\u201d is not the equivalent of a finding of \u201cbad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>faith\u201d and cannot be the basis for the imposition of sanctions. In addition, based on our review of the record, there is insufficient evidence to justify a finding that Zdravkovich\u2019s conduct in defending the Tricon case was in bad faith. Apparently, the primary basis for the trial judge\u2019s assessment of attorney\u2019s fees was that Zdravkovich was not present when the case was called. This fact alone does not justify a finding of \u201cbad faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">The circuit court judge, when assessing attorneys' fees against Zdravkovich pursuant to Rule 1-341, also failed to make the requisite factual findings and to set forth the basis for the imposition of sanctions. In the Tricon case, the court\u2019s order simply recites that it is based on the judge \u201c[hjaving reviewed the pleadings of counsel thereon, and any opposition thereto, and being otherwise fully advised in this matter....\u201d The order makes no findings of bad faith or that the appeal was taken without substantial justification, and the record clearly would not support such findings. Zdravkovich\u2019s contention that the district court judge committed error was well founded and persuasive. There was more than \u201csubstantial\u201d justification for the Tricon case appeal. There was neither an allegation, nor any basis for a finding, that Zdravkovieh\u2019s appeal was pursued in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In the O\u2019Connor case appeal, the order assessing attorney\u2019s fees merely recites \u201c[ujpon consideration of the Motion for Order for Attorneys Fees filed herein ... and for the reasons stated therein....\u201d The judge made no express finding that the appeal was taken in bad faith or without substantial justification. In their motion for attorney's fees, O'Connor and Terminals never specifically allege that Zdravkovieh\u2019s appeal was taken in bad faith or without substantial justification. The closest they come to such an allegation is in paragraph 7 of their motion where they state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">\u201c7. As a result of the frivolous appeal pursued by the Plaintiff/Appellant herein, the Defendants/Appellees have been caused to incur One Thousand and Fifty Dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>lars ($1,050.00) in attorneys fees as set forth in the Affidavit attached as Exhibit B. Since there was no basis in the record supporting the Plaintiff/Appellant\u2019s appeal as to [Terminals] and [O\u2019Connor], these Defendants/Appellees respectfully submit that sanctions should be imposed against the Plaintiff and his co-counsel for pursuing a frivolous appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The order signed by the circuit court judge does not establish that the judge expressly found bad faith or that the appeal was without substantial justification. Even if the judge had made such a finding, it could not be supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The imposition of sanctions is to deter litigation that clearly lacks merit, but not to \u201cstifle the enthusiasm or chill the creativity that is the very lifeblood of the law.\u201d <em>Eastway Const. Corp. v. City of New York, </em>762 F.2d 243, 254 (2d Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 918, 108 S.Ct. 269, 98 L.Ed.2d 226 (1987). In his appellate brief, Zdravkovich indicates that one of the bases for appeal was \u201cthe propriety of granting a judgment when it is known that [a litigant\u2019s] absence is caused by his appearance in another court.\u201d This issue, in its factual context, does not lack substantial justification, and there is no allegation or basis for a finding that Zdravkovich pursued his appeal in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Rule 1-341 is not intended to simply shift litigation expenses based on relative fault. Its purpose is to deter unnecessary and abusive litigation. The imposition of sanctions requires explicit factual findings supported by the record, as well as the careful exercise of judicial discretion. The deterrent purpose of Rule 1-341 should be reemphasized because, in too many cases, the pleadings that evidence the most bad faith and the least justification are motions requesting costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.
