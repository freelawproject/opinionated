The purpose of the PSD permit process is to prevent degradation of the ambient air quality in areas where air quality is already superior to that required by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. PSD approval is the first step in a three stage air quality permit process, and PSD approval is required before any potential source of air pollution can be located in a PSD area. The next stage in the air quality approval process requires an applicant to obtain a permit to construct, and the final stage requires the. applicant to obtain a permit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>operate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The plaintiffs are two individual landowners, Beverly Thoms and Karen Kalla, who reside near Sugarloaf Mountain, and the Sugarloaf Citizens Association, a nonprofit corporation representing the interests of the citizens residing in the Sugarloaf Mountain area of Montgomery County, Maryland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants are Montgomery County, Maryland, the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority, and the Air Management Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">At issue in this case is a municipal solid waste incinerator which Montgomery County and the Northeast Authority propose to construct at Dickerson, Maryland, near Sugar-loaf Mountain.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sometime in 1988, Montgomery County and the Northeast Authority filed an application for PSD approval of the proposed facility with the Air Management Administration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>COMAR 26.11.02.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">On May 10, 1988, the plaintiffs sent a letter to George P. Ferreri, head of the Air Management Administration, requesting that the Administration hold an \u201cadjudicatory\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>hearing on the PSD application. The Citizens Association sent numerous additional requests for an adjudicatory hearing to the Administration, specifically on May 24, 1988, September 28, 1988, and September 18, 1989. By letter of October 18, 1989, Mr. Ferreri denied the request for an adjudicatory hearing. Furthermore, he stated that a public hearing at which interested persons could make comments would be held on November 18, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Pursuant to COMAR 26.11.02.10C, notices were published in newspapers in the Sugarloaf Mountain area, informing residents that the Air Management Administration would hold a public hearing on November 18, 1989, regarding the PSD application, and that comments would be received through the date of the hearing. A five hour non-trial type hearing was held on November 18th, and the record was kept open for an additional thirty days in order to receive any further comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Prior to the public hearing, on November 6, 1989, Sugar-loaf Citizens Association filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a complaint for a declaratory judgment, requesting the court to declare that the Air Management Administration was required to hold an \u201cadjudicatory\u201d hearing before taking final action on the PSD application filed by Montgomery County and the Northeast Authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A petition for a writ of mandamus was also filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The original defendants, Air Management Administration and the head of the Administration, George Ferreri, answered the complaint and petition. Subsequently, the Northeast Authority and Montgomery County moved to intervene as defendants, and filed an answer to the complaint and petition; intervention was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Each defendant then filed a motion for summary judgment on two grounds, namely that the Citizens Association had no standing to sue because it lacked a property interest or special damages, and that a contested case hearing in PSD permit proceedings was not required by statute, regulation, or due process. After the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment were filed, the complaint and mandamus petition were amended to include the two individual plaintiffs, Ms. Thoms and Ms. Kalla.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">On March 2, 1990, the circuit court held a hearing on the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The trial court entered an order on March 6,1990, granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The court declared that a contested case hearing was not required by any law or by due process principles. The circuit court further held that the standing issue was moot because of its decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The Citizens Association and the individual plaintiffs then filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Before the case was heard in that court, Montgomery County, the Northeast Authority, and the Administration petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. The Citizens Association, Thoms, and Kalla filed a cross-petition. We granted both petitions and shall affirm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The issue in this case is whether the Air Management Administration, upon request, is required to hold a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing as defined by Maryland\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Code (1984, 1990 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-201 through 10-217 of the State Government Article, before ruling on an application for PSD approval.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">A \u201ccontested case\u201d is defined by the APA as follows: \u201c\u00a7 10-201.

That right must come from another source such as a statute, a regulation, or due process principles. <em>See Prince George\u2019s County v.

Moreover, the statute or regulation which grants the right to a hearing may negate the fact that the hearing is to be a \u201ccontested case\u201d or \u201cadjudicatory\u201d hearing. If the statutory or regulatory scheme does so, then the \u201ccontested case\u201d provisions of the APA are inapplicable. <em>See, e.g., Board v. Secretary of Personnel, </em>317 Md. 34, 562 A.2d 700 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">The Air Management Administration, as part of the Maryland Department of the Environment, constitutes a State agency to which the provisions of the APA are fully applicable. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10-201(b) and 10-202 of the State Government Article. Furthermore, approval of a PSD permit application constitutes the granting of a license as set forth in the definition of \u201ccontested case.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-20X(d) of the State Government Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The Citizens Association and the individual plaintiffs contend that \u201c[Code (1982, 1987 Repl.Vol.) ] Env\u2019t Art. \u00a7 2-404 and GOMAR 26.11.02.10C legally obligate [the Air Management Administration] to provide an opportunity for a hearing on an application for PSD approval. Thus, the PSD approval application for the incinerator fully meets the definition of a \u2018contested case\u2019 under the APA.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, as pointed out above, the source which gives a right to a hearing may negate the fact that the hearing is to be a \u201ccontested case\u201d or \u201cadjudicatory\u201d hearing. An examination of the entire statutory and regulatory scheme regarding the air quality permit process reveals that PSD approval is merely a preliminary or interlocutory requirement, prior to obtaining permission to actually construct and operate a potential source of pollution. Under COMAR 26.11.02.10C and the statutory permit scheme as a whole, the hearing required at the PSD permit stage is not a contested case hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>As the Citizens Association and the individual plaintiffs state, COMAR 26.11.02.10C does provide for a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d on an application for PSD approval.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The provisions of the regulation itself, however, imply that the hearing required is not to be a contested case hearing. <em>See Board v. Secretary of Personnel, supra, </em>317 Md. at 41-42, 562 A.2d at 703-704; <em>Eliason v. State Roads Comm., supra, </em>231 Md. at 260-261, 189 A.2d at 651. <em>See also Holmes v. Robinson, </em>84 Md.App. 144, 149-151, 578 A.2d 294, 296-297 (1990); <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 501, 583 A.2d 275 (1991); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number><em>Parlato v.

Specifically, COMAR 26.11.02.100(9) states: \u201cIn place of all of the procedures set forth in this regulation, the Department may use all or part of the procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 52.21, 1987 edition, to review the application for an approval for any PSD source.\u201d In turn, 40 C.F.R. Part 52.21(q) mandates that the procedures found in 40 C.F.R. Part 124 shall be used in processing PSD applications. Part 124 provides for non-trial type public notice and comment hearings in cases of PSD permit applications. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. Part 124.10 to 124.15. Furthermore, Part 124.71(c) states that PSD permits may never be subject to an \u201cevidentiary\u201d hearing. Thus, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has clearly demonstrated its intent that federal PSD permit proceedings be subject only to non-contested case type hearings. Maryland has shown a similar intent by providing that in place of its own procedures for PSD proceedings, the federal procedures, in which only non-trial type hearings are available, may be substituted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>The plaintiffs further contend that \u00a7 2-404 of the Environment Article obligates the Air Management Administration to hold a contested case hearing on PSD permit applications. Contrary to this contention, however, \u00a7 2-404, by its terms, is applicable only to proceedings involving <em>permits to construct </em>PSD sources. Section 2-404 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\">\u201c\u00a7 2-404. Ambient air quality control permits; notice; hearings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">\u201c(a) <em>Construction of certain </em>sources.\u2014The Department shall comply with the provisions in subsection (b) of this section before issuing a <em>permit to construct:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">(1) Any source which is required to obtain a permit to operate under regulations adopted under this subtitle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">(2) Any source which is subject to federal standards under 40 CFR Part 60 (New Source Performance Standards), 40 CFR Part 61 (National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants), or 40 CFR 52.21 (Prevention of Significant Deterioration).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">(b) <em>Hearing and notice of intended issuance of per</em>mit.\u2014Before issuing a permit to construct for any source listed in subsection (a) of this section, the Department shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">(1) Give public notice of the intended issuance of the permit; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">(2) Provide an opportunity for a public hearing in the county in which the proposed source will be located.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">The statutory provision for a hearing at the construction permit stage confirms the conclusion that a contested case hearing is not required at the PSD approval stage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under the air quality permit scheme as a whole, the State has chosen the construction permit approval stage as the point at which a hearing is required by law, thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>meeting the definition of a contested case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A hearing at the PSD approval stage is addressed only by COMAR 26.11.02.10C, which, by authorizing substitution of the federal procedures, negates the fact that the hearing required is a contested case hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">This interpretation of the statutory and regulatory scheme is reinforced by the fact that the construction permit stage is a more appropriate time for a contested case hearing than the PSD approval stage. Plaintiffs Thoms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>and Kalla allege that their property and health will suffer because of the operation of the proposed facility. The PSD approval, however, is simply a preliminary finding that the incinerator will not significantly harm the air quality in the Sugarloaf Mountain area generally. Although such approval is required in order to construct and operate the incinerator, the PSD approval itself does not authorize the construction or operation of the facility. As noted previously, Montgomery County and the Northeast Authority must engage in a permit application approval process at each of these stages also. Approval of the PSD permit has no immediate effect on any individual property rights, nor does it grant to the County the authority to begin constructing the proposed facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Conversely, the granting of a permit to construct would more immediately affect the individuals living around the proposed facility whose property might be harmed by the incinerator. The construction permit would create an immediate right in the County to begin building the facility. Clearly at this stage in the process, where actual harm may occur, a contested case hearing is more appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Montgomery County is required by law to provide for solid waste disposal, reduction, and recycling. In order to carry out its obligations, the County must have appropriate facilities. In turn, the County must demonstrate through the three stage air quality permit process that a facility such as the proposed incinerator will comply with the provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Allowing opponents the opportunity for full blown contested case hearings, with the accompanying right of judicial review, at each stage in the permit process would greatly interfere with a local government\u2019s ability to carry out its legal obligations and to protect the health and welfare of the citizens which it serves.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Therefore, the statutory and regulatory air quality permit scheme as a whole indicates that a PSD hearing is not a contested case hearing. <em>See State Dep\u2019t of A. &amp; Tax. v. Clark, </em>281 Md. 385, 392-396, 380 A.2d 28, 33-35 (1977) (entire statutory scheme for contesting tax assessments indicates that provisions allowing for challenges to assessments after the date of finality does not provide for a contested case).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED. APPELLANTS TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">ON MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION</p>\n<author id=\"Aij1\">ELDRIDGE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The defendant Air Management Administration has filed a motion for reconsideration, stating that this Court\u2019s opinion \u201cwent much further\u201d than was necessary and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWl\">\u201cdecided two matters not at issue: (a) that appellants are entitled to a \u2018contested case\u2019 at the \u2018permit to construct\u2019 stage, <em>and </em>(b) that \u2018contested case\u2019 hearings are required under various unrelated statutory schemes. * * * The State submits that this latter portion of the opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>particularly the sweeping conclusions about statutes cited in n. 12 ..., should be reconsidered or revised.\u201d (Motion for Reconsideration, p. 2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In addition to arguing that the above-described portion of the opinion was unnecessary and decided matters not at issue, the Air Management Administration asserts that the challenged portion of the opinion \u201cobscures, if it does not entirely eliminate, [the] fundamental distinction\u201d between \u201ccontested case hearings\u201d and \u201clegislative-type hearings\u201d involving \u201cissues of agency policy.\u201d Ibid. It is claimed that the opinion is \u201cinconsistent with prior decisions of this Court, <em>Montgomery County v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc., </em>280 Md. 686, 711-712 [376 A.2d 483, 494 (1977)], <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1067, [98 S.Ct. 1245, 55 L.Ed.2d 769] (1978); <em>Chevy Chase Village v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>249 Md. 334, 345 [239 A.2d 740, 744-745] (1968)....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at p. 3. Finally, the Air Management Administration argues that, if this Court should decline to delete the challenged portion of the opinion, the Court should \u201cdeclar[e] that the rule of this case\u2014that statutorily-labeled \u2018public hearings\u2019 may nevertheless be \u2018contested case\u2019 hearings\u2014is a rule of purely prospective application____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at p. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Subsequently, the defendants Montgomery County and the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority also filed motions for reconsideration, advancing essentially the same arguments set forth by the Air Management Administration. Memoranda on behalf of amici curiae in support of the motions for reconsideration have also been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">For the reasons delineated below, we disagree with all of the above-mentioned arguments and shall deny the motions for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">Preliminarily, we point out that the Air Management Administration mischaracterizes our opinion when it asserts that we decided \u201cthat appellants are entitled to a \u2018contested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>case\u2019 at the \u2018permit to construct\u2019 stage.... \u201d (Petition for Reconsideration, p. 2). We held that the \u201cconstruction permit approval stage [is] the point at which a hearing is required by law, thus meeting the [Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s] definition of a contested case.\u201d 323 Md. at 656-657, 594 A.2d at 1122. We decided nothing concerning the entitlement or standing <em>of these appellants </em>to obtain a contested case hearing at the construction permit stage. Moreover, we have made it clear in footnote 6 of the opinion that we are not reaching any issue of standing. Consequently, while one who has standing to be a party in a construction permit case before the agency is entitled to the opportunity for a contested case hearing at the construction permit stage, <em>see </em>Maryland Code (1984, 1990 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-205 of the State Government Article, we did not decide whether the appellants in the present case fall within such category.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">There is no merit in the defendants\u2019 arguments that the discussion in the opinion concerning the nature of the hearing at the construction permit stage was \u201cunnecessary\u201d and addressed a matter \u201cnot at issue.\u201d As the opinion points out, the plaintiffs in their brief specifically relied upon the statutory provision for a hearing set forth in Code (1982, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1990 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 2-404 of the Environment Article, which provides for a hearing at the construction permit stage. The defendant Air Management Administration in its brief devoted ten pages to the nature of the hearing at the construction permit stage provided for by \u00a7 2-404. In addition, the relationship between the statutory provision for a hearing at the construction permit stage, and the COMAR provision for a hearing at the PSD approval stage, was thoroughly explored at the oral argument before this Court. Furthermore, our determination that there was an opportunity for a contested case hearing at the construction permit stage was part of the reasoning underlying our conclusion that a contested case hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>not required at the PSD approval stage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Similarly, there is no merit in the defendants\u2019 arguments that the discussion in footnote 12 of the opinion, relating to the word \u201cpublic\u201d in statutory provisions for hearings, was unnecessary and unrelated to a matter at issue. A major argument by the defendants in this case was that the adjective \u201cpublic\u201d before the word \u201chearing,\u201d both in the regulation and in \u00a7 2-404 of the Environment Article, meant that the hearing was not a contested case hearing. The entire discussion in footnote 12 was part of the Court\u2019s response to this argument. In fact, while asserting in their motions for reconsideration that the discussion in footnote 12 is unnecessary and relates to matters not at issue, the defendants elsewhere in their motions for reconsideration continue to argue that the word \u201cpublic\u201d in a statutory provision for a hearing means that the hearing is \u201cinformational, not adjudicatory.\u201d (Air Management Administration\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration, p. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">In arguing that our opinion \u201cobscures\u201d or \u201celiminate[s]\u201d the distinction between contested case hearings and \u201cinformational\u201d or \u201clegislative type\u201d hearings involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>\u201cissues of agency policy\u201d (Air Management Administration\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration, p. 2), the defendants in their motions overlook the contested case provisions of the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7\u00a7 10-201 through 10-216 of the State Government Article. They do not even cite the statute. Instead, their reliance is upon cases not involving the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act. Moreover, their only arguments as to why the hearing provided for in \u00a7 2-404 of the Environment Article, and the hearings referred to in footnote 12, are not contested case hearings are that the word \u201cpublic\u201d is used in the statutes providing for hearings and that the administrative practice has not been to treat the hearings as contested case hearings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Under Maryland administrative law, where a statute, regulation or due process principles provide that a particular administrative function be done after an agency hearing, it is the definition in the Administrative Procedure Act, and not the statute dealing with the underlying administrative function, which ordinarily determines whether the hearing is a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing. <em>Donocam Assoc. v. Wash. Sub. San. Comm\u2019n, </em>302 Md. 501, 512, 489 A.2d 26, 31 (1985). In other words, where a statute such as \u00a7 2-404 of the Environment Article requires an opportunity for an agency hearing prior to the issuance of a construction permit, the question whether such hearing is a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing ordinarily depends upon applying the definition of \u201ccontested case\u201d in the Administrative Procedure Act to the agency activity, and not upon whether \u00a7 2-404 uses language indicating that the hearing is \u201cadjudicatory.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Otherwise, the definition of contested case in the Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 10-201(e) of the State Government Article, would be superfluous. In this regard, the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act differs from the administrative procedure acts in some other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The position of the defendants seems to be that the definition of \u201ccontested case\u201d in the Administrative Procedure Act should be ignored, and that the sole issue is whether an application for a construction permit under \u00a7 2-404 of the Environment Article is \u201clegislative-type\u201d action or \u201cadjudicatory\u201d action. A similar argument was flatly rejected by this Court in <em>Donocam Assoc. v. Wash. </em>Sub. <em>San. Comm\u2019n, </em>supra, 302 Md. 501, 489 A.2d 26. The issue in <em>Donocam </em>was whether a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by the Commission, prior to levying front-foot benefit charges on Donocam Associates' land, was a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing so that the Commission\u2019s decision was subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commission, like the defendants in the case at bar, \u201cargued ... that the setting of front-foot benefit charges is a legislative action and that such action is not reviewable as a contested case.\u201d 302 Md. at 512, 489 A.2d at 31. We disagreed with this position, stating that the alleged \u201clegislative\u201d nature of the \u201c 'underlying function involved\u2019 \u201d of setting front-foot benefit charges is not what determines whether a matter is a \u201ccontested case.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This Court went on to quote in part and apply the definition of \u201ccontested case\u201d which was then set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (302 Md. at 512, 489 A.2d at 31-32):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>\u201cIt is conceded, as indeed it must be, that the statute under which these assessments were made requires a hearing. As we have already noted, the Commission is an agency within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. There is no dispute relative to the fact that Donocam Associates were aggrieved- -their property has had assessments placed on it which work out to in excess of one-quarter of a million dollars, enough to aggrieve any property owner. The question becomes then whether \u2018the legal rights, duties, statutory entitlements, or privileges\u2019 of Donocam and persons similarly situated are required by law to be determined after an agency hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\u201cAs we see it the agency is to determine rights and duties at this hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\"><em>See also Newp.

Section 2-404 requires that, before issuing a permit to construct, the Department of the Environment shall, <em>inter alia, </em>provide an opportunity for a hearing in the county where the particular source is to be located. Section 2-404, therefore, is a statute requiring an agency hearing before the agency may grant a permit to construct a specific facility at a specific location. Nothing in this scheme expressly or by implication negates a contested case hearing. <em>Cf., Board v. Secretary of Personnel, </em>317 Md. 34, 562 A.2d 700 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">In light of the definition of \u201ccontested case\u201d in the Administrative Procedure Act, we reaffirm our earlier conclusion that the hearing on a permit application provided for by \u00a7 2-404 of the Environment Article is a contested case hearing. Prior to July 1, 1977, a \u201ccontested case\u201d for purposes of the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act was \u201ca proceeding before an agency in which the legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties are required by law or constitutional right to be determined after an agency hearing.\u201d Code (1957, 1978 Repl.Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7 244(c). Even under this language, we took the position that where a hearing was provided for in connection with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>permit or license, the proceeding was a \u201ccontested case.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Blumberg, </em>288 Md. 275, 294-296, 418 A.2d 1155, 1166-1167 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1083, 101 S.Ct. 869, 66 L.Ed.2d 808 (1981) (water and sewer permits); <em>Kaufman v.

Among the changes brought about by Ch. 884 was the addition of new \u00a7 250A to Art. 41, which stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">\u201c(a) The provisions of this act concerning contested cases apply when the grant, denial, or renewal of a license is required by law or constitutional right to be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Ch. 884 also added new \u00a7\u00a7 244(d) and (e) to Art. 41, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiN\">\u201c(d) <em>\u2018License\u2019 </em>includes the whole or part of any agency permit, certificate, approval, registration, charter, or sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>ilar form of permission required by law, but it does not include a license required solely for revenue purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\">\u201c(e) <em>\u2018Licensing\u2019 </em>includes the agency process respecting the grant, denial, renewal, revocation, suspension, annulment, withdrawal, or amendment of a license.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The title to Ch. 884 makes it clear that one of the purposes of the statute was to provide that \u201ccertain procedures and other requirements must be met when a license is involved----\u201d The substance of the above-quoted provisions is now contained in \u00a7\u00a7 10-201(c) and (d) of the State Government Article.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Section 2-404 of the Environment Article is a statute which requires the opportunity for a hearing prior to the grant of a permit. The proceeding under \u00a7 2-404, therefore, is a \u201ccontested case\u201d under the clear language of the Administrative Procedure Act and the legislative purpose underlying that language.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">As previously indicated, the defendants also assert that our opinion in the instant case is inconsistent with the opinions in <em>Mont. Co. v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, supra, </em>280 Md. at 711-712, 376 A.2d at 497, and <em>Chevy Chase Village </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>v. Board of Appeals, supra, </em>249 Md. at 345, 239 A.2d at 744-745. This argument is devoid of merit. Neither the <em>Woodward &amp; Lothrop </em>case nor the <em>Chevy Chase </em>case involved the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act. The governmental agencies there involved were not subject to the Act. Moreover, the nature of the administrative proceedings in those cases was quite different from a proceeding under \u00a7 2-404 of the Environment Article or from proceedings under the statutes referred to in footnote 12 of our opinion in the instant case. <em>Woodward &amp; Lothrop </em>involved comprehensive rezoning, under which the County Council \u201cdoes not consider and determine adjudicative facts concerning particular parties\u201d and \u201cits focus is not on a single piece of property,\u201d <em>Mont. Co. v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, supra, </em>280 Md. at 712-713, 376 A.2d at 498. The <em>Chevy Chase </em>case was also related to local zoning, and, with regard t\u00f3 the particular administrative proceeding involved, there was no statutory right to a hearing. <em>Chevy Chase Village v. Board, supra, </em>249 Md. at 344, 239 A.2d at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">The portions of the <em>Woodward &amp; Lothrop </em>and <em>Chevy Chase </em>opinions which, according to the defendants, are contrary to our opinion in the case at bar, contain general discussions of the difference between \u201cinformational\u201d or \u201clegislative-type\u201d proceedings on the one hand and \u201cadjudicatory\u201d or \u201ccontested case\u201d proceedings on the other. Where, however, an administrative proceeding is subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, where it is clearly a contested case within the meaning of that Act, and where the statutory scheme granting the right to a hearing does not negate the contested case nature of the proceeding, it is not particularly relevant that the administrative proceeding might, under general principles, be categorized as \u201clegislative\u201d in nature. <em>Donocam Assoc. v. Wash. Sub. San. Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>302 Md. at 512, 489 A.2d at 31-32; <em>Newp. Nat. Bank v. Prov. Inst. For Savings, supra, </em>101 R.I. at 618-620, 226 A.2d at 140-141.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Moreover, even if a proceeding under \u00a7 2-404 of the Environment Article were not subject to the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, and if the nature of the proceeding were governed by the general principles set forth in the <em>Woodward &amp; Lothrop </em>case, one having standing to be a party to the \u00a7 2-404 proceeding would still be entitled to the opportunity for an adjudicatory hearing. An application for a permit is generally treated \u201cas adjudication.\u201d 2 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>433 (2d ed. 1979). Where the opportunity for a hearing is provided for in connection with an application for a permit, an adjudicatory or contested case hearing is usually required. 2 F. Cooper, <em>State Administrative Law </em>484-490 (1965). Unlike the comprehensive rezoning involved in the <em>Woodward &amp; Lothrop </em>case, a proceeding under \u00a7 2-404 of the Environment Article involves an application for a permit by a specific person or entity to construct a particular facility at a specified location. At issue may be the effect on air quality of that facility at that location. In the <em>Woodward &amp; Lothrop </em>case, Chief Judge Murphy for the Court pointed out that \u201c[t]he difference between adjudicative and legislative facts is not easily drawn____\u201d 280 Md. at 711-712, 376 A.2d at 497. The Court, quoting from Professor Davis\u2019s treatise, went on (280 Md. at 712, 376 A.2d at 497):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">\u201clegislative facts \u2018do not usually concern the immediate parties but are general facts which help the tribunal decide questions of law and policy and discretion.\u2019 Davis, <em>Treatise, </em>\u00a7 7.02. The difference, broadly speaking, involves whether the decision is to be made on individual or general grounds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Under these general principles, a proceeding under \u00a7 2-404 would be \u201cadjudicative\u201d and not \u201clegislative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Footnote 12 of our opinion in this case noted and rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that whenever a statute described an administrative hearing as \u201cpublic,\u201d the hearing was informational and not a contested case hearing. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>course of our discussion in footnote 12, we referred to numerous statutory provisions for \u201cpublic\u201d hearings which, under the statutory schemes, are clearly contested case hearings. The defendants now, in addition to asserting that the entire footnote 12 was unnecessary, complain about our characterizing three particular statutory schemes as providing for contested case hearings. They are as follows: (1) Code (1974, 1989 Repl.VoL, 1990 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 6-501 through 6-511 of the Natural Resources Article, providing for an application for a permit to construct a facility in the coastal area; (2) \u00a7\u00a7 9-306 through 9-308 of the Natural Resources Article, providing for an application for a permit to conduct certain activity on private wetlands; and (3) Code (1977, 1990 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 5-304 through 5-305 and 5-210 of the Transportation Article, providing for an application for a license to operate an airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">All three of these statutory schemes deal with an application for a permit to conduct a specified activity at a particular location, and all three provide for the opportunity for a \u201cpublic\u201d hearing on the application. Consequently, for the reasons previously set forth, the administrative proceedings would certainly seem to be adjudicatory. What makes it clear, however, that the General Assembly did not intend that these \u201cpublic\u201d hearings be \u201cinformational\u201d or \u201clegislative-type\u201d hearings are the express provisions for judicial review in all three statutory schemes.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Thus, the administrative decision after the \u201cpublic\u201d hearing on an application for an airport license under \u00a7\u00a7 5-305 and 5-210 of the Transportation Article is subject to judicial review \u201cas provided by the Administrative Procedure Act\u201d (\u00a7 5-210(c)). Of course, judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act is for contested cases only.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Policy determinations after \u201cinformational\u201d hearings in other cases are not subject to judicial review under that Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>Boyds Civic Ass\u2019n v. Montgomery County, </em>309 Md. 683, 702-704, 526 A.2d 598, 608-609 (1987); <em>Donocam Assoc. v. Wash. Sub. San.

Although the statute provides for de novo judicial review, in <em>Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. v. Linchester, </em>274 Md. 211, 224-225, 228-229, 334 A.2d 514, 523-525 (1975), we held that, for constitutional reasons, judicial review under \u00a7 9-308 would be that applicable to contested cases, namely whether the administrative decision was arbitrary, capricious or unsupported by substantial evidence in light of the administrative record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Section 6-509 of the Natural Resources Article provides \u201cfor judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s action on any application\u201d for a permit to construct a facility in the coastal area. Judicial review is in the circuit court for the county where the facility is to be located (\u00a7 6-509(a)), and the action may be brought by \u201can aggrieved party\u201d or by certain government officials (\u00a7 6-509(b)). As the Department of Natural Resources is an agency subject to the Administrative Procedure Act (\u00a7 10-202 of the State Government Article), and as \u00a7 6-509 of the Natural Resources Article does not indicate otherwise, presumably judicial review under \u00a7 6-509 is in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. Such judicial review, as previously pointed out, is for \u201ccontested cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Even in actions not under the Administrative Procedure Act, administrative policy determinations after \u201cinformational\u201d hearings are not subject to judicial review in the usual sense of that term. Instead, any court review would ordinarily be limited to determining whether the agency acted constitutionally, <em>Storch v. Zoning Bd. of Howard Co., </em>267 Md. 476, 487, 298 A.2d 8, 14 (1972); <em>Crown Central v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>City of Baltimore, </em>258 Md. 82, 89-90, 265 A.2d 192, 196-197 (1970); <em>M. &amp; C.C. of Balt. v.

They, along with the other administrative proceedings referred to in footnote 12 of our opinion, are examples of the General Assembly\u2019s describing contested case hearings as \u201cpublic\u201d hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The defendants\u2019 last argument in their motions for reconsideration is that the \u201crule\u201d that \u201cstatutorily-labeled \u2018public hearings\u2019 may nevertheless be \u2018contested case\u2019 hearings\u201d should be \u201ca rule of purely prospective application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">In another case where a similar request was made in a motion for reconsideration, we responded as follows <em>(Houghton v.

Under the pertinent statutes, the construction permit stage is the only stage at which a statutory right to a hearing is provided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\">. The defendants argue that because \u00a7 2-404 provides for a \"public\" hearing, the hearing at the construction permit stage is also not a contested case hearing. This argument ignores many prior decisions of this Court which have treated the hearing so described as a contested case hearing. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md.Comm'n on <em>Human Rel. v. Beth. Steel, </em>295 Md. 586, 457 A.2d 1146 (1983) (Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7 11, provided for a \"public hearing\u201d); <em>Holy Cross Hasp. v. Health Services, </em>283 Md. 677, 393 A.2d 181 (1978) (Code (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol., 1978 Cum.Supp.), Art. 43, \u00a7 568M(2), authorized agency to hold \"public hearings\u201d). Numerous other statutory provisions provide for \"public\u201d hearings which, under the statutory schemes, are clearly contested case hearings. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code (1984, 1990 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 5-580 of the Family Law Article; Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol., 1990 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 6-507 to 6-509 of the Natural Resources Article; Code (1974, 1990 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 9-306 to 9-308 of the Natural Resources Article; Code (1977, 1990 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 5-210, 5-305 of the Transportation Article. Moreover, when the Legislature has desired to make clear that the \"public\u201d hearing provided by statute is not a contested case hearing, it has done so. <em>See </em>Code (1974, 1990 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 8-806 of the Natural Resources Article (the statutory section grants the right to a public <em>\u201cinformational\u201d </em>hearing to interested persons, and the right to a contested case hearing to persons specifically aggrieved).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The definition of a \u201ccontested case\u201d in the APA is not at all dependent upon whether the proceedings are \"public.\u201d A \"contested case\u201d proceeding ordinarily is not required by law to be open to the general public. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10-501(h) and 10\u2014503(3)(iii) of the State Government Article. On the other hand, the public policy of the State generally favors public hearings. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 10-502 of the State Government Article; <em>City of College Park v. Cotter, </em>309 Md. 573, 581-582, 525 A.2d 1059, 1062-1063 (1987); <em>Carroll Co. Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Educ., </em>294 Md. 144, 147, 448 A.2d 345, 347 (1982). In our view, when the General Assembly by statute provides that a particular type of hearing be \"public,\u201d it is simply mandating, in accordance with the general policy of the State, that the hearing be open to the public. The Legislature is not determining, by use or omission of the word \"public,\u201d whether the hearing is a contested case hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\">.

It is unclear under Maryland law to what extent principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel apply to administrative decisions. <em>See White v.

While the defendant Air Management Administration now asserts in its motion for reconsideration that the discussion in our opinion relating to the \u00a7 2-404 hearing at the construction permit stage was unnecessary and should be deleted from the opinion, the Air Management Administration earlier had a different point of view. It argued in its brief before this Court as follows (Brief of Air Management Administration, p. 12):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">\u201cBy its express terms, \u00a7 2-404 applies only to permits to construct. Brief of Appellants at 24. However, an application for a permit to construct has not yet been submitted for the proposed RRF. It, therefore, follows that \u00a7 2-404 simply cannot afford Appellants with the right to the adjudicatory hearing that they seek.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">\"As explained in the next section, however, determining what type of public hearing is required by \u00a7 2-404 is crucial to determining what type of public hearing is required by the air quality control regulations that do pertain to PSD. The State, therefore, urges the court to decide whether \u00a7 2-404 affords environmental organizations or property owners with the right to an adjudicatory hearing before an air quality permit to construct is issued.\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b717-5\">.

Although the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s definition of \u201ccontested case\u201d is not mentioned in the defendants\u2019 motions for reconsideration, the defendants\u2019 earlier briefs relied on Professor Davis's criticism of the somewhat similar definition of \"contested case\u201d set forth in the Model State Administrative Procedure Act recommended by the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. Professor Davis stated (1 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>39 (2d ed. 1978)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-10\">\"Section 1(2) defines \u2018contested case\u2019 to include a proceeding to determine legal rights \u2018required by law to be determined by the agency after an opportunity for hearing.\u2019 Yet \u00a7 3(2) requires \u2018oral hearing\u2019 for making rules, whenever requested by 25 persons. Does a rulemaking proceeding become a 'contested case\u2019 whenever an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>oral hearing is required? The answer is yes if the literal words are followed. Yet this makes nonsense of the definitions.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Professor Davis pointed out that the legislatures of some states have modified the definition of \"contested case\u201d to avoid this difficulty. <em>See abo </em>footnote 3, <em>supra. </em>While the Maryland General Assembly has not modified this aspect of the definition, this Court has held, as explained in our opinion in this case, that the statute or regulation which grants the opportunity for a hearing may negate the fact that the hearing is to be a \"contested case\u201d hearing. Our holding in this regard should obviate the problem posed by Professor Davis. Nevertheless, the statute or regulation which provides for a hearing should not be construed to override the definition in the Administrative Procedure Act unless the statute or regulation does so expressly or by clear implication. To do otherwise would be to ignore the definition in the Administrative Procedure Act and treat \u00a7 10-201(c) as surplus-age.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b721-7\">. In some jurisdictions with administrative procedure acts containing a definition of \"contested case\u201d similar to that in the pre-1978 Maryland statute, courts have indicated that hearings on applications for certain types of permits or licenses are informational and not contested case hearings. <em>See Public Interest v.
