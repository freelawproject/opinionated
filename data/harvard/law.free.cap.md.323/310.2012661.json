Md.Code (1989 Repl.Vol.), sec. 12-202 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article; <em>Williams v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>292 Md. 201, 438 A.2d 1301 (1981); <em>Moss v. Director, </em>279 Md. 561, 369 A.2d 1011 (1977); <em>Jourdan v. State, </em>275 Md. 495, 341 A.2d 388 (1975). The petition for certiorari is thus hereby denied for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Counsel for the petitioner is charged with knowledge that the Court is without jurisdiction in this case, and it is incumbent upon counsel to so advise the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">It is further incumbent upon counsel for the petitioner to fully reimburse the petitioner for the amount of any fee paid to counsel for the filing of this petition for a writ of certiorari, including the amount of this Court\u2019s filing fee, and to promptly advise the Court of compliance with this Order unless reasons to the contrary be shown by counsel not later than 22nd day of August, 1991.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
