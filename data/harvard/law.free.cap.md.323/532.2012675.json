A jury in the Circuit Court for Allegany County found Duckworth guilty of child abuse and battery. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion. We granted Duckworth's petition for certiorari to consider two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u201c1. Did the trial court err when it admitted evidence of a prior accidental shooting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Was the evidence sufficient to sustain Petitioner\u2019s convictions?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The shooting charged in the indictment occurred on January 28, 1988. Miranda Bergdoll (Mandy), age three years and eight months, was in her mother\u2019s apartment on Beall Street in Cumberland. Mandy\u2019s mother, Susan Ann Berg-doll (Bergdoll), was at work. Mandy\u2019s father was in prison. Mandy was in the care of Duckworth, who also resided there and whom Bergdoll married by the time of trial. There were no other persons in the apartment when the shooting occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The Bergdoll apartment consisted of the entire second floor of a small, two-story building. The front door of the apartment was at the bottom of the stairs which accessed the second floor hallway. Four rooms opened off the hall. Progressing from rear to front they were a kitchen in the rear, bedroom one, bedroom two, and a bathroom in the front.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Based upon a lengthy statement in question and answer form which Duckworth gave to the police, and which was audio recorded and transcribed, the jury could have found the following facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Duckworth was standing in the kitchen while running water for his bath in the bathroom. For no reason that he could articulate, Duckworth reached to a shelf above the refrigerator and took down a holstered Smith and Wesson, .44-caliber, magnum revolver. He said that \u201c \u2018the gun was loaded, and I forgot about it.\u2019 \u201d He took the weapon out of the holster. While holding the holster in one hand and the pistol in the other, he attempted to release the cylinder, but the revolver would not open. While Duckworth held the gun Mandy said, \u201c \u2018 \u201cDon\u2019t shoot me.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Duckworth said, \u201c \u2018 \u201cMandy, I\u2019m not going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>shoot you.\u201d \u2019 \u201d At that point Duckworth asked Mandy to turn the water off in the bathroom. She started down the hall, turned around, and seemed about to cry. Duckworth had his thumb on the hammer of the pistol. Mandy asked if Duckworth wanted her to turn the light on. Duckworth \u201c \u2018hollered at her for turning all the lights on, \u2018cause her mother bitches because we got to pay the bill.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Mandy said, \u201c \u2018 \u201cDon\u2019t shoot me,\u201d \u2019 \u201d and Duckworth said, \u201c \u2018 \u201cHoney, I won\u2019t shoot you,\u201d \u2019 \u201d when Duckworth \u201c \u2018let go [of the hammer], and the gun went off.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The handgun was loaded with bird shot in .44-caliber casing. Mandy was approximately ten feet away, standing between the doors to the bedrooms. She was hit by over fifty pellets of shot in the chest, neck, right arm, and some inside of the mouth. Some of the pellets lodged in the heart muscle. Mandy was standing between bedroom one and bedroom two, nearer bedroom two. Duckworth was standing in the kitchen. In the wall between where Mandy was standing and the frame of the doorway of bedroom one twenty-seven other pellets were clustered in an area approximately fifteen inches wide extending from a low point of fourteen inches to a high point of twenty-five inches above the floor. There were only eight pellets imbedded in the frame of the doorway to bedroom two.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Duckworth rushed Mandy to a hospital in Cumberland. Because of the injury to the heart muscle, Mandy was transferred to a hospital in the District of Columbia. She eventually made a complete recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">An expert from the Federal Bureau of Investigation who examined the handgun testified for the State. The weapon could be fired in single or double action modes. In the double action mode, pulling the trigger causes the hammer to rise, subsequently to release, and to fire the cartridge. This mode of firing requires 11.5 pounds of pressure on the trigger. In the single action mode, used for target shooting, the hammer is first cocked, and then the trigger pulled. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The single action mode of firing requires 3.25 pounds of pressure on the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The expert further testified that one of the safety features of the weapon is a hammer block which prevents the hammer from striking the cartridge unless the trigger is pulled. The witness tested that safety feature by striking the end of the hammer spur, using a leather mallet with a considerable amount of force, while the hammer was in the cocked position. The witness was able to cause the weapon to fire on three out of thirteen attempts with hammer blows. At that point a blow broke the hammer spur. In the witness\u2019s opinion it was not possible for the weapon to go off, without pulling the trigger, when the hammer was cocked, \u201cabsent some unusual circumstances,\u201d similar to those described in his test.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">At the time of the January 28, 1988, incident Duckworth, Bergdoll, and a house guest had four guns in the apartment, the .44-caliber magnum handgun, a Marlin, .22-caliber, scope rifle, a black powder pistol, and an old, Ruger, black powder, muzzle loader. Duckworth and the house guest had been out target shooting together a few days before the incident. The day of the incident, Duckworth showed Bergdoll how to load and use the .44-caliber handgun for her own self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">At a point some forty pages into Ms statement to the police, Duckworth was asked again to describe the shooting.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1E\">\u201c \u2018Q ... Just take your time and tell me what happened. Get it off your chest.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">\u201c \u2018A She was scared of me.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">\u201c \u2018Q Okay. I realize that.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">\u201c \u2018A And she\u2019s scared of it. And she\u2019s like, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot me.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI ain\u2019t going to shoot you.\u201d And she said ... \u201cYou just said....\u201d She just said, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot me.\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to shoot you.\u201d And she was trying to cry. And I said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t quit crying, IT1 shoot you.\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-11\">\u201c \u2018Q Okay.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\u201c \u2018A And I was standing there with it like that in my hand. I told you I had the holster in my left hand and the pistol was in my right hand____\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201c \u2018Q And you was thinking the gun was unloaded?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">\u201c\u2018A Right.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">\u201c \u2018Q And that\u2019s when the damn thing went off?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">\u201c \u2018A Right. Officer Abe, there\u2019s no way in hell I ... \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">\u201c \u2018Q [Duckworth], I believe that you didn\u2019t mean to shoot the girl. Do you understand what [Mandy] thinks?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">\u201c \u2018A She thinks I just said, \u201cHey, Mandy, you\u2019re bad and I\u2019m going to shoot you.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">Mandy\u2019s mother testified in the defense case. On cross-examination by the State, the following transpired which gave rise to the first issue presented by Duckworth in his certiorari petition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\">\u201cQ Mrs. Duckworth, had there ever been any other accidents involving [Duckworth] and your daughter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-13\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-14\">\u201cA No sir. Except for the shooting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-15\">\u201cQ Except for this shooting, there had never been another accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-16\">\u201cA Between ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-17\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection. She asked and answered the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-18\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-19\">\u201cQ Approximately a week before, wasn\u2019t there an incident with a BB gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-20\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-21\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-22\">\u201cA Is that answer or don\u2019t answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-23\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-24\">\u201cA Yeah. I was there. The BB hit the chair and then it hit her. He didn\u2019t stand there and hit her with it first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-25\">\u201cQ You were there in the room when it happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-26\">\u201cA I was in the bathroom. But if you would like to go see my kitchen chair, I\u2019ll take you over and show you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u201cQ Ma\u2019am, the question was, were you in the room when it happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">\u201cA I was in the bathroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The jury found Duckworth not guilty of assault with intent to maim and of use of a handgun in a crime of violence, but the jury found Duckworth guilty of child abuse and of battery. The trial court merged the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Duckworth\u2019s position is that \u201cthe ultimate issue in the case is whether the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that [Duckworth] intentionally shot Miranda Bergdoll; if the shooting was accidental, [Duckworth] did not commit a crime.\u201d He submits that \u201cwhether the State proved intent beyond a reasonable doubt resolves to whether the expert\u2019s testimony excluded any reasonable possibility other than [Duckworth\u2019s] intentionally pulling the trigger.\u201d Brief of Petitioner at 11-12. Within that framework, Duckworth argues that \u201c[w]hether [Duckworth] had been involved in prior accidents was irrelevant to whether he <em>deliberately </em>shot Miranda Bergdoll,\u201d and thus, Bergdoll\u2019s testimony, quoted above, was inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>at 7. We reject the premise of this analysis, because it ignores the role of criminal negligence in criminal battery and in child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">On the charge of battery, the trial court instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">\u201cin order to convict the Defendant of battery, the State must prove the following elements: that the Defendant caused physical contact or harm to the victim; that the contact was the result of an intentional and reckless act of the Defendant and was not accidental, and that the contact was not legally justified.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Under the evidence presented in the instant matter, the jury could have found that Duckworth pointed the revolver at Mandy. The physical evidence clearly demonstrates that the weapon was pointing directly at Mandy when it fired. There is direct evidence in Duckworth\u2019s statement that Mandy was pleading with Duckworth not to shoot her and that he threatened to shoot her if she did not stop crying. From this the jury could infer that Duckworth intentionally pointed the handgun at Mandy while he was threatening to shoot her.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">That is precisely how the State argued to the jury. Emphasizing the recklessness element of an alternative method of proving battery, the State argued: \u201cAgain ... is it reckless to point a gun, whether or not you believe it loaded or unloaded, at anyone, little [sic] alone a three year old infant[?]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">\u201cIn most jurisdictions today battery may be committed by conduct amounting to criminal negligence which legally causes an injury.\u201d W. LaFave <em>&amp; </em>A. Scott, <em>Handbook on Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 81, at 605 (1972) (footnote omitted). And <em>see </em>2 C. Torc\u00eda, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 178, at 296 (14th ed. 1979) (\u201c[A] criminal battery is committed, in accordance with the prevailing view ... if the contact was the result of [the defendant\u2019s] recklessness or criminal negligence. The inclusion of the latter mental state is sound and complements logically the mental state which supports manslaughter liability.\u201d); R. Perkins &amp; R. Boyce, <em>Criminal </em>Law, at 157 (3d ed. 1982) (\u201cFor battery, as for manslaughter, more is required than ordinary negligence sufficient to support a civil action. But the rule is now well established that conviction of battery can be supported by harm to the person resulting from criminal negligence.\u201d (Footnotes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>omitted)); Clark &amp; Marshall, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Crimes </em>\u00a7 5.09, at 294 (M. Barnes 7th ed. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">A leading ease in the area of criminal negligence is <em>Commonwealth v. Hawkins, </em>157 Mass. 551, 32 N.E. 862 (1893), where the defendant was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon. Persons had been annoying the defendant Hawkins by ringing his doorbell and insulting him when he came to the door. He went into the street with a pistol, in a thickly settled area of Fall River, at night, looked up and down the street, saw no one, and fired the pistol, pointing it toward the ground, to let the persons who had been annoying him know that he had a pistol, and in order to deter them from further annoying him. The shot apparently ricocheted and struck one Mary A. Powers who was standing over 200 feet away. In sustaining the conviction the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">\u201cIt is a general rule in criminal proceedings at common law that the defendant cannot be convicted unless a criminal intent is shown, but it is not necessary that he should have intended the particular wrong which resulted from his act____ So, in cases of homicide, the rule is well established, that one who wantonly, or in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, does that which results in the death of a human being, is guilty of manslaughter, although he did not contemplate such a result. His gross negligence in exposing another to a personal injury by intentionally doing the act makes his intention criminal, and supplies all the intent which the law requires to make him responsible for the consequences. This principle is equally applicable to other cases where a personal injury results from a wanton or reckless act which is likely to do bodily harm, or from any gross negligence which causes the danger. In the case at bar, if Mary A. Powers had died from the pistol shot, the defendant, on the facts found by the jury, would have been guilty of manslaughter. As she survived the injury, the same principle now requires a conviction of assault and battery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 553, 32 N.E. at 863 (citation omitted). And <em>see Bentley v. Commonwealth, </em>354 S.W.2d 495, 496 (Ky.1962) (\u201cWe do not find that negligent wounding, as such, was a crime at common law unless the defendant\u2019s conduct was so wanton and in disregard of the probable consequences to others that it was considered to be willful, in which event it was an assault and battery.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Excluding those situations in which one who is holding a loaded firearm might be, or become, justified in using it as a weapon, the act of pointing a firearm at a nearby human being, without being certain that the weapon will not discharge, generally is sufficiently reckless to support a conviction for voluntary manslaughter where the unintended discharge of the weapon results in death. Similarly, here, where the discharge of the weapon resulted in a wounding short of death, the same degree of recklessness supports the battery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In <em>Rampton\u2019s Case, </em>Kelyng J. 41, 84 Eng. Rep. 1073 (1664), Rampton, a hackney coachman,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201cfound a soldier\u2019s pistol in the street, and when he came home he shewed to his master, and they took the gun-stick and put it into the pistol, and it went down into the mussel of the pistol, by which they thought it was not charged, and his wife standing before him, he pulled up the cock and the pistol went off\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAl\">killing Rampton\u2019s wife. This was held to be manslaughter and not \u201cmisadventure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Chief Judge Murphy, writing for the Court of Special Appeals, dealt with circumstances analogous to those before us in <em>Mills v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 196, 282 A.2d 147 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>264 Md. 750 (1972). The defendant and four other teenage males, while attending a dance, went into a small rest room to share a bottle of liquor. Mills, who was carrying a .22-caliber automatic pistol, displayed it and may have been attempting to load or unload it. While the pistol was pointing at one Hunter, the latter slapped or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>pushed it away from him. The weapon fell to the floor, discharged, and killed one of the other youths. The Court of Special Appeals sustained Mills\u2019s conviction of involuntary manslaughter. The court reasoned that \u201cthe introduction of the loaded weapon into a small room among five youths drinking liquor from a bottle; and the handling of the weapon by a person unfamiliar with its operation, including its loading and unloading, is plainly a grossly negligent act dangerous to life and Hunter\u2019s reaction when the gun was pointed in his direction was wholly predictable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202, 282 A.2d at 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In <em>People v. Andersch, </em>107 Ill.App.3d 810, 63 IIl.Dec. 551, 438 N.E.2d 482 (1982), the defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for a shooting death that occurred after the defendant pointed his rifle at a group of unruly persons in the corridor of the Y.M.C.A. where he lived. The defendant argued that he did not realize the rifle was loaded. The court said that \u201c[i]t is settled that pointing a loaded weapon at another constitutes recklessness since it is a gross deviation from the standard of care exercised by a reasonable person,\u201d and that \u201cthe trier of fact could have properly determined that the defendant acted recklessly in not checking the condition of the weapon prior to the incident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818, 63 IIl.Dec. at 557, 438 N.E.2d at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">To the same effect <em>see Goffer v. State, </em>430 So.2d 896 (Ala.Crim.App.1983); <em>Slay v. State, </em>508 So.2d 1268 (Fla.App.1987); <em>Navarro v. State, </em>433 So.2d 1011 (Fla.App.1983); <em>People v. Schwartz, </em>64 Ill.App.3d 989, 21 IIl.Dec. 765, 382 N.E.2d 59 (1978); <em>People v. Carlton, </em>26 Ill.App.3d 995, 326 N.E.2d 100 (1975); <em>State v. Hardie, </em>47 Iowa 647, 29 Am. Rep. 496 (1878); <em>State v. Barberousse, </em>458 So.2d 569 (La.App.1984), aff'<em>d, </em>480 So.2d 273 (1986); <em>Hunter v. State, </em>647 S.W.2d 657 (Tex.Crim.App.1983); <em>Giles v. State, </em>617 S.W.2d 690 (Tex.Crim.App.1981). And <em>see </em>Annotations, <em>Homicide by Wanton or Reckless Use of Firearm Without Express Intent to Inflict Injury, </em>5 A.L.R. 603, 610-19 (1920); 23 A.L.R. 1554, 1556-57 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Thus, the State\u2019s theory of the case on the battery charge was legally sound, namely, that Duckworth criminally wounded Mandy by recklessly handling a firearm. It follows that the testimony by Mandy\u2019s mother concerning an accidental shooting with a BB gun approximately one week prior to the battery was clearly relevant. Mandy was struck by a BB on the earlier occasion\u2014precisely where, we do not know. The jurors might well reason that one in the position of Duckworth would be relieved that the accidental discharge of the BB gun had not blinded Mandy. Certainly, the jury could conclude that the accidental discharge of the BB gun in the earlier incident was a warning to Duckworth that should have reinforced the need for substantial caution when handling firearms. Duckworth\u2019s failure, on the occasion of the shooting charged in the indictment, to heed that warning exacerbated the recklessness involved in the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Bergdoll\u2019s testimony concerning the accident with the BB gun was also relevant to the charge of child abuse, and there was sufficient evidence of child abuse. Child abuse includes \u201c[t]he sustaining of physical injury by a child as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment ... by any ... person who has ... temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child under circumstances that indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 35A(a)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">There was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Duckworth intentionally pointed the weapon at Mandy to make her stop crying while she, after having previously been struck by a projectile from a gun handled by Duck-worth, was pleading with him not to shoot her. On that view of the evidence, which we do not imply is the only legally sufficient interpretation of the facts, the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>was complete before the weapon discharged, even if the discharge was not consciously intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In <em>Bowers v. State, </em>288 Md. 115, 389 A.2d 341 (1978), we considered the meaning of \u201ccruel or inhumane treatment\u201d in the context of a fifteen year old who had been beaten with a belt fifteen to twenty times on the back, neck, arms, and legs. We presented the Maryland child abuse statute against the background of the common law relating to parental discipline. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">\u201c[W]here corporal punishment was inflicted with \u2018a malicious desire to cause pain' or where it amounted to \u2018cruel and outrageous\u2019 treatment of the child, the chastisement was deemed unreasonable, thus defeating the parental privilege and subjecting the parent to penal sanctions in those circumstances where criminal liability would have existed absent the parent-child relationship. Put another way, a parent was not permitted under the common law to resort to punishment which would exceed \u2018that properly required for disciplinary purposes\u2019 or which would extend beyond the bounds of moderation. \u2018Excessive or cruel\u2019 conduct was universally prohibited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 126, 389 A.2d at 348 (citations omitted). We concluded that the terminology employed in the child abuse statute \u201cappears to be nothing but a codification of the common law principles concerning the limits of permissible parental chastisement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127, 389 A.2d at 348. Here, the jury could conclude under all of the circumstances that pointing the handgun at Mandy in order to make her stop crying was not only excessive or cruel, but, in view of her recently hawing been shot by a BB, sadistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Mandy\u2019s physical injury resulted from the cruel or inhumane treatment. This shooting of Mandy is more directly the result of Duckworth\u2019s pointing the weapon at her than was the shooting of the victim in <em>Mills v. State, supra, </em>13 Md.
