We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">The evidence disclosed that defendant became employed at the Adler Market (market) on June 3, 1987. Richard Montfort (Montfort), owner of the market, recalled that her duties included reconciliation of \u201ceach shift\u2019s till\u201d against the \u201cprintout... of the register,\u201d calculation of \u201coverages and shortages,\u201d maintenance of \u201cgeneral ledgers,\u201d payment of accounts, and \u201cgenerally ... the bookkeeping end of the business.\u201d Additionally, defendant collected and totalled all business receipts and routinely \u201cmade up\u201d the deposits into two bank accounts, one for the market\u2019s \u201cgeneral business\u201d funds and the other for the proceeds from lottery ticket sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>During defendant\u2019s employment, purchases were recorded on an \u201celectronic cash register\u201d which documented each transaction on duplicate \u201ctapes.\u201d The imprinted data included the date and amount of the transaction, categorized the sale, i.e., gasoline, beer, lottery, etc., and totalled both gross receipts and tax. Daily, defendant counted and \u2018 \u2018verified\u2019 \u2019 the actual receipts with the register tape, recorded the information in \u201cledgers\u201d and attached one copy of the tape \u201cto the sheets\u201d (the second duplicate tape was filed separately). Absent error, daily register tapes \u201cshould match\u201d with corresponding ledger entries and bank deposits.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Proceeds from the sale of lottery tickets were entered in a \u201cseparate\u201d ledger and deposited into a \u201cseparate account.\u201d A correct balance was of special importance to this account because the funds were regularly subjected to an \u201celectronic sweep\u201d or \u201ctransfer\u201d by the \u201clottery department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Montfort testified that defendant was the only person continuously employed at the market from May 1, 1989 to March 7, 1990, and served alone as its \u201cbookkeeper\u201d throughout the period. However, while defendant was absent from the market following her wedding on March 7, 1990, Montfort assumed her responsibilities and \u201creconstructed\u201d the market \u201cbooks\u201d from March 7, 1990, \u201cbackwards to May 1,\u201d 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The evidence was uncontradicted that this examination of the market\u2019s financial records disclosed recurring deficiencies in daily ledger entries and bank deposits when compared with related register tapes. Ledger records reflected a pattern of repeated downward adjustments in all categories of daily receipts, with the exception of lottery proceeds, and tax collections appropriate to the reduced totals. According to Montfort, these differences regularly totalled approximately $200 per day. In contrast, little or no shortages occurred on those days when defendant was away from the market. Montfort computed \u201ctotal losses\u201d suffered by the market of $43,215.21 from May 1, 1989 to March 7, 1990, the dates specified in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">R. E. Lackey (Lackey), a Virginia State Police investigator, also reviewed the financial records of the market and \u201cclosely scrutinized\u201d five randomly selected dates. After his examination confirmed Montfort\u2019s findings, Lackey interviewed defendant. Initially, she denied any wrongdoing but, once confronted with the documentation, admitted that she \u201cwas adjusting the books because of her gambling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>problem ... to cover up not paying for her lottery tickets.\u201d She denied, however, that \u201cthe shortages were up to around $200.00 per day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence, defendant argued that the record failed to establish an embezzlement of $43,215.21, and the court promised \u201ccareful thought\u201d to the \u201cexhibits\u201d before determining \u201crestitution.\u201d Later, at the sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth pursued this issue, and Montfort again testified, restating the losses. Defendant presented no evidence at that hearing and, on motion of the Commonwealth, the restitution was ordered as a condition of a suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Following conviction in a criminal proceeding, trial courts are specifically vested with the authority to \u201csuspend the sentence in whole or part,\u201d \u201csuspend [its] imposition\u201d and \u201cin addition .. . place the accused on probation,\u201d all \u201cunder such conditions as the court shall determine.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 19.2-303. Among such conditions, restitution for \u201cdamages or loss\u201d caused by the offense is expressly recognized and approved in several statutes. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-303, 19.2-305, 19.2-305.1, 19.2-305.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-303 provides that the court \u201cmay ... require ... at least partial restitution to the aggrieved party or parties . . ., under terms and conditions . . . entered ... by the court.\u201d (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-305. If the offense \u201cresulted in property damage,\u201d a suspension of sentence or probation <em>must </em>be conditioned upon \u201cpartial restitution,\u201d community service or \u201cdoing that which appears to the court to be feasible under the circumstances\u201d pursuant to \u201ca plan\u201d submitted to the court by a defendant. Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1. The court, \u2018 \u2018in its discretion, shall determine the amount [of restitution] to be repaid by the defendant and the terms and conditions thereof.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">These statutes obviously confer upon trial courts \u201cwide latitude\u201d and much \u201cdiscretion in matters of suspension and probation . . . to provide a remedial tool ... in the rehabilitation of criminals\u201d and, to that end, \u201cshould be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Nuckoles </em>v. <em>Com</em>monwealth,, 12 Va. App. 1083, 1085-86, 407 S.E.2d 355, 356 (1991); <em>Dyke v. </em>Commonwealth, 193 Va. 478, 484, 69 S.E.2d 483, 486 (1952); <em>see Grant v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 680, 685, 292 S.E.2d 348, 351 (1982). Nevertheless, conditions upon the suspension of execution or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>imposition of a sentence must be reasonable in relation to the nature of the offense, the background of the offender and the surrounding circumstances. <em>Loving </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 924, 930, 147 S.E.2d 78, 83 (1966), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>388 U.S. 1 (1967); <em>Nuckoles, </em>12 Va. App. at 1086, 407 S.E.2d at 356. Unreasonable \u201csentences . . . will... be vacated and set aside.\u201d <em>Loving, </em>206 Va. at 931, 147 S.E.2d at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">We find nothing in this record to suggest that the restitution ordered by the trial court constituted an unreasonable condition to the suspended sentence and an abuse of discretion. The amount of restitution ordered is supported by the record, and defendant submitted no alternative plan, or related evidence, for the court\u2019s consideration. Under such circumstances, the restitution was an appropriate component in defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Defendant further complains that the restitution was improperly ordered to someone \u201cother than the victim\u201d and imposed an unlawful and unconstitutional burden. These issues, however, were not argued before the trial court and will not be considered for the first time on appeal. Rule 5A:18; <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 591, 593, 405 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1991). This procedural bar applies even to defendant\u2019s constitutional claims. <em>Cottrell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 570, 574, 405 S.E.2d 438, 441 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">While this Court will \u201cnotice . . . error[] for which [there has been] no timely objection . . . when necessary to [satisfy] the ends of justice,\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 126, 131, 380 S.E.2d 8, 10 (1989), the record must \u201caffirmatively show[] that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not . . . that a miscarriage <em>might </em>have occurred.\u201d <em>Mounce </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 433, 436, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987). Our review of the record discloses no miscarriage of justice in the instant cause. <em>See Jimenez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 244, 249-50, 402 S.E.2d 678, 679-80 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Koontz, C.J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\"> While several statutes expressly limit this authority, none are applicable to the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b195-11\">Benton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6q\">concurring in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Because I believe <em>Loving v.
