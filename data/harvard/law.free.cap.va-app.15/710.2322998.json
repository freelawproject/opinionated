Employer contends that the services were not necessary within the meaning of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Specifically, the employer contends that the full commission erred in finding that the home nursing care authorized by appellee\u2019s doctor was \u201cnecessary\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-603. It also claims that the commission erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to appellee. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the commission on the merits and reverse as to the award of attorney fees against the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">On October 31, 1989, in the course of his employment, appellee sustained bums on his right arm. Employer accepted the injury as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>compensable, and appellee received medical treatment, which included hospitalization. Appellee\u2019s treatment, which continued after his discharge from the hospital, required the regular changing of his dressing. After appellee\u2019s discharge, his treating physician, Dr. Chavis, ordered that he have his dressing changed on a daily basis by \u2018 \u2018a qualified nurse . . . using aseptic technique.\u201d Dr. Chavis made arrangements for these services to be provided by Home Health Plus, a home care nursing service. Accordingly, from November 16, 1989, to January 4, 1990, employees of Home Health Plus home nursing service came to appellee\u2019s home to change his dressing, for a total of forty-one visits at a cost of $78 each. During that same period of time, however, appellee also traveled to Dr. Chavis\u2019 office for weekly examinations. The uncontradicted evidence showed that appellee\u2019s medical condition did not prevent him from leaving his home to have the dressing changed at some other location at a lower cost\u2014his employer\u2019s medical facility, or at his doctor\u2019s office (at a cost of $20). Employer did not learn of the home visits until after they had ceased. However, employer\u2019s human resources manager and plant nurse testified that they knew appellee would need regular medical attention for dressing changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The deputy commissioner held that the services were both authorized by the attending physician and necessary to the treatment of appellee\u2019s injury. Although home treatment may not have been necessary, changing of the dressing in an aseptic manner was necessary. Accordingly, the deputy commissioner held that appellee was entitled to compensation for that treatment. Also, because the deputy commissioner held that employer defended the matter without reasonable grounds, he granted appellee\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. On appeal, the commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision and adopted his findings of fact and conclusions of law. It also awarded additional attorney fees to appellee for the continued unreasonable defense of the employee\u2019s application for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Upon appellate review, this Court must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below, <em>Crisp v. Brown\u2019s Tysons Comer Dodge, Inc., </em>1 Va. App. 503, 504, 339 S.E.2d 916, 916 (1986), and the findings of fact made by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission will be upheld when supported by credible evidence. <em>James v. Capitol Steel Constr. Co., </em>8 Va. App. 512, 515, 382 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1989). However, the question of whether the disputed medical treatment was necessary within the meaning of Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>\u00a7 65.2-603 is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>See, e.g., City of Salem </em>v. <em>Colegrove, </em>228 Va. 290, 293, 321 S.E.2d 654, 656 (1984) (holding reviewable, as mixed question of law and fact, determination that college education was not \u201creasonable and necessary vocational rehabilitation training service\u201d under former Code \u00a7 65.1-88). Accordingly, the commission\u2019s conclusion as to the necessity of home treatment for the changing of appellee\u2019s dressing is not binding upon this Court. <em>Id. </em>However, both the purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the equities of the situation guide us in affirming the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The evidence shows that periodic dressing changes were medically necessary as a result of appellee\u2019s compensable injury. In order to effect those changes following appellee\u2019s discharge from the hospital, Dr. Chavis, the attending physician, ordered home health care from Home Health Plus. The evidence also shows, however, that appellee\u2019s medical condition did not require that the treatment be rendered in his home. Because this treatment <em>was </em>provided in appellee\u2019s home, however, the cost of the service was at least three times as much as the cost had the service been performed at the doctor\u2019s office or the place of employment. Employer contends that the treatment was not medically necessary as defined in Code \u00a7 65.2-603 because it did not need to be done in the home.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">The purpose of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">is to provide compensation to an employee for the loss of his opportunity to engage in work, when his disability is occasioned by an injury suffered from an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. The Act should be liberally construed in harmony with its humane purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-8\"><em>Barnett </em>v. <em>D. L. Bromwell, Inc., </em>6 Va. App. 30, 33-34, 366 S.E.2d 271, 272 (1988) (citations omitted). Following a compensable injury,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">the employer shall furnish ... a physician chosen by the injured employee from a panel of at least three physicians selected by the employer and such other necessary medical attention. . . . The employee shall accept the attending physician. . . , and in addition, such surgical and hospital service and supplies as may be deemed necessary by the attending physician or the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(1). Employer does not dispute that the periodic changing of appellee\u2019s dressing was necessary as a result of the accident. \u201cSo long as a causal relationship between the industrial accident and the . . . [treatment rendered] is shown, the employer is financially responsible for the medical attention which the attending physician deems necessary, subject to review by the Commission.\u201d <em>Jensen Press </em>v. <em>Ale, </em>1 Va. App. 153, 159, 336 S.E.2d 522, 525 (1985). Although treatment at appellee\u2019s home may not have been necessary, changing of the dressing itself was medically necessary, thereby requiring payment by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The evidence shows that appellant\u2019s human resources manager, Raymond Howell, who served as a liaison with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission and health care providers, was aware that treatment of appellee\u2019s bum would require periodic dressing changes, and that he assumed the attending physician, Dr. Chavis, had made the necessary arrangements. Employer\u2019s nurse, Mary Miller, gave similar testimony. Based on their knowledge that Dr. Chavis was treating appellee, neither made any attempt to arrange for dressing changes at employer\u2019s plant. Clearly, this home treatment was authorized by Dr. Chavis, and the fact that he later stated that it was not necessary to have the treatment rendered <em>at home </em>does not shift the payment burden to appellee. The record contains no evidence from which this Court could conclude that appellee had any knowledge that the treatment was excessive or unnecessary so that he should have refused to accept it or requested an alternate, less costly form of care. In addition, if he had refused such services, his refusal might have been deemed \u201cunjustified\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-603(B), which could have barred him from receiving additional compensation for his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">As discussed by the deputy commissioner in his opinion, the cases cited by employer do not require a different result because they are both factually and legally dissimilar. In <em>Warren Trucking Co. </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>221 Va. 1108, 1114, 277 S.E.2d 488, 492 (1981), the Court considered whether \u2018 \u2018services performed by [a] spouse in attending to the needs of the disabled claimant qualify as \u2018other necessary medical attention\u2019 within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.1-88.\u201d It noted that \u201cnursing services, whether rendered in a hospital or at home, are included among the medical benefits that an employer and insurer must furnish, provided the services are necessary and authorized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1115, 277 S.E.2d at 492-93. Although employer argues that the services rendered .here were not necessary because they did not need to be provided at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>home, we conclude that the necessity requirement has been met. The treatment itself was necessary, and the manner of delivering the treatment was authorized. The fact that the treating physician authorized delivery of the necessary treatment in a manner that was not the most economical is not the issue. Likewise, the treating physician\u2019s later admission that the treatment could have and should have been provided in a less expensive manner does not shift the burden of paying for services already provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Employer also cites the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Insurance Management Corp. </em>v. <em>Daniels, 222 </em>Va. 434, 281 S.E.2d 847 (1981), in support of its assignment of error. In that case, the Court concluded that the employer was not responsible for the charges incurred by claimant incident to liposuction because the claimant\u2019s obesity, although it may have hindered her recovery, was unrelated to her industrial accident. <em>Id. </em>at 439, 281 S.E.2d at 849. In the case at bar, by contrast, the disputed charges were incurred for a service that was directly linked to appellee\u2019s work-related accident, and not to some preexisting condition for which appellee was responsible. Accordingly, the holding in <em>Daniels </em>does not mandate reversal of the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Employer also assigns error to the commission\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. Under Code \u00a7 65.1-101, in effect at the time of this proceeding,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission may] assess an employer who has defended any proceeding without reasonable grounds the whole costs of the proceedings, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. Assessment of costs and attorney\u2019s fee is not required in every defense of a proceeding without reasonable grounds. Assessment is left to the sound discretion of the Commission. We will not disturb the administrative assessment of costs or attorney\u2019s fees unless there is an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-8\"><em>Jensen Press, </em>1 Va. App. at 159, 336 S.E.2d at 525-26. The deputy commissioner concluded in this case, and the full commission agreed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-9\">that this matter was defended . . . without reasonable grounds. Because the employer failed to provide the needed service through its plant nurse, the claimant had no choice but to accept the arrangement of his attending physician, upon whom he, quite properly, relied. He, similarly, had no choice but to retain counsel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>and file for a hearing after the defendant refused to accept responsibility for the resultant charges. Under such circumstances, the expenses of his legal representation [before both the deputy commissioner and the full commission] shall be the responsibility of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Our case law holds that whether the employer defended a proceeding without reasonable grounds is to be judged from the perspective of the employer, not the employee. \u2018 \u2018If an employer refuses to pay a claim, reasonably believing that it is not compensable, and in the course of its investigation the grounds for refusal are not so contradicted as to be shown unfounded, then the subsequent defense is reasonable, even if it is later proven misplaced or in error.\u201d <em>Volvo White Truck Corp. v. Hedge, </em>1 Va. App. 195, 201, 336 S.E.2d 903, 907 (1985) (citing <em>Norfolk Dep\u2019t of Fire v. Lassiter, </em>228 Va. 603, 605, 324 S.E.2d 656, 657-58 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In this case, the employer could reasonably have believed that it had no responsibility to pay for the cost of home treatment because only one prong of the \u201cnecessary and authorized\u201d test had been met: although the treating physician originally authorized home treatment, he readily admitted that rendering the treatment <em>at home </em>was not medically necessary. Although we have rejected employer\u2019s argument, the merits of that argument are an appropriate consideration in our review of the attorney fee award. On this basis, we conclude that the commission abused its discretion in granting appellee\u2019s request for attorney fees. For the same reason, we conclude that appellee is not entitled to an award of attorney fees based on his appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the commission on the merits but reverse its decision as to the award of attorney fees against the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">\n<em>Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">Fitzpatrick, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
