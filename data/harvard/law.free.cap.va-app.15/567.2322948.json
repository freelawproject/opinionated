Marketing Profiles, Inc. (MPI) and its insurer, National Grange Mutual Insurance Company (insurer), appeal, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to prove that claimant\u2019s injury \u201carose out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d We agree that claimant failed to establish an injury arising out of employment and reverse the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">The record discloses that, at the time of his injury, claimant was \u201cDirector of Photography\u201d for MPI, a \u201cmarketing and portrait photography\u201d business headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. Claimant\u2019s job responsibilities included travel to neighboring states \u201cat least once a week\u201d \u201cto take pictures.\u201d During these \u201cassignments,\u201d it was \u201cnormal\u201d that claimant \u201cgo around\u201d in his personal vehicle, and he was always \u201ccompensated for mileage\u201d by MPI.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">On Saturday, July 14, 1990, claimant was scheduled for a \u201cone day [photographic] assignment ... in Milford, Delaware.\u201d Alex Keisch (Keisch), president of MPI, knew of this engagement and Martha Kathleen Jones (Jones), a friend of claimant, testified that claimant mentioned the \u201cshoot\u201d during a conversation with her on the afternoon of July 13, 1990. Jones later received a recorded message from claimant on her \u201ctelephone answering machine,\u201d which indicated that \u201che was getting ready to leave the shoot. . . going to leave\u201d and \u201con his way back to Richmond.\u201d However, both the date and time of this call are unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">\u201cSometime\u201d following this communication, \u201csomewhere in Maryland,\u201d claimant was seriously injured. Hospital records report that he was admitted to Physicians\u2019 Memorial Hospital, located in LaPlata, Maryland, at 11:45 p.m. on July 14, 1990, following an \u201cautomobile accident,\u201d suffering from those injuries subject of this claim. Keisch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>testified that he was \u201caware\u201d of claimant\u2019s \u201caccident on . . . July 14 in Maryland on Route 301\u201d and confirmed that Route 301, \u201cthrough Maryland,\u201d was the \u201cshortest way\u201d between Richmond and Milford, Delaware. Unfortunately, claimant remembered nothing of the period \u201cthree to four weeks\u201d before and after the injury, and the evidence provides few additional details of the \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">\u201cIn order to recover on a workers\u2019 compensation claim, a claimant must prove: (1) an injury by accident,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) arising out of and (3) in the course of his employment.\u201d <em>Kane Plumbing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Small, </em>7 Va. App. 132,135, 371 S.E.2d 828, 830 (1988). The challenge of MPI and its insurer to the sufficiency of claimant\u2019s evidence to prove an injury occurring in the course and arising out of his employment poses \u2018 \u2018a mixed question of law and fact. . . properly reviewable\u2019 \u2019 on appeal to this Court. <em>Sentara Leigh Hosp. v. Nichols, </em>13 Va. App. 630, 633, 414 S.E.2d 426, 428 (1992) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\u201cThe expressions \u2018arising out of\u2019 and \u2018in the course of\u2019 are not synonymous and are used conjunctively; both conditions must be present before compensation will be awarded,\u201d and the burden rests upon claimant \u201cto prove them by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Baggett Transp. Co. v. Dillon, </em>219 Va. 633, 637, 248 S.E.2d 819, 822 (1978); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-101(B)(11). Thus, \u201cwe must determine whether the Commission\u2019s findings from the facts presented are sufficient in law to justify the award of compensation.\u201d <em>Baggett, </em>219 Va. at 637, 248 S.E.2d at 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The \u201carising out of\u201d proof necessary to support claimant\u2019s recovery under the act must establish \u201ca causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury\u201d that is \u201capparent to the rational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Bradshaw v. Aronovitch, </em>170 Va. 329, 335, 196 S.E. 684, 686 (1938) (quoting <em>In re McNicol, </em>215 Mass. 497, 499, 102 N.E. 697, 697 (1913)); <em>see also United Parcel Serv. </em>v. <em>Fetterman, </em>230 Va. 257, 258-59, 336 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1985). The injury must have \u201cfollowed as a natural incident of the work\u201d and resulted from an \u201cexposure occasioned by the nature of the employment.\u201d <em>United Parcel, </em>230 Va. at 258, 336 S.E.2d at 893. The evidence must show \u201csomething more\u201d than the occurrence of an \u201caccident . . . during the period of the employment,\u201d <em>Norfolk &amp; Washington Steamboat Co. </em>v. <em>Holladay, </em>174 Va. 152, 158, 5 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>486, 489 (1939), and the \u201cpeculiar circumstances of each case are crucial,\u201d especially when, \u201cas here, the injury ... occurs at a place other than the employer\u2019s premises.\u201d <em>Sentara, </em>13 Va. App. at 633, 414 S.E.2d at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">However, a particular condition or risk of employment which generally has not required proof of an \u201cincreased hazard peculiar to the work and not common to the public generally\u201d relates to an employee\u2019s \u201cpresence on the street or highway.\u201d <em>Immer &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Brosnahan, </em>207 Va. 720, 725, 152 S.E.2d 254, 257 (1967). Recognizing the inherent dangers of the highway confronted by anyone whose \u201cwork necessitates\u201d such exposure, an \u201c \u2018actual risk test\u2019 \u201d has developed in \u201c \u2018street cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725-26, 152 S.E.2d at 257; <em>Norfolk &amp; Washington Steamboat Co., </em>174 Va. at 159, 5 S.E.2d at 489; <em>Cohen v. Cohen\u2019s Dep\u2019t Store, </em>171 Va. 106, 110, 198 S.E. 476, 477-78 (1938); <em>Railway Express Agency v. Lewis, </em>156 Va. 800, 809-10, 159 S.E. 188, 191 (1931); <em>Dreyfus &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Meade, </em>142 Va. 567, 129 S.E. 336 (1925). Injury under these circumstances is deemed to arise \u201cout of the employment,\u201d provided (1) the employee\u2019s \u201cduties . . . require ... [a]... presence upon the public streets,\u201d <em>and </em>(2) the \u201cinjury arose from an actual risk of that presence upon the streets.\u201d <em>Sentara, </em>13 Va. App. at 634, 414 S.E.2d at 428. The second element of the test is dis-positive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">While the \u201cactual risk\u201d test assists claimant in establishing the requisite nexus between employment and the myriad threats of the highway, the claimant\u2019s evidence must relate his injury to a street risk connected \u2022 with his employment. <em>Baggett, </em>219 Va. at 643-44, 248 S.E.2d at 825; <em>see Hill City Trucking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>238 Va. 735, 739, 385 S.E.2d 377, 379-80 (1989); <em>Park Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Parham, </em>1 Va. App. 166, 170, 336 S.E.2d 531, 534 (1985). This proof distinguishes the \u201cactual risk\u201d concept from the \u201cpositional risk doctrine,\u201d long disfavored in Virginia. <em>Baggett, </em>219 Va. at 640, 248 S.E.2d at 823; <em>Hill City Trucking, </em>238 Va. at 740, 385 S.E.2d at 380; <em>Dreyfus &amp; Co., </em>142 Va. at 573-74,129 S.E. at 337-38. Thus, not every highway injury which occurs in the course of employment is compensable, and the \u201cpossibility\u201d of causes \u201ctotally unrelated\u201d to the street risks of employment must be eliminated. <em>Park Oil, </em>1 Va. App. at 170, 336 S.E.2d at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Assuming, without deciding, that claimant satisfactorily established an injury by accident that occurred during the course of his employment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> his evidence fails to \u201cexplain the circumstances of the accident\u201d and link the occurrence to a compensable street risk, thereby excluding noncompensable causes. <em>Pinkerton\u2019s, Inc. v. Helmes, </em>242 Va. 378, 380, 410 S.E.2d 646, 648 (1991). We indulge no presumption or inference that dispenses with proof that an unexplained highway accident \u201carose out of\u201d employment. <em>See id. </em>at 381, 410 S.E.2d at 648.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The \u201cburden of supplying evidence from which the inference can be legitimately drawn that the injury arose out of... employment, rests upon the claimant\u201d and \u201c[a]n award based upon surmise or conjecture will be set aside.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Suffolk Peanut Co., </em>171 Va. 439, 443, 199 S.E. 504, 506 (1938); <em>see Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Hairston, </em>2 Va. App. 677, 682, 347 S.E.2d 527, 529 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Factual findings of the commission, based on credible evidence, are conclusive and binding upon this Court. <em>Fairfax Hosp. v. De-LaFleur, </em>221 Va. 406, 410, 270 S.E.2d 720, 722 (1980); Code \u00a7 65.2-706 (former Code \u00a7 65.1-98). If reasonable inferences may be drawn from credible evidence, this Court will not disturb such inferences on appeal. <em>Hawks </em>v. <em>Henrico County Sch. Bd., 7 </em>Va. App. 398, 404, 374 S.E.2d 695, 698 (1988). Although both direct and circumstantial evidence \u201c \u2018may serve as the basis from which further inference of fact may be drawn,\u2019 \u201d such evidence \u201cmust establish a fact\u201d before it \u201cmay serve as a basis for inference.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>15 Va. App. 73, 77, 422 S.E.2d 593, 595 (1992) (quoting <em>Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry. v. Ware, </em>122 Va. 246, 257, 95 S.E. 183,186-87 (1918)).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">As the commission observed, this \u201crecord contains no evidence as to the details of the . . . vehicular accident.\u201d The testimony .of Keisch that claimant was to perform \u201ca job in Delaware,\u201d the \u201cmost reasonable way\u201d to which was \u201cU.S. 301,\u201d and of Jones that claimant \u201cwent\u201d and \u201cwas returning\u201d to Richmond explains claimant\u2019s presence on the highway. Such evidence, however, provides no facts to support additional inferences with respect to the particulars of the accident, proof of which is indispensable to claimant\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>We, therefore, find that claimant\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish those facts essential to support the commission\u2019s findings that his injury arose from employment and reverse its decision. In view of this disposition, we decline to address other issues presented in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Koontz, C.J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\"> Claimant\u2019s proof of injury by accident is not a substantive issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\"> \u201c[I]njuries sustained during the course of travel are compensable . . . whenever the employer,... because of the location of the work place or places, agrees to ... reimburse the employee expenses incurred in the operation of his own vehicle in the performance of his duties.\u201d <em>Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins.

Barnard, </em>236 Va. 41, 47, 372 S.E.2d 369, 372-73 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">The evidence proved and the commission found that Hill\u2019s employment required him to travel to Delaware, that Hill was required to use his own automobile, that Hill was reimbursed for his travel and mileage expenses, and that Hill was injured in an automobile accident on the highway that was \u201cthe most reasonable way for [Hill] to go and come.\u201d No evidence tended to prove Hill was on a personal venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">By relying upon <em>Pinkerton\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Helmes, </em>242 Va. 378, 410 S.E.2d 646 (1991), and <em>Sentara Leigh Hospital </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>13 Va.

Hill\u2019s travel on the highway at the time he was injured in the automobile accident was \u201cone which he was authorized and obligated to perform [; therefore, the] hazards of highway travel thus became necessary incidents of his employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728, 152 S.E.2d at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">For these reasons, I would affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
