He argues that the evidence\u2014which showed that his companion had actual possession of a firearm during the robbery in which both men took part\u2014was insufficient to support his conviction. For the reasons that follow, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">The evidence introduced at trial revealed the following: At about 6:30 p.m. on April 5, 1991, the robbery victim, Thomas Mayo, heard a knock at the door of his residence in Portsmouth. When Mayo opened the door, he saw appellant, who asked if he wanted to buy some jewelry. When Mayo declined, appellant asked if he would \u201cbe interested in a gun.\u201d At that point, another person appeared and pressed a gun into Mayo\u2019s ribs. Appellant grabbed Mayo\u2019s elbow and forced him into the house and up the stairs. The man with the gun held Mayo at gunpoint while appellant and another man searched the house. When the gunman became distracted, Mayo tried to escape. During the ensuing struggle to subdue Mayo, the gun discharged. The gunman held the gun in Mayo\u2019s face, but appellant said, \u201cDon\u2019t kill him yet. Don\u2019t kill him now.\u201d The men demanded to know where Mayo\u2019s money was. After he told them, they took it and left. At no time did Mayo see a gun in appellant\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">At trial, after the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, appellant moved to strike based on the insufficiency of the evidence as to possession. The court overruled his motion. Appellant moved to strike again after presenting his own case, but this motion was also overruled. The judge found appellant guilty as charged.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-11\">On appeal of the trial court\u2019s ruling,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-12\">we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. The judgment of a trial court sitting without a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-5\"><em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987) (citing Code \u00a7 8.01-680).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Even when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the record gives no indication that appellant ever had actual possession of the firearm. The issue is whether constructive possession of a firearm by a convicted felon is sufficient to support a conviction. This issue presents a question of first impression in this jurisdiction. For guidance, we look to principles concerning constructive possession of controlled substances in Virginia and constructive possession of firearms in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">To prove constructive possession of drugs, the Commonwealth must show that the defendant was \u201caware of both the presence and character of the substance and that it was subject to his dominion and control.\u201d <em>Powers v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 474, 476, 316 S.E.2d 739, 740 (1984). \u201c[Mjere proximity to a controlled drug is not sufficient to establish dominion and control.\u201d <em>Drew </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 471, 473, 338 S.E.2d 844, 845 (1986). However, possession \u201cneed not always be exclusive. The defendant may share it with one or more.\u201d <em>Josephs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 87, 99, 390 S.E.2d 491, 497 (1990) (en banc) (quoting <em>Gillis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 298, 301-02, 208 S.E.2d 768, 771 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Applying these principles in <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>State, </em>346 S.E.2d 881, 883 (Ga. Ct. App. 1986), the Court of Appeals of Georgia found the evidence sufficient to support a conviction for constructive possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The evidence in that case showed that Hamilton and his co-defendant first accosted the victim, a pedestrian, from their car. The co-defendant pointed a gun at the victim and ordered him to empty his pockets. The two men left the scene after taking $37 from the victim, but were apprehended an hour later. In the defendants\u2019 vehicle, the police found the gun that the co-defendant had used to commit the robbery. At trial, the state presented evidence to show that Hamilton had previously been convicted of aggravated assault. The court denied Hamilton\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal on the firearms possession charge, and the jury subsequently returned a guilty verdict. The Georgia Court of Appeals concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>[The jury] did accept the theory of constructive possession in order to convict [Hamilton] of the charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Inasmuch as there was evidence that appellant\u2019s co-defendant possessed a gun in furtherance of their joint resolve to commit an armed robbery, denial of a directed verdict of acquittal was in order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">We reach the same conclusion here. The evidence shows that appellant\u2019s co-defendant possessed and used the gun in furtherance of their joint resolve to commit robbery. When appellant asked the victim if he would like to buy a gun, his co-defendant immediately responded by sticking a gun in the victim\u2019s ribs, as if on cue from appellant. Later during the course of the robbery, the gunman obeyed appellant\u2019s command not to shoot the victim. These facts support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant exercised the dominion and control necessary to show constructive possession. Based on the above, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s judgment was not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Bray, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
