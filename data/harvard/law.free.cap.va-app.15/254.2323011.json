On appeal, he asserts (1) that the trial court erred in overruling his objections to the Commonwealth\u2019s statement in its closing argument that, if the jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity, he would go free; (2) that the trial court erred in granting an instruction that indicated to the jury that no action or movement that was planned could result from an irresistible impulse; and (3) that the trial court erred in allowing the Commonwealth to introduce hearsay statements made by an individual not called at trial. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">Appellant traveled to Charlottesville, Virginia, on May 20, 1989, in order to attend his sister\u2019s graduation from law school. His sister shared a house with three other women graduating that weekend, and appellant spent the night in his sister\u2019s bedroom. The following morning, appellant met the victim, one of his sister\u2019s housemates, for the first time. The two met twice again that day, but only briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">On the morning of May 22, 1989, the day after graduation, appellant and his sister packed their respective cars for the return trip home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>and, by 9:00 a.m., his sister had driven away. Appellant testified that he too left the house at this time, but stopped a half mile away, turned around, and returned. He stated that, as he drove away, he started to feel as though he were \u201cpossessed or in a rage or having a seizure or something.\u201d \u201cI just felt like\u2014I felt like doing something like hurting [her], I guess hurting that girl, I didn\u2019t really know her name.\u201d He parked back at the house and searched in his trunk for \u201csomething to hurt the girl with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Once inside the house, he knocked on the victim\u2019s bedroom door and, speaking through the closed door, asked if she had seen his car keys. She called back that she had not and then went into her bathroom to dry her hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Appellant testified that, while all of this was going on, he was \u201ctrying to fight it.\u201d He could not believe what he was thinking about doing and did not \u201cwant to do this,\u201d did not \u201cwant to hurt the girl,\u201d did not \u201cwant to do anything.\u201d \u201cI just wanted to let the girl know I was there so maybe she could stop me from doing something to her, so I\u2014I made up a story about had she seen my keys.\u201d He sat in the living room of the house \u201ctrying to fight... this feeling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The victim stood in her bathroom drying her hair when appellant suddenly seized her by the hair, pulled her down onto the bedroom floor, and struck her several times on the back of the head with a tire iron. She screamed, and appellant instructed her to \u201cshut up,\u201d then closed the bedroom window. Appellant struck her repeatedly as she struggled to escape. Ordering her to remove her pants and underpants, he removed his own shorts to reveal that he was wearing a jockstrap. He removed the jockstrap, lay on top of her, and forced her to have intercourse with him. He later recalled feeling a \u201crage, like I just wanted to hurt\u2014hurt the girl and I just couldn\u2019t stop myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">After raping her, appellant ordered the victim to put her pants and underpants back on, then to kneel down and lean over. When she did so, he began striking her in the back of the head with the tire iron. With his last blow, she collapsed to the floor. She lay there for several minutes, never quite losing consciousness. When she was able to get up, she saw that appellant was busy cleaning the room. He washed his hands, used a towel from the bathroom to wipe up blood and wipe off doorknobs, went to the kitchen to find paper towels, and ordered her to change her bloodied t-shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Appellant seemed to calm down as he cleaned, and the victim asked him why he had done this to her. He answered that he was frustrated. She talked to him as he cleaned, as he calmed down, trying to convince him to leave. She told him that she would not tell anyone what had happened and that she would not call the police. Appellant got into his car and drove away. When he had gone, she called a friend who took her to a hospital. Her head wounds required fourteen stitches.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Recalling his thoughts just before leaving the house, appellant testified that he just did not understand what had happened to him: \u2018 \u2018I don\u2019t know why\u2014there was something wrong with me.\u201d He wanted to see a doctor but, not knowing any in Charlottesville, headed back to Rochester. On his way home, he met his sister by chance on the highway and the two stopped at a McDonald\u2019s in Pennsylvania. He kept silent about the rape because, he said, he did not want to upset her. Somewhere along the way back to Rochester, appellant discarded his bloodstained t-shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In Rochester, appellant consulted a lawyer before contacting a doctor. According to appellant, he and the lawyer \u2018 \u2018made up a little story\u201d that the victim had been walking naked in the house when she offered to have sex with him. However, after consensual intercourse, she attacked him, scratched him, and announced that she would say appellant had raped her. Angered, appellant struck her in the head with a tire iron. Appellant stated that the purpose of this fabrication was to induce his parents to pay his legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">At trial, appellant relied on the defense of insanity due to an irresistible impulse. Dr. Robert O. Brown, Sr., a psychiatrist, testified that, at the time of the rape, appellant suffered from \u201corganic mental syndrome\u201d or \u201corganic personality syndrome,\u201d a mental illness related to previous brain injuries. Dr. Brown concluded that, at the time of the rape, appellant experienced an irresistible impulse over which he had no control.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">During the summer of 1982, while appellant was enrolled at the Rochester Institute of Technology, he had a serious bicycling accident in which he suffered severe head injuries, including a fractured skull and a broken jaw. For five days following the accident, brain fluid leaked into his inner ear, indicating that the thickest covering of his brain had been tom. As a result of the accident, appellant eventually left school and went to work for a large corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>A reported second consequence of the accident was that appellant experienced difficulty relating to others. His comments tended to be socially inappropriate and his attitude argumentative and angry. At times he would \u201cgo into a wild tirade or rages over some almost insignificant item.\u201d He was also plagued with constant and \u201cexcruciating headaches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In 1986, appellant voluntarily admitted himself to the neuropsychiatry unit of a Rochester hospital following an incident with his girlfriend in a bar during which he felt he had not maintained appropriate control over his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In 1987, appellant suffered a second serious head injury when a security guard struck him repeatedly in the head with a nightstick. According to appellant\u2019s own testimony, neighbors had hired the security guard to attack and try to kidnap him. As a result of the beating, appellant developed a large swelling on his head and suffered headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Dr. Brown testified that appellant\u2019s impulse became irresistible when he went into the victim\u2019s bedroom and grabbed her. Dr. Brown acknowledged that the acts of turning his car around, driving it back to the house, stopping the car, looking for a weapon in the trunk, walking into the house, calling through the closed bedroom door, and waiting in the living room before breaking into the bedroom to beat and rape the victim involved conscious physical actions. Dr. Brown also stated that appellant\u2019s feelings of being \u201cpossessed\u201d and his desire to harm the victim did not amount to an irresistible impulse because appellant in fact resisted them for as much as fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Dr. Brown testified that the source of the irresistible impulse was a desire to punish his sister for her success. Dr. Brown stated that the weekend of the sister\u2019s graduation, in light of the history of her academic successes, and measured against his own academic failures following his head injuries, was extremely stressful for appellant. Dr. Brown indicated that stress is difficult for a brain-injured person such as appellant to manage and that the weekend graduation proved to be too much to handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Over objection, the Commonwealth questioned Dr. Brown about a letter he had received from the lawyer appellant consulted in New York. Dr. Brown testified that the lawyer indicated that appellant initially told him the victim had consented. Appellant objected on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>grounds that \u201cthere is no foundation for any statement\u201d to the attorney and that Dr. Brown had not used the information in the letter \u201cas part of his conclusion that he has reached in this case.\u2019 \u2019 The Commonwealth argued that its questions were meant to determine what part the letter played in Dr. Brown\u2019s evaluation and whether appellant had told Dr. Brown the truth during the evaluation. The court overruled defense objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Dr. S. Kenneth Hoge, testifying as an expert for the Commonwealth, indicated his belief that appellant had not suffered from an irresistible impulse. Dr. Hoge testified that, while the 1982 head injury could have exacerbated appellant\u2019s personality problems, problems arising from his post-accident behavior were similar to pre-accident problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In its closing argument, the Commonwealth argued that the jury had a duty to protect the public and that a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity would mean appellant would go free. The trial court overruled an objection by appellant\u2019s counsel on the ground that the latter assertion was not true. Appellant\u2019s counsel asked the court to instruct the jury on what would happen to appellant following a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. The trial court stated that it would \u201cinstruct this jury on that very question.\u201d When the trial court instructed the jury members on this question, it said that they \u201cshould not concern themselves with what happens after the verdict.\u201d Appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The trial court also instructed the jury that, if it found from the evidence that appellant\u2019s acts were \u201cplanned in advance,\u201d then it \u201cmay conclude that his acts toward her were not the product of an irresistible impulse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling objections to a statement by the Commonwealth that, if the jury found appellant not guilty by reason of insanity, he would go free. We find that the trial court properly cured what was plainly an error by the Commonwealth with an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">In its closing argument, the Commonwealth told the jury that \u2018 \u2018the law, in the form of an insanity defense, says you may go free and a jury may find you not guilty if you find \u2014 if you can respond to an irresistible impulse.\u201d Counsel for appellant objected that \u201cthe Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney full well knows that\u2019s not the case and if this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>man is found not guilty by reason of insanity he\u2019s committed to the Department of Mental Health.\u201d The Commonwealth countered that this assertion by appellant\u2019s counsel was \u201cnot true.\u201d The court advised both counsel that the matter would be left \u201cto the instructions.\u201d In the presence of the jury, appellant\u2019s counsel answered that he was \u201cgoing to ask for another instruction\u201d as \u201cthe jury should know what happens if he\u2019s found not guilty by reason of insanity. He does not walk free.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Before presenting his closing argument to the jury, appellant\u2019s counsel moved \u201cthat the jury be instructed as to what happens to the defendant with regard to what happens if he\u2019s found not guilty.\u201d The court answered that it would \u2018 \u2018instruct this jury on that very question\u2019 \u2019 but asked counsel to proceed with his argument. Appellant\u2019s counsel then informed the jury that a \u201cfinding of not guilty by reason of insanity will afford this community just as much protection\u2019 \u2019 as a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Following the closing arguments, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">[Y]ou should not concern yourselves with what happens after your verdict, whatever it is, so you need to confine yourself to the evidence as presented, follow the instructions and come up with your verdict and not concern yourselves with what might happen after the verdict is rendered. That\u2019s for the court to take hp after your verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">We hold that, under the circumstances of this case, this instruction by the court to the jury properly cured a plainly improper remark by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">It is well-established in Virginia that a jury is not to concern itself with post-sentencing events. <em>See Poyner v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 401, 432, 329 S.E.2d 815, 836, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 865 (1985). Thus, the trial court\u2019s admonishment to the jury not to take into consideration post-sentencing events correctly stated the law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Stotler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 481, 484-85, 346 S.E.2d 39, 41 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The effect of improper remarks ... is presumed to be curable by an admonishment to the jury. . . . When the trial court has taken such corrective action, a mistrial should not be declared unless there is a manifest probability that such action will not remove the prejudicial effects of improper remarks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The appellant contends that the facts of this case must be construed in the light most favorable to him. According to his argument, once he has established that an error has occurred, it is up to the Commonwealth to prove that the error was not prejudicial. In order to know whether the error prejudiced appellant\u2019s interests, he contends this Court must review the evidence in the light most favorable to him. While it is true that generally we must consider an error prejudicial unless \u201c \u2018it plainly appears from the record and the evidence\u2019 that the verdict was not affected by the error,\u201d if a trial court promptly instructs a jury to disregard the effect of an error, we may assume that the jury did so, unless the record \u201c \u2018suggests a manifest probability\u2019 that it did not.\u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 1003, 1008-09, 407 S.E.2d 910, 912 (1991) (en banc) (quoting <em>Boykins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 309, 313, 170 S.E.2d 771, 774 (1969)). We find nothing in the record to undermine this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Appellant further argues that the trial court erred in granting an instruction to the jury that, if it found appellant\u2019s acts were planned in advance, it could conclude they had not resulted from an irresistible impulse. According to appellant, this instruction encouraged the jury to reject the testimony of appellant\u2019s expert witness and constituted a comment on the evidence by the court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Appellant argues that, by giving the \u201cplanned-in-advance\u201d instruction, the trial court effectively took from the jury the question whether to believe Dr. Brown\u2019s testimony that an irresistible impulse need not be fleeting but \u201cmay last from minutes to hours.\u201d The full text of the disputed instruction follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">If you find from the evidence that the acts of JEFFREY THEODORE KITZE toward [the victim] were planned in advance, you may conclude that his acts toward her were not the product of an irresistible impulse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">In <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 704, 70 S.E.2d 284 (1952), the Supreme Court of Virginia stated that \u201c[t]he irresistible impulse doctrine is applicable only to that class of cases where the accused is able to understand the nature and consequences of his act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>and knows it is wrong, but his mind has become so impaired by disease that he is totally deprived of the mental power to control or restrain his act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718, 70 S.E.2d at 292. In <em>Rollins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 575, 151 S.E.2d 622 (1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U.S. 1026 (1967), the Court approved the following instruction: \u201c[T]he jury is instructed that if the act which is alleged to be the result of an irresistible impulse was planned in advance, then, as a matter of law, such act cannot be said to be the product of an irresistible impulse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 151 S.E.2d at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The Court in <em>Rollins </em>noted that there was before it \u201cno suggestion in the evidence that the defendant acted on an irresistible impulse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the point decided by the Court was not actually in issue. <em>See Virginia Ry. &amp; Power Co. v. Dressler, </em>132 Va. 342, 350-51, 111 S.E. 243, 245-46 (1922). Nonetheless, the Court\u2019s approval of the instruction in <em>Rollins </em>directs our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The instruction approved in <em>Rollins </em>flows logically from the definition of \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d approved in <em>Thompson, </em>yet it extended that definition in a significant way. In approving the contested instruction, the Court in <em>Rollins </em>expressly relied on a dictionary definition of \u201cimpulse\u201d: \u201cThe word \u201cimpulse\u2019 implies that which is sudden, spontaneous, unpremeditated.\u201d 207 Va. at 580, 151 S.E.2d at 625 (citing Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1138) (emphasis added). The Court thus approved an interpretation of the phrase \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d that precluded premeditated acts, or acts planned in advance, from being considered products of an irresistible impulse.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">We note that, at least hypothetically, <em>Rollins </em>might be read too broadly to preclude an irresistible impulse defense in cases where there is evidence of advance planning but also evidence of an intent to abandon the plan. Where an individual plans a crime, yet subsequently exhibits a clear intent to abandon his plan, later perpetration of that same crime by that same individual might yet be the product of an irresistible impulse.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">However, we find in this case no evidence that, once he had turned his car around and headed back to the house, defendant ever abandoned his criminal progress. This lack of evidence, coupled with the recognition by defendant\u2019s own expert that defendant was not in the grip of an irresistible impulse when he turned his car around and started back, leads us to conclude that, legally, there was no break between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the stage at which defendant planned his crimes and the stage at which he acted on those plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Although the instruction at issue here might not in all cases survive a challenge, there was, on the facts of this case, no error. Therefore, we follow the guidance of the Supreme Court in <em>Rollins </em>in holding that the trial court did not err in approving the instruction at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Appellant asserts that the Commonwealth should not have been allowed to question Dr. Brown about a letter from an attorney, Michael DiPrima. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Dr. Brown testified that he wrote DiPrima and enclosed with his letter \u201ca signed permission, a release from the defendant to release this information.\u201d In response, DiPrima sent the letter now contested on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">One basis for the objection to the letter\u2019s introduction was that its authenticity had not been established. One non-statutory way to authenticate a document is through circumstantial evidence. \u201c \u2018The court must determine if the circumstantial evidence is sufficient to justify the document\u2019s admission; the jury will then, as in all cases, make an independent decision as to whether the document is genuine.\u2019 \u201d <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 717, 726-27, 347 S.E.2d 539, 544 (1986) (quoting Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 180, at 469 (2d ed. 1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The fact that Dr. Brown received a letter from DiPrima in response to his inquiry may, if the court so deems it, be considered sufficient evidence to justify the document\u2019s admission. <em>See </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 180, at 469 (3d ed. 1988). Further evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the letter was undisputed. When the trial court asked appellant\u2019s' counsel if he contested Dr. Brown\u2019s statement that appellant signed a consent form for the release of information from DiPrima, appellant\u2019s counsel answered that he did not. Considering the evidence that appellant signed the release form, that Dr. Brown wrote DiPrima a letter and included the release form, and that Dr. Brown received a letter from DiPrima in return, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it deemed the circumstantial evidence sufficient to justify the letter\u2019s admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">Counsel for appellant and the Commonwealth argued the question of the letter\u2019s admissibility outside the presence of the jury. At one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>point, counsel for appellant took the position that, if Dr. Brown indicated the letter was \u201cpart of the reason [he] reached the conclusion [he] did in this case,\u201d then appellant would have no objection to the letter\u2019s admission. However, appellant argued, \u201cThat is not what Dr. Brown said.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">We disagree with this characterization of Dr. Brown\u2019s testimony. At two points Dr. Brown plainly indicated that he had relied on DiPrima\u2019s letter in making his evaluation. When asked if he had \u201cutilize^]\u201d the letter in the conduct of his evaluation,\u201d Dr. Brown answered, \u201cYes.\u201d Asked if he had \u201creceivefd]\u201d the letter in the process of his evaluation and \u201cconsider[ed]\u201d it in evaluation, Dr. Brown answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Appellant conceded at trial that, if Dr. Brown relied on the letter in making his evaluation, the letter was admissible. Whether this resolution of the issue reflects the law in Virginia is not a question before us, for it is the law of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">We disagree with the contention that Dr. Brown did not rely on the letter. The trial court did not err in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the trial court are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Baker, X, and Barrow, X, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-11\"> See <em>Buchanan </em>v.
