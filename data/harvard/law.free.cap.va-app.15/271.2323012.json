Rice, M.D., and Joseph W. Lawler (collectively \u201cEDF\u201d) appeal an order of the circuit court denying their \u201cPetition for Appeal\u201d of the \u201cWater Quality Standard\u201d (standard) for 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin) established by the State Water Control Board (Board). Chesapeake Corporation, Union Camp Corporation and Westvaco Corporation (industry) were granted leave by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>trial court to intervene in the proceedings. In adopting the standard, EDF contends the Board \u201carbitrarily\u201d responded only to economic and technological factors and, thus, violated its \u201cstatutory duty\u201d to fix a standard which considered and \u201cprotected reasonable public stream uses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We find no reversible error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">I. THE RECORD</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Code \u00a7 62.1-44.2 expresses \u201cthe policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia\u201d and the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the State Water Control Law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">(1) protect existing high quality state waters and restore all other state waters to such condition of quality that any such waters will permit all reasonable public uses and will support the propagation and growth of all aquatic life, including game fish, which might reasonably be expected to inhabit them, (2) safeguard the clean waters of the Commonwealth from pollution, (3) prevent any increase in pollution, (4) reduce existing pollution, and (5) promote water resource conservation, management and distribution, and encourage water consumption reduction in order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the present and future citizens of the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">In furtherance of this policy, it is the \u201cduty\u201d of the Board and it \u201cshall have the authority\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">(3a) To establish . . . standards of quality ... for any state waters consistent with the general policy set forth in this chapter.. . and to take all appropriate steps to prevent quality alteration contrary to the public interest .... Whenever the Board considers the adoption ... of any standard, it shall give due consideration to, among other factors, the economic and social costs and benefits which can reasonably be expected to obtain as a consequence of the standards....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Such action of the Board is governed procedurally by Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.14:7.1 and 9-6.14:8 of the Administrative Process Act (Act). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(3b).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">On December 11, 1989, the Board directed its staff to \u201cmove to a public hearing\u201d on a \u201cproposed water standard for dioxin\u201d of 1.2 parts per quadrillion (1.2). This action was followed by administrative proceedings and related \u201cpublic hearings\u201d in accordance with Code \u00a7 9-6.14:7.1. The proposal generated much comment from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Virginia Department of Health (VDH), EDF, industry and others, and the resulting record is voluminous and complex. As a consequence, this opinion recites only those facts necessary to a resolution of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The record discloses that dioxin is an \u201cunavoidable contaminant\u201d produced during certain manufacturing processes. A carcinogen, lethal and injurious to life even in small doses, it was described as \u201cone of the most toxic substances with respect to human health that has been found in the environment known to mankind.\u201d Unfortunately, it is presently discharged into the public waters of this Commonwealth, primarily as an \u201cunintended by-product\u201d of paper manufacturing by industry. If not regulated, this activity could expose \u201cthe population to additional cancer risks that would be unacceptable . . . [to] the State Department of Health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">However, determination of a dioxin exposure level that is tolerable by humans has proven \u201cvery difficult.\u201d Research with animals has revealed a \u201cmarked variation in host sensitivity and susceptibility,\u201d with experiments producing results that are sometimes \u201ccontradictory.\u201d \u201c[Definition\u201d of an \u201cacceptable risk level for the general population\u201d was described by the State Health Commissioner as an \u201cenigma\u201d which required a \u201cpolicy decision\u201d that assured \u201cminimal or insignificant\u201d exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">In an effort \u201cto translate choices among dioxin factors into a final standard,\u201d the EPA developed a \u201cmodeling formula\u201d designed to consider properly these numerous \u201cfactors\u201d by numerical weighting. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>This equation was \u201caccepted by all parties as the best means of predicting an appropriate . . . standard,\u201d utilized by the Board in this instance, and is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">DIOXIN WATER</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">QUALITY STANDARD = RISK LEVEL X BODY WEIGHT</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">CANCER X (WATER + FISH X BIOCONCENTRATION</p>\n<p id=\"AAm\">POTENCY INTAKE CONSUMPTION FACTOR)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Manifestly, a variation in any component of the formula would alter the result, and the evidence disclosed particular uncertainty and disagreement surrounded the numerically correct \u201cCANCER POTENCY\u201d \u201cRISK LEVEL\u201d and \u201cBIOCONCENTRATION\u201d factors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">At its meeting on March 19, 1990, Board staff, EDF and industry representatives addressed the Board on the proposed standard. Following the several presentations, the Board deferred \u201caction\u201d until its May meeting and, on May 14, 1990, approved, without dissent, the originally proposed 1.2 standard. The evidence indicates that this standard would \u201creduce existing pollution\u201d associated with dioxin discharge. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 62.1-44.2(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">In selecting the standard, the Board adhered to RISK LEVEL and BIOCONCENTRATION numbers that were within the EPA approved range and applied a CANCER POTENCY estimate described by the federal agency as \u201cwithin the range of scientific defensibility\u201d and \u201cacceptable.\u201d Reduced standards recommended by the VDH, 0.056 parts per quadrillion, and by the EPA, 0.13 parts per quadrillion, resulted from application of more conservative equation components, all of which were also compatible with the EPA scale. Industry supported the 1.2 standard as both scientifically sound and technologically and economically achievable, while EDF regarded the EPA proposal as \u201cthe only criteria [sic] that is protective for Virginia waters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">Dissatisfied with the Board\u2019s decision, EDF pursued judicial \u201creview\u201d of its action by a \u201cPETITION FOR APPEAL\u201d (petition) filed in the trial court pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16(A). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-44.29, 62.1-44.30, 9-6.14:17. Through several \u201cissues on appeal,\u201d EDF argued that the decision resulted from the Board\u2019s consideration of only \u201cthat standard which was economically and technologically feasible and could be measured by current analytical methods.\u201d The result, EDF complained, neither considered nor protected \u201cstream uses, including fish and aquatic life as well as public health\u201d and, as a consequence, violated both \u201cfederal and state law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> EDF, therefore, urged the trial court to conclude that the Board had \u201carbitrarily and unreasonably\u201d failed to protect \u201cpublic health\u201d and \u201caquatic life\u201d from the \u201ctoxic effects of dioxin\u201d and violated \u201cits purpose\u201d and the \u201cintent and policies of the Water Control Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The record discloses that the court properly reviewed \u201cthis matter on the basis of the agency file, supplemented\u201d by memoranda and argument of counsel. In his initial letter opinion, the trial judge identified the Board\u2019s failure \u201cto adopt a dioxin standard which would achieve the purposes of the State Water Control Law\u201d expressed in Code \u00a7 62.1-44.2 as the \u201croot\u201d of the EDF challenge. He recognized that the \u201cbasic premise\u201d to this contention was the Board\u2019s predisposition to a standard that considered only \u201ceconomic,\u201d \u201csocial\u201d and \u201ctechnical\u201d factors, \u201cto the exclusion of stream uses\u201d and other considerations mandated by statute. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-44.2, 62.1-44.15(3a).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In reviewing the Board\u2019s action, the trial court considered the entire record, including the scientific and other evidence, as it related to the selected standard. The judge noted that \u201cthe determination of the figures to use in each of the factors\u201d was a decision \u201cderived from blends of policy choices . . . and . . . data\u201d beyond the \u201ccompetence of the courts,\u201d and demanding the \u201cspecial expertise\u201d of the administrative agency. Thus, the trial court found that the Board\u2019s standard was entitled to a \u201chigh degree of deference,\u201d was \u201csupported by substantial evidence,\u201d and was \u201cwithin the scope of [its] legal authority.\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The parameters of judicial review of \u201cagency action\u201d are defined in Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17 of the Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This Court has previously instructed that the \u201cissues of law\u201d specified in the statute \u201cfall into two categories: first, whether the agency ... acted within the scope of [its] authority, and second, whether the decision itself was supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va. App. 231, 242, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1988). Although many circumstances involve \u201cmixed questions\u201d of both \u201claw and fact,\u201d issues are sometimes \u201coversimplified\u201d as \u201clegal\u201d or \u201cfactual,\u201d a distinction which is significant to judicial review of an administrative decision. <em>See id. </em>at 243, 369 S.E.2d at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">It is well established that agency action is presumed valid on review, and the burden rests \u201cupon the party complaining\u201d to overcome this presumption. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17; <em>Commonwealth ex rel. State Water Control Bd. v. Appalachian Power Co., 9 </em>Va. App. 254, 259, 386 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1989), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>12 Va. App. 73, 402 S.E.2d 703 (1991). However, agency resolution of \u201cfactual issues\u201d is generally \u201caccorded greater deference\u201d than decisions related to \u201clegal issues.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, 6 </em>Va. App. at 242-43, 369 S.E.2d at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">In \u201cthe context of factual issues,\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17 mandates that \u201cthe court shall take due account of the presumption of official regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the agency, and the purposes of the basic law under which the agency has acted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 369 S.E.2d at 7. This heightened deference acknowledges an agency\u2019s \u201cexpert discretion [in] matters coming within its cognizance and [allows] judicial interference . . . only for relief against the arbitrary or capricious action that constitutes a clear abuse of the delegated discretion.\u201d <em>Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Comm \u2019n </em>v. <em>York Street Inn, Inc., 220 </em>Va. 310, 315, 257 S.E.2d 851, 855 (1979) (quoting <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment of Newark, 9 </em>N.J. 405, 423, 88 A.2d 607, 615-16 (1952)). A \u201creviewing court may reject [an] agency\u2019s findings of fact only if, considering the record as a whole, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>reasonable mind would necessarily come to a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, </em>6 Va. App. at 242, 369 S.E.2d at 7; <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In contrast, judicial review of a \u201clegal issue\u201d requires \u201clittle deference,\u201d unless it also \u201cfalls within an agency\u2019s area of particular expertise.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, 6 </em>Va. App. at 243-46, 369 S.E.2d at 8. This principle recognizes the \u201cspecial competence\u201d of the judiciary to decide issues of \u201ccommon law,\u201d \u201cconstitutional law\u201d or \u201cstatutory interpretation,\u201d distinct from \u201cfindings of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Courts must \u201cconstrue and determine compliance with the statutes governing adoption of administrative regulation irrespective of the agency\u2019s construction,\u201d <em>Appalachian Power, </em>9 Va. App. at 259-60, 386 S.E.2d at 636, and not \u201cmerely rubber-stamp an agency determination,\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, </em>6 Va. App. at 243, 369 S.E.2d at 8. Agency action, even when \u201csupported by substantial evidence,\u201d must be set aside if judicial review reveals a failure \u201cto observe the required procedures or to comply with statutory authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243, 369 S.E.2d at 7; <em>see State Bd. of Health </em>v. <em>Godfrey, </em>223 Va. 423, 434, 290 S.E.2d 875, 880-81 (1982); <em>Muse </em>v. <em>Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Bd., 9 </em>Va. App. 74, 78, 384 S.E.2d 110,112 (1989); Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">EDF\u2019s challenge in the instant case advances a legal issue, the Board\u2019s failure to comply with its statutory mandate. In our review and analysis, EDF directs us more to the Board\u2019s decision-making process than to the evidence. EDF argues that the Board was predisposed to a standard fashioned only by economic, technical and social considerations and unwilling to consider properly and protect all \u201creasonable public stream uses.\u201d This approach is condemned by EDF as inconsistent with the policy of the Commonwealth expressed in Code \u00a7 62.1-44.2 and the mandate of Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(3a) and thus in violation of the Board\u2019s statutory duty. In support of this contention, EDF relies upon staff remarks, discussion and debate within the Board, and the recommendations and comments of industry, VDH and the EPA. EDF also maintains that a history of VDH \u201chealth advisories,\u201d prompted by the dioxin contamination of certain waterways in the Commonwealth, further discredited the Board\u2019s conduct and its 1.2 standard.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>This argument, however, presents a mixture of legal and factual questions, each indispensable to a correct analysis of the substantive legal issue and, as expressed in <em>Johnston-Willis, </em>illustrates the difficulty with the legal/factual dichotomy. 6 Va. App. at 243, 369 S.E.2d at 7-8. Properjudicial review of the Board\u2019s action must not be restricted to legal issues, but must encompass \u201call. . . proofs\u201d found within the entire record. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17. Interrelated factual and legal issues must be considered together in the context of the entire record, with each examined under the appropriate standard of review. The court may then discharge its statutory duty and \u201cdetermine . . . whether the result reached . .. could reasonably be said, ... to be within the scope of the legal authority of the agency.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Therefore, according due deference to the Board\u2019s factual findings, the record reveals substantial credible evidence to support the 1.2 dioxin water quality standard. The decision followed extended debate, addressed and resolved conflict and uncertainty in the evidence and balanced numerous interests. All views were presented to the Board, and the relevant statutory factors were fully explored and developed for its consideration. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(3a). On appeal, we cannot seize upon questions, comments or incidences of an orderly administrative process to discredit agency action that is supported by the record, viewed in context and as a whole. <em>See Yarborough </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 971, 978, 234 S.E.2d 286, 291 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">When the Board\u2019s action is scrutinized in relation to its duties and responsibilities, the decision was not only factually sound but faithful to statute. The Board selected a standard that was \u201cbased on the proper application of its expert discretion\u201d to appropriate evidence and statutory considerations, in harmony with \u201cthe purposes of the basic law\u201d and neither \u201carbitrary\u201d nor \u201ccapricious.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, </em>6 Va. App. at 246, 369 S.E.2d at 9; Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(3a). Therefore, again based on the entire record, including \u201call . . . proofs,\u201d it can \u201creasonably be said\u201d that the Board acted within its \u201clegal authority\u201d and without error.
