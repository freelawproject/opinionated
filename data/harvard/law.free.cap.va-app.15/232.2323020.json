He appeals, contending that the trial court erred in admitting testimony that associated the location of the offense with notorious criminal activity. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">The evidence disclosed that Officers Angelo Chiota (Chiota) and Kenneth Hatten (Hatten), \u201cresponding ... to [a] complaint of open drug sales,\u201d observed defendant exit a cab and enter a \u201cpark\u201d located in Alexandria, Virginia. It was \u201caround 7:30\u201d on a February evening and the officers \u201cnoticed\u201d only defendant and another individual in the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">As the officers watched, defendant \u201cthr[e]w . . . away\u201d a \u201cbig, very shiny object,\u201d which \u201cappeared to be narcotics,\u201d and \u201cwalked on.\u201d While Chiota recovered the discarded article from \u201cthe ground,\u201d Hatten \u2018 \u2018asked defendant to come over\u2019 \u2019 to the police vehicle. Chiota returned with a \u201cplastic Baggie,\u201d which contained \u201c14 little Baggies\u201d of \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d having an estimated total value of \u201cabout $7,000.00.\u201d The officers then arrested and searched defendant, and discovered a beeper under his shirt. Chiota testified that the \u201camounts\u201d and \u201cpackaging\u201d of the drug were \u201cnot consistent with personal use\u201d and identified the beeper as a \u201ctool that people who deal in drugs use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">During trial, Chiota was permitted to describe \u201cthe area where the park is located\u201d as an \u201copen drug market.\u201d This testimony followed uncontradicted evidence of Chiota\u2019s training and expertise in the \u201cidentification of, the manufacture, sale, possession and distribution of . . . drugs, specifically cocaine\u201d in the City of Alexandria. His description of the park area and its inclusion among \u201cseveral spots in the city\u201d \u201croutinely\u201d involved in \u201ccomplaints\u201d was supported by personal experience, well established in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Relying upon <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 336, 228 S.E.2d 562 (1976), defendant first argues that evidence of the park\u2019s reputation was irrelevant and inadmissible. In <em>Smith, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that Smith\u2019s presence at a particular \u201cstreet intersection hundreds of times within the six months\u201d prior to his arrest and its reputation \u201cas a place for illegal drug violations\u201d had \u201cno relevancy to the charge that [he] possessed heroin with intent to distribute on [the date of the alleged offense].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337, 228 S.E.2d at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">However, unlike defendant, Smith possessed no drugs at the time of his arrest, and the only evidence of criminal conduct was \u2018 \u2018the activity of [Smith] and others\u201d in an area reputed \u201cfor trafficking in drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336-37, 228 S.E.2d at 562. Under such circumstances, the Court found Smith\u2019s \u201cmere presence\u201d at an unsavory \u201cplace\u201d permitted no reasonable inference \u201cthat he was engaged in . . . drug distribution\u201d and was \u201cunrelated evidence,\u201d \u201chighly prejudicial, to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337, 228 S.E.2d at 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The Court again considered the relevancy of evidence \u201cabout drug conditions\u201d in a particular area in <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 83, 86, 340 S.E.2d 820, 822 (1986). There, the evidence \u201cshowed\u201d that Coe and others \u201ctravel[ed] from Virginia to [South Bend,] Indiana [to] procure a large [supply] of marijuana,\u201d and the city was described as a \u201cplace where a substantial quantity of contraband was readily available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 340 S.E.2d at 823. The Court approved this evidence as \u201cpertinent and relevant\u201d to establish Coe\u2019s criminal conspiracy and \u201ccorroborate the other testimony.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Distinguishing <em>Smith, </em>the Court noted the \u201cabundant... evidence\u201d of Coe\u2019s guilt in addition to his visit to a disreputable area. <em>Id. </em>at 88-89, 340 S.E.2d at 824. In the context of such other evidence, \u201cthe fact of drug availability in South Bend\u201d became relevant because it \u201ctended to prove that [Coe] was there\u201d to procure \u201cdrugs in accordance with the agreement,\u201d a fact directly material to the prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 89, 340 S.E.2d at 824; <em>see also Wymer v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 294, 302, 403 S.E.2d 702, 707 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Thus, although both <em>Smith </em>and <em>Coe </em>instruct that testimony relating an accused to a sinister location, without more, is irrelevant, <em>Coe </em>recognized that such evidence may be admissible when considered with \u201cother evidence\u201d of illegal activity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Coe, </em>231 Va. at 89, 340 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>S.E.2d at 824. This view enjoys the substantial support of other jurisdictions. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Napoleon, </em>12 Conn. App. 274, 284, 530 A.2d 634, 640, <em>cert. denied, </em>205 Conn. 809, 532 A.2d 78 (1987); <em>Hinnant </em>v. <em>United States, </em>520 A.2d 292, 294 (D.C. 1987); <em>Horton v. State, </em>194 Ga. App. 797, 798-99, 392 S.E.2d 259, 260 (1990); <em>State v. Tasker, </em>448 So. 2d 1311, 1314 (La. Ct. App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 So. 2d 644 (1984); <em>People v. Potter, </em>115 Mich. App. 125, 133, 320 N.W.2d 313, 317 (1982); <em>Stringer </em>v. <em>State, </em>557 So. 2d 796, 798 (Miss. 1990); <em>State v. Damon, </em>78 N.C. App. 421, 423-24, 337 S.E.2d 170, 171 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>51 N.C. App. 344, 349, 276 S.E.2d 501, 504-05 (1981). <em>But see Gillion </em>v. <em>State, </em>573 So. 2d 810, 811 (Fla. 1991); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>559 So. 2d 729 (Fla. Ct. App. 1990), <em>aff'd, </em>575 So. 2d 1292 (Fla. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Similar to <em>Coe, </em>this record provides abundant evidence that defendant possessed crack cocaine with the intent to distribute it. <em>See Monroe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 154, 156, 355 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1987). Thus, Chiota\u2019s characterization of the park as an \u201copen drug market\u201d was admissible as additional relevant evidence material to a prosecution for the offense. <em>See Wise </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 178,187-88, 367 S.E.2d 197,202-03 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">However, defendant complains that even if admissible, the testimony improperly suggested an awareness of the area\u2019s reputation and prejudiced him far beyond the probative value of that evidence. \u201cThe responsibility for balancing these competing considerations is largely within the sound discretion of the trial [court],\u201d and its \u201cruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of [that] discretion.\u201d <em>Coe, </em>231 Va. at 87, 340 S.E.2d at 823. Defendant had \u201cno right to have the evidence \u2018sanitized,\u2019\u201d and we cannot say that the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting relevant and material evidence. <em>See Scott </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 519, 526, 323 S.E.2d 572, 577 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Duff, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-9\"> We further recognize that the defendant\u2019s presence in a high crime area, standing alone, does not provide the requisite degree of suspicion to justify an investigatory stop. <em>See Riley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 494,498,412 S.E.2d 724,726 (1992); <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Va. App. 1100, 1104, 407 S.E.2d 49, 52 (1991); Goodwin v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 363, 367, 398 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1990). However, a defendant\u2019s presence in such a location may be a factor in evaluating criminal conduct. See also Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47,52 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-11\"> Judge Duff participated in the hearing and decision of this case prior to the effective date of his retirement on September 1,1992 and thereafter by designation pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-116.01.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
