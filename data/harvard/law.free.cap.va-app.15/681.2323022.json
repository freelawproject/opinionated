Finding that the commission\u2019s decision that Transpersonnel did not maintain its place of business in Virginia is not plainly wrong, we affirm the dismissal of Worsham\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Transpersonnel, Inc., an Illinois corporation, maintains its principal office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Transpersonnel is in the business of supplying interstate truck drivers to major companies. James N. Mills, Transpersonnel\u2019s eastern regional manager, testified that the company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Manpower, Inc. Transpersonnel is licensed to conduct business in Virginia, but has no offices or facilities in Virginia and does not pay any licensing fees in Virginia for trucks or equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The trucks that Transpersonnel\u2019s employees drive for Nabisco are leased by Nabisco from Ryder, a truck rental and leasing company. No showing was made of any contact with Virginia by Transpersonnel, except for the Transpersonnel drivers going to Nabisco\u2019s plant and driving away a Ryder-owned truck carrying Nabisco products.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Worsham was employed as a long distance truck driver in 1976 by Affiliated Drivers, which had a contract with Nabisco. This contract provided that Affiliated Drivers would supply drivers to Nabisco, and these drivers would then transport Nabisco products in a vehicle provided by Nabisco. Transpersonnel assumed Affiliated Drivers\u2019 contract with Nabisco in 1983. Worsham thus became a Transpersonnel employee. He received his instructions from Transpersonnel\u2019s eastern regional office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His paychecks were mailed to him at his home in Richmond from Transpersonnel\u2019s headquarters in Milwaukee.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">The applicable statute dealing with jurisdiction over foreign injuries and employers is Code \u00a7 65.2-508, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">When an accident happens while the employee is employed elsewhere than in this Commonwealth which would entitle him or his dependents to compensation if it had happened in this Commonwealth, the employee or his dependents shall be entitled to compensation, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">(1) The contract of employment was made in this Commonwealth; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\">(2) The employer\u2019s place of business is in this Commonwealth; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>provided the contract of employment was not expressly for service exclusively outside of the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The parties agree that the contract of employment was made in Virginia and that the services were not to be performed exclusively outside of this state. Thus, the issue is whether \u201cthe employer\u2019s place of business is in this Commonwealth.\u201d The term, \u201cemployer\u2019s place of business,\u201d is not defined in this title. Thus, we consider the term to determine its meaning, bearing in mind that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is remedial in nature and is to be construed in the light most favorable to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In <em>Coldtrain </em>v. <em>Starco, Inc. </em>65 O.I.C. 19 (1986), the commission found that a foreign employer maintained a place of business in Virginia when the employer merely maintained a storage trailer, that may have been used for clerical work at a job site in Quantico. The case involved a North Carolina corporation with its principal place of business in North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">We conclude that because the General Assembly used the term, \u201cemployer\u2019s place of business,\u201d it contemplated something other than the employer merely conducting business in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Worsham suggests that Nabisco is also Transpersonnel\u2019s place of business. However, this record does not contain proof of any facts concerning Transpersonnel\u2019s operation at Nabisco. Worsham was not required to live in Virginia. At the direction of his employer\u2019s dispatcher, who was located in Philadelphia, he would go to the Nabisco Company, pick up a load and usually drive it outside the Commonwealth. We do not decide in this case the precise meaning of the term, \u201cemployer\u2019s place of business.\u201d Instead, we merely hold that on the record before us concerning Transpersonnel\u2019s contact with Virginia, the commission was not plainly wrong in finding that Worsham did not prove that Transpersonnel\u2019s \u201cplace of business\u201d at the time of the accident was in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">Elder, J., and Fitzpatrick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
