He was sentenced, respectively, to imprisonment for three years and five years on those charges. On appeal, he contends that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress statements that he made after invoking his right to counsel. We find no error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">After his arrest on March 6, 1991, Bolding was interrogated at the Prince William County police station by Detective David Watson. The following dialogue occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">WATSON: Okay, before I ask you any questions, I\u2019m going to have to advise you of your rights. You have the right to remain silent, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">BOLDING: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">WATSON: Anything you say, can and will be used against you in court, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">BOLDING: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">WATSON: You have the right to consult with a lawyer before answering any questions, and have a lawyer with you during any questioning, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-15\">BOLDING: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-16\">WATSON: If you can not afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you free of cost if you want one, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-18\">BOLDING: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-19\">WATSON: Do you understand your rights as I have explained them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-21\">BOLDING: I understand my rights, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>WATSON: Are you willing to talk to me without consulting a lawyer or having a lawyer present with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU1\">BOLDING: Well, if, can I have a lawyer right this second?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdF\">WATSON: If you can get one here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACZ\">BOLDING: Uh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9s\">WATSON: If you can get one here, sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_I\">BOLDING: I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t have funds for a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7o\">WATSON: Well, I\u2019m not a judge. I can\u2019t appoint you a lawyer, alright? I can give you an opportunity to call one if you want though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac-\">BOLDING: Um, I, I can\u2019t afford one. I don\u2019t have the money to. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFa\">WATSON: Well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6v\">BOLDING: afford a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADY\">WATSON: Well, do you want to talk to me without having a lawyer present or do you want a lawyer here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAUa\">BOLDING: Yeah, I\u2019ll talk to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQT\">WATSON: You\u2019re sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af3\">BOLDING: I\u2019m just telling you now I can\u2019t afford a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjC\">WATSON: Well, if you can\u2019t afford a lawyer and the judge finds you in a position where you can\u2019t afford one then he\u2019ll appoint one but I\u2019m concerned with right here and now. Do you want to talk to me without having a lawyer here with you right now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-K\">BOLDING: Yes, I\u2019ll talk to you without having a lawyer here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Bolding then gave the statement he later sought to suppress. Denying the motion to suppress, the trial court found that Bolding\u2019s answers to Detective Watson\u2019s questions \u201c[were] not an unequivocal response, but [were] in fact an ambiguous response and [were] really a discussion of what his rights were and to the timing of obtaining an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. <em>477 </em>(1981), the Supreme Court held that an accused who, having been advised of his right to counsel, requests counsel or expresses his desire to deal with the police through counsel, cannot be questioned further unless counsel is made available to him or he initiates the further interrogation. In <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 397 S.E.2d 385 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>112 S. Ct. 88 (1991), the Virginia Supreme Court, discussing the applicability of <em>Edwards </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">[T]he <em>Edwards </em>rule is invoked . . . when the accused, having received Miranda warnings . . . , \u201chas <em>clearly </em>asserted his right to counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 253-54, 397 S.E.2d at 395-96 (citation omitted). <em>See also Poyner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 401, 410-11, 329 S.E.2d 815, 822-23, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 865 (1985); <em>Bunch v. Commonwealth, 225 </em>Va. 423, 432-34, 304 S.E.2d 271, 276-77, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 977 (1983); <em>Terrell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 285, 403 S.E.2d 387 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">In <em>Eaton, </em>the accused asked, \u201cYou did say I could have an attorney if I wanted one?\u201d The police responded that he did not have to tell them anything and that he had the right to an attorney if he wanted one. The Supreme Court held that Eaton\u2019s question fell short of the clear assertion required to invoke the <em>Edwards </em>rule. <em>Eaton, </em>240 Va. at 254, 397 S.E.2d at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">In <em>Poyner, </em>the accused asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say I have the right to an attorney?\u201d The police replied, \u201cYes.\u201d The interrogation continued. Holding the question not to be a request for counsel, the Supreme Court said, \u201cAt most, it sought to clarify one of the rights of which he had already been advised.\u201d <em>Poyner, 229 </em>Va. at 410, 329 S.E.2d at 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">In <em>Terrell, </em>the accused stated: \u201c(l)\u2018Well, I will have to get a lawyer I reckon;\u2019 (2) T am trying to get along with all of you, I know I didn\u2019t do all of this but I will get a lawyer;\u2019 (3) \u2018Well, I\u2019ll just have to get a lawyer and worry about it then;\u2019 and (4) T know I didn\u2019t do all this but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>I'll get a lawyer.\u2019 \u201d Affirming the trial court\u2019s holding that these statements did not invoke the <em>Edwards </em>rule, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">His statement did not represent a desire to have counsel present during the interrogation; he merely indicated that he wished to obtain counsel if charged with the crimes upon which he was being questioned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">12 Va. App. at 289-90, 403 S.E.2d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Bolding, having been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and having indicated that he fully understood them, inquired as to his right to assistance of counsel, but then voluntarily continued to discuss the case with Detective Watson. His question, \u201c[C]an I have a lawyer right this second?\u201d was neither a request for counsel nor a statement of unwillingness to proceed without counsel. It was merely a request for information. This conclusion is borne out by Bolding\u2019s further statement, \u201cI\u2019m just telling you now I can\u2019t afford a lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Detective Watson took care to ensure that Bolding understood his rights. He told him, \u201cWell, if you can\u2019t afford a lawyer and the judge finds you in a position where you can\u2019t afford one then he\u2019ll appoint one.\u201d Watson further asked, \u201cBut I\u2019m concerned with right here and now. Do you want to talk with me without having a lawyer here with you right now?\u201d Bolding replied, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll talk to you without having a lawyer here.\u201d This dialogue clearly supports the trial court\u2019s determination that Bolding did not assert his right to counsel and that the <em>Edwards </em>rule was not invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">Koontz, C.J., and Barrow, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
