States argues that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act) requires that this relationship be supported by \u201cthe existence of a contract between contractors,\u201d a circumstance which it denies in this instance. We agree with the commission and affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">The record discloses that Bush Construction Corporation (Bush) was \u201cemployed as the general contractor on a construction project,\u201d and, thereafter, subcontracted a portion of its undertaking to Eastern Roofing Corporation (Eastern). Eastern, \u201cin turn,\u201d subcontracted a measure of these responsibilities to Waymar Roofing and Sheetmetal, Inc. (Waymar), and Bush agreed to pay Eastern and Waymar, jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">Prior to its agreement with Bush, Eastern had assigned \u201call . . . accounts and contract rights, now existing or hereafter acquired,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>other assets, to Marepcon Financial Corporation (Marepcon), a \u201cwholly owned subsidiary of Norshipco,\u201d as security for \u201call present and future indebtedness\u201d of Eastern to Marepcon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">On February 9, 1990, after contracting with Bush, Eastern \u201cdefaulted on its financial obligations to Marepcon\u201d and Marepcon foreclosed, acquiring \u201call\u201d of Eastern\u2019s assets. These assets were then immediately \u201csold by\u201d Marepcon to States, another \u201cwholly owned subsidiary of Norshipco,\u201d \u201ccreated the same day\u201d to facilitate Norshipco\u2019s \u201cidentification and collection\u201d of \u201call the money that was available from the [Eastern] receivables,\u201d and \u201cminimize or . . . avoid\u201d additional financial loss on the Eastern credit. States anticipated that this effort would require its performance on certain of Eastern\u2019s contracts and possible continuation \u201cas a roofing company,\u201d if the undertaking proved profitable. Consequently, States immediately assumed occupancy of Eastern\u2019s business premises and hired \u201cmost\u201d of its former employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Within a week of this transaction, Bush received correspondence from States advising that it had \u201cpurchased the equipment, trade accounts receivable, contract rights and inventory of Eastern,\u201d but \u201cdid not assume any liability or obligation of Eastern.\u201d This was followed by further correspondence to Bush from W. Doyle Payne, Jr. (Payne), President of States, which \u201cannounce[d] the formation of States,\u201d \u201coffer[ed] the highest quality work\u201d and assured that States was \u201clooking forward to working with [Bush] on present and future contracts,\u201d \u201ceagerly awaiting the opportunity to work with [Bush].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Later, Payne personally communicated these intentions directly to Bush during a telephone conversation with its vice-president. Payne confirmed that States \u201cwanted to complete the [Eastern] contract,\u201d was \u201cgoing to take care of [Bush\u2019s] work,\u201d \u201chope[d] to get more work with [Bush]\u201d and \u201cwould like to plan on being one of [Bush\u2019s] subcontractors.\u201d Consistent with this promise, States shortly began to fulfill Eastern\u2019s obligations to Bush, submitted to Bush \u201crequisition forms\u201d for payment and accepted \u201cchecks payable to States Roofing and/or States Roofing and Waymar,\u201d all in accordance with the Eastern contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>In March 1990, Bush\u2019s \u201csuperintendent\u201d contacted States in an effort to \u201cget [Waymar] back on the job to finish their work.\u201d In response, States\u2019 vice-president complained to Waymar that States, \u201cas well as, Bush,\u201d had been \u201cunable to get . . . information about why work on this project has stopped\u201d and notified Waymar \u201cto proceed\u201d within \u201c72 hours ... or the contract w[ould] become void.\u201d Waymar assured States \u201cthat the work would be completed by April 7\u201d and \u201cput the men back on the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Thereafter, claimant, Waymar\u2019s employee, suffered a compensable injury while employed on the Bush project. Following this accident, States ordered Waymar not to \u201ccome [back] on the job\u201d and completed the \u201cwork covered under [Waymar\u2019s] subcontract\u201d with Eastern and Eastern\u2019s contract with Bush.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">On June 8, 1990, claimant filed an application for hearing with the commission. Having determined that Waymar was an uninsured employer, the commission added States, Bush and Eastern as parties defendant. After examining the several contractual relationships, the commission concluded that States \u201cfully assumed the role of Eastern,\u201d \u201cincluding Eastern\u2019s liability as statutory employer,\u201d \u201cboth in terms of its relationship with Bush and with Waymar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">On appellate review, we must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>Crisp </em>v. <em>Brown's Tysons Corner Dodge, Inc., </em>1 Va. App. 503, 504, 339 S.E.2d 916, 916 (1986). Factual findings by the commission, which are supported by credible evidence, are conclusive and binding upon this Court on appeal. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Red\u2019s Hitch &amp; Trailer Servs., Inc., </em>11 Va. App. 55, 60, 396 S.E.2d 392, 395 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>2 Va. App. 712, 714, 347 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Code \u00a7 65.2-302 (former Code \u00a7 65.1-29 to 65.1-31) provides that a \u201ccontractor\u201d becomes the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d of its subcontractor\u2019s employees whenever it engages such \u201c[subcontractor] ... for the execution or performance ... of the whole or any part of the work undertaken\u201d by the contractor and, therefore, is \u201cliable to pay to <em>any </em>worker employed in the work any compensation under [the Act]\u201d for which it \u201cwould have been liable ... if that worker had been immediately employed\u201d by such contractor, (emphasis added). The subcontractor similarly becomes the statutory employer of a sub-subcontractor\u2019s employees. Code \u00a7 65.2-302. Thus, employees of an uninsured sub-subcontractor may look to the subcontractor, and to the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>contractor, for coverage, although recovery is not permitted from both. Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-302, 65.2-303; <em>see also A.G. Van Metre, Jr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Gandy, </em>7 Va. App. 207,210, 372 S.E.2d 198, 200-01 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">States contends, however, that the liability of a statutory employer attaches only to Bush in this instance, because the requisite contractual relationship did not exist between States and either Bush or Waymar. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Generally, \u201c \u2018where one company sells or otherwise transfers all its assets to another company, the latter is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Madison Management Group, Inc., </em>918 F.2d 438, 450 (4th Cir. 1990) (quoting 15 W. Fletcher, <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations </em>\u00a7 7122, at 188 (rev. perm. ed. 1983)). This prevailing view has been the rule in Virginia for many years. <em>See People\u2019s Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>152 Va. 814, 819, 148 S.E. 828, 829 (1929); <em>see also Crawford Harbor Assocs. </em>v. <em>Blake Constr. Co., </em>661 F. Supp. 880, 883 (E.D. Va. 1987). However, the \u201cpurchasing corporation\u201d becomes liable for the obligations of the \u201cselling corporation\u201d when it appears that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">(1) the purchasing corporation expressly or impliedly agreed to assume such liabilities, (2) the circumstances surrounding the transaction warrant a finding that there was a consolidation or <em>de facto </em>merger of the two corporations, (3) the purchasing corporation is merely a continuation of the selling corporation, or (4) the transaction is fraudulent in fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\"><em>Harris v. T.I., Inc., </em>243 Va. 63, 70, 413 S.E.2d 605, 609 (1992); <em>Crawford Harbor Assocs., </em>661 F. Supp. at 883; <em>Pepper </em>v. <em>Dixie Splint Coal Co., </em>165 Va. 179, 191, 181 S.E. 406, 410 (1935); <em>People\u2019s Nat'l Bank, </em>152 Va. at 819, 148 S.E. at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">In <em>City of Richmond, </em>the Fourth Circuit concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that GHA, the purchasing corporation, \u201cimplicitly assumed\u201d the liabilities of Interpace, the selling corporation. 918 F.2d at 451. Noting that, among other things, GHA \u201ctook credit for Interpace\u2019s work on the project,\u201d \u201cassumed responsibility for completing the project,\u201d \u201cmade efforts to collect money under the project,\u201d \u201cparticipated in repairs\u201d on the project, and retained many Interpace employees, the court concluded that the evidence \u201csupported] an inference of GHA\u2019s implicit assumption of liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It described this determination as \u201cnecessarily fact-bound.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"AAf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>States\u2019 conduct here similarly manifested an implied agreement to assume Eastern\u2019s contractual liabilities with Waymar and Bush. States purchased Eastern\u2019s equipment, accounts receivable, contract rights and inventory, occupied its business premises and hired \u201cmost\u201d of its former employees. Payne, States\u2019 President, pledged \u201cto complete the [Eastern] contract\u201d with Bush, \u201cto take care of [Bush\u2019s] work ... to get more work with [Bush]\u201d and resumed the work. At Bush\u2019s request, States demanded that Waymar perform under the Eastern contract and threatened termination in the event of default. When Waymar withdrew from the project following claimant\u2019s injury, States performed \u201cunder [Waymar\u2019s] subcontract.\u201d Finally, as the work progressed, States prepared and submitted \u201crequisition forms\u201d to Bush, seeking and receiving payment pursuant to the Eastern contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Under such circumstances, States\u2019 reliance upon <em>Progressive Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Thumm, </em>209 Va. 24, 161 S.E.2d 687 (1968), is misplaced. In Progressive, the evidence failed as a matter of law to prove the existence of a contract because there was neither a \u201cdistinct intention common to both\u201d parties nor a common understanding as to contract terms. <em>Id. </em>at 30-31, 161 S.E.2d at 691. In contrast, the conduct of all parties in this instance manifested a clear understanding that States had assumed the Eastern contracts with both Bush and Waymar. States \u201creferred to the contracts]... in such terms as to leave no reasonable doubt but that it treated [them] as its own\u201d and all parties acquiesced in the relationship. <em>Economic Water Heating Corp. v. Dillon Supply </em>Co., 156 Va. 597, 604-05, 159 S.E. 78, 80 (1931). \u201cWhen a party assumes the contract, or undertaking, of another he makes it his contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606,159 S.E. at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">We thus find ample evidence to warrant the commission\u2019s conclusion that Eastern\u2019s contracts with Bush and Waymar were assumed by States, and that States was the statutory employer of claimant at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Accordingly, the decision of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Koontz, C.J., and Benton, X, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\"> This assignment was effected by a \u201cGENERAL ASSIGNMENT ACCOUNTS AND CONTRACT RIGHTS SECURITY AGREEMENT\u201d between Eastern, as \u201cAssignor,\u201d and Marepcon, acting under a fictitious name, as \u201cLender.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
