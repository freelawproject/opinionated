Harrel contends that the trial judge erred in finding (1) that the court obtained personal jurisdiction over him, (2) that the case was appropriate for a direct payment order, and (3) that the wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees of $2500 should be charged to Harrel. We reverse the judgment and dismiss the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">In 1976, the parties were granted a divorce by decree of the circuit court. The decree affirmed, ratified, and incorporated the parties\u2019 separation agreement, which, among other things, fixed child support for each of the three minor children at $100 a month per child and spousal support at $600 a month. When the decree was entered, however, the child support payments were reduced by the circuit judge to the sum of $50 a month per child. The decree also transferred the matter to the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court for enforcement, modification, or revision, all matters pertaining to spousal support, child support, and custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">Fourteen years later, on April 11, 1990, Preston filed an affidavit with the juvenile court claiming an arrearage of $84,316.77. On May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>30, 1990, Preston filed a document styled Notice and Petition for Entry of Spousal and Child Support Employer Direct Pay Order. The record also contains a document styled \u201cProof of Service,\u201d which states that \u201ca true copy of the Notice of Entry of Spousal and Child Support Employer Direct Pay Order with attached Affidavit\u201d was delivered to Harrel in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Stapled to the \u201cProof of Service\u201d is a draft of a proposed order determining the amount of support owed by Harrel and ordering direct payment from Harrel\u2019s retirement pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Harrel made a special appearance in the juvenile court to contest jurisdiction. The juvenile court judge overruled his plea to jurisdiction and stated that Virginia continued to have jurisdiction over this matter because \u201cthe parties were divorced in Virginia, the Virginia court had personal jurisdiction over [Harrel] at that time, [Preston] effected personal service ... upon [Harrel] in Oklahoma, that the court has continuing jurisdiction over [Harrel] and that the service of process was valid.\u201d The juvenile court judge entered judgment against Harrel for $84,316.74 in arrearages and $1,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. However, the juvenile court judge\u2019s order did not contain a provision allowing a deduction against Harrel\u2019s naval retirement pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Preston noted an appeal to the circuit court. Harrel again made a special appearance to contest jurisdiction. Harrel\u2019s jurisdiction plea was overruled. After a hearing, the circuit judge ordered Harrel to pay $84,316.77 in arrearages, ordered that the arrearages were subject to a direct pay order as allowed by Code \u00a7 20-79.1, and ordered Harrel to pay $2,500 of Preston\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">It is well settled that a plaintiff is not entitled to \u201ca judgment <em>in personam </em>to extra-territorial effect if it be made to appear that it was rendered without jurisdiction over the person sought to be bound.\u201d <em>May v. Anderson, </em>345 U.S. 528, 533 (1953). Therefore, we must first consider Harrel\u2019s claim that Virginia courts did not obtain jurisdiction over his person because of faulty service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">A court in Virginia may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who has:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">(i) executed an agreement in this Commonwealth which obligates the person to pay spousal support or child support to a domiciliary of this Commonwealth, . . . [or] (ii) been ordered to pay spousal support or child support pursuant to an order entered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>any court of competent jurisdiction in this Commonwealth having <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over such person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1(A)(8) (emphasis added). However, at the time this matter was instituted in the juvenile court in 1990, \u201c[jjurisdiction in subdivision 8(i) [and] 8(ii) [of Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1(A)] . . . [was] valid only upon proof of service of process pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 8.01-296 on the nonresident party by a person authorized under the provision of [Code] \u00a7 8.01-320.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1(A)(9).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">Personal service of a process on a nonresident person outside the Commonwealth may be made by: (i) any person authorized to serve process in the jurisdiction where the party to be served is located; or (ii) any person eighteen years of age or older who is not a party or otherwise interested in the subject matter of the controversy and notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, such person need not be authorized by the circuit court to serve process which commences divorce or annulment actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Code \u00a7 8.01-320(A). Harrel contends that the record fails to establish that the service of process complied with these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, \u00a7 2004(C)(1)(A) (1988), \u201ca sheriff or deputy sheriff, a person licensed to make service of process in civil cases, or a person specifically appointed for that purpose\u2019 \u2019 may serve process in a civil case. The record contains an affidavit entitled \u201cProof of Service\u201d which indicates that \u201cYvette D. Cox\u201d made \u201cpersonal service of Francis Leon Harrel\u201d on June 5, 1990 at 11:30 a.m. at 5333 South Hudson Place in Tulsa, Oklahoma. On that affidavit, the phrase \u201cP.SL 89-128\u201d was written next to Cox\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">The record does not contain any evidence that Cox was a sheriff, a deputy sheriff, a person licensed to make service of process in a civil case, or specially appointed to serve process. The writing, \u2018 \u2018P.SL 89-128,\u201d which follows Cox\u2019s name is unexplained. Preston asserts that those items represent Cox\u2019s license. However, nothing in the affidavit states that it is her licensing number or states Cox is licensed to make service of process. Nothing in Oklahoma\u2019s statutory scheme explains the significance of that phrase. In the absence of evidence in the record stating Cox\u2019s qualifications, the trial judge had no basis upon which to conclude that Cox was authorized to make service of process in Oklahoma. Accordingly, we hold that the record does not prove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>proof of service was made in Oklahoma by a person authorized to serve process by Oklahoma\u2019s statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Code \u00a7 8.01-325 requires that when notice is served by someone other than a police officer, that person shall return proof of service <em>whether the service is made inside or outside the Commonwealth, </em>which must include an affidavit stating that person\u2019s qualifications, the date of service, the manner of service, and the name of the person served. Nothing in the record established that Cox was licensed as a personal process server in Oklahoma or that she was over eighteen years of age, not a party, or not interested in this action. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-328, 8.01-325, and 8.01-293. Thus, the proof of service failed to establish Cox was qualified to serve process under Virginia\u2019s procedural requirements. \u201cA court acquires no jurisdiction over the person of a defendant until process is served in the manner provided by statute.\u201d <em>Slaughter v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 787, 791, 284 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1981). Because service of process was invalid, the court did not acquire personal jurisdiction over Harrel. <em>Id. </em>at 792, 284 S.E.2d at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The direct payment order and related attorney\u2019s fees order were incidental to and dependent upon the adjudication of arrearages and, thus, entered without the requisite personal jurisdiction. For these reasons, they also are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Koontz, C.J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
