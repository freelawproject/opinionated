The guardian appeals, contending that (1) the trial court abused its discretion in denying her motion for a continuance, (2) the cause was not justiciable under Code \u00a7 8.01-184, and (3) the trial court lacked the jurisdiction necessary to terminate the relationship between Jane and Baby Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>The record discloses that Baby Doe was bom to Jane on July 31, 1991. The birth followed the in vitro fertilization of an ovum from Mary with the semen of her husband, John, implanted into the uterus of Jane at the Genetics and IVF Institute (institute). This arrangement was in accordance with the terms of a written agreement between John and Mary and Jane and her husband, Richard (Richard), and no dispute exists between these parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Nevertheless, seeking a judicial determination of the respective rights of all parties in interest, John and Mary filed a \u201cBill of Complaint for Declaratory Judgment\u201d on August 2, 1991, which requested the court to (i) declare them the \u201clawful parents\u201d of Baby Doe, (ii) terminate the parental rights of Jane and Richard, and (iii) order the Registrar to issue an appropriate Certificate of Birth. Jane and Richard responded and consented to the proposed relief, while the Registrar, acting through the Attorney General, expressed no position on the merits of the suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The guardian, however, denied the allegations that Baby Doe was \u201cnot the biological child of Jane\u201d and that \u201cDNA testing\u201d had \u201cconclusively establish[ed] [a] genetic . . . link between\u201d the infant and John and Mary.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">John and Mary immediately requested \u201can expedited hearing\u201d to resolve the \u201clegal status\u201d of the child and facilitate the issuance of a birth certificate. The guardian objected, claiming an inadequate opportunity to prepare for trial, and moved for a continuance. The trial court overruled this motion and heard the case on August 6, 1991, four days after institution of the action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the hearing, Dr. Daniel B. Demers (Demers), \u201cdirector of the identity testing laboratory\u201d at the institute, testified that \u201cDNA testing\u201d of the appropriate parties had confirmed, \u201c[wjithout a doubt,\u201d that John and Mary were \u201cthe biological parents\u201d of Baby Doe. The court found this, and the other uncontradicted evidence, \u201cclear and convincing\u201d that John and Mary were Baby Doe\u2019s \u201cbiological and genetic parents\u201d and ordered the Registrar to \u201crecord John and Mary Doe as the true and lawful parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>of Baby Doe on [the] Birth Certificate,\u201d thus terminating Jane and Richard\u2019s \u201ctraditional parental rights.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">We first address the guardian\u2019s contention that the trial court abused its discretion when it overruled her motion for a continuance. She argues that, without \u201ctime to investigate the matter\u201d and properly prepare for trial, Baby Doe was denied her basic due process right to be heard in a proceeding of critical importance to the infant. U.S. Const, amend. XIV; Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-9(A) requires a guardian <em>ad litem </em>to \u201cfaithfully represent the estate or oilier interest of the person under a disability for whom he is appointed,\u201d and imposes the \u201cduty\u201d upon the court to \u201csee that [such] interest ... is so represented and protected.\u201d \u201cThe courts of the Commonwealth have a long history of protecting the interests of minor children,\u201d and this statute only further assures that their \u201crights and interests\u201d are \u201csafeguarded.\u201d <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Gray </em>v. <em>Johnson, 7 </em>Va. App. 614, 623, 376 S.E.2d 787, 792 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Guardians must represent infants \u201cearnestly and vigorously and not merely in a perfunctory manner.\u201d <em>Norfolk Div. of Social Servs. v. Unknown Father, </em>2 Va. App. 420, 425 n.5, 345 S.E.2d 533, 536 n.5 (1986); <em>see also Stanley v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>10 Va. App. 596, 603, 395 S.E.2d 199, 203 (1990), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>242 Va. 60,405 S.E.2d 621 (1991); <em>Ruffin v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 488, 494, 393 S.E.2d 425, 429 (1990). To discharge this responsibility properly, a guardian is expected to \u201cinvestigate thoroughly\u201d and \u201ccarefully examine [] the facts surrounding the case.\u201d <em>Ruffin, </em>10 Va. App. at 495, 393 S.E.2d at 429. Inadequate representation of an infant is tantamount to no representation and may deny a child \u201chis or her day in court, and the fundamental due process right to be heard.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>7 Va. App. at 623, 376 S.E.2d at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">In the case at bar, the guardian was confronted with unusual circumstances which involved issues of great importance to her infant charge. By requesting a continuance, the guardian sought only a reasonable opportunity to undertake a \u201cbona fide examination of the facts,\u201d <em>Unknown Father, </em>2 Va. App. at 425 n.5, 345 S.E.2d at 536 n.5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>properly prepare Baby Doe\u2019s case and otherwise \u201cconscientiously fulfil^] the duties [of her] appointment,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428, 345 S.E.2d at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Generally, continuances rest \u201cwithin the sound discretion of a trial court, and its ruling will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Lomax </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 168, 172, 319 S.E.2d 763, 765 (1984). However, in a criminal case, an accused must not be denied a \u201cfair and impartial trial\u201d or deprived of the constitutional right \u201c \u2018to call for evidence in his favor\u2019 \u201d by the exercise of this discretion. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in a civil case, a trial court shall not deny a continuance, if, to do so, \u201c\u2018seriously imperil[s] the just determination of the cause.\u2019\u201d <em>Mills v. Mills, </em>232 Va. 94, 96, 348 S.E.2d 250, 252 (1986) (quoting <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Trice, </em>86 Va. 835, 842, 11 S.E. 428, 430 (1890)). The summary proceedings in this instance so prejudiced and impaired Baby Doe\u2019s due process rights that the resulting order must be reversed. <em>Venable </em>v. <em>Venable, </em>2 Va. App. 178, 181, 342 S.E.2d 646, 648 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Because this matter is remanded, we will consider the guardian\u2019s contention that the cause presented no \u201cactual controversy\u201d and, thus, failed to comply with Code \u00a7 8.01-184, the declaratory judgment statute. The assumption of jurisdiction in declaratory judgment is a matter that rests with the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Chaffinch v. C&amp;P Tel. Co., </em>227 Va. 68, 72, 313 S.E.2d 376, 378 (1984). The existence of a controversy \u201cis a question of fact,\u201d that \u201cmay be shown by the pleadings.\u201d <em>Yukon Pocahontas Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Ratliff, </em>175 Va. 366, 368, 8 S.E.2d 303, 304 (1940). The record discloses that the guardian\u2019s \u201c[a]nswer\u201d denied material allegations in the Bill of Complaint, creating the spectre of an \u201cactual controversy\u201d in satisfaction of the statutory requirement. Under such circumstances, the trial court properly entertained the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The guardian further complains that the suit omitted necessary parties defendant. However, this argument was not asserted before the trial court, and \u201cthe parties . . . must give the trial court the first opportunity to rule on disputed evidentiary and procedural questions.\u201d <em>Gardner v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 418, 423, 350 S.E.2d 229, 232 (1986); Rule 5A:18. An issue not in dispute before the trial court will not be considered for the first time on appeal. Rule 5A:18; <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 591, 593, 405 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1991). Thus, we are now precluded from reviewing this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Lastly, the guardian asserts that the trial court lacked the \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d necessary to terminate Baby Doe\u2019s parental relationship with her birth mother. The Bill of Complaint, however, requested \u201ca declaratory judgment as to the maternity and paternity of Defendant Baby Doe,\u201d \u201cpursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 20-49.2 and 8.01-184.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-49.2 provides that the \u201cdetermination of parentage, when raised in <em>any </em>proceeding, shall be governed by [Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-49.1 to 20-49.8, Proceedings to Determine Parentage],\u201d and empowers circuit courts with \u201cconcurrent original jurisdiction of cases arising under this chapter.\u201d (emphasis added). Manifestly, the trial court was not divested of this authority simply because the issue was presented through a declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We recognize that the General Assembly recently enacted Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-156 through 20-165 to address the status of children born as a result of surrogacy contracts, as well as related issues. However, the effective date of legislation is July 1, 1993, and Code \u00a7 20-49.2 remains an appropriate vehicle in these circumstances to resolve parentage of children conceived before that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Barrow, J., and Duff, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\"> In a \u201cMemorandum of Law\u201d filed with the court, the Registrar did, however, urge the court to \u201creview the evidence\u201d and determine parentage pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-49.1 to 20-49.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\"> Subsequent motions by the guardian to vacate the order and rehear the matter were also overruled by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b279-9\"> \u2018 \u2018The parent and child relationship between a child and woman <em>may </em>be established <em>prima facie </em>by proof of her having given birth to the child ...\u201d (emphasis added).
