(appellants) appeal from an award by the Industrial Commission compensating Carter McKinnon Parks (claimant) for temporary total work incapacity beginning September 15, 1989, and continuing. Appellants assert (1) that the commission erred in entering an award based on an \u201coccupational disease,\u201d when as a matter of law there was not a disease but instead a noncompensable cumulative injury, and (2) that no credible evidence supported the commission\u2019s conclusion that there was an occupational disease. We find no merit in the arguments urged on us by appellants and affirm the commission\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>On January 10, 1981, while employed as a maintenance mechanic at Merillat, claimant suffered the permanent loss of the use of his right hand and received temporary total compensation benefits through April 14, 1986, the day he returned to Merillat to work as a \u201cwire hanger.\u201d Claimant\u2019s new position required him to remove from a conveyor belt bundled wire hangers and doors weighing up to twenty-five pounds. It also involved repetitive overhead lifting. He held the job until September 6, 1989, when he stopped working due to pain in his left shoulder and chest area.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Claimant consulted a series of medical specialists about his shoulder. After examining him, two orthopedists reached similar conclusions. Dr. Larry G. Lipscomb diagnosed claimant as having \u201can impingement syndrome and in all probability [a] rotator cuff tear.\u201d Dr. Melvin L. Heiman found \u201ca .typical impingement problem with AC joint arthritis and roughening of the rotator cuff.\u201d A cardiologist, Dr. Harrison D. Turner, ruled out cardiovascular problems as the cause of the pain. Concluding that the problem was of a musculoskeletal nature, Dr. Turner recommended that claimant be medically retired in order to prevent \u201cfurther injury to the area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Claimant filed a claim for an occupational disease of his left shoulder, asking for a finding of temporary total work incapacity beginning September 15, 1989, and continuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Dr. Heiman, one of the two orthopedists who examined claimant, diagnosed his condition as \u201can occupational disease.\u201d Dr. Heiman also reported that \u201c[t]his type of illness is not a disease such as cancer, but is in fact an overuse syndrome related to the type of employment Mr. Parks was engaged in.\u201d The second orthopedist, Dr. Lipscomb, stated that he \u201cwould put it into the injury category.\u201d Merillat\u2019s counsel submitted medical records to other orthopedists. Dr. William A. Mcllwain determined from these records that claimant had suffered not from a disease but from an \u201cinjury from repetitive use.\u201d Dr. Joseph K. Maloy concluded that claimant had suffered not from a disease but from \u201cstress disorder.\u201d Neither Dr. Mcllwain nor Dr. Maloy examined claimant personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>In its opinion of January 11, 1991, the commission reasoned that claimant suffered from an occupational disease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commission stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">[a]s the parties are aware, the Commission has awarded numerous cases of carpal tunnel syndrome as an occupational disease depending on the evidence, and we have a problem distinguishing this claimant\u2019s rotator cuff tear or impingement syndrome from a carpal tunnel syndrome that has developed through repetitive motions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The commission further noted that \u201c[tjhere is no evidence in the record of the claimant\u2019s activity outside of the employment contributing to his shoulder problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Appellants assert that the commission erred when it entered an award based on an \u201coccupational disease,\u201d when as a matter of law there was no disease but, instead, a noncompensable cumulative injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The commission\u2019s reliance on cases in which a claimant suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome was found to have sustained an occupational disease can be traced to the holding of this Court in <em>Knott </em>v. <em>Blue Bell, Inc., </em>7 Va. App. 335, 373 S.E.2d 481 (1988). In <em>Knott, </em>we held that, once each of the six conditions set out in Code \u00a7 65.1-46 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>(now Code \u00a7 65.2-400) has been met, the commission may conclude that a claimant\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome is an occupational disease. However, because our holding in <em>Knott </em>flowed from an \u201cexamination of Code \u00a7 65.1-46 as it appeared prior to the legislative changes effective July 1, 1986,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 337, 373 S.E.2d at 482, and because of the consequential impact of those legislative changes, we must address anew the question whether a condition gradually incurred as a result of repeated work-related trauma may be deemed an occupational disease under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Claims for compensation for an occupational disease arising after the General Assembly revised the statutory definitions of both an occupational disease and an ordinary disease of life will be determined by those new definitions, as well as the legislative intent that spawned them. To identify that intent, we set the 1986 revisions in their historical context.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">In <em>Western Electric Co. v. Gilliam, </em>229 Va. 245, 329 S.E.2d 13 (1985), the Virginia Supreme Court reversed a finding by the Industrial Commission that a claimant\u2019s tenosynovitis was an occupational disease. Tenosynovitis, an overuse syndrome in this instance, resulted from \u201crepeated, work-related trauma.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247, 329 S.E.2d at 14. The Court accepted the commission\u2019s \u201cfactual finding\u201d that tenosynovitis is a disease. <em>Id. </em>However, interpreting the statutory provisions in effect prior to the changes of July 1, 1986, it ruled that a disease \u201cgradually-incurred on account of repeated, work-related trauma\u201d is not an occupational disease but an ordinary disease of life. <em>Id. </em>Thus, under the statutory definitions then in effect, the condition was not compensable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">While the Court in <em>Gilliam </em>accepted \u201cthe factual finding\u201d by the commission that the claimant\u2019s tenosynovitis was a disease as opposed to an injury,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it rejected the commission\u2019s finding that this disease was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u201coccupational.\u201d Instead, a disease \u201cwhich had its origin in repeated, work-related trauma, was an ordinary disease of life.\u201d <em>Gilliam, 229 </em>Va. at 247, 329 S.E.2d at 14 (footnote omitted). However, interpreting \u201clegislative intent as reflected in the totality of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act <em>as it exists today,\u201d id. </em>(emphasis in original) (footnote omitted), the Court expressed a reluctance to hold that the Act extended compensation to disabilities resulting from \u201cdiseases caused gradually by repeated trauma.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247-48, 329 S.E.2d at 14.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">[Sjuch a consequential decision, impacting as it must a broad spectrum of economic and social values, is a matter of public policy reserved to the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the General Assembly, and we will not trespass on its domain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 248, 329 S.E.2d at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">In the wake of <em>Gilliam, </em>a joint subcommittee comprised of members of the House Committee on Labor and Commerce and members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor reviewed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act with an eye to possible revision. The central question addressed in a series of meetings held in 1985 and 1986 was \u201cwhether the Supreme Court reasonably interpreted the definition of \u2018occupational disease\u2019 in <em>Gilliam.\u201d </em>H. Doc. No. 27, at 3 (1986). From these discussions emerged revisions to the statutory definitions of \u201coccupational disease\u201d and \u201cordinary disease of life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">A report tracing the history of the subcommittee\u2019s work, and creating the context in which the eventual revisions must be understood, set out the various alternatives considered by the subcommittee. Among these was an amendment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">which would exempt any conditions originating or arising within the muscular, ligamentous, or skeletal system so as to draw a line where the Supreme Court makes its determinations in cases involving such systems. It was explained that this would eliminate \u201cwear and tear\u201d conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">H. Doc. No. 27, at 8 (1986). The joint subcommittee in fact proposed such an amendment. In its final recommendations it expressly favored language exempting from coverage \u201cany conditions originating or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>arising within the muscular, ligamentous, or skeletal system\u201d over less restrictive language exempting only \u201cconditions of the neck, back or spinal column.\u201d The subcommittee felt that, were it to recommend less restrictive language, the proposed bill \u201cwould put the Industrial Commission back into the position it was in prior to <em>Gilliam </em>yet the joint subcommittee felt that language should be more restrictive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The joint subcommittee thus sent a clear message .that \u2018 \u2018wear and tear conditions\u201d should be exempt from coverage under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Just as clearly, the General Assembly rejected that recommendation when it enacted into law language exempting conditions of the back, neck, and spinal column only. Code \u00a7 65.1-46 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-400). Understood in light of those background considerations expressly set out in the joint subcommittee\u2019s report, the plain intent of the legislature in adopting the less restrictive language was to \u201cput the Industrial Commission back into the position it was in prior to <em>Gilliam.''</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">During the hearings held before the joint subcommittee, the Industrial Commission summarized its <em>pre-Gilliam </em>approach to ordinary diseases of life.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">The Industrial Commission informed the subcommittee that the feeling at the Commission prior to <em>Gilliam </em>was that even though a claimant\u2019s disease was \u201can ordinary disease of life\u201d it could be compensated if all six conditions specified in \u00a7 65.1-46 were met. . . . They pointed out that over the years they have made a conscious effort to show a causal connection between the disease and the work before awarding claims and that they felt the system worked fairly for both the injured employee and the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">H. Doc. No. 27, at 5 (1986). Just as the Industrial Commission was guided by the principle of causality, so too will we be guided as we apply the 1986 revisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and interpret the legislative intent that inspired them.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">The revision of Code \u00a7 65.1-46 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-400), which defines occupational diseases, and the enactment of Code \u00a7 65.1-46.1 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-401), which identifies those ordinary diseases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>life that may be treated as occupational diseases, introduced new language to govern the compensability of occupational diseases. However, because we hold that claimant\u2019s shoulder condition is compensable as an occupational disease under Code \u00a7 65.1-46 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-400), in the same way that it would have been <em>pre-Gilliam, </em>we do not decide whether his condition might also be an ordinary disease of life under Code \u00a7 65.1-46.1 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-401).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In order for a disease to be compensable under Code \u00a7 65.1-46 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-400), each of six conditions must be met. Only one of these conditions underwent significant revision in 1986. Prior to 1986, Code \u00a7 65.1-46(4) read, \u201cIt does not come from a hazard to which workmen would have been equally exposed outside of the employment.\u201d In 1986, this provision was amended to read, \u201cIt is neither a disease to which an employee may have had substantial exposure outside of the employment, nor any condition of the neck, back or spinal column.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-46(4) (now Code \u00a7 65.2-400(B)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Following the 1986 amendment, if a claimant\u2019s occupational disease may have resulted from substantial exposure outside of the employment, that claimant must meet the more rigorous standard of proof set out in Code \u00a7 65.1-46.1 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-401).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, where, as here, there is no suggestion that claimant\u2019s condition resulted from exposure outside of his employment, we need not look beyond the four comers of Code \u00a7 65.1-46 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-400).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">In <em>Gilliam, </em>the Supreme Court held that a disease \u201cwhich had its origin in repeated, work-related trauma, was an ordinary disease of life.\u201d <em>Gilliam, </em>229 Va. at 247, 329 S.E.2d at 14 (footnote omitted). In light of the previous discussion, it is clear that the General Assembly intended to \u201cput the Industrial Commission back into the position it was in prior to Gilliam.\u201d H. Doc. No. 27, at 8 (1986). Prior to <em>Gilliam, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>the Industrial Commission treated wear and tear conditions as occupational diseases, compensable under Code \u00a7 65.1-46 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-400). Because of the General Assembly\u2019s plain intent to revert to the commission\u2019s <em>pre-Gilliam </em>approach, if a claimant\u2019s condition is compensable under Code \u00a7 65.1-46 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-400), we need not reach the question whether such condition may also be an ordinary disease of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In order to establish that his condition is compensable, a claimant must prove an injury. Code \u00a7 65.1-7 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-101) defines an injury as either an injury by accident or an occupational disease \u201carising out of and in the course of the employment,\u201d but not including \u201ca disease in any form, except when it results naturally and unavoidably from either of the foregoing causes.\u201d Here, claimant\u2019s condition is not an injury by accident. <em>See Morris v. Morris, </em>238 Va. 578, 385 S.E.2d 858 (1989) (holding that injuries from repetitive trauma are not injuries by accident).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Code \u00a7 65.1-46 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-400) provides that, in order for an occupational disease to be compensable, each of six factors must be established. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra. </em>In an August 7, 1990, opinion, the deputy commissioner reviewed the history of this case and found that, based on evidence satisfying each of the six conditions set out in Code \u00a7 65.1-46 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-400), claimant\u2019s disease was an occupational disease arising out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The commission expressly upheld these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u201c \u2018Whether a disease is causally related to the employment and not causally related to other factors is ... a finding of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ross Lab., </em>13 Va. App. at 377, 412 S.E.2d at 208 (quoting <em>Island Creek Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Breeding, </em>6 Va. App. 1, 12, 365 S.E.2d 782, 788 (1988)). \u201cWhen there is credible evidence to support it, such a finding is \u2018conclusive and binding\u2019 on this court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We see nothing in the evidence to undermine the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant\u2019s condition flowed from his employment as a natural consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Koontz, C.J., and Coleman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-14\"> An unpublished memorandum opinion was released in this case on March 31, 1992. Said opinion was withdrawn by this Court on April 17, 1992, prior to the issuance of the Court\u2019s mandate. The withdrawal was caused by an opinion which was to be published by another panel of this Court which involved similar issues. <em>See Holly Farms Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>15 Va. App. 29,422 S.E.2d 165(1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b81-9\"> Code \u00a7 65.1-46 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-400), which defines the term \u201coccupational disease,\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">As used in this Act, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term \u201coccupational disease\u201d means a disease arising out of and in the course of employment, <em>but not an ordinary disease of life </em>to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-12\">A disease shall be deemed to arise out of the employment only if there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-13\">(1) A direct causal connection between the conditions under which work is performed and the occupational disease,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-14\">(2) It can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-15\">(3) It can be fairly traced to the employment as the proximate cause,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-16\">(4) It is neither a disease to which an employee may have had substantial exposure outside of the employment, nor any condition of the neck, back or spinal column,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-17\">(5) It is incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of employer and employee, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-18\">(6) It had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and flowed from that source as a natural consequence, though it need not have been foreseen or expected before its contraction.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b82-9\"> It is significant that the Supreme Court did not reject the commission\u2019s finding that the condition at issue was a disease. By contrast, just six months earlier, in <em>Holly Farms </em>v. <em>Yancey, </em>228 Va. 337, 321 S.E.2d 298 (1984), the Court rejected outright a finding by the commission that a claimant\u2019s back strain was a disease. In so holding, the Court in <em>Yancey </em>relied on fifty years of case history in which back strains, such as those complained of by the claimant, had been treated \u201cas injuries, not as diseases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340-41, 321 S.E.2d at 300. In other words, in view of the case history governing back strains, courts were not free to treat a \u201c[sjtrain of the muscles or tendons in the back . . . due to a single or repeated . . . trauma\u201d as a disease. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 321 S.E.2d at 300. Nonetheless, as <em>Gilliam </em>suggests, the Industrial Commission <em>was </em>free to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u201cfactual finding\u201d that a condition not involving back strain, but \u201cgradually-incurred on account of repeated work-related trauma,\u201d was a disease. 229 Va. at 247, 329 S.E.2d at 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\"> Code \u00a7 65.1-46.1 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-401) allows an \u201cordinary disease of life,\u201d or one \u201cto which the general public is exposed outside of the employment,\u201d to be treated as an occupational disease</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">if it is established by clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable medical certainty, that it arose out of and in the course of employment as provided in \u00a7 65.1-46 with respect to occupational diseases and did not result from causes outside of the employment, and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">1.
