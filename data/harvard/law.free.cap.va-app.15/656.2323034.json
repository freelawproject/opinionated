Strother (claimant) permanent and total disability benefits for loss of use of a scheduled member pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-503 (formerly \u00a7 65.1-56).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The employer contends that insufficient evidence supports the finding that the claimant reached maximum medical improvement and that the commission erred in holding that it was not necessary to have a specific rating for permanent partial loss of use of the legs when such disability is derivative of an earlier compensable back injury. We hold that sufficient evidence supports the finding that Strother had reached maximum medical improvement. However, we agree with the employer that a specific incapacity rating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>is required before permanent partial or total disability benefits may be awarded. Accordingly, we reverse the commission\u2019s award and dismiss the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In December 1979 the claimant received an award of temporary total disability benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-500 for a compensable back injury. These benefits ended in May 1989. On January 5, 1990, the claimant filed a claim for permanent and total disability benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-503, which provides that lifetime benefits may be awarded for the loss of various ratable members of the body, including the legs. He based his claim on the assertion that, due to the functional loss of use of his legs from his low back injury, he could not engage in any gainful employment. The application was denied by the deputy commissioner on the ground that, because there was no permanency rating, the claimant failed to show that he was entitled to disability benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-503. The full commission reversed and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">in this case of first impression that it is not necessary that there be a specific rating of permanent partial disability to the legs which is based on the back injury. It is sufficient if the back injury results in a substantial loss of the legs to the extent that they cannot be used in any substantial degree in any gainful employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The commission further held that, because the claimant could not engage in any gainful employment, his incapacity was total.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">On October 17, 1979, the claimant, while working for Cafaro Construction, was injured in the process of lifting a pump with a coworker. The pump slipped from the co-worker\u2019s hands, \u201cjerking\u201d the claimant and causing injury to his lower back. As a result, the claimant suffers from back pain radiating into his legs, inhibiting his ability to ambulate and work. In the ten years since his accident, he has undergone four surgical procedures performed to address herniation of the disc at L4-L5, the most recent being in January 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">MAXIMUM MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">The record contains conflicting medical opinions on whether the claimant had reached maximum medical improvement to his back and derivatively to his legs. On February 27, 1990, Dr. Neal A. Green, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>orthopaedic surgeon, performed an independent medical examination on the claimant. Dr. Green concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">Due to the severity of [the claimant\u2019s] injuries, particularly due to his ruptured discs and significant involvement of both lower extremities, he is totally incapacitated from working. His current situation is causally related to the injuries sustained in the 10-lb-79 accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In addition, Dr. Green testified during a July 23, 1990 deposition that in his opinion the claimant had reached maximum medical improvement. Employer\u2019s counsel specifically questioned Dr. Green on this issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">Q. Is there anything that can be done medically to improve Mr. Strother\u2019s condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">A. I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">Q. He has reached his maximum medical improvement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">A. I would agree with that opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">The claimant\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Richard E. Ranels, in a report dated March 26, 1990, disagreed and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-12\">A question of maximum medical improvement is raised and it does appear that from a review of the notes of 1989 [the claimant] has continued to show some improvement in serial examinations especially when compared to the examinations of Winter 1989. On the other hand, Mr. Strother subjectively feels that he has worsened over the last four or five months and continues to seek a surgical cure for his pain syndrome which I have expressed to him that after four surgeries this does not appear to be feasible and that he will always have to deal with some back discomfort. I\u2019ve also indicated that he needs to become more involved and seek out gainful daily activities for both his emotional and physical wellbeing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-13\">A disability rating cannot be given at this time in that objective improvement appears, from all the data provided, to be continuing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">As to the extent of the claimant\u2019s disability and whether he can engage in any gainful employment, Dr. Ranels concluded that the claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>\u201cis able to use his body and specifically his legs and back in a significant fashion that would suffice for gainful employment as long as he is provided with mild, light work activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Additional medical evidence was presented from several other physicians who have examined or treated the claimant, including evidence from Dr. Donald D. Davidson who performed a disc excision (laminectomy) on the claimant in November 1979. In a report dated September 29, 1989.. Dr. Davidson opined that the claimant \u201cis completely and totally disabled from his chronic back syndrome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">\u201cA question raised by conflicting medical opinion is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Powell, </em>2 Va. App. 712, 714, 347 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1986) (citing <em>Pocahontas Fuel Co. </em>v. <em>Agee, </em>201 Va. 678, 680, 112 S.E.2d 835, 837 (1960); <em>Estep v. Blackwood Fuel Co., </em>185 Va. 695, 699, 40 S.E.2d 181, 183 (1946); <em>Celanese Fibers Co. v. Johnson, </em>229 Va. 117, 120, 326 S.E.2d 687, 690 (1985)). Accordingly, the commission could properly accept those medical opinions most favorable to the claimant and, if appropriate, disregard others. On review by this Court, we examine the record to ascertain whether credible evidence supports the finding that the claimant had reached maximum medical improvement. \u201cThe fact that there is contrary evidence in the record is of no consequence if there is credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Wagner Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>12 Va. App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991) (citing <em>Franklin Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Walker, 6 </em>Va. App. 108, 110-11, 367 S.E.2d 191, 193 (1988) (en banc)). We conclude that Dr. Green\u2019s deposition testimony provides sufficient credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding that the claimant had reached maximum medical improvement as to both his back and legs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">DISABILITY RATING</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The employer contends that the commission erred in not requiring a rating of the claimant\u2019s disability. We agree. The commission\u2019s opinion states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>We previously held in an unreported case, <em>Hodge v. Springer </em>Corporation, VWC File No. 546-413 (1988), that a back injury which limits the use of the claimant\u2019s legs to the extent that he cannot engage in a substantial degree of gainful employment may be the basis for an award of compensation for permanent total disability. As to the employer\u2019s second ground of defense, we hold in this case of first impression that it is not necessary that there be a specific rating of permanent partial disability to the legs which is based on the back injury. It is sufficient if the back injury results in a substantial loss of the legs to the extent that they cannot be used in any substantial degree in any gainful employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We explained in <em>Hungerford Mechanical Corp. </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>11 Va. App. 675, 401 S.E.2d 213 (1991), that in order to obtain benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-503 for the loss of use of a particular body member, the claimant must establish that he has achieved maximum medical improvement and that his functional loss of capacity be quantified or rated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">Code [\u00a7 65.2-503] establishes presumptive ratings for the loss of particular body members and also provides that \u2018 \u2018for the permanent partial. . . loss of use of a member compensation may be proportionately awarded.\u201d <em>Where the issue concerns a permanent partial loss of use, the commission must rate \u2018 \u2018the percentage of incapacity </em>suffered by the employee\u201d based on the evidence presented. <em>County of Spotsylvania </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>218 Va. 565, 568, 238 S.E.2d 813, 815 (1977). Medical evidence is not necessarily conclusive, but is subject to the commission\u2019s consideration and weighing. <em>See id. </em>at 569-70, 238 S.E.2d at 816. Thus, a medical rating of the employee\u2019s disability is evidence which an employee offers in order to meet the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 677-78, 401 S.E.2d at 214-15 (decided under former Code \u00a7 65.1-56) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">We find no authority or reason for the commission\u2019s deviation from the well-settled rule requiring a specific rating of a claimant\u2019s incapacity before awarding compensation \u201cfor the permanent partial loss or loss of use of a member.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-503. \u201cThe benefits provided by [Code \u00a7 65.2-503] for partial loss are awardable upon a \u2018rating\u2019 by the Commission of the percentage of incapacity suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>by the employee. The \u2018rating\u2019 determines the ultimate amount of compensation the employee is entitled to receive.\u201d <em>Hart, </em>218 Va. at 568, 238 S.E.2d at 815. The fact that the claimant\u2019s leg problems are derivative of his earlier compensable back injury does not remove the requirement of a specific rating for the body members involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Evidence that claimant\u2019s functional loss of use of his legs is derivative from a compensable back injury only establishes the cause of the disability; it does not establish the extent of the ratable loss of use of the claimant\u2019s legs, which is the incapacity addressed by Code \u00a7 65.2-503. \u201c[A]n award under Code [\u00a7 65.2-503] is not dependent upon a claimant\u2019s incapacity for work. That section is intended to provide benefits in the nature of indemnity for the loss of a scheduled body member.\u201d Commonwealth, <em>Div. of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 Va. App. 401, 404, 339 S.E.2d 552, 554 (1986). As we further explained in <em>Williams:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">[I]f the scheduled loss is the <em>sole </em>cause for work incapacity, once a permanent rating is established, a claimant\u2019s compensation payments are made under Code [\u00a7 65.2-503]. However, a claimant may sustain a permanent loss of a member and also work incapacity from other injuries or effects of the accident not embraced in the rated loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">In this case, the claimant has already been compensated for \u201cother injuries or effects of the accident\u201d by an award of temporary total disability benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-500. In order to establish entitlement to additional compensation under Code \u00a7 65.2-503, the claimant was required to present evidence rating the functional loss of use of his legs. The commission erred when it relied on the claimant\u2019s prior \u201ctotal\u201d disability from his back injury as a rating to satisfy the requirements of Code \u00a7 65.2-503.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">We conclude that the commission misapplied the law in determining the award. Because the evidence in support of the claimant\u2019s application fails to rate the functional loss of use of his legs, the claimant failed in his burden of proof to establish entitlement to benefits for permanent partial or total loss of use of his legs. Therefore, we reverse and dismiss the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>In addition, the employer has moved for an award of costs pursuant to Rule 5A:25(g) for reproduction of portions of the appendix designated unnecessarily by the claimant. After careful consideration of the motion and the record, we find an award of costs to the employer inappropriate under the facts of this case. Accordingly, we deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Baker, J., and Coleman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-12\"> Effective October 1, 1991, Title 65.1 was recodified as Title 65.2. All references in this opinion are to Title 65.2, in effect at the time the Commission\u2019s decision was rendered in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-9\"> The commission properly considered additional non-medical evidence in determining the status of the claimant\u2019s disability. \u201cMedical evidence is not the sole criterion. There have been and probably will continue to be cases where the medical evidence shows only a percentage of disability when in truth and in fact the disability so found renders the claimant incapable of working and therefore incapable of earning any wages.\u201d <em>J.A.
