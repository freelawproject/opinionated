On appeal, he contends that the Commonwealth failed to prove the corpus delicti of the charge. We agree and reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The evidence disclosed that, while \u201con routine patrol\u201d during the early morning hours of October 8, 1990, Deputy Sheriff T. E. Gibbs (Gibbs) observed defendant \u201cstanding . . . beside the driver\u2019s door\u201d of a \u201cJeep,\u201d \u201capparently talking to the person inside.\u201d Suddenly, \u201c[sjomeone yelled, \u20185-0,\u2019 \u201d the \u201cJeep pulled off at a high rate of speed\u201d and defendant \u201cran.\u201d Gibbs then \u201cpursued,\u201d stopped and searched the vehicle, discovering \u201cfive small vials\u201d which contained only a \u201cwhite residue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">Terry Taylor (Taylor), the operator of the Jeep, testified that she had purchased three \u201cplastic containers\u201d of \u201ccocaine\u201d from defendant and \u201csmoke[d] it with a can\u201d just before she \u201cwas stopped.\u201d She recalled that Gibbs \u2018 \u2018confiscated\u2019 \u2019 both the containers and the \u2018 \u2018can\u2019 \u2019 during his search of her vehicle. The certificate of analysis (certificate) introduced at trial identified an \u201caluminum can\u201d and \u201c[f|ive (5) plastic vials\u201d as \u201c[ejvidence [sjubmitted\u201d by Gibbs. It reported the presence of \u201c[cjocaine\u201d on the can, but noted that the vials were \u201c[n]ot analyzed.\u201d When Gibbs testified, however, he made no mention of any can and only the vials were identified and admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">Defendant argues that this evidence failed to sufficiently relate any cocaine to either defendant or the alleged offense and, therefore, the requisite corpus delicti of the crime was not proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The corpus delicti of an offense \u201c\u2018is the fact that the crime charged has been actually perpetrated. It is the body or substance of the crime,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018consists not merely of an objective crime, but of the defendant\u2019s agency in the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baughan v. Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 28, 32-33, 141 S.E.2d 750, 754 (1965) (quoting <em>Lucas v. Commonwealth, </em>201 Va. 599, 603, 112 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1960)). Manifestly, a successful drug prosecution must establish both the existence of a proscribed substance and an accused\u2019s unlawful activity with respect to it. However, the \u201cnature of the illegal substance . . . need not be proved by direct evidence,\u201d and \u201c[ujsers and addicts, if they have gained a familiarity or experience with a drug may ... testify as to the identification of [that drug] after previous use has been demonstrated.\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 60, 63, 379 S.E.2d 134, 136 (1989) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In <em>Hill, </em>this Court affirmed a conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, although the drug \u201cwas not produced at trial nor was any analysis of the substance admitted in evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The purchaser \u201ctestified that he had used cocaine approximately five hundred times,\u201d \u201cthat he had been a cocaine dealer for several years,\u201d \u201cthat the substance he purchased from [the defendant] looked like cocaine, affected him in the same manner in which cocaine affected him, and in fact was cocaine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 379 S.E.2d at 136; <em>see also Myrick </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 333, 340, 412 S.E.2d 176, 180 (1991). The Court found this evidence, corroborated by \u201cadmissions\u201d of the accused and \u201cother circumstantial evidence,\u201d sufficient to prove that the substance was cocaine. <em>Hill, </em>8 Va. App. at 63, 379 S.E.2d at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In the instant case, however, Taylor did not identify the \u201ccocaine\u201d by describing its appearance, the manner in which it affected her, her previous \u201cfamiliarity or experience\u201d with the drug or provide other foundation for her conclusion that it was, in fact, the substance purchased from defendant. Thus, Taylor\u2019s testimony was simply insufficient to prove that defendant distributed cocaine to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Although the certificate described an aluminum can which contained a residue of the drug, this can was not admitted into evidence, it was never identified by Taylor, and Gibbs never mentioned it in his testimony. Such evidence does not support even a reasonable inference that it was the same can referenced in Taylor\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Where the Commonwealth\u2019s proof is \u201cwholly circumstantial,\u201d \u201cthe chain of necessary circumstances must be unbroken and the evidence as a whole must satisfy the guarded judgment that both the corpus delicti and the criminal agency of the accused have been proved to the exclusion of any other rational hypothesis and to a moral certainty.\u201d <em>Person v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 36, 38-39, 389 S.E.2d 907, 909 (1990) (quoting <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 261, 263, 356 S.E.2d 449, 450 (1987)). This Court is \u201cnot at liberty to relax \u2018the requirement that the State must establish the existence of the <em>corpus delicti </em>and prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt by admissible evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leybourne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 222 </em>Va. 374, 377, 282 S.E.2d 12, 14 (1981) (quoting <em>Pepoon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 804, 812, 66 S.E.2d 854, 859 (1951)).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Duff, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Willis, X, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-12\"> As we reverse on this issue, we do not address defendant\u2019s additional assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b99-13\"> Responding to defendant\u2019s motion to strike, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney advised the court that the can was \u201cnot returned [by the laboratory], no explanation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\"> Judge Duff participated in the hearing of this case prior to the effective date of his retirement on September 1, 1992 and thereafter by designation pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-116.01.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
