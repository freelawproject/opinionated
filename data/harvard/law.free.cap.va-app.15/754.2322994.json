No credible evidence supported a finding that Augusta Lumber &amp; Supply^ Inc. ever relinquished the power to direct the means and methods by which James did his work, and, therefore, James was an employee, not an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">Three separate commercial enterprises are involved in this proceeding: Augusta Lumber &amp; Supply, Inc. (\u201cAugusta Lumber\u201d), a business engaged in buying and selling logs which employed James at the time of his injury; Augusta Trucking Company (\u201cAugusta Trucking\u201d), a separate business engaged in transporting logs and lumber which maintains offices in the same building as Augusta Lumber and transports logs and lumber for Augusta Lumber, as well as others; and Wood Products of Virginia, a self-insurance group, of which Augusta Lumber was a member at the time of James\u2019 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">Before the accident, James hauled lumber, as an independent contractor, for Augusta Trucking, which paid him by the mile. On the day of the accident, James arrived at work expecting to haul a load of lumber for Augusta Trucking to South Carolina. He learned, however, that the load was not ready for transport. The dispatcher for Augusta Trucking told James of a request from Augusta Lumber for a truck to haul logs from a nearby rail siding to the lumberyard. He told James that he would be paid by Augusta Lumber and would be working for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Augusta Lumber. Augusta Lumber intended to employ James \u201cthat day on a trial basis and if he worked out good that day then he would be used the next day and thereafter as the need arose.\u201d The dispatcher identified the employee of Augusta Lumber who would be supervising him.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The general manager of Augusta Lumber supervised James on the day of the accident. According to the manager, James was expected to assist in the unloading of the gondola car and then haul the logs from the rail siding to the lumberyard. James was expected to direct the operator of a knuckleboom, a piece of equipment used to unload the logs, once the load of logs in the railroad car reached the point where the operator could no longer see them. Because James had not previously spotted logs, the general manager expected to show James the method to use. James was not free to take breaks whenever he wanted to, but was expected to continue on the job until it was finished, not stopping for lunch until directed to do so. The knuckleboom was owned by Augusta Lumber, as was the truck that it was attached to. No method of payment had been worked out between James and Augusta Lumber, but the general manager intended to try James out that day and \u2018 \u2018see how it worked out and then put him on . . . [the] payroll.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">When James was unable properly to position the trailer so that the logs could be loaded, the general manager of Augusta Lumber offered to position the trailer. He was maneuvering the trailer as James stood to the side of the truck when the logs, which had been suspended from the knuckleboom, \u201cfell from the loader, struck James and seriously injured him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The commission denied James compensation because it found \u2018 \u2018no contract of hire between [James] and Augusta Lumber\u201d and because evidence of Augusta Lumber\u2019s \u201cright to exercise any control over\u201d James was insufficient. We disagree. A contract of hire did exist between James and Augusta Lumber and evidence of Augusta Lumber\u2019s right to exercise control over James did exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">\u201cAn implied contract of hire exists where one party has rendered services or labor of value to another under circumstances which raise the presumption that the parties intended and understood that they were to be paid for, or which a reasonable man in the position of the person receiving the benefit of the services or labor would or ought to know that compensation or remuneration of some kind was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>be exchanged for them.\u201d <em>Charlottesville Music Ctr., Inc. v. McCray, </em>215 Va. 31, 35, 205 S.E.2d 674, 678 (1974). The parties do not dispute that James \u201crendered services or labor of value\u201d to Augusta Lumber. They also do not dispute that both James and Augusta Lumber \u201cintended and understood that [the services rendered] were to be paid for.\u201d Thus, an implied contract of hire existed between James and Augusta Lumber.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The only question then, in determining whether James was an employee of Augusta Lumber, is whether by virtue of the contract of hire he was \u201cin the service of\u201d Augusta Lumber. Code \u00a7 65.2-101. Whether he was \u201cin the service of,\u201d that is, a servant of, Augusta Lumber, as opposed to an independent contractor, depends upon the control retained by Augusta Lumber over James\u2019 work. <em>Intermodal Servs., Inc. v. Smith, </em>234 Va. 596, 601, 364 S.E.2d 221, 224 (1988); <em>Metropolitan Cleaning Corp. </em>v. <em>Crawley, </em>14 Va. App. 261, 264, 416 S.E.2d 35, 37 (1992) (en banc). The right of control inherent in an employer and employee relationship is the power to control the means and methods by which the result sought is to be accomplished. <em>Smith, </em>234 Va. at 601, 364 S.E.2d at 224. An employer retains the power to direct \u201cthe means and methods\u201d by which an employee performs his or her work. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201cit is not the actual exercise of [this] control, but the right [to] control,\u201d that is determinative. <em>Hann </em>v. <em>Times-Dispatch Pub. Co., </em>166 Va. 102,106, 184 S.E. 183, 185 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The testimony before the commission reveals that Augusta Lumber directed \u201cthe means and methods\u201d by which James was to do his work. The supervisor instructed him when to take breaks, including his lunch, and where to position his trailer. Furthermore, when James could not properly position the trailer, the supervisor showed him how.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The commission did not reject this testimony; instead, it relied upon factors which failed to show that Augusta Lumber gave up the right to control the means and methods of James\u2019 work. In determining that James was not an employee, but was an independent contractor, the commission observed that the manager of Augusta Trucking had advised James of the availability of work with Augusta Lumber, that Augusta Lumber and Augusta Trucking, although closely associated, were operated as separate independent companies without the mingling of assets or personnel, and that the general manager of Augusta Trucking had no authority to hire employees for Augusta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Lumber. These facts relate to the relationship between James and Augusta Trucking; they do not relate to the relationship between James and Augusta Lumber.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The commission also observed that James was \u201casked to handle only one short trip, i.e. from the rail siding back to the lumberyard, a distance of approximately one mile,\u201d a fact of little relevance in determining James\u2019s status as an independent contractor. Finally, the commission described the supervisor\u2019s placement of the trailer as \u201cno more than an accommodation\u201d and said that James could have refused to allow him to do this, conclusions that the evidence fails to support.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">These factors did not rebut the otherwise sufficient evidence that Augusta Lumber retained the right to direct the means and methods by which James performed his work. Therefore, without rejecting the testimony before it, the commission could not have concluded that James was an independent contractor. Because the commission did not reject the testimony, we must conclude that its decision rests upon the incorrect conclusions of law it expressed and that it erred in denying James compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">James also asked that we address the calculation of his average weekly wage. This wage was determined by the deputy commissioner on the basis of a $100 check he received from Augusta Lumber for his services on the day the accident occurred. James contends that his average weekly wage should have been computed based on his total income in 1988 from his work as a trucker.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because it determined that James was not entitled to compensation, the commission did not address this issue. Therefore, we decline to address this issue until it has been considered by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">For these reasons, the decision of the commission denying James compensation is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">Benton, J., and Coleman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-11\"> James\u2019 contention raises, in part, an issue we have previously found unnecessary to address. <em>See Crawley, </em>14 Va. App. at 264, 416 S.E.2d at 37.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
