Greenwald appealed to the circuit court, contesting the validity of the cease and desist order under several provisions of law. The circuit judge ruled that Greenwald had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies as required by the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA). Greenwald contends (1) that the trial judge erred in ruling that Greenwald had to exhaust administrative remedies, and (2) that it is entitled to costs and attorney fees. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment and vacate the cease and desist order.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">The Department received and investigated a complaint that Greenwald, a business engaged in the design, construction, renovation and remodeling of residential structures, as permitted by Code \u00a7 54.1-402(A)(1), was using the term \u201carchitecture\u201d and its derivatives in advertisements in violation of Code \u00a7 54.1-406(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the conclusion of its investigation, the Department issued a letter informing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Greenwald that its \u201cadvertising is prohibited pursuant to Title 54.1, Chapter 4, section 54.1-406(C), Code of Virginia\u201d and further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">You are ordered to cease and desist from using any modification or derivative of the word \u201carchitecture\u201d in your firm name or description of your business activity in a manner that indicates or implies that your firm practices or offers to practice architecture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Greenwald filed a timely petition for appeal in the circuit court. Greenwald charged that the Department\u2019s cease and desist order was inconsistent with Code \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-402 and 54.1-406, that the cease and desist order was issued in violation of the Virginia Administrative Procedure Act, that the Department\u2019s failure to provide Greenwald with notice and opportunity to be heard prior to the issuance of the cease and desist order violated procedural due process, and that the Department\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 54.1-406 was an unconstitutional abridgment of freedom of speech, due process and equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In a demurrer, the Department alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the facts as pleaded did not prove that the cease and desist order constituted a case decision. The trial judge overruled the demurrer in substantial part and specifically ruled in an opinion letter that the Department\u2019s letter ordering Greenwald to cease and desist the activities alleged to be violations of Code \u00a7 54.1-406(C) was a case decision. The Department then filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that Greenwald had not exhausted its administrative remedies. The trial judge granted the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>n.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">A \u201ccase decision\u201d is defined by statute as \u201cany agency proceeding or determination that, under laws ... at the time, a named party as a matter of past or present fact. . . either is, is not, or may or may not be (i) in violation of such law ... or (ii) in compliance with any existing requirement for obtaining or retaining a license or other right or benefit.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4(D). By issuing its cease and desist order, the Department, an administrative agency, determined and conveyed to Greenwald its determination that Greenwald\u2019s \u201cadvertising is prohibited pursuant to Title 54.1, Chapter 4, section 54.1-406(C) Code of Virginia.\u201d It is beyond cavil that die Department made a \u2018 \u2018determination that, under laws ... at the time, a named party as a matter of past or present fact... is ... or may ... be ... in violation of such law.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The Department argues that, because it had no statutory authority to issue a cease and desist order, its order cannot be a case decision. The Department concedes that Code \u00a7 54.1-111 \u201cconstitutes the Department\u2019s sole mechanism in its basic law for handling allegations of unlawful, unlicensed activity and there is no provision in the VAPA to the contrary.\u201d We agree with the Department that its statutory authority to act upon a conclusion that an entity has engaged in unlicensed practice is circumscribed by Code \u00a7 54.1-111. Under that Code section, the Department is expressly authorized only to (i) refer the matter to the appropriate Commonwealth\u2019s attorney for criminal prosecution, or (ii) initiate a proceeding in equity in the appropriate circuit court for injunctive relief. The Department did neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The Department argues, however, that, because it was not authorized to issue a cease and desist order, its act of doing what it is not permitted to do by law does not subject the Department to the requirements of the VAJPA. The Department relies upon <em>Virginia Board of Medicine </em>v. <em>Virginia Physical Therapy Association, </em>13 Va. App. 458, 413 S.E.2d 59 (1991), in support of this contention. However, <em>Virginia Board of Medicine </em>is distinguishable and not applicable to the facts of this case. In <em>Virginia Board of Medicine, </em>the decision turned upon whether the Board \u201c \u2018promulgated\u2019 and formally adopted a <em>rule\u201d </em>which \u201cmeet[s] the VAPA definition of a rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 413 S.E.2d at 65 (emphasis added). The Court held that the Board\u2019s actions did not constitute a rule for the purposes of the VAPA. <em>Id. </em>Significantly, in that case, \u201c[njeither party argue[d] there was a case decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468, 413 S.E.2d at 65. The record in that case established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>that \u201c[t]he board only notified [the complainant] that <em>an informal conference was to be held, to determine whether he may have violated the Code.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). In the case before us, the record unambiguously proves that the Department informed Greenwald that its conduct violated the law and ordered Greenwald to cease and desist its advertising. As the trial judge ruled, the Department\u2019s cease and desist order \u201cfits [the VAPA] definition [of case decision] like a glove.\u201d We concluded that the trial judge did not err in so ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">HI.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u201cThe burden shall be upon the party complaining of agency action to designate and demonstrate an error of law subject to review by the court.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17. Greenwald contends that the Department erred in not providing an informal hearing, as required under Code \u00a7 9-6.14:11, before rendering its cease and desist order. \u201cThe question whether an agency decision making body acted within the scope of the authority conferred upon it by statute is a question of law.\u201d <em>Muse v. Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control Bd., 9 </em>Va. App. 74, 78, 384 S.E.2d 110, 112 (1989). Because the cease and desist order was a case decision within the meaning of the statute, even if we assume the Department was statutorily authorized to conduct enforcement activity through cease and desist orders, Greenwald should have been given an informal hearing prior to issuing the order. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:11. In such an event, the trial judge should have found that the agency committed an error of law in not holding the hearing and should have suspended or set aside the order. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:19.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">However, the Department concedes, and we agree, that the Department \u201cis expressly authorized to undertake only <em>two </em>direct courses of [enforcement] action pursuant to . . . Code \u00a7 54.1-111.\u201d The Department could have either referred the matter to the appropriate Commonwealth\u2019s attorney for criminal prosecution or petitioned the appropriate circuit court for injunctive relief. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 54.1-111. By issuing a cease and desist order administratively, the Department attempted an enforcement action by case decision, a course of action that was not sanctioned by law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">Where a regulation or case decision is found by the court to be not in accordance with law under Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17, the court shall suspend or set it aside and remand the matter to the agency for such further proceedings, if any, as the court may permit or direct in accordance with law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:19. Accordingly, the trial judge erred in dismissing Greenwald\u2019s petition for failure to exhaust its administrative remedies. The statute clearly indicates that the trial judge should have suspended or set aside the order without prejudice to the Department\u2019s right to initiate any lawfully authorized enforcement action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">IV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">In overruling the Department\u2019s demurrer, the trial judge stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">A successful litigant may recover attorney fees and costs under Sections 1983 and 1988. The present case seeks not damages, but injunctive and prospective relief, and if such relief is granted, Greenwald may be able to recover attorney\u2019s fees and costs under Sections 1983 and 1988.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In granting the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial judge denied Greenwald\u2019s motion for attorney fees under the VAPA and found it unnecessary to address Greenwald\u2019s other claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Since we have determined that the trial judge should have set aside the cease and desist order, we need not consider whether Greenwald\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies would defeat the initiation of an action based on federal law, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We also need not address Greenwald\u2019s contention that the Department\u2019s interpretation and application of Code \u00a7 54.1-406(C) were unconstitutional abridgments of the freedom of speech, due process, and equal protection clauses of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia. However, because we have concluded that the trial judge erred in not vacating the cease and desist order, we vacate the trial judge\u2019s order denying Greenwald attorney\u2019s fees and we remand the question of attorney\u2019s fees to the trial judge for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Baker, J., and Moon, X, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-11\"> Code \u00a7 54.1-402(A)(1) contains the following provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">A.
