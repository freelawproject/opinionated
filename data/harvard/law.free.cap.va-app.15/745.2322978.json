We affirm the commission's decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Fletcher worked for TAD for approximately six years as a reprographics technician/plotter operator. Her job duties regularly required her to lift rolls of paper which were thirty-six inches long and weighed thirty to thirty-five pounds and to place these rolls in a machine. Her duties also required her to use her right arm to cut paper approximately 400 times a day with motions that required constant turning and twisting of the right arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">On July 27, 1990, Fletcher began to observe problems in her right shoulder. On November 23, 1990, Fletcher sought medical treatment from Dr. Robert C. Dart. In an attending physician\u2019s report, Dr. Dart stated that Fletcher had a history of right shoulder pain due to chronic lifting on the job and diagnosed Fletcher as having a \u201crotator cuff tear.\u201d Dr. Dart\u2019s diagnosis was confirmed by a MRI exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">TAD\u2019s insurance carrier declined responsibility for Fletcher\u2019s medical treatment and expenses. After an evidentiary hearing, the deputy commissioner denied benefits to Fletcher. On appeal, the commission opined that Fletcher suffered an \u201coccupational disease\u201d and awarded benefits. The commission found \u201ca direct causal connection between [Fletcher\u2019s] repetitive work as a reprographics processor and development of her right shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>injury.\u201d The commission noted that there was \u201cno substantial injurious exposure outside the employment which would reasonably cause the condition claimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The legal issues raised in this case are similar to those decided by this Court in <em>Merillat Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>15 Va. App. 44, 421 S.E.2d 867 (1992) and <em>Holly,Farms Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>15 Va. App. 29, 422 S.E.2d 165 (1992), where this Court affirmed the commission\u2019s ruling that a condition gradually incurred as a result of repeated work-related trauma may be compensable as an occupational disease under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">An injury is statutorily defined as either an \u201cinjury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment or occupational disease.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101. Code \u00a7 65.2-400 defines occupational diseases and \u201cprovides that, in order for an occupational disease to be compensable, each of six factors must be established.\u201d <em>Parks, </em>15 Va. App. at 52, 421 S.E.2d at 871. The commission found that, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-400, Fletcher\u2019s condition was an \u201coccupational disease\u201d arising out of and in the course of her employment. The commission also found that \u201c[t]he medical evidence does not show [Fletcher\u2019s] condition to be an ordinary disease of life.\u201d The commission\u2019s opinion further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-7\">We next find the evidence in this case to establish a direct causal connection between [Fletcher\u2019s] repetitive work as a reprographics processor and development of her right shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff injury. The medical evidence is found to show that the injury flowed naturally from the work and that the work was the proximate cause. We find no substantial injurious exposure outside the employment which would reasonably cause the condition claimed, but rather, that the conditions of the employment which involved right-arm action and repetitive lifting and cutting constitute the risk incidental to the work which reasonably produced the injury (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">When credible evidence supports a finding that a disease is causally related to the employment and not causally related to other factors, such a finding is conclusive and binding on this court. <em>Ross Lab. </em>v. <em>Barbour, </em>13 Va. App. 373, 378, 412 S.E.2d 205, 208 (1991). We conclude that the record contains credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s conclusion that Fletcher\u2019s condition flowed from her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>employment as a natural consequence. Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Barrow, X, and Coleman, X, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
