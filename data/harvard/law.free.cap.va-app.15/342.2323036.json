Parnell, Jr., was convicted by a jury of threatening to damage a dwelling in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-83 and maliciously shooting at an occupied building in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-279.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Parnell contends that the convictions should be reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>because (1) the trial judge erred in instructing the jury concerning the term \u201cthreat;\u201d (2) the trial judge erred in admitting statements that Parnell made to a sheriff\u2019s deputy three days after the incident; (3) the jury was not properly instructed concerning the elements of Code \u00a7 18.2-83 and did not have sufficient evidence upon which to convict him of threatening to damage a structure; (4) Code \u00a7 18.2-279 is unconstitutionally vague; and (5) the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-279. We affirm both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The evidence proved that in June 1990 one of James L. Whitlock\u2019s friends was involved in a conflict with Parnell and asked to use Whitlock\u2019s telephone to call the police. Several weeks later, on the night of July 4, as Whitlock returned to his home, he saw Parnell, whom he had known for fifteen years, and Parnell\u2019s brother, Curtis, in an automobile. When the brothers drove past Whitlock\u2019s home, Parnell called Whitlock several vile names. Parnell stopped at the residence next to Whitlock\u2019s home and continued to call Whitlock other vile names. Parnell also yelled vile racial epithets about Whitlock\u2019s friend, stated that he would kill Whitlock, and said that he would burn Whitlock\u2019s house. Parnell concluded by saying, \u201c[I] will be back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Two days later, a deputy sheriff arrived at Whitlock\u2019s house and took Whitlock to obtain an arrest warrant charging Parnell with threatening to burn his house. While Whitlock was away, his neighbor, Eugene Pascal, brought two of the Whitlock children home. When Pascal arrived, Whitlock\u2019s wife heard two shots fired in the vicinity. She also heard someone yell, \u201cWillie, Curtis, come back here.\u201d As Pascal prepared to leave, Whitlock\u2019s wife and Pascal saw an automobile drive by without its lights on. Pascal went outside and stood in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>center of the front yard to determine what was happening. The automobile turned around, turned its lights on, and then turned them off again as it approached the Whitlock home. Whitlock\u2019s wife and Pascal saw Parnell in the automobile holding a gun. Parnell shot at the outdoor light and then fired a shot toward the house. After passing the house, the automobile turned and came back. Parnell again shot at the light and shot toward the house before the automobile drove away. Although no bullets hit the house, at least one bullet hit the outside light.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The evidence also proved that on the following day, a sheriff\u2019s deputy arrested Parnell and read Parnell a statement of <em>Miranda </em>rights. When he asked if Parnell had anything to say, Parnell responded, \u201cHe will die and his house will bum.\u201d On this evidence, the jury convicted Parnell on both charges and sentenced him to three years in prison for threatening to burn Whitlock\u2019s home and to five years in prison for shooting at the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The jury had to determine whether Parnell communicated \u201cto another by any means [a] threat to . . . burn, destroy, or in any manner damage any . . . building or other structure.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-83. Parnell requested that the trial judge instruct the jury as follows concerning the definition of \u201cthreat\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">The term \u201cThreat\u201d is defined as an avowed present determination or intent to injure presently or in the future. A statement may constitute a threat even though it is subject to a possible contingency in the maker\u2019s control. The prosecution must establish a \u201ctrue threat\u201d, which means a serious threat as distinguished from words uttered as mere political argument, idle talk or jest. In determining whether words were uttered as a threat the context in which they were spoken must be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Parnell argues that the trial judge committed reversible error when he deleted the first three sentences and instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">In determining whether words were uttered as a threat the context in which they were uttered must be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">We conclude that the trial judge did not commit reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">\u201c \u2018The purpose of an instruction is to furnish guidance to the jury in their deliberations, and to aid them in arriving at a proper verdict, so far as it is competent for the court to assist them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cooper v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 497, 500, 345 S.E.2d 775, 777 (1986) (quoting 75 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Trial </em>\u00a7 573 (1974)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">\u201cIt is elementary that the burden is on the Commonwealth to prove every essential element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Unless those elements are defined by instructions available to the members of the jury during their deliberation, they cannot properly determine whether the Commonwealth has carried its burden. The duty to give such instructions is not discharged by simple reference to the indictment or by reading the applicable statute to the jury. \u201cIt is always the duty of the court <em>at the proper time </em>to instruct the jury on all principles of law applicable to the pleadings and the evidence (emphasis added)\u201d and \u201ca correct statement of the law applicable to the case, <em>when the law is stated, </em>... [is one of the] essentials of a fair trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\"><em>Dowdy v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 114, 116, 255 S.E.2d 506, 508 (1979) (emphasis to original) (citations omitted). \u201cA reviewing court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is \u2018to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darnell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988) (quoting <em>Swisher </em>v. <em>Swisher, </em>223 Va. 499, 503, 290 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The trial judge did not err in rejecting, in part, the instruction that Parnell submitted. Although we agree with Parnell that the first sentence of the proposed instruction properly defined the term \u201cthreat,\u201d we conclude that the second and third sentences were potentially misleading. The trial proof contained no evidence of a \u201cpossible contingency in the maker\u2019s control.\u201d Therefore, the trial judge did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on such an abstraction. \u201cIt is error to give an instruction, though correct as an abstract statement of law, unless there is sufficient evidence in the record to support it.\u201d <em>Swift v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 420, 424, 100 S.E.2d 9, 13 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">In a similar vein, we conclude that the trial judge did not err in refiising to instruct the jury that the Commonwealth had to prove a \u201ctrue threat\u201d or a \u201cserious threat.\u201d The statute requires proof of a \u201cthreat.\u201d The adjectives \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d would have interjected an issue that was not supported by the evidence. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, it is a fundamental principle that \u201c[although an instruction may correctly state the law, it should not be given if it is inapplicable to the facts in evidence . . . [and] might confuse or distract the jury.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 708, 711, 347 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1986) (citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>omitted). The evidence proved that the remarks were made contemporaneously with other vile and derogatory remarks directed toward Whitlock. We conclude that the trial judge\u2019s decision to avoid placing before the jury the distinction between \u201cthreat,\u201d \u201ctrue threat,\u201d and \u2018 \u2018serious threat\u2019 \u2019 was not error. The instruction to the jury to consider the context in which the words were uttered sufficed to guide the jury in its function.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Although we agree with Parnell that the first sentence of his proposed instruction contained the usual dictionary definition of the word \u201cthreat,\u201d we conclude that the trial judge did not commit reversible error in \u201crelyfing] upon the intelligence of jurors to give to plain, ordinary words their plain, ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>McCoy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>133 Va. 731, 735, 112 S.E. 704, 705 (1922). Parnell contended at trial that, although he was angry with Whitlock, cursed him, and called him vile names, he never mentioned burning his house. Parnell does not contest that he spoke in anger or that he harbored animosity toward Whitlock. Those issues were undisputed. The disputed issue was whether, in fact, Parnell said he would burn Whitlock\u2019s house. If the jury found that he uttered those words, the trial judge instructed the jury that it had to consider the context in which the words were spoken in determining whether they constituted a threat.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">\u2018 \u2018The chief object contemplated in the charge of the judge is to explain the law of the case, to point out the essentials to be proved on the one side or the other, and to bring into view the relation of the particular evidence adduced to the particular issues involved. In [the] instructions the trial judge should inform the jury as to the law of the case applicable to the facts in such a manner that they may not be misled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\"><em>Cooper, </em>2 Va. App. at 500, 345 S.E.2d at 777 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">There is not a scintilla of evidence that Parnell\u2019s comment was made in jest. Thus, even if the trial judge erred in not more fully explaining to the jury the definition of \u201cthreat,\u201d the omission was not material to the case. The instructions given to the jury correctly stated the law. Accordingly, we conclude that in the context of this case the omission was harmless error. <em>See Kil v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 802, 811-13, 407 S.E.2d 674, 679-80 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">When Parnell was arrested and charged with having threatened to bum Whitlock\u2019s home, the deputy sheriff read Parnell a statement of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and explained to Parnell the charge. In response to the deputy sheriffs explanation, Parnell said, \u201cHe will die and his house will bum.\u201d Parnell contends that the statement was irrelevant, prejudicial, and inadmissible evidence of unrelated criminal behavior and that the trial judge erred in allowing the Commonwealth to prove he made that statement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">The general rule excluding evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d extends only to crimes which are unrelated to those on trial, and which are offered solely for the purpose of showing that the accused was a person of such character as to be a likely perpetrator of the offense charged. If the evidence of other conduct is connected with the present offense, or tends to prove any element or fact in issue at trial, it should be admitted, whether or not it tends to show the defendant guilty of another crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\"><em>Scott </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 519, 527, 323 S.E.2d 572, 577 (1984) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Parnell\u2019s statement was not unrelated to the offense for which he was being tried. The evidence proved that during the incident on July 4, Parnell called Whitlock vile names and was extremely angry with him. Parnell\u2019s statement, made two days later, had the tendency to prove his animosity toward Whitlock. It tended to prove Parnell\u2019s state of mind and, thus, corroborated the testimony that Parnell harbored extreme hostility toward Whitlock. Indeed, after the statement was admitted in evidence, Parnell testified in his own defense and admitted that he was angry at Whitlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Parnell, however, denied at trial that he threatened to burn Whitlock\u2019s house. The statement he made in the presence of the deputy sheriff also corroborated Whitlock\u2019s testimony that Parnell threatened to bum his house. The short time span between the events and the identity of the statements tended to corroborate Whitlock\u2019s testimony that Parnell made the same statement to him two days earlier. <em>See Woodfin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 89, 95, 372 S.E.2d 377, 381 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1009 (1989); <em>Minor v. Commonwealth, 213 </em>Va. 278, 280, 191 S.E.2d 825, 826-27 (1972). Thus, we conclude that the statement was admissible and that its probative value outweighed the incidental prejudice that it may have engendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Parnell asserts for the first time on appeal that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that the recipient of a threat must reasonably believe that the person who made the threat will act according to the expression of intent. Neither party offered such an instruction. The trial judge instructed the jury that \u201c[i]n determining whether words were uttered as a threat the context in which they were spoken must be considered.\u201d Thus, we cannot conclude that \u201c[t]he granted instruction^] omitted some essential element of the offense.\u201d <em>Jimenez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 244, 251, 402 S.E.2d 678, 681 (1991). Accordingly, Parnell\u2019s failure to offer the instruction that he now contends should have been given bars our consideration of that issue on appeal. <em>See Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 218, 225, 380 S.E.2d 26, 30 (1989); <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 418, 423, 350 S.E.2d 229, 232 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Parnell also contends for the first time on appeal that Code \u00a7 18.2-279 is unconstitutional. At no time in the trial court did Parnell challenge this statute or raise this issue. A defendant who fails to challenge the constitutionality of a statute in the trial court is barred from raising that issue on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 14, 18 n.1, 334 S.E.2d 536, 539 n.1 (1985); <em>Cottrell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 570, 574, 405 S.E.2d 438, 441 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">In addition, Parnell contends for the first time on appeal that his conviction for shooting at an occupied structure in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-279 is \u201ccontrary to the law and the evidence.\u201d The record reflects that at no time in the trial court did Parnell move to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, or to strike the evidence at the close of his evidence and the Commonwealth\u2019s rebuttal, or to set aside the verdict after the jury rendered its verdict. Having failed to raise this issue in the court below, Parnell is barred from raising it for the first time on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">For these reasons, the judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">Coleman, J., and Fitzpatrick, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-12\"> These statutes read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-13\">A.
