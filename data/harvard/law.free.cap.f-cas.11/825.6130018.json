Pursuant to such consent the said Hillyard and others have this day filed their claim in this suit, alleging that they are bona fide owners of said vessel, and that she was seized and captured from them by a vessel called the \u201cRetribution.\u201d It is conceded, in writing, by the United States attorney, \u201cthat if the claimants establish their ownership of the said vessel by proper evidence, they will be entitled to the restoration of the said vessel to them upon payment of one-eighth of her value, as salvage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The evidence presented to the court under the above claim consists of a copy of the register of the vessel made at the port of Boston, Massachusetts, November 7, 1860, to the claimants; the deposition of James T. Sparks, of Provincetown, Massachusetts, sworn to October 19, 1863, before a notary public; and the deposition of one of the claimants, Thomas Hillyard, taken before a notary public December 17, 1863, the assistant of the United States attorney being present and cross-examining the witness. No objection is made on the part of the United States to the competency and sufficiency of the said evidence to that end, and the proctors for the claimants having moved the court for a decree of restitution of the said vessel to them, the court is satisfied, upon the proofs aforesaid, that the claimants are loyal citizens of the United States, and are the true and bona fide owners of the said prize vessel, recaptured by the United States war vessel Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">It is, therefore, ordered and decreed, that the said schooner Hattie be restored to the claimants, on payment by them of one-eighth of the value of the said vessel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
