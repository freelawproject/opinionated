The petitioner in proving his debt had stated that he held certain stocks as security therefor, and his petition set forth that it \u201cnever was his intention to relinquish the said securities dr any of them, and that he proved his debt because he received a notice from the commissioner, and supposed it to be necessary for him so to do, but without the most distant idea that by so doing he would in the slightest degree affect his rights in the collateral securities.\u201d A rule to show cause was granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b765-6\">Mr. Graham, for Lapsley.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b765-7\">The proof of debt was made under an evident and .mistaken idea that it was necessary to do so, and with no intention to surrender the collateral security; there is no reason to suspect any improper motive for desiring its withdrawal, and permission to do so has been heretofore granted by courts of bankruptcy.

This proof was made under an erroneous impression, for which the commissioner is partly responsible, for had he informed Lapsley of the consequences of what he was doing, no proof would have been attempted.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-18\"> [Reported by William II. Crabbe, Esq.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b765-12\">RANDALL, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AGZ\">This application to withdraw the proof of debt is made, I presume, from abundant caution, for the creditor has not commenced a suit at law or equity against the bankrupt, nor obtained a judgment which would be surrendered by making the proof; and the securities which he holds are collateral and independent of the bankrupt\u2019s personal liability. In England, a creditor who holds collateral security will not, generally, be allowed to prove his debt, unless the security is surrendered. He may, however, by leave of the court, have the securities sold or valued, and then prove for the remainder of his debt; or, if he has proved the whole debt without reference to his security, the court will order the proof to be expunged, on application of the assignee or other parties in interest, until the secun ties have been disposed of. The creditor may then, if he has committed no fraud, prove for-the balance. In this case there was no concealment, and there is no allegation of fraud; nor is it pretended that the creditor elected to surrender his securities and come in upon the estate for a dividend of the general assets. There is no evidence here that any one was misled by Lapsley\u2019s act, or that, until this application was made, any creditor supposed he had gained an advantage by the proof. In Ex parte Downes [supra], relied on by the counsel who opposed this petition, the creditor, supposing his mortgage to be of little value, voluntarily surrendered it, and did not apply for leave to withdraw his proof, and have the mortgage restored to him, until, by an actual sale, its value hud been ascertained to be much larger than his dividend of the general assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">The act of congress [of 1841 (5 Stat. 440)] gives the court power to set aside and disallow any debt, on proof that it is founded in fraud or mistake. The proof in this case having been made for the full amount of the creditor\u2019s demand, without deducting the value of the security, as should have been done, and this appearing to be through mistake, the creditor has leave to withdraw the proof of his debt, and the rule is made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
