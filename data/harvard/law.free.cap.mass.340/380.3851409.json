Duffy to build a motel in a general residence district.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The zoning by-law divides the town into five districts: single residence, 1A and IB; general residence; apartments; business; industrial. The uses permitted in general residence districts are those permitted in single residence districts, which do not include hotels, motels or lodging houses, and additionally \u201cTwo-family dwellings and lodging houses.\u201d The by-law includes this definition: \u201cHotel or lodging house: A building designed or used for paying guests, permanently or transiently, where more than three bedrooms are used for such purposes.\u201d The by-law does not otherwise refer to hotel and makes no mention of motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Nothing in the by-laws shows an intent to allow a motel in residence districts. Hotels, motels and lodging houses are sufficiently differentiated to be differently classifiable for zoning purposes. See <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>333 Mass. 114; St. 1954, c. 134, \u00a7 1, amending G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 27; <em>Von Der Heide </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Somers, Westchester County, </em>204 Misc. (N. Y.) 746, 748-749; <em>Longo Liquor License Case, </em>183 Pa. Super. Ct. 504. We need not decide whether the common definition of the by-law is sufficient to establish that hotels are allowed in general residence districts although only lodging houses are specified, or whether a motel may in some circumstances be deemed a hotel. See <em>Maturi </em>v. <em>Balint, </em>204 Misc. (N. Y.) 1011. We discern no implication of authorization of motels in the authorization of lodging houses and the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
