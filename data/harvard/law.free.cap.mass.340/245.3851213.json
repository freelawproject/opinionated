Mrs. Mary Martin, when at the front window of her house at 9 Eastern Avenue, the second house from the southwest corner of Cross Street, between 1 and 1:30 p.m., heard a little cry and \u201cso she looked out.\u201d She saw the plaintiff in the street and saw Mrs. Lucretia R. Damon going toward her. She also then saw an automobile, a vehicle later established to be owned by the corporate defendant and driven by the defendant Ryan, stopped at the head of Cross Street; \u201ctwo thirds of the car was into Cross Street\u201d; she saw the automobile back up and start down Eastern Avenue. Mrs. Damon, then living at 2 Cross Street on the corner, between 1:15 and 1:30 p.m. , on August 6, went out on her porch, which faced Eastern Avenue, and saw the plaintiff lying in the street. She \u201cwent across the street to the child,\u201d saw that she was badly hurt, looked in the direction of Mrs. Martin\u2019s house and saw an automobile, the corporate defendant\u2019s automobile, moving slowly down Eastern Avenue, and shouted \u201cDid you hit this child,\u201d or, as Mrs. Martin recalled, \u201cCome back here, you just hit this child.\u201d The automobile was then in front of Mrs. Martin\u2019s window, ten to twelve feet from the curb on her side, on the \u201cleft hand\u201d (southerly) side of the road. Ryan heard the call, looked back, stopped, or nearly stopped, and then drove off, and did not answer. Mrs. Martin saw no automobiles parked near by on either side of Eastern Avenue, and \u201cwhen she first saw the little girl she saw no cars moving in the vicinity\u201d; Mrs. Damon did not see any other automobiles near by. None was parked in the area, and \u201cthere was no other traffic on Eastern Avenue while she was there with the child.\u201d This much of what happened can be taken as established, viewing the evidence favorably for the plaintiff as we do in judging the rightness of the judge\u2019s action in directing verdicts for the defendants. But there is no direct evidence of causation or negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The movements of the automobile on Eastern Avenue and Cross Street, prior to the moment when it was observed about to back into Eastern Avenue from Cross Street, are described in the bill of exceptions only in Ryan\u2019s testimony, in the auditor\u2019s report, and in consistent testimony of a police officer of what Ryan told him. According to this evidence Ryan had come down Eastern Avenue at a speed of from twenty to twenty-five miles per hour and had made a left hand turn into Cross Street, to go through it. Ryan testified that <em>\u201cto </em>make the corner\u201d he slowed to ten or fifteen miles per hour. \u201cAfter he had gone 100 or 200 feet into Cross Street,\u201d as the auditor found, Ryan saw a truck which blocked the narrow street. Ryan then backed the automobile to the point at which it was observed by Mrs. Martin. He testified, and the auditor found, that he stopped to allow traffic to go by.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Ryan testified that when stopped at the head of Cross Street he looked out the rear window and saw a child in the street and a woman running across to pick it up. The auditor found that Ryan had seen no child in or near the street as he approached Cross Street, and the police officer testified that Ryan had said in his employer\u2019s office, when cautioned to tell the truth, and after prior evasive and false statements, that he did not know he was in an accident, and when asked if it was possible that he could have hit the child without knowing it he said \u201cIt is possible, but I don\u2019t think I did,\u201d and when asked if he had seen the child in the street had answered \u201cthat he did see the child in the street after he went by but he didn\u2019t see the child in front of him,\u201d \u201cthat as he was driving along Eastern Avenue, he saw no child in the street, but that he saw a child in the street later\u201d; that it was \u201cnone of his business\u201d; and that he saw the child from the rear of his automobile. The officer could not say whether Ryan told him that this was when \u201che was on Cross Street or Eastern Avenue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Ryan was overtaken by the police about 1:30 or 1:40 p.m. There were no brush marks on the dust on the automobile or other marks when it was then examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>The testimony permitted the conclusion that the plaintiff had been hit by an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The officers, in plain clothes and in a vehicle without police insignia, stopped the automobile with Ryan in it on East Main Street near the foot of Cross Street and walked around the automobile. Ryan asked why the automobile had been stopped (\u201cWhat\u2019s the story Chief?\u201d) and was told that the automobile had been reported in an accident. Ryan said \u201cYou\u2019ve got the wrong car, Chief,\u201d \u201cthe wrong number,\u201d and answered negatively when asked if he had struck a child up on Eastern Avenue, which was in sight and in which direction the officer pointed. When asked to account after being told that the officers had the number and description of his automobile, he described his movements after eating lunch and the officer knew that the course described would have put Ryan on Eastern Avenue in the area of the accident. Ryan lived in Hingham and testified that at the time of the accident he was \u201cjust familiar with the names of the main street and the street on the fish pier.\u201d Ryan went with the officer to the accident scene and denied he had heard Mrs. Damon shout, but when Mrs. Damon said \u201c[you] heard ... all right because you started to stop,\u201d he said he had heard her and had observed the child in the street, but \u201che didn\u2019t strike it and it was none of his business so he wasn\u2019t going to get involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">There can be no doubt of the relevance of the evidence of Ryan\u2019s evasive conduct and false statements to the issue of liability. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Shain, </em>291 Mass. 506, 512-513. <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Finley, </em>325 Mass. 99, 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The question remains, however, can it be concluded from all the evidence including the implied admissions that there was a greater probability than not that Ryan\u2019s automobile hit the plaintiff and that it was being operated negligently? <em>Atlas </em>v. <em>Silsbury-Gamble Motors Co. </em>278 Mass. 279, 282-283. We assume, without decision, an affirmative answer to the first question. We think that negligent operation could not be found. Disregarding the evidence favorable to Ryan which excludes his negligence, we can only speculate on what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>did happen. \u201cThe mere happening of an accident . . . where the circumstances immediately preceding it are left to conjecture, is not sufficient to prove negligence on the part of the operator of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Lach, </em>338 Mass. 233, 235. There is no basis for concluding that the vehicle was turning the corner into Cross Street \u201c. . . at a rate of speed exceeding fifteen miles per hour\u201d (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 17); that the plaintiff, if hit by Ryan, was hit elsewhere than about opposite the corner where found; or that the speed of the automobile was related to the accident. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>275 Mass. 272, 274-275. The implied admissions in Ryan\u2019s conduct and talk do not sustain the plaintiff\u2019s burden on the issue of negligence. Their probative force was weak on that issue. Censurable yielding to the impulse to avoid both the inevitable inconvenience of proved involvement and the risk of liability could be taken fully to account for what Ryan did and said. As to the caution required to avoid erroneous inferences from conduct, see Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 273, and his comment in note 2 on <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Shain, supra. </em>In <em>Credit Serv. Corp. </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>308 Mass. 476, 481, the defendant\u2019s consciousness of liability was evidenced by a conveyance without consideration and an incorporation a few days before action was begun. This court said (p. 481), \u201cAn implied admission of this sort may turn the scale where the evidence is conflicting. But it forms an insufficient foundation for the erection of an entire case by mere inference without other evidence.\u201d The issue of Ryan\u2019s negligence is the decisive issue, if not the \u201centire case,\u201d and we think the principle is applicable. In the circumstances there is insufficient evidence to make reasonable the conclusion that negligence of Ryan caused the accident. See cases cited <em>ibid., </em>p. 481. Compare, for express admission of omission to act, <em>Machado </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>326 Mass. 615, 617. In <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Shain, supra, </em>291 Mass. 506, 508-511, the issue concerned only the admissibility of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s appearance after the accident. The defendant had admitted that he hit the deceased and the evidence apart from the implied admissions was sufficient to show negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>gence. In <em>D\u2019Arcangelo </em>v. <em>Tartar, </em>265 Mass. 350, the issue was identity of the automobile and driver. The direct evidence supported a finding of negligence of the driver of whatever automobile hit the plaintiff, and there was some other evidence of identity in addition to the evidence tending to show consciousness of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
