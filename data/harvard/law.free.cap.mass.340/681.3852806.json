The information so furnished, after analysis by a firm of public accountants, was introduced in evidence at the hearings which led to the promulgation by the commission on November 17 of the price fixing order G17-505 discussed in the <em>Cumberland Farms </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">On November 20, 1958, the Governor under G. L. c. 94A, \u00a7 12, ordered the commission by telegram to review order G17-505. The commission, being in doubt as to the nature and scope of such a review, requested an opinion from the Attorney General, who advised them, among other things, that a review was \u201ca separate proceeding.\u201d Thereafter, on December 1, the commission voted to gather the necessary material for the \u201creview\u201d of G17-505, and on December 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>promulgated amendment 1 to official order G17-450 (the order of August 11 requiring the cost data reports). Amendment 1, like the earlier order, required the milk dealers in marketing area 17 to report certain cost data. It was adopted without notice and hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The petitioner, James P. Dacey, claiming to be aggrieved by amendment 1, brought this petition for review under G. L. c. 94A, \u00a7 21. Cumberland Farms, Inc., which also was affected by the amendment, was allowed to intervene. The case was heard on the pleadings together with certain documentary evidence showing the action taken by the commission. There apparently was no oral evidence and the judge made no findings of fact. A decree was entered adjudging that amendment 1 was adopted and promulgated in accordance with law. The petitioner and the intervener appealed. The case comes here on the pleadings, the decree, and the documentary evidence, including the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The basis of the appeal is that amendment 1 was invalid. Inasmuch as the amendment was adopted in connection with a review of order G17-505 which, as we held in the <em>Cumberland Farms </em>case, <em>ante, </em>is no longer operative, wre could very well decline to deal with the amendment on the ground that the questions concerning it are moot. But, as in the <em>Cumberland Farms </em>case, since the questions are of importance and have been fully argued, we shall proceed to indicate our views. See <em>Vautier, petitioner, ante, </em>341, 344-345. Moreover, there is a suggestion in the briefs that sanctions may be imposed against the intervener because of its alleged noncompliance with the amendment. See \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Since the amendment was adopted without notice and hearing (see G. L. c. 94A, \u00a7\u00a716 [To] and 17 [V]), the commission seeks to justify its adoption in this manner under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 2 (3) (the State administrative procedure act), which provides in part, \u201cIf the agency finds that immediate adoption or amendment of a regulation is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety or general welfare, and that observance of the requirements of notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>and public hearing would be contrary to the public interest, the agency may dispense with such requirements and adopt the regulation or amendment as an emergency regulation or amendment. The agency\u2019s finding and a brief statement of the reasons for its finding shall be incorporated in the emergency regulation or amendment . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Contrary to the intervener\u2019s contention, we are of opinion that amendment 1 is a type of order that falls within \u00a7 2 (3), for that section prescribes the procedure for the \u201camendment of <em>any </em>regulation as to which a hearing is required by any law . . \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied). See 1954 Annual Survey of Mass. Law, 126, 131. And we are of opinion that the information which the amendment was designed to obtain was not irrelevant to the establishment of minimum wholesale and retail prices of milk. Section 10 gives to the commission very broad powers with respect to what it may consider in establishing minimum prices. It shall ascertain \u201cby such examination or investigation as the situation may permit or warrant\u201d what prices will be most beneficial to the public interest and will best protect the milk industry. And in every such examination or investigation the commission \u201cshall take into consideration all the conditions affecting the milk industry, including the amount necessary to yield a reasonable return to the producer and to the milk dealer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Thus, the question narrows down to whether the amendment was adopted in conformity with the requirements of \u00a7 2 (3). We are of opinion that it was. The commission found, as required by \u00a7 2 (3), that the immediate adoption of the amendment was \u201cnecessary for the preservation of the public health, safety or general welfare,\u201d and that the \u201cobservance of the requirements of notice and public hearing would be contrary to the public interest.\u201d The commission stated as reasons for these findings that if the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>quirements of notice and hearing were <em>to </em>be observed (1) the review would be unduly delayed and (2) the proper and expeditious administration of the law would be prevented. These findings satisfy the formal requirements of \u00a7 2 (3) and are sufficient to support the order unless it can be said to be erroneous for any of the grounds enumerated in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (8), which by reason of c. 94A, \u00a7 21, determine the standards of review in a case of this sort. The petitioner\u2019s and the intervener\u2019s attack on the amendment appears to be based on ground (g) of \u00a7 14 (8) which provides that the court may set aside a decision of an administrative agency upon the court\u2019s determination that substantial rights of a .party have been prejudiced by reason of a decision which is \u201c[Vjrbitrary or capricious\u201d or \u201can abuse of discretion.\u201d More specifically, they urge that there was no basis for the commission\u2019s finding that the immediate adoption of the amendment was necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety or general welfare. There can be little doubt that the price fixing order G17-505 concerned the public welfare. On the basis of the record before us, taking into consideration the urgency imported by the Governor\u2019s telegram ordering a review of G17-505, we cannot say that the commission\u2019s finding that an immediate adoption of the amendment was necessary for the general welfare was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion; the amendment was designed to furnish the commission with data reasonably relevant to its review.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The decree affirming the action of the commission is reversed, not on the merits, but because the original order sought to be reviewed has become moot. The case is remanded to the Superior Court with directions to dismiss the petition. See <em>Vigoda </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Boston State Hosp. </em>336 Mass. 724, 726-727.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-7\"> The intervener\u2019s contention is founded on the provision in \u00a7 2 (3) that ''[o]a emergency regulation or amendment shall not remain in effect for longer than three months unless during that time the agency gives notice and holds a public hearing as required in this section.\u201d It is argued that this indicates that the emergency provision was intended to apply only to amendments of a continuing nature and not to one, as here, relating to a single event.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
