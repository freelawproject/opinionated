[and the] display of not more than two signs pertaining to the permitted use with a total area of not more than twelve square feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The board denied the application specifying as grounds, inter alla, that the real estate business is not an accessory use customarily incidental to the use of the premises as a home and that the plaintiff\u2019s business is not a profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">In the proceedings on appeal to the Superior Court (G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21) the parties filed a statement of agreed facts and the judge reserved and reported the case on that statement and the pleadings. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The decision of the board is to be judged on the facts adduced in the Superior Court. <em>Pendergast </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>331 Mass. 555, 558-559.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">The parties have rightly recognized in a stipulation included in the statement of agreed facts that the issues are the two stated above, with which the board dealt, and that \u201cif the vocation ... is neither a profession nor <em>\u2018a </em>customary home occupation \u2019 . . .no modification of . . . [the board\u2019s] decision is required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">For purposes of zoning classification a real estate broker is engaged in business and is not practising a profession. Though the vocation, like many businesses, may have professional aspects, they are not primary. G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 87PP, 87RR. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>79 Cal. App. 2d 813, 816-818, and cases cited. Rathkopf, The Law of Zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>and Planning, c. 23, \u00a7 19. See <em>Building Commr. of Brookline </em>v. <em>McManus, </em>263 Mass. 270, 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The plaintiff shows no right to require the permit under the \u201ccustomary home occupation\u201d clause. There is no statement of what is customary in Holliston in respect of home occupations. It is stated that the plaintiff\u2019s office and only place of business is in one room of the residence, that in newspaper advertisements the plaintiff gives his residence as his place of business, that he has off street parking facilities for his customers on the premises, that in summer there are about twenty-five customers a month, and in winter about eighteen a month, that there are no employees, but the plaintiff has some help from his wife and son. We cannot rule that the conduct of a real estate business is, as a matter of law, a customary home occupation. Nor can we rule that it was error in law for the board to determine, for Holliston, that such a business is not customarily incident to the use of the premises as a home. See <em>Riverside </em>v. <em>Kuhne, </em>335 Ill. App. 547, 560 (insurance <em>office); </em>Bassett, Zoning, pp. 100-101 (\u201cThe earliest zoning ordinances took communities as they existed and did not try to prevent customary practices that met with no objection from the community\u201d). We intend no intimation as to the validity or invalidity under such a by-law of a determination that, for the particular municipality, a real estate business, as conducted, is a customary home occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The final decree is to adjudge that the decision of the board of appeals is within its jurisdiction and no modification is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
