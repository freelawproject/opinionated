The bill seeks to reach and apply a note and mortgage secured by the assets of the market given by Modano to Beale, and was taken as confessed against Modano. A final decree was entered estabhshing all the claims of the plaintiff, ordering the defendants to pay them, and restraining Beale from foreclosing the mortgage until they had been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">There was evidence that Beale, who is a physician, learned in the latter part of May, 1953, while attending Modano, that he was having difficulty with one Acconcia, a copartner with whom he was conducting the market in Hyde Park. Beale lent Modano $3,500, of which $3,200 was paid to a creditor of the market, and Modano gave Beale his note for $4,000. Modano also joined Beale in an agreement giving to the latter an option to become a partner in the market by discharging the indebtedness. On or about June 20, 1953, Modano purchased Aeconcia\u2019s interest in the market for $3,500 and filed a certificate under G. L. c. 110, \u00a7 5, with the city clerk of Boston that he, Modano, was conducting the market. Beale on May 21, 1953, had filed a business certificate as the proprietor of Your Market, elsewhere in Hyde Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">The judge found that Beale and Modano on or about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>June 20, 1953, entered into a secret partnership in the operation of the market, that thereafter Beale engaged employees, appeared regularly to examine the books, and on one occasion warned a salesman that if the manager of the market placed an order with him, he, Beale, would not be responsible for the bill. The judge also found that on another occasion, on April 12, 1954, Beale wrote the manager purporting to discharge him \u201cfrom my employment\u201d and signed the letter \u201cFrederick F. Beale, Co-Partner.\u201d On September 28, 1954, Modano and Beale entered into a written agreement \u201cthat the status existing between us by which we were partners to each other but not partners as to third persons is hereby dissolved .... This is our termination of the partnership agreement.\u201d The judge further found that all the claims in suit arose after Beale became a partner, that none of these creditors was aware of the relationship of Beale to the market, and that notice of the dissolution was never published in a newspaper of general circulation in the place \u201cat which the partnership was regularly carried on.\u201d But he found that Beale, both by words spoken and written and by his conduct, represented himself as a partner in the market and that he made such representations in a public manner. The only evidence of public representations is that summed up in the prior findings. The judge stated, \u201cI cannot find that the activities of Beale were so far unknown and were so inactive that the business reputation of the partnership cannot be said to have been in any degree due to Beale\u2019s connection with it.\u201d He ruled that Beale was liable on all six accounts as though he were an active member of the partnership under G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 16 (1) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Beale even though only a secret and inactive partner was liable as undisclosed principal to one who sold goods to the partnership while he remained a partner. G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 15. <em>Grosvenor </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>1 Met. 19, 20. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Langdon, </em>12 Allen, 544. Crane, Partnership (2d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 24, 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Four of the six debts sued upon, however, came into existence after the agreement of dissolution of September 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>1954, although the creditors had sold goods on credit to \u201cNapoli Super Market\u201d prior thereto. Representatives of three of these creditors testified that they never knew Beale. The only evidence of the knowledge of the other is (1) the answer \u201c[o]nly by hearsay\u201d to the question put to the man who became credit manager of that creditor in 1957: \u201cAs credit manager you have never heard of Beale, have you?\u201d (2) the ledger card of that creditor, which read \u201cNapoli Grocery Company, M. Modano,\u201d and (3) the assignment which designated the account as \u201cModano d/b/a Napoli Super Market.\u201d General Laws c. 108A, \u00a7 16,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> relied on below, is merely declaratory of the common law principle of estoppel, <em>Standard Oil Co. of N. Y. </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>265 Mass. 322, 326, and is inapplicable to the four post-dissolution debts, for by its terms one representing himself to be a partner is liable only \u201cto any . . . person to whom such representation has been made.\u201d There is no finding that Beale himself made any representations to the creditors that he was a partner, or that any representations he made were ever communicated to them. On the contrary the judge found that \u201cnone of the assignors . . . [was] aware of the relationship of Beale to the Napoli Super Market.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The assignee relies on G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 35.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>section the partnership remains liable to creditors which \u201cextended credit to the partnership prior to dissolution and had no knowledge or notice of the dissolution,\u201d but, even so, the liability of the former partner is to be satisfied from partnership assets alone if he was sufficiently unknown and inactive to make subsection (2) applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The evidence being reported we are to decide the case according to our judgment of the facts, accepting the findings below unless we determine that they are plainly wrong. <em>Cowden </em>v. Cutting, 339 Mass. 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">We hold that the qualification of reasonableness is implied in \u00a7 35 (2) (b). It must be determined whether, viewing most favorably for the creditors the evidence of the business reputation of the partnership, the retired partner\u2019s activity and the knowledge that others had of his participation, it could reasonably be concluded that there was a causal relationship between his participation and that reputation. We need not determine the extent of the function of the fact finder in applying \u00a7 35 (2) (b) for, in our view, on the evidence and the subsidiary facts found, the ruling is required that Beale was \u201cfs]o far unknown and inactive in partnership affairs that the business reputation of . . . [Napoli Super Market from June, 1953, to September, 1954] could not . . . [reasonably be found] to have been in any degree due to his connection with it.\u201d <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Hurlburt, </em>5 Cowen (N. Y.) 534, 535. See <em>Hornaday </em>v. <em>Cowgill, </em>54 Ind. App. 631; Crane, Partnership (2d ed.) p. 442. Compare the cases which are said to underlie \u00a7 35 (Burdick, Partnership [3d ed.] pp. 267-269), and where, semble, the retired partner had had more participation, <em>Elkinton </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>143 Mass. 479; <em>Elmira Iron &amp; Steel Rolling Mill Co. </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>124 N. Y. 280; <em>Griggs &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>63 Misc. (N. Y.) 348; <em>Shamburg </em>v. <em>Ruggles, </em>83 Pa. 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">There is no evidence that anyone in the business community who extended credit knew that there was a partnership, and no evidence that anyone outside the market, other than the salesman to whom Beale spoke, heard of the remark which implied Beale\u2019s proprietorship or of inferences drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>therefrom. There was no direct evidence of the business reputation of the market. The only evidence of the knowledge of proprietorship had by the businesses which extended credit came from witnesses who supported the accounts attached to the assignments as reflecting the books. This evidence tended to show that only Modano was known as connected with Napoli Super Market in the offices of four of the creditors, and no one was known as proprietor of the market in the offices of the other two.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">There was evidence that three of the six creditors whose accounts had been assigned, and perhaps a fourth, had done business with the market prior to June, 1953, when Beale was not a partner and another person was. It is a necessary conclusion from the business certificate that anyone who was sufficiently concerned about credit to make inquiry at the city clerk\u2019s office or of a responsible credit reporter after about June 20, 1953, would have learned that Modano claimed to be the only proprietor. The evidence showed that Beale never ordered merchandise, did not work in the market nor direct its operations, even when Modano was in the hospital, had nothing to do with keeping the books and \u201csignfed] nothing.\u201d There was evidence that about the time of the dissolution \u201cbusiness was going down,\u201d \u201cwas very quiet,\u201d and there was no evidence to suggest that the business had responded favorably to Beale\u2019s connection with it, if that is material, which we need not decide. It is a reasonable conclusion that some persons in the business community may have heard of Beale\u2019s connection. But reputation depends on general knowledge. See <em>F. W. Stock &amp; Sons </em>v. Dellapenna, 217 Mass. 503, 506; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry. </em>254 Mass. 441,443; <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Canning, </em>180 Mass. 461, 463; Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 261 (3), 1580 et seq., 1612. \u201cBusiness reputation\u201d reflects standing in the business community. <em>Denny </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>2 Cush. 160, 169-170. <em>Heywood </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>4 Gray, 574, 579-580. Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 1616.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">We assume but need not decide that there was an extension of credit to the partnership notwithstanding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>creditors did not know that Napoli Super Market was a partnership.
