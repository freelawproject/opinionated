L. c. 65, \u00a7 27 (as amended through St. 1953, c. 654, \u00a7 90), by the trustee under the will of Horatio Davis against the commissioner of corporations and taxation (the commissioner), in which the executor and trustee under the will of Maria D. Hastings has been joined as a party, for the abatement of a legacy tax. Horatio died on February 25, 1910, leaving property in trust to pay income to two nieces Susan Benson and Maria Hastings \u201cor such of them as shall be living at the respective times of payment . . . during the life of the . . . survivor . . . and at the death of such . . . survivor . . . to . . . distribute the . . . trust fund to . . . such persons and in such manner as the . . . survivor of my said nieces by her last will . . . shall appoint,\u201d with gifts over, not here relevant, in default of appointment. Maria was the survivor and died on June 6, 1957, leaving a will, in art. sixth of which she validly exercised the power of appointment under Horatio Davis\u2019s will by appointing the principal of the trust fund \u201cto the executor of this my will ... to be . . . dealt with ... as general assets of my estate.\u201d By art. seventh of Maria\u2019s will, she left the residue of her estate to her trustee in trust to pay the income to her sister, Alice H. Crompton, for life, with gifts over of the principal at Alice\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Maria\u2019s estate was sufficient to pay all debts, expenses, taxes, claims, and legacies, without resort to the appointed assets. All Massachusetts legacy taxes payable prior to Maria\u2019s death by Horatio\u2019s executors or trustees have been paid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The trustee of Horatio\u2019s will tendered to the commissioner $1,482.88 in payment of the succession tax which the trustee admitted was due on Alice Crompton\u2019s life interest in the appointed assets under art. seventh of Maria Hastings\u2019s will. This amount was computed at the statutory rate fixed by taking into account the family relationship of Alice to Horatio Davis. The commissioner declined to accept the tender as a payment in full for all taxes then due from the trust under Horatio\u2019s will. He certified a tax in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>sum of $18,523.79 on the value of the entire trust as of the date of the death of Maria computed at the statutory rate based upon Maria\u2019s family relationship to Horatio Davis. The commissioner thus contended that, by art. sixth of Maria\u2019s will, Maria had made manifest \u201cher intent to co-mingle . . . [the appointive assets] to make them part of her general estate,\u201d so that, in effect, there would be one tax upon the succession to the trust assets by their passage from Horatio\u2019s trust to Maria\u2019s estate and a further tax upon the succession to the assets as part of Maria\u2019s estate when transmitted to the residuary legatees under art. seventh of Maria\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The probate judge heard the case on a stipulation of the facts summarized above. The final decree provided that the \u201conly legacy tax for which . . . [Horatio Davis\u2019s trustee] is now liable is that ... on the present life interest of Alice H. Crompton under article seventh of the will of Maria D. Hastings in the amount of $1,482.88.\u201d The commissioner has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">1. The power of appointment given to Maria under Horatio Davis\u2019s will was a general testamentary power of appointment. By exercising that power Maria made the appointive property available in equity to her creditors, although such resort was not necessary in the particular case. See <em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Ingraham, </em>126 Mass. 200, 202-204; <em>National Shawmut Bank </em>v. <em>Joy, </em>315 Mass. 457, 472; <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Alfred Univ. </em>339 Mass. 82, 88. See also <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen. </em>229 Mass. 474, 476-478; Newhall, Settlement of Estates (4th ed.) \u00a7 369. Cf. <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Wordell, </em>319 Mass. 118, 120. A similar result would have followed exercise of the power by the residuary article (seventh) of her will. See <em>Slayton </em>v. <em>Fitch Home, Inc. </em>293 Mass. 574, 580. Maria, in the circumstances of her estate, could thus have accomplished in one step the same result in fact achieved by her in two steps, viz. (1) appointment by art. sixth to her estate, (2) the disposition by art. seventh of her residuary estate. See <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Painter, </em>322 Mass. 362, 366; Newhall, Settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ment of Estates (4th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 365-366, 368. It is not necessary to decide whether, in all circumstances, the results of a disposition of the appointive assets solely by the residuary article (seventh) would have been the same as those which followed the method she in fact adopted. See Restatement: Property, \u00a7 363; Am. Law of Property, \u00a7 23.59. Whether one step or two steps were employed in the will and codicil constituting her will, Maria, by the whole of those instruments which took effect at her death, designated, in her capacity as donee of the power and thus in effect agent of Horatio, the donor, the ultimate recipients of the appointive assets. Under concepts of property law long recognized, those who receive the appointive property will take from Horatio and not from her. The disposition is a succession taxable under G. L. c. 65, \u00a7 1 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 596),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> only in Horatio\u2019s estate. See <em>Emmons </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>171 Mass. 410, 411-413; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen. </em>221 Mass. 600, 601-602; Restatement: Property, \u00a7 333. See also Am. Law of Property, \u00a7\u00a7 23.3-23.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">2. The commissioner has support in various Pennsylvania cases,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> since overcome by a statute (Purdon\u2019s Pa. Sts. Anno. Title 72, \u00a7 2301), which are contrary to the principles stated in the Massachusetts cases just cited and to authority elsewhere. See <em>McMurtry </em>v. <em>State, </em>111 Conn. 594, 599-605, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>which properly (at p. 599) the contention there and here made by the taxing authorities was referred to as \u201cone more of form than of substance.\u201d We do not follow the Pennsylvania cases. Cases dealing with the principles of \u201ccapture\u201d or \u201cblending\u201d may be used in determining questions such as arise under the rule against perpetuities. See e.g. <em>Fiduciary Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Mishou, </em>321 Mass. 615, 622-627; <em>Amerige </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>324 Mass. 648, 660-663. It is inappropriate to apply these principles, in the absence of a clear legislative mandate, to impose a double excise under tax statutes which deal with \u201cmatters of substance.\u201d See <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Bullard, </em>313 Mass. 72, 86-87, 93. See also <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Second Natl. Bank, </em>308 Mass. 1, 6-7. The \u201cright to tax must be found within the letter of the law; it is not to be extended by implication.\u201d See <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>335 Mass. 431, 435. No legislative intention to impose a double excise in this situation is shown by the statutes. We intend no intimation as to the constitutional validity of such a double excise.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">3. The decree of the Probate Court is affirmed. Horatio Davis\u2019s trustee is to have costs of this appeal. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>309 Mass. 293, 300. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>320 Mass. 168, 173. See G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 16, and analogy of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 3 (as amended through St. 1951, c. 518), \u00a7 4. See also G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\"> Section 1, aa so amended, so far as pertinent reads: \u201cAll property within the . . . commonwealth, . . . and any interest therein, belonging to inhabitants of the commonwealth, . . . which shall pass by will . . . [or] succession . . . shall be subject to a tax at the percentage rates fixed by the following table: [Here follows a table of rates] . . ..\u201d General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 65, \u00a7 13, reads, so far as relevant: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this and the following section, the tax . . . shall be assessed upon the value of the property at the ... death of the decedent. In case of a . . . bequest ... to take effect in possession . . . after the expiration of one or more life estates . . . the tax shall be assessed on the value of the property or interest therein coming to the beneficiary at the time when he becomes entitled to the same in possession or enjoyment. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The power of appointment under Horatio Davis\u2019s will was created after September 1, 1907.
