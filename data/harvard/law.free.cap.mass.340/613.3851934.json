L. c. 32, \u00a7 89A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the amount which would have been due from January 7 to March 11, 1958, based on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>annuity of $1,500 with dependent\u2019s allowance of $312 per year. The defendant has excepted to an order for judgment for the plaintiff in the amount claimed and to the denial of requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The auditor found these facts: The deceased died June 5, 1954, of a coronary occlusion, that is, \u201ca constriction or obstruction to a coronary vessel or artery to the heart resulting in infarction (death to the muscle tissues and cells)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">. . . [which], is a heart disease.\u201d The deceased had been retired on May 7, 1952, for \u201cmyocarditis, a heart disease, of undetermined origin\u201d after suffering a heart attack on April 21, 1952. His retirement was in accordance with the provisions of G. L. c. 32, with the benefit of \u00a7 94.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s application for an annuity was placed on file by the Medford city council on November 29, 1955. The plaintiff then successfully petitioned the Superior Court for a writ of mandamus which ordered the city manager (G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 104) and council to appoint a medical board to process her application in accordance with \u00a7 89A. The ensuing report of a medical board stated that they \u201cmet . . . and reviewed the past history\u201d of the deceased which \u201cindicated that he was originally certified for retirement . . . because of a myocarditis of undetermined origin . . . [and that he] expired on June 5, 1954, with the certified diagnosis of coronary occlusion \u2014 hour. The medical panel does not find any evidence to indicate that the deceased . . . died as a result of an injury received in the performance of his duty as a member of the police department of the city of Medford.\u201d The city manager declined to grant an annuity and sent a copy of the report to the city council with the statement that he had acted in view of the \u201cpanel\u2019s\u201d (medical board\u2019s) findings. The city council placed the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>port on file. The city \u201chas refused to pay an annuity to the plaintiff.\u201d The auditor found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Where the statutory requirements for an annuity have been satisfied, a plaintiff may recover the annuity by an action of contract. <em>Lenox </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>330 Mass. 593, 595. Here, however, the requirements have not been satisfied. There are lacking necessary determinations by the city manager and council (the \u201cappropriate public authority\u201d under \u00a7 89A). This section requires (1) that it be \u201cproved to the satisfaction of\u201d the public authority that the death of the deceased was the natural and proximate result of an accident or hazard undergone in the performance and within the scope of duty and (2) that the \u201camount of any such annuity shall from time to time be determined within the limits . . . [set out in the section] by the . . . public authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 94 <em>(supra, </em>note 2), although helpful to the plaintiff, does not make action by the public authority unnecessary. As the authority has failed to grant an annuity there is no present indebtedness from the city to the plaintiff for which an action at law will lie and the defendant\u2019s exceptions must be sustained. Something should be said, however, of the respective rights and obligations. See <em>Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic </em>Assn. v. <em>Beede, </em>320 Mass. 601, 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The plaintiff has the benefit of the presumption under \u00a7 94 if the deceased died from the same hypertension or heart disease that brought about the retirement. The presumption continues that such disease was service connected. <em>Selectmen of West Springfield </em>v. <em>Hoar, </em>333 Mass. 257, 259. Section 94, however, at least as worded prior to St. 1956, c. 411, did not purport to create a presumption that the heart disease which causes death some time after retirement is the same heart disease that caused retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Although the statute (G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 7 [1], 6 [3]) provides that no member shall be retired for service connected disability in the absence of a certificate of a \u201cmedical panel\u201d setting out both the incapacity and whether the disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>might be service connected, the effect of \u00a7 94 is that the latter requirement \u201cno longer applies as a condition precedent to hypertension or heart disease cases.\u201d <em>Mathewson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>335 Mass. 610, 615-616. This principle is applicable in proceedings for an annuity under \u00a7 89A. Its effect is not to eliminate the necessity of a certificate by the medical board filed with the city treasurer (and in the light of which the public authority is entitled to act, as an amendment to the statute [\"St. 1956, c. <em>424</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>in effect expressly provides) but is to limit the significance of the certification. The medical board does not have a duty to provide statements of evidence, <em>Mathewson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>335 Mass. 610, 615, but its certificate is in itself in the nature of evidence <em>(ibid., </em>615), on which, subject to the effect of the presumption, the public authority may act. The plaintiff and the public authority are entitled to an understandable certificate by the medical board which reflects the evidence before it. The board in the circumstances of this case should certify (1) whether death was caused by the disease on which retirement was based, and (2) whether there was evidence that the disease was not service connected and their finding on that issue. Unless a certificate of the board, based on evidence that the disease was not service connected, or other \u201ccompetent evidence\u201d before the public authority, shows that the disease was not service connected, the statutory presumption will be operative in the proceedings before it. Because of the ambiguity of the board\u2019s report as made (that it \u201cdoes not find any evidence to indicate that the deceased . . . died as a result of an injury received in the performance of his duty\u201d) the certificate is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We assume that the public authority could have inferred from the certificate that the disabling disease was also the disease which caused the death. With the aid of the presumption that that disease was service connected, the cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>tificate, so construed, would have supported the vote of an annuity. We think the certificate did not justify the opposite inference, that is, that the disabling and the killing diseases were not the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">In the light of these principles there appears occasion for further action both by the medical board and by the public authority, with the necessary determinations made in accordance with reasonably appropriate standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-8\"> General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 89A, as amended through St. 1952, c. 431, \u00a7 4, provided in part: \u201cIf an employee ... of any political subdivision . . . dies from injuries received, or dies as a natural and proximate result of undergoing a hazard peculiar to his employment, while in the performance of his duty, and it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the appropriate public authority . . . that such death was the natural and proximate result of an accident occurring, or of undergoing . . .
