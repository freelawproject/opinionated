The case was referred to an auditor under the usual rule and he found for the plaintiff. Thereafter the case was tried to a jury on the auditor\u2019s report and other evidence, and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The case comes here on the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>exceptions to several rulings on evidence and to portions of the charge. No questions bearing on liability are involved and we shall recite only so much of the evidence as is necessary to an understanding of the challenged rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">At some time in 1953 the defendant was engaged by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company to install a culvert, a portion of which was to pass under Southhampton Street, Boston. On May 19, 1953, the city of Boston issued a permit to the defendant for the excavation of a part of Southampton Street. Work was commenced on the culvert in the summer of 1953, and was completed early in the fall of that year. A portion of the culvert ran under a thirty inch water main of the city of Boston. That part of the water main that was above the culvert rested on steel I beams installed by the defendant. When the concrete roof of the culvert was poured the bottoms of the I beams were embedded in the concrete.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Early in the morning of January 20, 1955, the water main broke and water filled the basement of the plaintiff\u2019s restaurant, causing damage to his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">1. The theory of the plaintiff\u2019s case was that the defendant was negligent in suspending the water main directly on the I beams, and that such negligence resulted in the break. The defendant\u2019s position in part was that the break was not caused by its negligence but resulted from a deteriorated main which had broken on numerous occasions. In support of this position the defendant offered in evidence certain reports (ten in all) of the water division of the public works department of the city of Boston, and an annual report of that division. The reports were designated \u201cA\u201d to \u201cJ,\u201d inclusive, for identification and the annual report was designated \u201cL\u201d for identification. This evidence was excluded and the defendant made appropriate offers of proof and excepted to the rulings. Three of the reports, \u201cA,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d and \u201cC,\u201d relate to the same incident, a repair job on the water main at Southampton Street in April, 1950. All that these reports reveal is that the \u201cpipe sagged\u201d and that twenty-five feet of new pipe was relaid. \u201cF\u201d refers to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>\u201cleak outside gate box\u201d on November 16, 1953; \u201cG\u201d to a \u201cleak on 30\" main\u201d in February, 1954; \u201cH,\u201d dated November 24, 1954, to a \u201cleak under bridge\u201d; \u201cI\u201d to the digging of two test holes \u201cto locate M T A duct line\u201d; and \u201cJ,\u201d dated May 22, 1947, to a \u201cleak in south sleeve.\u201d All of the foregoing incidents occurred in the general vicinity of Southampton Street where the defendant\u2019s installation was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\u201cD,\u201d \u201cE,\u201d and \u201cL\u201d refer to work done by reason of the break on January 20, 1955, which is the basis of the present action. \u201cE\u201d reveals nothing more than that there was repair work on the thirty inch main. \u201cD\u201d contains a statement that the cause of the break was \u201cblow-offs,\u201d and \u201cL\u201d in one place attributes the cause of the break to \u201cdefective blow-off\u201d and in another place to \u201cpipe resting on new sewer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">We assume, without deciding, that the reports satisfy the public record or official statement (as it is sometimes called) exception to the hearsay rule. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, </em>245 Mass. 405, 417; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dorr, </em>216 Mass. 314, 319; Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 1633 (1). Compare <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Kidd, </em>197 Mass. 256, 259; <em>Fondi </em>v. <em>Boston Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>224 Mass. 6, 8; <em>Amory </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>321 Mass. 240, 252-253. Most of the excluded reports show no more than the fact of a leak in the main or a sagged pipe in the general vicinity of where the leak in question occurred. That is true of \u201cA,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d \u201cC,\u201d \u201cF,\u201d \u201cG,\u201d \u201cH,\u201d and \u201c J.\u201d \u201cI\u201d does not even show that; it shows only that two \u201ctest holes\u201d were dug, and need not concern us further. We assume that evidence of this type could be admissible for the purpose offered. But without further evidence showing the causes and circumstances of these leaks the excluded evidence would have slight, if any, probative value. And, if additional evidence of the causes and circumstances were to be introduced, there would be the danger of confusion or of unreasonable expenditure of time in the trial of collateral issues. Generally the admissibility of such evidence has been left to the wise discretion of the trial judge. He is in a better position than anyone else to determine the relevancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>of such evidence and whether it will unduly prolong the trial or confuse the jury with collateral issues. For a good discussion of this subject with an exhaustive collection of authorities, see opinion of Lummus, J., in <em>Robitaille </em>v. <em>Netoco Community Theatre of No. Attleboro, Inc. </em>305 Mass. 265, 266-269. See also <em>Guidara &amp; Terenzio Inc. </em>v. <em>R. Guastavino Co. </em>286 Mass. 502, 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">We are of opinion that under the principles just stated the judge did not err in excluding exhibits for identification <em>\u201cA,\u201d </em>\u201cB,\u201d \u201cC,\u201d \u201cF,\u201d \u201cG,\u201d \u201cH,\u201d \u201cI,\u201d and \u201cJ.\u201d Nor was there any error in the exclusion of \u201cD,\u201d \u201cE,\u201d and \u201cL,\u201d which related to the leak in question. \u201cE\u201d contained nothing of any consequence. \u201cD\u201d and \u201cL\u201d added little or nothing to the testimony of employees of the water division, and were objectionable for the further reason that they contained opinions. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, </em>245 Mass. 405, it was stated by Eugg, C.J., at page 417, that, although there might be exceptions, the general rule was that \u201crecords . . . by public officers concerning causes and effects involving the exercise of judgment and discretion, expressions of opinion, and making conclusions are not admissible in evidence as public records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">2. One Campbell (a superintendent in the water division of the Boston public works department) was called by the plaintiff and was permitted to testify that there was a regulation of the public works department which provided \u201cthat there shall be no pipes placed closer than twelve inches to a water pipe in all directions, so that we can get at the water pipe to repair it or relay it. That is the sum and substance. \u201d No written proof of the regulation was offered; nor was such proof introduced later.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant seasonably saved its rights to the admission of this evidence on the ground that it was an attempt to prove the contents of a regulation by oral evidence rather than by the regulation itself. This evidence related to an important issue in the trial and if it was erroneously admitted it was prejudicial to the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>We are of opinion that it was error to permit proof of the regulation in this manner. Courts do not take judicial notice of regulations; they must be put in evidence. <em>Finlay </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Assn. Inc. </em>308 Mass. 20, 27. <em>Diaduk\u2019s Case, </em>336 Mass. 5, 7. If, as seems unlikely, the regulation was oral, it was not admissible. In this respect the situation closely resembles that of an oral rule. In <em>Gerry </em>v. <em>Worcester Consol. St. Ry. </em>248 Mass. 559, it was held that oral rules of a street railway company were inadmissible. It was said at page 565, \u201cThe existence of written or printed rules can be easily established. Oral rules resting in the memory or recollection of witnesses might be difficult to prove. Evidence concerning them might be uncertain and contradictory, and would tend to prolong the trial of a case and divert the attention of the jury from the issues involved. A rule for the guidance of employees in matters affecting the safety of others must be made known to them; it must be published.\u201d This reasoning is equally applicable to regulations of a city, town or governmental agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">If, on the other hand, the regulation was written, the proof of it ought not to have been by oral evidence; the written regulation itself was the best evidence and should have been introduced. The proof of printed regulations has been made easy by statute (see G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 75); the printed regulation should be put in evidence, unless shown to be unavailable, which is not the case here. Often much might depend on the precise wording of the regulation. The exception to this evidence must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">3. The defendant, prior to excavating Southampton Street, applied for and was granted a permit to excavate by the public works department of Boston. One Pinkul,. principal engineer of the water division of that department, was called by the plaintiff, and in response to a series of questions by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel he described the procedure in connection with the granting of a permit to excavate a street. He was shown the permit (exhibit 1) to excavate Southampton Street, which had been issued by the city to the defendant, and stated that he had never seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>it before, but that if he had approved the defendant\u2019s application for the permit he would have appended a sticker that \u201cwe append to all approved plans.\u201d The sticker, on which there was printed matter, was then admitted in evidence, as what \u201cthe witness says would have been appended to an approved application for [&gt;3 permit.\u201d All of this evidence was subject to the defendant\u2019s objection and exception. The sticker bore the caption \u201c City of Boston \u2014\u2022 Public Works Department \u2014 Water Division,\u201d and contained, among other provisions, the following: \u201cLocation approved with the distinct understanding that no masonry, concrete, duct or pipe shall be placed nearer than one foot of a water pipe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The plaintiff seeks to support the admission of the sticker on the ground that it was a regulation of the public works department and hence was admissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 75, which provides in part that \u201cPrinted copies of rules and regulations purporting to be issued by authority of any department ... of any city or town having authority to adopt them . . . shall be admitted without certification or attestation, but, if their genuineness is questioned, the court may require such certification or attestation thereof as it deems necessary.\u201d We assume that the sticker could be a printed copy of a regulation. But the plaintiff failed to lay any foundation that the sticker was a copy of any regulation, and there is nothing on the face of the sticker that indicates that it was such. Thus, it cannot be said to be a printed copy of a regulation \u201cpurporting to be issued\u201d by the public works department.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Conceivably the admission of the sticker might be justified on the ground that, since it was customary for such sticker to be appended to all applications, an inference might arise that a sticker was appended to the application here. See <em>Santarpio </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>301 Mass. 207, 209. But the contents of the sticker were not shown to have the force of a regulation, and, whether or not it was customarily attached to permits, it had no relevancy, and ought to have been excluded. This evidence related to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>important issue in the case (whether the proper space was maintained between the culvert and the water main) and it could very well have been harmful to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">4. The remaining exceptions arise out of certain statements by the judge in his charge, which the defendant contends amounted to a charge on the facts in violation of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 81. But these are questions that are not likely to arise on a retrial of the case and do not require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\"> The sticker (exhibit 8) discussed later under part 3 was not such evidence for reasons there appearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
