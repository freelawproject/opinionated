The single member\u2019s findings and decision were adopted by the reviewing board. In the Superior Court, a final decree was entered (a) stating that the \u201cdeceased . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>did not receive an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment and that his death was not causally related to any injury . . . arising out of or in the\u201d course of his employment, and (b) dismissing the widow\u2019s claim. The widow has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Messersmith was in South Carolina on a trip for his employer, New England Tape Company (the company). He collapsed and died while playing golf on February 28, 1954. The death certificate gave as the cause of death \u201cprobable coronary thrombosis.\u201d Messersmith worked for the company as an engineer and was \u201ckey salesman\u201d with respect to the exploitation of a new process being developed by the company in cooperation with Owens-Corning Fiberglas Company (Fiberglas) in South Carolina. He travelled a great deal on business at all times and it became \u201cimperative that he go ... to .. . South Carolina to assist \u201d in the project, in which \u201cthe stakes were high.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Messersmith had been confined to a hospital for about a month in 1951 with heart disease and had an underlying arteriosclerotic condition. On February 23, 1954, at the direction of one Brown, majority stockholder of the company and the deceased\u2019s immediate superior, the deceased went by train to South Carolina and met Brown. They drove together on February 24 two hundred fifty miles to the Fiberglas laboratory where they spent the next two days, Thursday and Friday. On Saturday they were asked to play golf with the work manager and an engineer, which they did. They were invited to play again on Sunday (February 28) but did not play in the morning because of rain. In the afternoon Brown and Messersmith did play golf with a third person. While playing Messersmith had a heart attack and died. The single member found (a) that the game on February 28 \u201cwas a means ... of ... cementing good relationship between the two companies\u201d; (b) that \u201cthis . . . game was an incident of\u201d the employment; (c) that the employee had an arteriosclerotic heart condition prior to February 28; and (d) that the decedent \u201csuffered an injury arising out of and in the course of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>employment on February 28, 1954; that the physical activity and nervous tension of the work . . . resulted in the acute [heart] failure . . . and caused . . . death on the same day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In addition to the foregoing facts found by him, the single member improperly recited certain testimony, without clearly making findings about it as he should have done (see <em>Craddock\u2019s Case, </em>310 Mass. 116, 125; <em>Judkins\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 226, 227), viz: (a) that all that Brown and the deceased talked about in South Carolina was their work project; and (b) that the widow, several days prior to Messersmith\u2019s departure for South Carolina, observed that \u201che showed signs of fatigue, was gray in color and his lips were bluish.\u201d The single member also referred to expert testimony of one Dr. Rattigan \u201cthat this man\u2019s death from coronary thrombosis on February 28, 1954, was causally related to a variety of factors relating to his employment by reason probably of acceleration of a preexisting disease process to a point that death occurred on that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">1. The single member appears to have rested his conclusion that the fatal golf game was \u201can incident of\u201d Messersmith\u2019s employment upon a subsidiary finding that the game was played with one of the Fiberglas employees. This subsidiary finding is not warranted by the evidence. The record indicates that plans to play golf with Fiberglas employees on Sunday morning were abandoned because of rain, that these Fiberglas employees had made other arrangements for the afternoon, and that Brown and the deceased merely met the Fiberglas people at the club and then \u201cpicked up a third individual and started off.\u201d No evidence gives basis for the inference that the third individual was connected with Fiberglas. We need not determine whether other considerations mentioned in <em>Moore\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 1, 4-5, existed which would permit a finding that the game was \u201can incident of\u201d the employment, for no other basis was mentioned by the single member.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">2. The single member\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat the physical activity and nervous tension of the work in which . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>[MessersmithJ was engaged resulted in the acute failure of his heart\u201d rests on no adequate subsidiary findings by the single member. The single member\u2019s relevant findings (as opposed to mere recitals of testimony), summarized above, by themselves do not warrant any inferences that Messersmith was under \u201cnervous tension\u201d or that his work contributed to his death. It is particularly significant that there were no findings about the widow\u2019s observations of Messersmith\u2019s fatigue and color prior to his departure for South Carolina which were an essential part of the basis for Dr. Rattigan\u2019s answers to the hypothetical questions, later mentioned. In <em>Judkins\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 226, 227, it was pointed out that there should be \u201csuch specific and definite findings upon the evidence reported as will enable this court to determine with reasonable certainty whether correct rules of law have been applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">3. Both (a) the circumstance that the board\u2019s decision may rest upon an unwarranted subsidiary finding, and (b) the inadequacy of the findings, would lead us to remand the case to the Industrial Accident Board for clarification. We, however, also examine the record to see whether such remanding is unnecessary because \u201cthe evidence, including all rational inferences,\u201d was insufficient in law to sustain the widow\u2019s burden of establishing that the deceased\u2019s death arose out of and in the course of his employment. <em>Judkins\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 226, 228-231. <em>Roney\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 732, 739-740.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">4. The following facts, in addition to those already stated, could have been found on the evidence. Messersmith, in addition to considerable travelling, worked on occasion sixteen hours a day, despite his record of heart disease. Upon his return on February 19, 1954, to Worcester from a trip to New York, his wife \u201cknew he had had a heart attack; she had seen him have many of them; he was gray; his lips were purple in color; he was drawn and tired. He didn\u2019t want anything to eat.\u201d Between February 19 and February 23 when he left for South Carolina \u201che was very tired and stayed in his room a great deal; he worked on papers . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>[and] was very withdrawn.\u201d His wife \u201casked him not to take the trip . . . but he said . . . that it was very important to his company and when the trip was over he would be able to rest.\u201d On February 23 \u201che was pale with a gray look; he was very slow and didn\u2019t have his usual sparkle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">After the 1951 attack, which was not his first, Messersmith had talked with his doctor and they decided that, \u201calthough he might increase his life expectancy by not returning\u201d to work with the company, he should do so but \u201calter his schedule; . . . rest from each day\u2019s work before he undertook the next day\u2019s work, and . . . from one trip before he took the next trip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Dr. Rattigan was asked a hypothetical question which stated the earlier testimony very fully. His opinion that Messersmith\u2019s death \u201cwas causally related to a variety of factors relating to his employment,\u201d he explained in part as follows, \u201cThis man\u2019s activities that particular day [February 28] did hasten his death.\u201d From his history of myocardial infarction \u201cthree years prior to this ... it must be assumed that he had a severe degree of circulatory coronary artery disease\u201d which still permitted him to continue his usual \u201cactivities which . . . were not especially conducive to rest and relaxation.\u201d Nine days \u201cbefore his death . . . he was observed to have signs which to [the] witness clearly indicated . . . progressive depletion of his coronary reserve.\u201d Yet \u201cunder pressure ... of his job and in a very fatigued state he did undertake to go on a trip which involved considerable mental tension and while engaged in a game of golf, again in witness\u2019s opinion not entirely divorced from tension, had a heart attack and died.\u201d In Dr. Rattigan\u2019s opinion \u201cmany of the factors related to his work, clearly spell . . . tension which we would advise patients with coronary artery disease to avoid.\u201d Nine days before his death, \u201che was in such a state that any doctor\u201d knowing his medical history \u201cwould have recommended complete bed rest, if not complete hospitalization.\u201d The \u201cactivities of that last day were just enough to accelerate the already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>depleted process within the coronary system so as to bring about death before it normally would have occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">On cross-examination, Dr. Rattigan stated that his \u201ctheory on causal relationship is not entirely contingent on excess tension. . . . pT]t contributes very substantially but not to the exclusion of other factors.\u201d Contributing to Messersmith\u2019s death was the \u201cfact that [fforj nine days . . . prior to the last day, he had travelled and worked rather intensively ... in a condition in which . . . every moment that he spent outside of complete bed rest or hospital care, placed him in jeopardy of exactly what happened on February 28.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The witness conceded that as to the period after February 23 there was no testimony of the grayness which had indicated \u201cgrave circulatory trouble on the 19th and again on the 23rd.\u201d He testified, however, (1) that once you have the information assumed in the hypothetical question as to the \u201cman\u2019s condition as observed by his wife February 19 I could tell you that this man was headed straight for another type of coronary catastrophe that would prove fatal as it actually did,\u201d and that Messer smith \u201cwas in a precarious condition which could have gone either way, depending ... on what he did after February 19 ... I think that had the man been hospitalized, or had he rested, he would not have died nine days later.\u201d This opinion Dr. Rattigan described as \u201cbetter than a guess,\u201d for although \u201c ph]e could not give 100% assurance that he would not have died then . . . the probability is that he would not have died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Other doctors with excellent qualifications took a different position. The single member could reasonably have concluded that in various respects Dr. Rattigan was neither convincing nor clear and that he inadequately explained important assumed facts at conflict with his theory. Nevertheless, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that the single member was bound so to conclude. The extent to which cross-examination weakened the weight of the testimony was for the trier of the facts, as was the circumstance that Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Rattigan at times in his testimony placed substantial but not exclusive weight on the events of the final Sunday (which on this record were not incident to the work) as a cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">This is not like the expert testimony, admittedly based upon an \u201cassumption of excitement and emotional factors,\u201d which in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>336 Mass. 609, 613-614, was revealed by cross-examination to be \u201cgratuitous.\u201d Here Messersmith, after the indications of fatigue and grayness shown on February 19 and 23, undertook, wholly apart from the final Sunday golf game, substantial work activities which could reasonably be regarded as seriously hazardous for him. We cannot say, as a matter of law, that Dr. Rattigan had no reasonable basis (a) for his opinion that Messersmith\u2019s condition on those days indicated \u201crather grave circulatory difficulty as of the moment the observation was made\u201d or (b) for concluding (see <em>Cormier\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 714, 717) that Messersmith\u2019s substantial work activities thereafter would impose excessive tension on one with Messersmith\u2019s heart condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">5. Where a preexisting heart disease of an employee is accelerated by the employment, there may be found to be an injury arising out of and in the course of employment. See <em>McMurray\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 29, 32-33, and cases cited; <em>Baruffaldi </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>337 Mass. 495, 501. In <em>Brzozowski\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 113, 115-116, there is recognition of the difficulty of drawing the line between \u201cgradual degeneration of . . . [(an employee\u2019s] cardiac organs . . . [(and death] accelerated by a strain or exertion attributable to his work.\u201d See also the somewhat comparable situation in <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 301, 303-305, where a work induced heart condition, not the cause of death, so weakened an employee as to make his death from cancer occur sooner than it otherwise would have. We cannot say as a matter of law, whatever we might have done if charged with finding the facts, that upon the evidence it was not permissible to find that the work exertions after the signs of danger on February 19 contributed substantially to death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>more rapidly than if rest or hospitalization precautions had then been taken. Accordingly, this is not an instance where (cf. <em>Judkins\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 226, 228, 230; <em>Roney\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 732, 739) we can refrain from remanding the case to the reviewing board for proper subsidiary findings and for reexamination of its conclusions. See <em>Ratigan\u2019s Case, </em>338 Mass. 712, 718-719.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">6. Various exceptions to the admission of evidence have been argued with extreme brevity and without citation of authority. It is sufficient to say that each of them has been .examined and no prejudicial error is disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">7. The decree below is reversed. The case is to be remanded to the board for clarification of its findings and decision and for such other proceedings consistent with this opinion as the board may deem appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
