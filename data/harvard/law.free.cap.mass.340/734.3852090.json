The insurance company\u2019s sole exception is to the denial of its motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">The evidence, in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiffs, shows that the tractor was purchased at an auction on June 13, 1953, and was immediately covered by insurance for malicious destruction and vandalism \u201cbecause there was . . . animosity at the auction.\u201d From June 13 to June 25, the tractor was used on different jobs and was in Winthrop \u201cday and night ... up to June 25.\u201d The machine was \u201ctested the day before they bought it . . . [and] sounded good and ran good.\u201d It \u201cworked all right between the 13th and the 25th\u201d for \u201capproximately 48 or 54 hours.\u201d On the morning of June 25, 1953, after about two to three hours of work, the oil pressure dropped. The oil lines, fuel lines, fuel and oil filters, and oil pump then were checked and were found in good condition. An expert \u201cwho had rebuilt this engine in May, 1953,\u201d took \u201cthe engine down\u201d and \u201cfound ... an accumulation of sand and grit.\u201d The expert \u201cthought he drained . . . roughly ... a quart of sand from the motor\u201d of which the insurance representative took a sample \u201cprobably about a half pint of sand.\u201d The sand was \u201cvery fine beach sand like a grinding compound.\u201d It \u201cjust ruined the bearing pistons and rings and every<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>thing general in that machine.\u201d The machine was \u201closing oil pressure\u201d because \u201cgrit was, going through the bearings with the oil and . . . you lost your clearance and your bearings and there was nothing there to hold the oil in.\u201d Oil \u201cis placed in the machine through a filling cap\u201d and \u201csand can\u2019t get in . . . unless somebody puts it in ... . The cap is always on the motor and it doesn\u2019t matter under what conditions the machine . . . [may have been] working . . . you could not get that much sand in the motor.\u201d The sand \u201cis not sucked up through the air intake because the filters won\u2019t allow it to get in there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The plaintiffs had the burden of proof of showing that the loss was caused by vandalism, that is, by \u201csuch wanton and malicious acts as are intended to damage or destroy the property insured.\u201d See <em>Rich </em>v. <em>United Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>328 Mass. 133, 134-135. Unlike the <em>Rich </em>case, the evidence already summarized warranted the jury in concluding that there was greater probability that the quart of sand reached the motor through the oil intake because of intentional human intervention constituting malicious mischief or vandalism than that it came there by any accidental or negligent means or through normal use. The jury could reasonably reach this conclusion from the expert\u2019s testimony and the circumstance that the machine suddenly stopped working well on June 25. There was no need for the jury to rely on the statements, apparently in evidence subject to no exception, (a) of an agent of the insurance company, which if authorized might be admissions, or (b) of the expert that there had been vandalism in this situation. The expert\u2019s opinion about the possibility of sand reaching the motor, except in one way, was not mere speculation or a guess from subordinate facts, as in <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 747, 751, on a matter about which nobody, in the state of existing scientific progress, could have knowledge, nor were the basic facts gratuitously assumed. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>336 Mass. 609, 613-614. It was the opinion of \u201ca mechanic on all types of work and ... on bulldozers of the same type and kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>. . . since 1929\u201d who had \u201crebuilt the motor\u201d before the breakdown and who promptly investigated the cause of the loss of oil pressure when it occurred. His opinion related to mechanical facts susceptible of actual knowledge. Various considerations, advanced to show that the expert\u2019s views were in some respects not persuasive, went only to the weight of his testimony. It was for the jury to determine what weight was to be given to them. A verdict for the insurance company could not have been directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
