The trial judge denied, subject to the trustees\u2019 exceptions, their motion for a directed verdict on the plaintiff\u2019s opening and also their motion for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence. The trustees also excepted to (a) the judge\u2019s failure to prevent allegedly improper argument by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and (b) certain portions of the judge\u2019s charge. There was a verdict for the plaintiff and the case is here on the trustees\u2019 bill of exceptions. The facts are stated in their aspect most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The plaintiff with a group of women attended, on May 11, 1951, a dance at Ruggles Hall, one of a series run by a man named \u201cWally.\u201d About 11:15 p.m., as she went down the stairs from the dance hall on the second floor of the building, she \u201cwent on her back on the stairs\u201d and \u201cfell on her whole weight. . . . When anybody falls, you don\u2019t know how you fell. You just fall. All that she remembers is that she went down and just cracked her back on the stairs.\u201d Later she said that she \u201cfell on the bottom stair\u201d and struck her \u201chead on the sixth stair.\u201d After she \u201cregained her composure,\u201d she observed a \u201ccrack in the stairs, piece taken right out . . . just like a broken stair. The stairs were marble .... There was quite a piece out of the bottom stair, where she was.\u201d Her injuries were serious. She paid admission to the dance. On prior occasions she had noticed \u201cthis step with the piece out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The building is a three story brick building. It has two dance halls and sev\u00e9n or eight offices. The dance hall on the second floor is reached from 5 Buggies Street through a long hallway and stairs with two landings, six or seven steps made of marble to each landing. One or two steps are made of wood. One Waldman managed the property, for the owners and rented the dance hall at 5 Buggies Street to Wally by oral agreement under which Wally \"was a tenant at will paying three hundred dollars a month .... Wally made all repairs inside his hall . . . and paid . . . everything pertaining to the inside of the building. . . . The entrance to the hall \u2014 the stairs going up \u2014 were included in the oral lease and rental. . . . Wally never repaired the stairs .... When . . . [Waldman] rented the hall to Wally, he [Waldman] knew that he [Wally] was going to use it as a public dance hall for the admission of people . . . that as far as he knew, the condition of the stairs was all right just prior to the oral renting to Wally\u201d but Waldman did not then examine the stairs. \"The stairs are in the same condition as . . . for the last fifteen years.\u201d Another witness stated that the stairs \"were the same at the time of the leasing as they were\u201d when the plaintiff fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The trial judge was not required to direct a verdict on the plaintiff\u2019s opening. In his discretion, he may prefer to have the case \"presented on actual evidence rather than ... on a statement of counsel.\u201d <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>332 Mass. 508, 509. See also <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Whittaker, </em>324 Mass. 398, 399-401; <em>Amorosso </em>v. <em>Farina Bros. Co. Inc. </em>339 Mass. 595, 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">2. The trustees, in support of their position that a directed verdict for them was required at the close of the testimony, contend that there was no evidence (a) that the trustees were in control of the stairs; (b) that, even if the trustees were in control of the stairs, the stairs were in any different condition from that in which they were, or appeared to be, at the time of the letting (see <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Isenberg Bros. Inc. </em>321 Mass. 170, 171-173); or (c) showing any causal connection between the defect and the fall. The trustees were the owners of the property. The jury without distortion or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>mutilation of an integral portion of Waldman\u2019s statements (see <em>Woods </em>v. <em>DeMont, </em>322 Mass. 233, 235) could believe bis testimony that the terms of the oral renting included the dance hall and disbelieve his testimony that Wally also rented the stairs. See <em>Nunan </em>v. <em>Dudley Properties, Inc. </em>325 Mass. 551, 553. They could find support for this view in the fact that Wally repaired the hall but did no work on the stairs. They could believe Waldman\u2019s testimony that, \u201cas far as he knew, the condition of the stairs was all right just prior to the oral renting,\u201d and disbelieve the testimony that the stairs had remained in the same condition for fifteen years. Waldman\u2019s testimony, if thus only partly believed, was more favorable to the plaintiff than her own testimony tending to show that the stairs were in the same condition as at the time of the letting, viz. that she \u201cwent to Buggies Hall when Wally opened it\u201d and that on \u201cThe first night that she went to Wally\u2019s . . . she saw a piece out of the bottom stair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s testimony was that most favorable to her with respect to the causal connection between the alleged defect and her fall. See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Gee, </em>328 Mass. 213, 215-216. Cf. <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Yogel, </em>329 Mass. 492, 494; <em>Boday </em>v. <em>Thibault, </em>337 Mass. 243, 245; <em>Merwin </em>v. <em>De Raptellis, </em>338 Mass. 118, 120-121, where there was evidence that the defect in fact caused the injury. Cf. also <em>Marquis </em>v. <em>John Nesmith Real Estate Co. </em>300 Mass. 203, 206; <em>Dreher </em>v. <em>Bedford Realty, Inc. </em>335 Mass. 385, 389. She testified that she fell \u201con the bottom stair\u201d and that there \u201cwas quite a piece out of the bottom stair, <em>where she was\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Although this evidence was slight, we are unable to say that the jury could not infer that there was greater probability that the \u201cpiece out of the . . . stair\u201d contributed to the accident than that she simply fell. The case is governed by cases like <em>Dreher </em>v. <em>Bedford Realty, Inc. </em>335 Mass. 385, 389 (steps worn at place at which jury \u201ccould have found that the plaintiff was descending\u201d), rather than by cases like <em>Gerstenzang </em>v. <em>Kennedy &amp; Co. Inc., ante, </em>174, 175 (where there was no evidence showing the pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ence of excessive wax upon the \u201cportion of the floor on which she slipped\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">3. The judge erred in permitting comment by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel upon the absence of Wally as a witness. It was not shown that Wally was available, although Waldman admitted that he had \u201cnot attempted to locate\u201d Wally. See <em>Heina </em>v. <em>Broadway Fruit Mkt. Inc. </em>304 Mass. 608, 610-611; <em>Horowitz </em>v. <em>Bokron, </em>337 Mass. 739, 743-744, and cases cited. It also was not shown, nor was it reasonable to infer, that Wally\u2019s testimony would in any degree have been unfavorable to the trustees. See <em>McKim </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>170 Mass. 426, 428; <em>McGeorge </em>v. <em>Grand Realty Trust, Inc. </em>316 Mass. 373, 377-378.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">4. The judge improperly charged that \u201can owner of property, in control of the premises, is supposed to keep it in that condition of repair that it was in at the time that the place was occupied.\u201d We assume that the judge was referring to the stairs and instructing the jury about the law applicable, if they should find, despite Waldman\u2019s testimony, that the trustees remained in control of the stairway. He incorrectly stated the applicable rule. After a full review of the numerous earlier cases, this rule in <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Isenberg Bros. Inc. </em>321 Mass. 170, 172, was said to be that \u201cthe duty of the landlord toward persons who come upon the premises to do business with his tenant is no greater than his duty to the tenant, and in the absence of special agreement that duty is <em>to use reasonable care </em>to maintain common approaches in as good condition as they were in or appeared to be in at the time of the letting to the tenant\u201d (emphasis supplied). See also <em>Stedfast </em>v. <em>Rebon Realty Co. Inc. </em>333 Mass. 348, 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">5. As the error, just mentioned, in the charge requires a new trial in any event, we do not pause to consider other questions relating to the charge which are unlikely to recur. It is appropriate, however, to discuss one contention of the plaintiff. This is not a case where the landlord extended on his part any invitation to customers of the tenant to visit the premises. Cf. <em>Underhill </em>v. <em>Shactman, </em>337 Mass. 730, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>733-734. Under our cases, whether the landlord retained control of the stairs or leased them to Wally, the landlord would not be liable to a tenant\u2019s customer merely because, at the time of the letting, the premises were in defective condition and the landlord then knew or had reason to know that the leased premises would be used by the public. If the landlord retained control of the stairs, the principle underlying Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 359, as applied to facts such as those here present, is inherently inconsistent with the rule of the decisions reviewed in the <em>Isenberg Bros. </em>case. In case the stairs were let to Wally, \u00a7 359 does not represent the rule of the Massachusetts decisions applicable upon this record with respect to \u201cthe tenant and those entering under him.\u201d See <em>Luoma </em>v. <em>Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. Inc. </em>332 Mass. 101, 104. Cases dealing with the letting or licensing of a public hall for a brief period, in which it is \u201cobvious that the safety of the building must be left mainly to the\u201d owner, do not support the application of \u00a7 359 to a case like this. Cf. <em>Oxford </em>v. <em>Leathe, </em>165 Mass. 254, 255; <em>Schofield </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>170 Mass. 415, 416, 418; <em>Shrigley </em>v. <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. </em>287 Mass. 300, 302-303; <em>Simons </em>v. <em>Murray Realty, Inc. </em>330 Mass. 194, 196-197; note, 62 Harv. L. Rev. 669, 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
