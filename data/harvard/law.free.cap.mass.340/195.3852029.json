Fiorentino, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-12\"><em>Peter D. Cole, (Albert E. Good </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AEa\">Spalding, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlE\">In this action of tort the plaintiff testified that on September 9, 1955, she entered the defendant\u2019s store; that while walking around looking at merchandise \u201cher left foot slipped and twisted under her and she went down\u201d; and that she \u201cdid not go all the way to the floor since her daughter-in-law had hold of her right arm and was supporting her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">The plaintiff based her right of recovery on the fact that the floor was improperly waxed. The plaintiff\u2019s daughter-in-law testified that the \u201cfloor was overwaxed and you could see a small indentation from a heel. . . . You could see your face in the wax.\u201d The defendant\u2019s manager testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>that the floor was covered with \u201cvinai plastic requiring little waxing\u201d and that it was \u201ccleaned every six weeks by a commercial cleaner with rotary brushes of steel wool and waxed with nonskid wax.\u201d He also testified that the \u201cfloor was in good condition [on] the day of the accident.\u201d There was no testimony as to when the floor was last waxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The judge in finding for the defendant stated, \u201cI find as a fact that the floor had not been improperly waxed and that it was not in a dangerous condition\u201d and that the plaintiff \u201cfailed to establish a breach of any duty of the defendant.\u201d A report to the Appellate Division was dismissed and the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The sole question presented by the report is a ruling on evidence, which arose in these circumstances. The plaintiff testified that \u201cwhile she was being assisted to an erect position by her daughter-in-law . . . one of the salesgirls came running over to her\u201d and said \u201cI knew this would happen. There is too much wax on the floor.\u201d The plaintiff testified that the salesgirl\u2019s remark \u201cseemed to come out of . . . [her] all of a sudden and was made while she [the plaintiff] was being assisted to her feet, and couldn\u2019t have been more than a second or two after the moment when her left foot slipped.\u201d The evidence as to what the salesgirl said was admitted de bene with the understanding that if the judge later ruled that the evidence was inadmissible the plaintiff\u2019s rights would be saved. When making his decision, the judge stated that \u201cthe . . . [remark of the salesgirl] was not a part of the res gestae. The res gestae of the happening of the accident had ended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The evidence was not competent as an admission to bind the defendant. The admissibility of the utterance must rest on the fact that it was \u201cspontaneous to a degree which reasonably negatived premeditation or possible fabrication, and tended to qualify, characterize and explain\u201d the accident. <em>Correira </em>v. <em>Boston Motor Tours, Inc. </em>270 Mass. 88, 91. With respect to spontaneous utterances the guiding principles have been stated \u2014 and in our view correctly \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>by Prof. Wigmore: \"The utterance must have been before there has been time to contrive and misrepresent .... It is to be observed that the statements need not b\u00e9 strictly contemporaneous with the exciting cause; they may be subsequent to it, provided there has not been time for the exciting influence to lose its sway and to be dissipated. . . . [T]]here can be no definite and fixed limit of time. Each case must depend upon its own circumstances.\u201d Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 1750. See McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 272. See also <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Marston, </em>310 Mass. 461, 464-465.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The trial judge in determining whether an utterance meets the tests of admissibility ought to be given broad discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We cannot say that the ruling excluding the evidence was erroneous. The matter was one peculiarly within the judge\u2019s province and only in clear cases \u2014 of which this is not one \u2014\u2022 of an improper exercise of discretion should his ruling be revised.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-13\"> Professor Wigmore even advocates giving the trial judge absolute discretion in this field.
