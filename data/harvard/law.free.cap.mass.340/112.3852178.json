Mullins, a member of the State-Boston retirement system,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was employed as a matron at the city of Boston\u2019s stadium at East Boston. On August 26, 1955, she fell in a hole on the premises of the stadium while returning from lunch and sustained the injuries from which has arisen this application for retirement for accidental disability. A medical panel of three phy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>sicians certified unanimously that her disability was likely to be permanent and that it was the \u201cproximate result of the accident or hazard undergone on account of which the retirement is claimed.\u201d The Boston retirement board denied the application on the ground that the injuries were not \u201cthe result of an accident sustained or hazard undergone during the performance of duty.\u201d The applicant appealed to the contributory retirement appeal board, which reversed the decision of the Boston board. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (4). Upon a review under \u00a7 14 of G. L. c. 30A, the State administrative procedure act, the Superior Court affirmed the decision of the appeal board. The applicant was allowed to intervene (\u00a714 \u00a32]). The case comes to this court on the appeal of the Boston board (\u00a7 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The only question presented for decision is whether the applicant was incapacitated \u201cby reason of a personal injury sustained or a hazard undergone as a result of, and while in the performance of,\u201d her duties. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7. The case of <em>Boston Retirement Board </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Board, ante, </em>109, is on all fours with the present case and is controlling. For the reasons set forth in that case the decree is reversed and a new decree is to be entered reversing the decision of the appeal board.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-17\"> St. 1947, c. 520, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
