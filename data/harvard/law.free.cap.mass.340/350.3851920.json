J. Maney Co., Inc. (the corporation), all the shares of which were owned by Clement at his death, against William J. Maney, administrator of the estate of Louis, a brother of Clement. Mrs. Maney intervened as a party plaintiff. Clement died on January 7, 1954. By his will he left $2,500 to Louis. This sum was paid to Louis. The final payment was made in March, 1955, about eleven months prior to Louis\u2019s death and about two months after Louis had filed, on January 12 and 17, 1955, in the Probate Court notices of a claim against Clement\u2019s estate. On this claim, Louis, now represented by his administrator, brought an action by writ dated January 10, 1955, with an ad damnum of $5,000,000, against the present plaintiffs, Mrs. Maney as Clement\u2019s executrix and the corporation, for \u2018-\u2018aid, counsel, advice, and assistance\u201d furnished. The present bill was brought to enjoin the prosecution of the action and the claim on the ground that Louis, by taking the $2,500 legacy under Clement\u2019s will, elected to receive the benefits of the legacy rather than to prosecute his action and claim. The bill proceeds on the theory that the claim \u201cif valid . . . will completely wipe out the estate of Clement . . . because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>value of the services alleged is greater than . . . the assets in\u201d the estate, that \u201cthe prosecution of the action . . . against the . . . executrix would necessarily thwart the working of the will,\u201d and that Louis\u2019s administrator by Louis\u2019s \u201celection ... is precluded from enforcing any action that would defeat the operation of . . . [the] will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Clement\u2019s will and the declaration in the action at law brought by Louis were incorporated by reference by the judge in his findings. He also found, in addition to the facts already stated, that the value of Clement\u2019s estate was $1,476,064.20 and that counsel for Louis\u2019s administrator stated in open court at the trial that the claim of Louis\u2019s estate in the action at law under the only remaining counts (counts 1 and 2) against Clement\u2019s executrix, in quantum meruit for services, was for $241,000. He concluded that the legacy of $2,500 was \"a benefaction and . . . not in payment of any debt\u201d and that the \u201cacceptance of the bequest . . . [was] not inconsistent with . . . [Lotus\u2019s] claim for services .... It cannot be said on the record . . . that the claim . . . would . . . defeat the . . . will, although it would . . . diminish the amount received by the executrix in her individual capacity as a legatee . . . .\u201d By the final decree the bill was dismissed. Clement\u2019s executrix and the corporation have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">1. Clement\u2019s executrix and the corporation contend that Louis\u2019s administrator is bound by the allegations or admissions in the declaration in the law action, in the pleadings in the present case, and in the notices of claim filed in the Probate Court stating that the value of Louis\u2019s claim for services was $5,000,000. The trial judge was not bound to find that the claim came to this amount, merely because this sum was named as the recoverable damages in the writ, or in a count of a declaration, or in the answer. It is common knowledge that the amounts of unliquidated damages mentioned in writs and declarations are usually purely \u201cformal allegations by an attorney [which] may be presumed to have been made without special instructions from his client.\u201d See <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>269 Mass. 335, 336-337; <em>Jennings </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>Bragdon, </em>289 Mass. 595, 598; <em>Burmon &amp; Bolonsky, Inc. </em>v. <em>Luckenbach S. S. Co. Inc. </em>39 F. 2d 619 (D. Mass.). See also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>144 Mass. 409, 411; <em>Hobart </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>243 F. 2d 735, 744 (1st Cir.); Annotation, 63 A. L. R. 2d 412, 427. Such allegations of damages have little or no value as an admission or assertion by the person making them except, perhaps, where, because they limit the claim to an amount less than the sum which might reasonably be claimed, they may show a low appraisal by the claimant of the value of his claim. Similar considerations apply to the notices of claim filed in the Probate Court under G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9, as amended. These are merely notices of the maximum amount claimed and of the bringing of the action. We treat the assertions and admissions of an ad damnum of $5,000,000 as relating only to a purely formal statement of a maximum claim and as not binding upon Louis or his administrator as establishing the true value of, and recovery upon, the claim, for purposes of this proceeding. It has not been established that the claim, even if successful, will exhaust the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">2. Upon this record, Louis\u2019s claim for services is not shown to be inconsistent with his receipt of a small legacy and thus the doctrine of election has no application. As was the case in <em>Hollister </em>v. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>328 Mass. 225, 229, Clement\u2019s will directed that his \u201cjust debts ... be paid\u201d and there is no indication in the legacy itself that Clement intended it to be received by Louis in satisfaction of his claim or as anything other than an unconditional benefaction. Article fourteenth of the will provided that if \u201cany legatee . . . shall contest the admission of this will to probate, then . . . such legatee shall forfeit the legacy herein.\u201d No article of the will makes any similar provision with respect to the assertion of claims against the estate by creditors, who are also legatees. The counts still remaining in Louis\u2019s declaration in the action at law seek only to recover unliquidated damages for breach of a contract and for services on a quantum meruit basis. These are claims of a general creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>As in the <em>Hollister </em>case (see p. 229) we \u201csee no basis for saying that the . . . [testator] intended that . . . [Louis\u2019s] acceptance of the legacy . . . was to be treated as an election to forego the right to press a [creditor\u2019s] claim for services against the estate.\u201d See <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>264 Mass. 13, 15; <em>Stoney </em>v. <em>Soar, </em>322 Mass. 408, 412-413; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>White, </em>329 Mass. 549, 554. The doctrine of <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>17 Pick. 303, 308, is not to be extended to cases where there is no evidence of the testator\u2019s intention to require an election by the legatee and where the claim asserted is no more than a general claim against the testator\u2019s estate not specifically inconsistent with any particular provision of the will. See <em>Fiduciary Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Mishou, </em>321 Mass. 615, 628-629, in which there is discussion of the great weight to be given to the intention of the testator in this respect. <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>224 Mass. 125, 133-134, and the related case in 233 Mass. 55, 60-61, dealt with the conflict between an alleged contract by a testator to devise property and a will which did not make that devise. Even if the doctrine of election can be said to have been applied properly to the beneficiary of that alleged contract, who received gifts under the will, those cases do not require application of the principle of election in this different situation. No specific repugnancy between Louis\u2019s claim and the will is here shown comparable to that discussed in the second <em>Noyes </em>case (at pp. 60-61), and in <em>Thurlow </em>v. <em>Thurlow, </em>317 Mass. 126, 128-130, also distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">3. The final decree is affirmed. The defendant is to have costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
