The question for deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>sion is whether the trial judge properly directed a verdict for the defendant upon a count alleging breach of the statutory covenants in a quitclaim deed. The facts are stated in their aspect most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The defendant (Mrs. Livadas) owned a building in Lowell with an outside fire escape, built mainly of wood. In August, 1956, this \u201cwas usable, but. . . in a dangerous condition.\u201d On May 23, 1956, the building inspector sent to Mrs. Livadas a letter ordering her \u201cin accordance with\u201d G. L. c. 143, as amended, \u201cto remove this . . . fire escape and install [a] new metal fire escape,\u201d work to be commenced on or before May 31, 1956. A permit to repair the fire escape was later denied by the building department.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The plaintiff, in July, 1955, after \u201ca cursory examination\u201d of the premises, granted a loan to Livadas, taking a note of Livadas and Mrs. Livadas for $1,350, secured by a second mortgage on the property. In August, 1956, another loan was made by the plaintiff. Thereafter negotiations took place between \u201cLivadas and [the plaintiff] . . . with reference to the possible purchase of the property by\u201d the plaintiff. Although the plaintiff made a partial inspection of the property, he \u201cnever at any time . . . had knowledge that there was a fire escape in the rear\u201d of the building. A deed in statutory form with quitclaim covenants, dated August 28, 1956, in which Livadas joined, was given by Mrs. Livadas to the plaintiff as trustee of a real estate trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The contents of the May 23, 1956, letter were never brought to the plaintiff\u2019s attention by Livadas or his wife. The plaintiff prior to the sale had no knowledge that it had been sent. Shortly after the conveyance he learned about it and gave written notice to Mrs. Livadas that he claimed damages for breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">1. In <em>Engel </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>336 Mass. 529, 531-532, we held that the absence from the statutory quitclaim covenants (G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 17, quoted infra) of the words \u201cor suffered\u201d was \u201cwithout significance\u201d and that the statutory covenant would be construed as if the covenant contained those words. See Swaim, Crocker\u2019s Notes on Common Forms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>(7th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 14, 15, 18, 139-142; 1958 Annual Survey of Mass. Law, \u00a7 1.7. Cf. <em>Fanger </em>v. <em>Leeder, </em>327 Mass. 501, 507. The <em>Engel </em>case is relevant to one aspect of this case. Because significant material, not referred to in the <em>Engel </em>decision, has come to our attention, we reexamine its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The short forms of deeds now generally in use (see G. L. c. 183, \u00a7\u00a7 8-12, 16, 17, and appendix) were authorized by St. 1912, c. 502. Section 1 (see G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 8) stated that the \u201cfollowing forms may be used . . . and . . . may be altered as circumstances may require, but nothing in this act shall . . . prevent the use of other forms.\u201d Section 3 contained a statutory form of quitclaim deed using the now familiar term \u201cquitclaim covenants.\u201d See G. L. c. 183, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 17, and opp. form (2). Section 14 (see G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 12) provided that \u201cno covenant shall be implied from . . . the word \u2018grant.\u2019\u201d Section 17 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the 1912 statute (see G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 17) provided that \u201cquitclaim covenants\u201d or \u201climited covenants\u201d should have the \u201cfull force, meaning and effect of\u201d stated words, which in the General Laws have been changed in minor respects, so that they now read: \u201cThe grantor, for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and successors, covenants with the grantee, his heirs, successors and assigns, that the granted premises are free from all encumbrances <em>made by the grantor, </em>and that he will, and his heirs, executors, administrators and successors shall, warrant and defend the same to the grantee and his heirs, successors and assigns forever against the lawful claims and demands of <em>all persons claiming by, through or under the grantor, but against none other\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The legislative history of the 1912 statute sheds little light on its meaning. See 1912 House Docs. 950, 955 (on the petition of Mr. Frank W. Grinnell and others), 2031. The 1912 statute defines the terms \u201cwarranty covenants\u201d and \u201cquitclaim covenants\u201d with great precision. In view of the provision of \u00a7 1 permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ting alteration of the short forms, the 1912 statute affords strong reason against implying any words, in addition to those in the respective definitions, which are not specifically inserted in a particular instrument. The term \u201cwarranty covenants\u201d is expressed broadly (see italicized words quoted, footnote 1, <em>supra). </em>On the other hand, the term \u201cquitclaim covenants\u201d in \u00a7 17 (see G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 11), which is equated with the term \u201climited covenants,\u201d is narrowly confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">We have been referred to no contemporaneous 1912 commentaries on the short form statute. There has been, however, later discussion. In Davis, Massachusetts Conveyancers\u2019 Handbook, \u00a7 85, pp. 125-126, after quoting a long form of covenants common in quitclaim deeds prior to 1912 (see also Crocker, Notes on Mass. Common Forms [5th ed. 1913] pp. 153-154) it is said that \u201cit is to be noted that the old quitclaim covenants differ from the quitclaim covenants in the Short Forms Act, in that in the long form deed the grantor covenants against encumbrances made or suffered by him, whereas in the short form deed the grantor covenants only against encumbrances made by him. The result is that the short form does not covenant against involuntary encumbrances such as taxes.\u201d See Swaim, Crocker\u2019s Notes on Common Forms (7th ed. 1955) \u00a7 15 (see also \u00a7 18); Partridge, Deeds, Mortgages and Easements, \u00a7 39, p. 139. See also editorial note, 36 Mass. L. Q. (No. 3) 48-49,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> discussing the intimation in <em>Fanger </em>v. <em>Leeder, </em>327 Mass. 501, 507, that it \u201cmay be of significance that the words 'or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>suffered\u2019 were omitted in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 183, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 17.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The considerations mentioned above lead us to overrule so much of the <em>Engel </em>case (336 Mass. 529, 531-532) as holds that the omission from the short form quitclaim covenants of the words \u201cor suffered\u201d was \u201cwithout significance.\u201d We consider the quitclaim covenants in the deed of August 28, 1956, on the basis that the words \u201cor suffered\u201d are not implied in those covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">2. The statutory provisions under which the building inspector proceeded are found in G. L. c. 143, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 8, and 9 (as amended,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> respectively, by St. 1949, c. 541, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, and 3). Section 6 reads: \u201cIn a city. . . wherein there is in force a building code . . . such . . . person as the mayor . . . may designate shall be inspector of buildings, and . . . upon being informed . . . that a building ... or anything . . . connected therewith ... is dangerous . . . shall inspect the same; and if it appears . . . dangerous he shall . . . notify the owner ... to remove it or make it safe. . . .\u201d Chapter 143, \u00a7 8, provides that if the owner neglects to comply \u201ca careful survey of the premises shall be made by a board\u201d of two officials and a disinterested person, and that a \u201cwritten report . . . shall be made, and a copy . . . served on such owner.\u201d By \u00a7 9, if the report declares the \u201cstructure to be dangerous, and if the owner . . . continues such . . . neglect\u201d the building inspector \u201cshall cause it to be made safe or taken down.\u201d Section 9 further provides that the \u201ccosts . . . incurred shall constitute a lien upon the land . . . and shall be enforced ... in the manner provided for the collection of taxes on land; and such owner . . . shall, for every day\u2019s continuance of such . . . neglect after being so notified, forfeit to the city . . . not less than ten nor more than fifty dollars.\u201d The language of the forfeiture provision of \u00a7 9, when read with \u00a7 10, indicates that, if the original order of the building inspector is upheld, the daily forfeiture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>then recoverable is to relate back to the date of the original notice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Apart from the letter of May 23, 1956, the record does not show other action by the building inspector under c. 143, or that any board was appointed, any survey or written report made, or any copy of a report served upon Mrs. Livadas prior to her conveyance. No work to demolish the fire escape had been done by the city prior to the conveyance, so no lien could have arisen. It must be decided (1) whether the potential but imperfect lien and the potential but unliquidated forfeiture liability constitute encumbrances \u201cmade by the grantor\u201d within the statutory quitclaim covenant and (2) whether they give rise to a claim against the land by a person \u201cclaiming by, through, or under\u201d Mrs. Livadas within the statutory warranty. See G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">(a) Although the costs of any necessary repair or demolition by the city are to constitute a lien on the land, there is no similar provision with respect to the forfeiture provided in G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 9, which appears to be a penal imposition upon the \u201cowner, lessee, or mortgagee in possession\u201d not in any way affecting the title to the land. The penal nature of the forfeiture is even more apparent under the 1959 amendment, not here applicable (see footnote 3, <em>supra). </em>The forfeiture, or the liability to it, cannot be regarded either as an encumbrance within the statutory quitclaim covenant or as giving rise to a breach of the statutory warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">(b) The contingent or inchoate lien, which might at some later time come into existence under \u00a7 9, as a consequence of the building inspector\u2019s letter of May 23, 1956, if it was an encumbrance (as to which we make no intimation), was not an encumbrance \u201cmade\u201d by Mrs. Livadas, as opposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>to one \u201csuffered\u201d by her. The cases afford little assistance in determining the meaning of the word \u201cmade\u201d in quitclaim covenants. See <em>Tarbell </em>v. <em>Page, </em>155 Mass. 256, 258; <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>194 Mass. 296, 297; <em>Fanger </em>v. <em>Leeder, </em>327 Mass. 501, 508. See also <em>West </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>11 Met. 556, 558-559; <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>10 Cush. 134,141; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>141 Mass. 160, 161. In the light of the omission of the words \u201cor suffered\u201d from the statutory form, already discussed, we interpret \u201cmade\u201d as implying something more than mere inaction by the grantor of the type here shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In decisions under general covenants and warranties, the question whether an encumbrance was \u201cmade\u201d by a grantor does not arise. See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>110 Mass. 387, 388; <em>Blackie </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>117 Mass. 181, 183. See also <em>Brunke </em>v. <em>Pharo, </em>3 Wis. 2d 628, 630-632 (existing violation of building laws, as to which enforcement action is imminent, held an encumbrance within a general covenant). Cf. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Sexsmith, </em>28 Wash. 2d 947, 950-952. <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Dooley, </em>119 Mass. 294, 296, is distinguishable because the quitclaim deed there discussed contained a warranty against encumbrances \u201cmade or suffered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">(c) The inchoate lien was not within the statutory warranty<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as a demand by one claiming \u201cby, through, or under\u201d Mrs. Livadas. When she sold the land she had received only a preliminary notice, not followed by any statutory procedure under \u00a7 8. The notice imposed finally no obligation on Mrs. Livadas to act, at least until there had been board action under \u00a7 8. If after her conveyance such an obligation had been imposed, it would necessarily have been imposed upon the then owner, lessee, or mortgagee in possession. The city would not then be claiming by, through, or under Mrs. Livadas in acting itself and in creating a lien under \u00a7 9 for the cost of such action. Cf. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>110 Mass. 387, 388, in which, although it dealt with a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>warranty against the claims of all persons, the court spoke of a hen for real estate taxes as arising \u201cthrough\u201d a grantor holding title on the assessment date. That grantor, on the assessment date, became subject to an immediate tax liability whereas Mrs. Livadas became subject to no immediate obligation because of the notice of May 23, 1956. We do not determine whether the statement in the <em>Hill </em>case has been affected by <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>194 Mass. 296, 300-302. See <em>Horn </em>v. <em>Crest Hill Homes, Inc., ante, </em>362, 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The plaintiff did not show facts constituting a breach of any of Mrs. Livadas\u2019s statutory covenants. The verdict for Mrs. Livadas was properly directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\"> Section 17 may be contrasted with \u00a7 16 (now see G. L. c. 183, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 16) which defines \u201cwarranty covenants\u201d in part as a warranty that the grantor is \u201clawfully seized in fee simple of the granted premises; that they are free from <em>all encumbrances,\u201d </em>and that they will be warranted and defended \u201cagainst the lawful claims and demands of <em>all persons\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\"> In this note, the editor, Mr. Frank W. Grinnell, says (at p. 50), \u201cHaving served on the committee of conveyancers which drafted the [1912] short form act . . . and supported it to enactment, we can assure the court that the omission of the words \u2018or suffered\u2019 is not only \u2018of significance,\u2019 but was deliberate and fully understood at the time, during the discussions with bar committees and the legislative committee. . . . \u2018[I]n urban communities\u2019 and especially in Boston, \u2018grantors prefer not to incur the liability of warranting the title,\u2019 against unknown claims. That was as true before 1912 as it is today and ... it was the common practice of experienced practitioners to cross out the words \u2018or suffered\u2019 which appeared in the [then] common printed form .... Accordingly, in drafting the statutory . . . covenant, which ... is incorporated by reference ... by the words \u2018Quitclaim covenants,\u2019 we omitted the words \u2018or suffered\u2019 to protect grantors from the trap of uncertainty involved in those words. The opinion of the court is exactly in accordance with the statute.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\"> These sections have been further changed by St. 1957, c. 214, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, and 4, not applicable to the present case. See also St. 1959, c. 75, which makes it clear that the forfeiture provided by \u00a7 9 is really a fine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\"> Section 10, as amended by St. 1949, c. 541, \u00a7 4, provides that an owner aggrieved by an order of a building inspector may appeal to the Superior Court for a trial by jury under G. L. c. 139, \u00a7 2 (as amended through St. 1945, c. 697, \u00a7 5), subject to two provisos, the second of which reads, \u201cand provided . . . that this section shall not prevent the city . . . from recovering the forfeiture provided in . . . section nine from the date of the service of the original notice, unless the order is annulled by the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\"> We do not consider whether the plaintiff had sufficiently established in other respects the basis of an action upon the warranty.
