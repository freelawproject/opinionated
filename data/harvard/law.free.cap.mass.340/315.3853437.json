L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42 (as amended through St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 12), of a decision of the board of review (the board) of the division of employment security (the division) existing under G. L. c. 23, \u00a7 9N (b), as amended through St. 1951, c. 763, \u00a7 21 A. The board found that the petitioner did not meet the eligibility requirements for unemployment benefits, see c. 151A, \u00a7 24 (b), as appearing in St. 1951, c. 763, \u00a7 8,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was bound to return some $1,046 of benefits received. A judge in the District Court reversed the decision of the board. The director of the division claimed an appeal and the case is before us on the report of the judge. See <em>Lasell </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>325 Mass. 23, 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The following proceedings within the division gave rise to the present appeal. After the petitioner had applied for and had received unemployment benefits for the period mentioned below, there was a redetermination (under c. 151 A, \u00a7 71) within the division of his eligibility for such benefits. This redetermination, issued by the director of the division on May 5, 1958, took place by reason of c. 151 A, \u00a7 29 (a), requiring a recipient of benefits to be \u201cin total unemployment and <em>otherwise eligible for benefits\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) and of \u00a7 1 (r) (2) defining \u201c[t]otal unemployment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The petitioner was disqualified by the redetermination for benefits for the weeks ending October 5, 1957, through March 1, 1958. From the affirmance of this redetermination by the director of the division, the petitioner appealed to the board. There was a hearing before a review examiner on July 28, 1958, at which the petitioner was represented by counsel. The board\u2019s review examiner, whose decision became \u201cthe final decision of'the board,\u201d found the facts stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The petitioner was laid off by his employer on September 28, 1957, because of lack of work. About October 1, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>petitioner\u2019s wife took over the kitchen at a night club \u201con a concession basis.\u201d The review examiner, on the issue whether the petitioner was in fact unemployed during the relevant period, did not make specific, clear subsidiary findings as he should have done. See <em>Maniscalco </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>327 Mass. 211, 214. See also <em>Judkins\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 226, 227; <em>Messersmith\u2019s Case, ante, </em>117, 119-120. Instead, he merely recited testimony (a) that the petitioner and his wife had \u201cbeen engaged in restaurant cooking for a number of years,\u201d and (b) that, although the petitioner usually went to the night club every night and made up a few sandwiches or salads, \u201con the whole he did no work.\u201d The review examiner then apparently merely assumed, without finding as a fact, that the petitioner\u2019s \u201cwife operated the [night club] concession\u201d and that, therefore, the petitioner was in \u201ctotal unemployment\u201d during the weeks in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">On the issue whether the petitioner made adequate efforts to obtain employment, the review examiner found that from \u201cthe date of the . . . claim and during the weeks in dispute the . . . [petitioner] submitted the names of but six employers to whom he had applied for work.\u201d For three weeks before March 1, 1958, he was \u201cnegotiating for the rental of a diner\u201d and he began to operate it on March 1. The review examiner concluded that the petitioner \u201cmade but little effort during his long period of unemployment to secure work, and . . . that, because of this inadequate search for work, he did not meet the eligibility requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The petition to the District Court for review alleged that the \u201cfirst hearing officer found that the petitioner was not unemployed,\u201d but that, upon the later review, the decision, already mentioned, of the board was made based on the petitioner\u2019s alleged failure to make efforts to secure work. No grounds of relief were stated unless the foregoing allegations constituted a statement of grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">1. General Laws c. 151 A, \u00a7 42, requires (a) that the action \u201cof the board shall be reviewed [in the District Court] in accordance with the standards for review provided in\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (8),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (b) that the director file with the court \u201cthe decision of the board of review, including all documents and papers and a transcript of all testimony taken . . . before said board.\u201d Section 42 does not provide for a hearing de nova, or for any taking of testimony, in the District Court, except, perhaps, as the section incorporates by reference, or may be affected by, provisions of c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Chapter 30A, \u00a7 14, provides that \u201c[i]n so far as the statutory form of judicial review ... is silent as to procedures provided in this section, the provisions of this section shall govern such procedures \u201d (see <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>339 Mass. 535, 543, fn. 2) and in subsection (6) that the review \u201cshall be confined to the record [of the agency or board], except that in cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency, not shown in the record, testimony thereon may be taken in the court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court under subsection (7) has power to require additional evidence to \u201cbe taken before the agency.\u201d Chapter 151 A, \u00a7 42, expressly requires that the \u201cpetition for review . . . shall state the grounds upon which . . . review is sought.\u201d This is consistent with the similar provision found in c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (2), which requires \u201ca concise statement of . . . facts showing that [the] petitioner is aggrieved, and the ground or grounds specified in\u201d \u00a7 14 (8) upon which the petitioner relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The petition inadequately states the grounds on which review is sought, for both c. 151 A, \u00a7 42, and c. 30A, \u00a7 14, require more than was done here. Even if it be assumed, however, that the petition was adequate, we perceive no error by the board. The board decided that, because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>petitioner\u2019s \u201clittle effort ... to secure work\u201d he did not meet the eligibility requirements. This conclusion was consistent with the board\u2019s subsidiary findings and was supported by substantial evidence before the board summarized in the report of the District Court judge as follows: \u201cThe . . . [petitioner] made only six personal applications for employment during the period . . . included in this number were two referrals by the local office of the division. His testimony also indicates: \u2018that he looked for work around in circles that he operated in; that he was available for work of any sort . . . \u201d The board was not required to believe that the petitioner had made more effort than the \u201csix personal applications,\u201d nor was it obliged to believe that the petitioner\u2019s somewhat perfunctory assistance at the night club constituted (as the judge suggested) effort to become employed. The review examiner and the board were well justified in concluding that only six applications for work in a period of unemployment of about five months (September 28, 1957, to March 1, 1958) were not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of c. 151 A, \u00a7 24, as appearing in St. 1951, c. 763, \u00a7 8, that \u201cto be eligible for benefits\u201d an unemployed person must \u201c (b) [b]e capable of and available for work and unable to obtain work in his usual occupation or any other occupation for which he is reasonably fitted.\u201d Whether an unemployed person is unable to obtain work, or is otherwise eligible for benefits, is largely a question of fact, as to which the burden rests on the unemployed person to show that Ms continued unemployment is not due to Ms own lack of diligence. <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>324 Mass. 45, 48-50. <em>Corrado </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>325 Mass. 711, 712-713. <em>Pizura </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>331 Mass. 286, 288-290. Cf. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>326 Mass. 757, 764-766.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">2. A further issue was decided by the District Court judge and the director of the division upon wMch we comment, although we tMnk that it was not adequately raised by the petition for review. The judge pointed out that all pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ceedings prior to that before the review examiner \u201chad involved only the . . . issue . . . whether . . . the petitioner was in \u2018total unemployment/ and [that] the final [board] decision . . . was . . . upon an entirely different ground, i.e., \u2018that the petitioner made . . . little effort... to secure work.\u2019 \u201d On this account he ruled that, under c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (1), the notice of the hearing before the review board was defective in failing to give the \u201cparties . . . sufficient notice of the issues involved to afford them reasonable opportunity to prepare and present evidence and argument.\u201d This ruling was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u201cNo evidence was introduced at the hearing before the court as . . .to the contents of . . . [the] notice\u201d and neither \u201cthe original nor a copy of the notice\u201d was before the court. The judge had no basis in the record for a ruling on this point. The adequacy of the board\u2019s procedure was not mentioned as a ground for review, nor does the record show that any question about the adequacy of the notice was raised before the board by the petitioner\u2019s counsel. In any event, the hearing before the board was on the petitioner\u2019s appeal from action within the division by (or in behalf of) the director on the broad issue of the petitioner\u2019s eligibility to receive benefits. Although the director had denied him benefits under c. 151A, \u00a7 29 (a), and \u00a7 1 (r) (2), the former of these sections referred not only to the requirement that a recipient be in \u201ctotal unemployment\u201d but also to a requirement, already quoted, that he be \u201cotherwise eligible for benefits.\u201d This essentially incorporated in \u00a7 29 (a) by reference the eligibility requirements of \u00a7 24. Upon his own appeal to the board it was incumbent upon the petitioner to sustain his burden of proof (see <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>324 Mass. 45, 50) as to all aspects of his eligibility for benefits. See <em>Pizura </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>331 Mass. 286, 291-292.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">3. The decision of the District Court is reversed. A decision is to be entered adjudging the claim to be invalid and the decision of the board to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\"> See later amendment by St. 1958, c. 437, \u00a7 1, not here relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\"> Section 1 (r) (2) contains the following definition: \u201c\u2018Total unemployment,\u2019 an individual shall be deemed to be in total unemployment in any week in which he performs no wage-earning services whatever, and for which he receives no remuneration, and in which, though capable of <em>and available for work, he is unable to obtain any suitable work . </em>. .\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\"> The standards stated in \u00a7 14 (8) require correction or modification of the board\u2019s decision in this adjudicatory proceeding (see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1) if \u201csubstantial rights of any party . . . have been prejudiced because the . . . [agency\u2019s] decision [was] . . .

This, however, is immaterial in view of our disposition of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
