Allen Construction Company (Construction) to build the control tower at Logan International Airport. One Clark, a defendant in one of the present suits and the petitioner in the other, was the successful subbidder and subcontractor to supply the metal windows and metal frames.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">Clark, who did not himself fabricate metal windows, approached Farm-Rite Implement Company<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Farm-Rite) for assistance. Farm-Rite also was not equipped to furnish windows of the type required, but it, to help out Clark, placed with Fenestra Incorporated<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Fenestra) an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>dated August 19, 1954, to \u201c[furnish galvanized . . . [s]teel [w]indows for the [c]ontrol [t]ower . . . Logan Airport . . . [i]n accordance with verbal quotation .... Architects drawings . . . being sent to you today.\u201d A confirmatory order, dated September 24, 1954, changed the payment terms, but made no change in \u201cother instructions and specifications.\u201d Plans and specifications sent with this order had been received from Clark by Farm-Rite.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The windows as furnished by Fenestra \u201cwere invoiced\u201d to Farm-Rite on June 27, 1955, for $11,642.88, and, on July 8, 1955, Farm-Rite paid to Fenestra this sum, for which it has not been reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Clark issued a purchase order to Farm-Rite on September 10, 1954, which provided that all \u201cmaterials [were] to be in accordance with plans and specifications.\u201d As to this, the master, later mentioned, found that Fenestra was required \u201cto deliver the sashes fabricated [and] bonderized.\u201d Bonderization, he found, is \u201ca process applied to a smooth . . . surface ... to roughen it for . . . retaining . . . paint,\u201d and the bonderization \u201cwas to be according to . . . specifications\u201d later mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The sashes were delivered to the airport on May 10, 1955. Installation of the windows was completed on August 9, 1955. In \u201cSeptember, there was . . . [indication] of paint peeling from the sashes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Article III of the general conditions of the main contract provided in part that the architect \u201cshall decide all questions ... as to the . . . quality, [and] acceptability . . . of the several kinds of . . . materials . . . and shall decide all questions ... as to the interpretations of the . . . specifications and as to the fulfillment of this contract on the part of the [contractor, and his determination . . . shall be final and . . . shall be a condition precedent to the right of the [c]ontractor to receive any money hereunder.\u201d Clark by his subcontract with Construction \u201cassumed the obligation to be bound by the architect\u2019s determination\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>under art. III. See <em>G. L. Rugo &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lexington, </em>338 Mass. 746, 749-751; <em>Fred C. McClean Heating Supplies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jefferson Constr. Co. </em>339 Mass. 356, 363. The architect, after tests, \u201cdetermined that the paint failure was due to lack of proper bonderization, and thereupon ordered . . . [Construction] to scrape all the paint from the windows . . . and to effect a new bonderization by . . . rubbing them down with wire brushes ... to make a rough surface and then to have the sashes repainted. This . . . was a different type of bonderization from that required by the original specifications. . . . [Construction] called upon . . . Clark, to do this work, which Clark refused to do. Thereupon, . . . [Construction] hired [one] Pikens to do the work . . . at\u201d substantial expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Farm-Rite on April 22, 1957, filed a bill in equity against Fenestra, Insurance, and Clark seeking, (1) that in the event of a'\u201cdetermination that Fenestra ... is hable for the faulty windows, . . . Fenestra ... be ordered to repay to . . . [Farm-Rite] what . . . [Farm-Rite] has paid Fenestra . . . and that . . . [Farm-Rite] be exonerated by Fenestra . . . and . . . Insurance ... of any claims . . . of Clark\u201d; and (2) that, if \u201cthere is a determination that Fenestra ... is not hable . . . Clark be ordered to pay . . . [Farm-Rite] for the windows . . . and that . . . [Farm-Rite] be exonerated from any claims by Clark.\u201d Clark on May 10, 1957, filed his petition (see footnote 2, supra) seeking a decree that Construction owes him $17,035.85 (including some money claimed for extra work) for his work and seeking payment from Surety (see footnote 2, supra) if Construction fails to pay him.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The cases were referred to a master, from whose findings the facts already set out have been summarized. The * master concluded<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in the case brought by Farm-Rite (1) that Fenestra and Farm-Rite were not \u201cfile bidders or subcontractors of . . . Construction . . . and are, therefore, not bound by\u201d art. Ill of the general conditions of the main <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>contract; (2) that Fenestra \u201ccarried out its agreement with . . . Farm-Rite ... in accordance with the order given to it by . . . [Farm-Rite] and that Farm-Rite . . . cannot recover its payment from Fenestra\u201d; and (3) that Farm-Rite \u201cwas a gratuitous intermediary of Clark . . . and . . . was merely doing a favor in lending its credit and obtaining a processor for Clark . . . and that . . . Clark . . . owes Farm-Rite\u201d $11,642.88 with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Farm-Rite and Clark filed objections to the master\u2019s report, and the master, in purported compliance with Rule 90 of the Superior Court (1954), furnished certain summaries of evidence. By interlocutory decrees the master\u2019s report was confirmed. A final decree in the case brought by Farm-Rite ordered Clark to pay to Farm-Rite the sum of $11,642.88, plus interest and costs, and dismissed the bill as against Fenestra and Insurance. In the case brought by Clark, a final decree dismissed the petition. Clark has appealed from both interlocutory and final decrees. Farm-Rite has appealed from the interlocutory decree and the final decree in the case initiated by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The Case Initiated by Farm-Rite.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">1. Fenestra contends that Farm-Rite cannot appeal, because it has obtained relief against Clark, one of the defendants, whose obligation to it Farm-Rite by its bill sought to have determined. See G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3 (3); c. 231A. There is no merit to this contention. Farm-Rite may reasonably be of opinion (1) that its claim against Fenestra denied by the final decree rests on a more solid foundation than its claim against Clark; (2) that, on appeal, it may be adjudged to be liable to Clark in some amount, which would be to Farm-Rite\u2019s disadvantage unless it may recover what it claims from Fenestra; or (3) that it is entitled to exoneration, not given it by the final decree, by Fenestra from further claims of Clark, or by Clark from further claims of Fenestra. These circumstances make Farm-Rite an aggrieved party under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 19. Farm-Rite has not been shown to have been a mere stakeholder or to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>no pecuniary or other substantial interest in the outcome of the appeal. Cf. <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>317 Mass. 130, 131-132; <em>Worcester Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>337 Mass. 769, 770. Cf. also <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>332 Mass. 197, 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">2. Clark and Farm-Rite each contend that certain vital findings were not justified by evidence summarized by the master. These summaries were furnished in connection with proper exceptions to the master\u2019s report (see <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>United Cape Cod Cranberry Co. </em>332 Mass. 675, 679) which present questions of law for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">3. In addition to the facts found and the evidence recited in his report (see <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Weisman, Inc. </em>324 Mass. 224, 228), the master summarized the following evidence as supporting his finding that Fenestra and Farm-Rite \u201cwere not file bidders\u201d under the main contract \u201cand are, therefore, not bound by\u201d art. Ill of its general conditions. Clark knew of the arrangement between Farm-Rite and Fenestra. Fenestra \u201cknew that Clark was the eventual user of the windows.\u201d The contracts between Clark and Farm-Rite and between Farm-Rite and Fenestra \u201cconsisted of purchase order[s], letters and the plans and specifications.\u201d Neither Farm-Rite nor Fenestra was a file bidder. Before the purchase orders were issued by Clark and Farm-Rite, respectively, Fenestra received \u00a7\u00a7 \u201c1 through 15 of the specifications.\u201d Section 8, entitled \u201cMetal Windows,\u201d contained four pages of requirements. \u201cThe windows could not have been made . . . without having\u201d \u00a78. Paragraph 8-01 a of \u00a7 8 provided, \u201cAttention is directed to the printed form of contract and [s]ection 1 of these specifications entitled \u2018Supplementary General Conditions\u2019 which is hereby made a part of this section.\u201d Section 1 provides in par. 1-01, \u201cAttention is directed to the printed form of contract of which these specifications are hereby made a part.\u201d The architect, acting under art. III (quoted earlier), \u201cdecided the windows as furnished by Clark were not of the quality required by the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">On this summary of evidence, the finding that Farm-Rite and Fenestra were not file bidders was justified. The sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>marized evidence disclosed, however, that the master erroneously failed to realize that, even if Farm-Rite and Fenestra were not \u201cfile bidders,\u201d they could be bound by art. III if they in fact agreed to be bound by art. III. The master thus did not apply the right rule of law and did not make findings essential to provide an adequate basis for a decree. See <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>335 Mass. 130, 136-137. There are no findings (as opposed to summaries of evidence) (a) whether Farm-Rite and Fenestra, even if not \u201cfile bidders,\u201d had agreed to be bound by art. III, and (b) of the precise contents of, and instruments making up, the contracts between Clark and Farm-Rite and between Farm-Rite and Fenestra. These contracts were clearly appropriate subjects of subsidiary findings and all essential parts of relevant instruments should have been included in, or attached to, the summaries of evidence. Doubtless, they would have been ordered to be so included if there had been a motion to recommit the report supported by proper affidavit under Rule 46 of the Superior Court (1954). See <em>Cantor </em>v. <em>Cantor, </em>325 Mass. 719, 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">As no evidence summarized indicates any oral agreement affecting the specifications, if the written instruments were fully before us, we would be in as good a position as the master to determine what the agreements were. See <em>Ober </em>v. <em>National Cas. Co. </em>318 Mass. 27, 30; <em>Forte </em>v. <em>Caruso, </em>336 Mass. 476, 480-481. See also <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Gowetz, </em>339 Mass. 294, 300. From so much of the written contracts as has been summarized we observe much to indicate that there was no justification for the master\u2019s conclusion that Fenestra was not bound by art. III.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We, however, cannot rule now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>that there was no such justification, without having the complete contracts before us, for in the unsummarized letters (which the summary of evidence states were a part of the contracts) and in the portions of the written instruments not summarized, there may be something which will justify the master\u2019s conclusion. In any event, because the master\u2019s conclusion is not shown to be justified by the evidence summarized and appears to be based on the erroneous assumption that art. III can only bind file bidders, Farm-Rite\u2019s exception numbered 1 and Clark\u2019s exception numbered 3 to the master\u2019s report should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">4. Farm-Rite\u2019s exceptions numbered 2 and 3 (and, less directly, its exceptions numbered 4 and 5) and Clark\u2019s exception numbered 4 related to the master\u2019s finding that Fenestra \u201ccarried out its agreement with\u201d Farm-Rite \u201cin accordance with the order given to it by\u201d Farm-Rite and that Farm-Rite cannot recover its payment to Fenestra. With respect to these exceptions, the master furnished the following summary of evidence in addition to evidence already mentioned above. Paragraph 8-04 of the specifications provided: \u201cf. Bonderizing and Shop Painting. (1) All windows and allied parts . . . shall be emersed [sic] in bonderite solution and rinsed in . . . chromic acid. (2) After air drying . . . apply one coat of DuPont\u2019s Rustinhibitive Primer or equal. ... (3) Field coats of paint shall be as specified in Section 21, Painting.\u201d Paragraph 8-01 of the specifications, as has been stated above, directed attention to par. 1-01 of the general conditions, which in turn referred to the printed form of contract. Article I of the contract provided in part, \u201c (g) Whenever the words \u2018or equal\u2019 . . . are used . . . this means \u2018equal in the opinion of the Architect.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The architect was not \u201cinformed that the windows were being fabricated by\u201d Fenestra. Fenestra did not use \u201cDuPont\u2019s Rust-inhibitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Primer\u201d but used Boydell\u2019s Rust-inhibitive Primer.\u201d The architect did not \u201cexpress the opinion that Boydell\u2019s . . . [p]rimer was equal to . . . \u2018DuPont\u2019s . . . [p]rimer.\u2019\u201d Fenestra did not place the \u201cwindows in \u2018bonderite solution,\u2019 but in \u2018grenadine\u2019\u201d solution. Bonderite was developed and licensed by Parker Rust Proof Company and grenadine was a product of another company. \u201c\u2018[TB]onderize,\u2019 \u2018bonderization\u2019 and \u2018bonderite solution\u2019 were trade names of . . . the Parker . . . Company.\u201d There were other methods of accomplishing the purpose of bonderizing, viz. to render a galvanized surface capable of being painted. \u201cThe architect . . . determined that paint failure was due to lack of proper bonderization\u201d and issued the orders already mentioned for refinishing the windows by another method. \u201cThis was not bonderizing or applying bonderite solution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The master in his original report referred to testimony by one expert that tests had showed \u201cvery little, if any, bonderization on the sash\u201d and by another expert \u201cthat the sash revealed bonderization well within . . . recognized limits.\u201d The master, however, did not refer to this testimony in his summaries of evidence under Rule 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Even if the master did not believe that Fenestra (a) used a different primer from that specified, (b) failed to obtain the architect\u2019s approval of Boydell\u2019s primer, and (c) used grenadine solution instead of bonderite, this summary of evidence did not justify the master\u2019s finding that Fenestra had complied with its contract. Disbelief of evidence of noncompliance does not establish that there was compliance. Although some evidence of immersion in bonderite solution may have been provided by an affidavit of Fenestra\u2019s treasurer, the affidavit did not show use of DuPont\u2019s primer or approval of the architect of the use of a substitute. Farm-Rite\u2019s exceptions 2 and 3, and Clark\u2019s exception 4, to the master\u2019s report should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">As the master did not consider that there had been any breach by Fenestra of the contract with Farm-Rite (or by Farm-Rite of its contract with Clark), he made no findings upon whether such a breach, if it existed, was material. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>There must be such findings to provide any proper basis for a decree, unless he finds that in all respects Fenestra did comply with the specifications. If art. III of the main contract is binding upon Farm-Rite and Fenestra, the architect\u2019s determination will be conclusive on this issue. If art. III is not thus binding, separate findings about this issue will be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The Case Brought by Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">In the case brought by Clark against Construction, the master found that, apart from a charge back for refinishing the windows, Construction owed Clark a balance of $17,035.85. Against this, Construction charged back to Clark $14,018.53, part of which was the amount paid to Pikens for refinisbing the windows. The master also found</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">(a) that Clark actually performed for Construction extra work in the sum of $2,640 which \u201cClark testified he did\u201d on oral instructions of Construction\u2019s superintendent, and</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">(b) that this work was \u201cnot ... in accordance with the . . . contract ... as Clark . . . did not have a written order from the architect and . . . Construction ... in turn was not paid for these items by the Commonwealth.\u201d In these circumstances, the master stated that he was \u201c compelled to find that . . . Construction . . . owes Clark . . . nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The master, with respect to the charge back, stated \u201cthat there was dependable evidence . . . that the paint failure was . . . caused [not] by lack of bonderization . . . [by] Fenestra, but rather by the use of an alkyd paint on specification by the architect.\u201d Nevertheless, he ruled that \u201cas a matter of law . . . the judgment of the architect cannot be questioned by Clark or . . . Construction . . . and . . . is . . . binding on the two parties.\u201d The master found that the architect acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Clark in his case argues only his exceptions 6 and 7 to the master\u2019s report. Other exceptions, which relate only to the case brought by Farm-Rite, have been dealt with already.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Exception 6 in effect asserts that there was no evidence sufficient to support a charge back to Clark by Construction of a ten per cent overhead charge for the benefit of Construction based on the $12,744.12 paid by Construction to Pikens for refinishing the windows. The master, in addition to findings and evidence summarized in his report, merely reports evidence of the addition of this ten per cent charge by Construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The evidence thus reported shows no subcontract provision or trade custom sufficient to justify the ten per cent overhead charge. The circumstance that the pleadings in the case brought by Farm-Rite indicate that Clark billed Farm-Rite for such a charge, in addition to the $14,018.53 charged back to Clark by Construction, does not adequately establish the existence of such a trade custom. The master\u2019s finding with respect to the amount of Construction\u2019s charge back to Clark is not supported by the evidence summarized by him. See <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>296 Mass. 479, 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Exception 7 raises the questions (a) whether there was error in law in the master\u2019s finding that the extra work amounting to $2,640 was not performed in accordance with the main contract because Clark did not have a written order from the architect for such work, and (b) whether this finding was inconsistent with subsidiary findings. The master declined to summarize-any evidence with respect to this finding because the report contained \u201csufficient facts to enable the court to pass on this objection as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The master\u2019s report says little more on this point than the statement already quoted that, because there was no written order, these \u201cextras . . . were not performed in accordance with the terms of the contract.\u201d This inadequate statement may imply that Clark\u2019s subcontract (in accordance with provisions usual in such subcontracts) did require such a written order and that the work was extra work requiring a written order under the subcontract and perhaps under the main contract. Those facts are not found or stated as evidence in the master\u2019s report, nor are they stated in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>summary of evidence. Even though Clark did not move to recommit the report for a further summary of evidence and support his motion by suitable affidavit under Rule 46 (see <em>Cantor </em>v. <em>Cantor, </em>325 Mass. 719, 721), the master merely by making the finding itself has not stated evidence sufficient to justify it. See <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>296 Mass. 479, 482-483. Exception 7 should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Obviously to prevail in further proceedings, Clark must show either that his subcontract (including provisions of the main contract incorporated by reference) required no written order, or that the extra work was apart from the subcontract in some respect, e.g. that Construction, already bound to do it under the main contract, arranged to have Clark do it separately from Clark\u2019s subcontract, in special circumstances which would render inapplicable the considerations mentioned in <em>Fred C. McClean Heating Supplies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jefferson Constr. Co. </em>339 Mass. 356, 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">We do not reach the question, argued by Construction, whether any recovery by Clark against Construction upon the subcontract is barred by the stringent rule in <em>Sipley </em>v. <em>Stickney, </em>190 Mass. 43, 47-48, and cases which purport to follow it. See <em>Swaney </em>v. <em>Clark-Wilcox Co. </em>331 Mass. 471, 474-476. Cf. <em>Ficara </em>v. <em>Belleau, </em>331 Mass. 80, 81-82; Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 1123-1126; Williston, Contracts (Rev. ed.) \u00a7 842, n. 4. We cannot now say whether the rule will prove to be relevant when adequate and proper findings shall have been made. For example, it may appear that, as to some elements of the recovery claimed by Clark, the contractual arrangement upon which the claim rests may be sufficiently separate from the subcontract to make the rule wholly inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Disposition of the Cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">6. The interlocutory decrees and the final decrees are reversed. The cases are remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b313-14\"> The names of two parties have been changed since May 6, 1954. Farm-Rite was once known as Federal Windows, Inc. Fenestra was once known as Detroit Steel Products Company. To avoid confusion, they have been referred to, in the body of this opinion, only by their later names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\"> Federal Insurance Company (Insurance) furnished a performance bond for the price ($11,564).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\"> The conclusions of the master in the case brought by Clark are stated later in connection with the discussion of that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\"> The references in the purchase orders to the plans and specifications point to their incorporation by reference, as does the evidence that the specifications were in Fenestra\u2019s hands before the orders were given. Fenestra clearly knew that Clark in effect had delegated to it all his subcontract obligations with respect to fabricating the windows. The parties, knowing this, must have contemplated that failure to satisfy the specifications (in the determination of the architect) would make the windows of little use to Clark or to Farm-Rite, and might expose them to a substantial liability. These considerations all are consistent with the view that the parties\u2019 objective intention shown by the written instruments was that Fenestra must perform in accordance with the specifications, in turn incorporating art.
