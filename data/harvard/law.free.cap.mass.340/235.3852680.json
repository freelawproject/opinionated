L. c. 231A that signs which are in use or are proposed for use at gasoline filling stations of its retail dealers, and which refer to blended gasoline sold thereat under its trade mark Sunoco, or to the dispensing pumps, do not violate G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 295C, as appearing in St. 1939, c. 459, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The case was reserved and reported by a single justice upon the pleadings and a statement of agreed facts. A prayer for an alternative declaration of the invalidity of \u00a7 295C to any extent applicable has been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Section 295C is one of several sections of a statute whose purpose is to prevent fraud in the sale of motor fuel. <em>Slome </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Fitchburg, </em>304 Mass. 187, 189. Section 295C provides: \u201cEvery retail dealer in motor fuel shall publicly display and maintain on each pump or other dispensing device from which motor fuel is sold by him, at least one sign and not more than two signs stating the price per gallon of the motor fuel sold by him from such pump or device. Said sign or signs shall be of a size not larger than eight inches by ten inches. The price shown on each of such signs shall include all taxes imposed with respect to the manufacture or sale of the motor fuel sold at such pump or device, and every such sign shall either contain a statement of the taxes included in said price, or, without specifying the amount thereof, shall state that such taxes are included in said price. All figures, including fractions, upon said signs, other than figures and fractions used in any price computing mechanism constituting a part of any such pump or dispensing device, shall be of the same size. C10 No signs stating or relating to the price of motor fuel, and no signs designed or calculated to cause the public to believe that they state or relate to the price of motor fuel, other than the signs referred to in the preceding paragraph and required to be displayed upon pumps and other dispensing devices, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>shall be posted or displayed on or about the premises where motor fuel is sold at retail, and within view of any public highway or reservation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The dispensing pump to which the signs relate is adjustable if desired so as to blend in its nozzle, with gasoline of a standard octane rating, a predetermined amount of other gasoline or \u201coctane concentrate\u201d which has a high octane rating. Thus a single pump and two storage tanks make possible the delivery to each customer of gasoline which has an octane rating deemed suited to the compression ratio of the engine of his automobile. As presently used the pumps deliver the standard gasoline and five blends.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The signs which the defendant deems violative of \u00a7 295C read as follows: \u201cNew Thrifty 6 fuels custom blended\u201d; \u201cMIRACLE PUMP 6 THRIFTY FUELS\u201d; \u201cNEW! THRIFTIER custom-blended\u201d (with picture of the pump); \u201ccustom BLENDED AT THE PUMP NEW . . . THRIFTIER! Exact Octane To Fit <em>Your </em>Car\u201d; \u201cMiracle Blending Pump links up: power thrift Custom-Blended at the Pump\u201d; \u201cCustom Blending pay only for the octane you need!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel at the argument said that it does not ask a declaration in respect of the \u201cpay only\u201d sign. We think that, unless there is assurance that all controversy in respect of this, and similar, signs is ended, we should construe the \u201cpay only\u201d sign. Its status being, in our view, like that of the others we do construe it without deciding the right to or effect of the withdrawal of an issue by only one party.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">We hold that the signs are not signs \u201cstating or relating to the price of motor fuel\u201d or signs \u201cdesigned or calculated to cause the public to believe that they state or relate to the price of motor fuel\u201d within the meaning of these words in G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 295C.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">The \u201cprice of motor fuel\u201d is the number of currency units for which a unit of fuel is sold. A dictionary definition of \u201cthrifty\u201d is, \u201cGiven to, or evincing, thrift; characterized by economy and good management; provident.\u201d It is true that the purchase of a fuel will be thrifty if its cost is less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>than that of another fuel which in performance is identical with it. But these statements do not make that claim. If the use of the word \u201cthrift\u201d alone would justify an inference of reference to price, such inference is extinguished in the signs by disclosure of the basis for the claim. The \u201cthrift\u201d signs say in effect that \u201cbuying our custom blended gasoline\u201d or \u201cbuying gasoline dispensed in our miracle pump\u201d is a thrifty practice. The \u201cpay only\u201d sign says in effect: \u201cbuying custom blended fuel means that you pay only for the octane you need.\u201d Such statements are equally applicable whatever prices prevail for standard and higher grades of fuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">These signs inform customers who need gasoline of higher octane rating than standard that their expenditures for motor fuel, that is, their fuel costs, may be less than at competitive pumps which sell only a single high test fuel. Such fuel <em>cost </em>to the customer is what these signs, and in particular the \u201cpay only\u201d sign, refer to. This, however, is not in any precise sense the \u201cprice\u201d of the fuel, and we do not think that the wording or intent of the statute requires that the word \u201cprice\u201d be so construed as to include concepts beyond its plain meaning. \u201cThe words of a statute are to be given their usual and ordinary meaning. Words plain enough in common speech are equally plain when they appear in a statute. They are to be considered in the light of the obvious aim to be accomplished by the Legislature and as employed by the Legislature as expressing the practical means by which the legislative aim is to be attained. Every statute, if possible, is to be construed in accordance with sound judgment and common sense, so as to make it an effectual piece of legislation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slome, </em>321 Mass. 713, 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The signs in issue do not tend to the promotion of fraud, or to \u201cconvey the impression that . . . [the fuel] is sold at less than the prevailing market price.\u201d <em>Merit Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. on the Necessaries of Life, </em>319 Mass. 301, 304. A photograph in evidence confirms that the only display of price is in the small sign or two signs which conform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>to \u00a7 295C, so that our disapproval, heretofore expressed, of \u201ca wealth of signs with exaggerated and blatant statements of the virtues and prices . . . [which leave the motorist] in doubt and confusion\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>is inapplicable. Furthermore the signs in use, though striking, are not of this description.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The bill of complaint presents a proper case for a declaratory decree under c. 231A apart from the waived constitutional issue. This is not a case of equity intervening to prevent the prosecution of a crime. See <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>274 Mass. 56. Compare <em>Kenyon </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>320 Mass. 528 (constitutional rights involved). Chapter 231A created a new remedy and is to be \u201cliberally construed and administered\u201d (\u00a79). <em>Madden </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>333 Mass. 734, 736-737. The controversy was initiated by a letter from the former director that posted signs \u201cwould appear to be in violation of . . . section 295C, the second paragraph thereof,\u201d and suggesting ehmination of the word \u201cthrifty.\u201d A later letter said that unless changes were made criminal prosecution would be instigated against the plaintiff and its retail dealers displaying the signs. The statute in addition to criminal penalties against \u201cwhoever . . . violates\u201d it (\u00a7 295K) provides that \u201c[t]he division shall administer and enforce\u201d it (\u00a7 295H), that \u201c[t]he superior court shall have jurisdiction in equity to enjoin . . . repeated violation ... by any retail dealer . . . [, that petitions . . . may be filed by any person injured or damaged by such violation\u201d (\u00a7 295L), and that on second and subsequent criminal convictions the licenses of licensees (retail dealers, \u00a7 295B) may be suspended (\u00a7 295K). Retailers\u2019 licenses under G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 13, for the storage of petroleum products could be affected by a violation. See <em>Scudder </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Sandwich, </em>309 Mass. 373, 376; <em>Adamsky </em>v. <em>City Council of New Bedford, </em>326 Mass. 706, 709-710. If the plaintiff is seeking to avoid being prosecuted it is also seeking much more than that. The controversy affects the relation of the plaintiff to its retail dealers in respect of important business policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The statute does not leave it to the director or the divi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>sion to determine whether the signs relate to price. His power is to move to have the courts decide the issue. Compare <em>Pacella </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Commn. </em>339 Mass. 338, 346. There is no interference in a pending administrative procedure. See <em>St. Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>320 Mass. 467, 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">A declaratory decree is to be entered in accordance herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
