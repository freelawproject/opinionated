Tra\u00edna, Chapter 7 trustee (\u201cTrustee\u201d) in the bankruptcy proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>of Appellee Martha C. Sewell (\u201cDebtor\u201d), asks us to reverse the ruling of the bankruptcy court, which was affirmed by the district court, excluding from property of the estate the Debtor\u2019s beneficial interest in her employer\u2019s ERISA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> retirement plan. The Trustee insists that the bankruptcy and district courts erred in allowing that exclusion under \u00a7 541(c)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> even though the employer\u2019s plan is an ERISA plan<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> containing an ERISA required anti-alienation provision,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because \u2014 as the result of alleged disqualifying acts by Debtor\u2019s employer'\u2014 the subject plan is purported not to be <em>tax </em>qualified under applicable provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Concluding that an ERISA plan\u2019s tax qualification is not a prerequisite to exclusion of a participant\u2019s beneficial interest from her bankruptcy estate under \u00a7 541(c)(2), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The Debtor was a full-time employee of Home Care Center, Inc. (\u201cHome Care\u201d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but was not a shareholder, director, officer, or highly-paid executive. Home Care sponsored a pension plan known as the Deferred Capital Compensation Plan and Trust (the \u201cPlan\u201d). The Debtor was a participant in the Plan, but was not a trustee, administrator, or other fiduciary. Among other typical ERISA provisions, the Plan contains a clause restricting transfer of the Debtor\u2019s beneficial interest in the retirement trust.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Also referred to as an anti-alienation or \u201cspendthrift\u201d clause, this provision is admittedly enforceable under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">Although the record does not contain evidence that the Plan was ever anything but presumptively qualified for tax purposes, neither is there record evidence that the Plan was ever formally disqualified for tax purposes by the Internal Revenue Service. The Trustee, nevertheless, contends that specified acts \u2014 \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d \u2014 by Home Care or individuals acting for it caused the Plan not to be tax qualified at the times pertinent to this case. Although we have doubts that an ERISA plan that is presumed to be tax qualified or has opted to obtain a tax qualification letter from the IRS can become disqualified other than by the overt action of the IRS, we assume for purposes of today\u2019s <em>de novo </em>review (as have the parties and the bankruptcy and district courts) that the Plan is not tax qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">The Debtor takes the position that her beneficial interest in the Plan is excludable from her bankruptcy estate under \u00a7 541(c)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code. This position is premised on the facts that her interest in the Plan, unquestionably a trust, is subject to a restriction prohibiting alienation (transfer) and that the restriction is enforceable under ERISA, a non-bankruptcy law. Section 541(c)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-14\">A restriction on the transfer of the beneficial interest of the debtor in a trust that is enforceable under applicable non-bankruptcy law is enforceable in a case under this title.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">The Trustee objected to the Debtor\u2019s exclusion of her interest in the Plan, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>the bankruptcy court overruled that objection on the basis of \u00a7 541(c)(2), holding that the Plan is \u201cERISA-qualified\u201d and that its tax qualification\u2014or lack thereof\u2014\u2022 is immaterial. Specifically, the bankruptcy court rejected the Trustee\u2019s contention that to be an \u201cERISA-qualified pension plan,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2022 the Plan had to be tax qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. The Trustee appealed to the district court, which affirmed the bankruptcy court. The Trustee then timely filed a notice of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">When a ruling by the bankruptcy court that has been appealed to and ruled on by the district court is appealed to us, we perform the same appellate review as did the district court: We examine the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard, and we examine that court\u2019s legal determinations under the <em>de novo </em>standard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The sole issue on appeal of this case\u2014whether a bankruptcy debtor\u2019s beneficial interest in an ERISA retirement plan that contains an anti-alienation provision is excludable from the bankruptcy estate under \u00a7 541(c)(2) when the ERISA plan in question is not or may not be qualified for tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code\u2014is purely a legal one. Consequently, our review in this case is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">B. <em>Property Excludable from the Bankruptcy Estate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Under the well-known scheme of the Bankruptcy Code, all property and interests in property owned by the debt- or at the time the petition in bankruptcy is filed (and, in some instances, for a short period prior thereto) are available to satisfy claims of creditors and costs of the proceedings <em>unless </em>such assets are (1) \u201cexcluded\u201d from the bankruptcy estate altogether, or (2) included in the bankruptcy estate but \u201cexempted\u201d from use in satisfying claims of creditors and other authorized charges. As the Debtor in the instant case has claimed\u2014and the bankruptcy and district courts have allowed\u2014the <em>exclusion </em>of her beneficial interest in the Plan from her bankruptcy estate, we never reach the issue of <em>exemptions: </em>Exemptions come into play only when property is included in the bankruptcy estate and is sought to be used to satisfy claims of creditors; by definition, <em>excluded </em>property never forms part of the bankruptcy estate and thus need not to be tested for exempt status.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-12\">Under the equally well-known scheme of ERISA, provisions in Title 29 of the U.S.Code identify the various types of ERISA plans and specify what must be included in such plans; on the other hand, provisions in Title 26 specify what must be included in an ERISA plan for it to be \u201cqualified\u201d for tax purposes and thus be subject to special tax provisions that entitle the plan\u2019s sponsors and participants to tax benefits provided under ERISA. Obviously, ERISA is a largely parallel, dual system, jointly administered by the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury, and statutorily bifurcated into Titles 26 and 29 of the U.S.Code. Moreover, many provisions and requirements found in Title 29 are replicated in Title 26. Prominent among such twin provisions is the requirement that an ERISA employee pension benefit plan contain a restriction on alienation of the beneficial interests of the participants in the plan.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Clearly, an ERISA plan like Home Care\u2019s is required to have an anti-alienation clause; likewise, for such a plan to be \u201cqualified\u201d for tax purposes, it must contain an anti-alienation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">Nowhere in ERISA, however, is there a requirement that, to be an ERISA plan and thus be governed by ERISA, a plan must be tax qualified. Indeed, the converse is true: An ERISA plan that is not or may not be tax qualified nevertheless continues to be governed by ERISA for essentially every other purpose.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It would be perverse, indeed, if the negligent or intentional act of an ERISA plan sponsor, administrator, or other fiduciary, that results in disqualification for tax purposes could, <em>ipso facto, </em>remove the plan\u2014-and thus the beneficial interests of the employees/participants\u2014from the aegis of ERISA and its protections of the very interests for which the legislation was adopted and is administered in parallel by the Treasury and Labor Departments. The instant case is a perfect example: Were the rule otherwise, the Debtor\u2019s beneficial interest in her ERISA employee pension benefit plan, replete with restrictions on voluntary and involuntary alienation and thus facially ex-cludable from the Debtor\u2019s bankruptcy estate under \u00a7 541(c)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, could be stripped of all ERISA protection, including enforceable nonbank-ruptcy restrictions on transfer, by the failure of her employer\u2014beyond any control of the Debtor\u2014to maintain tax qualification of the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Although the excellent and comprehensive appellate briefs of the parties contain detailed analyses of the statutory and jurisprudential development of this area of the law, we are satisfied that consideration of two opinions\u2014one from the United States Supreme Court and the other from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\u2014provide all the guidance and precedent needed to decide this appeal, which presents a matter of first impression in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">The question whether the beneficial interest of a debtor in an ERISA retirement plan and trust that contains an ERISA-appropriate and ERISA-enforceable restriction on transfer comes within the ambit of \u00a7 541(c)(2)\u2019s exclusion was answered definitively and in the affirmative by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Patterson v. Shumate.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court held unequivocally that \u00a7 541(c)(2)\u2019s requirement that a restriction on transfer of a beneficial interest of the debtor in a trust be enforceable \u201cunder applicable nonbankruptcy law\u201d is not limited to enforceability under state law; it suffices that such a restriction in an \u201cERISA-qualified pension plan\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> be enforceable under some federal law other than bankruptcy law-there, as here, ERISA. In its opinion, however, the Court inadvertently opened another jurisprudential Pandora\u2019s Box when, for reasons that are not apparent to us, it coined the phrase \u201cERISA-qualified pension plan\u201d which appears nowhere in ERISA\u2019s statutory language. The phrase is neither a term of art nor a defined term for purposes of ERISA. Moreover, \u00a7 541(c)(2) makes no reference to ERISA, much less to an ERISA-qualified plan. Nevertheless, one line of <em>Patterson </em>progeny comprises a body of jurisprudence concerning a question not answered in <em>Patterson: </em>Whether, to be \u201cERISA-qualified,\u201d the plan must be \u201cqualified\u201d for tax purposes.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>For present purposes, it suffices to note that bankruptcy courts and district courts have answered that question both ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\">To date only one federal court of appeals has addressed the tax qualification issue head on: the Seventh Circuit, in <em>In re Baker.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The operable facts in <em>Baker </em>are on all fours with those we consider today.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Given the congruency of the cases, we find it appropriate to quote one lengthy but dispositive paragraph from Judge Easter-brook\u2019s opinion in <em>Baker:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-4\"><em>Patterson </em>states its holding this way: \u201ca debtor\u2019s interest in an ERISA-qualified pension plan may be excluded from the property of the bankruptcy estate pursuant to \u00a7 541(c)(2).\u201d 504 U.S. at 765, 112 S.Ct. at 2250. What is an \u201cERISA-qualified\u201d plan? The term does not appear in the statute, and its provenance is mysterious. Some plans are <em>tax </em>qualified, a term of art meaning that contributions to the plan are deductible at the corporate level and not taxed to the employee until the plan distributes benefits. Taxation has nothing to do with the question at hand, however. Most likely, the Court used \u201cERISA-quali-fied\u201d to mean \u201ccovered by Subchapter I of ERISA.\u201d Not all pension plans need contain an anti-alienation clause. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003(b). Early in its opinion the Court referred to \u201cthe anti-alienation provision required for qualification under \u00a7 206(d)(1) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1).\u201d 504 U.S. at 755, 112 S.Ct. at 2244. Understanding \u201cERISA-quali-fied\u201d to mean nothing more complex than \u201ccontaining the anti-alienation clause required by \u00a7 206(d)(1) of ERISA\u201d makes the phrase mesh with the topic of the opinion: whether ERISA is \u201capplicable nonbankruptcy law.\u201d (Perhaps the term \u201cERISA-quali-fied\u201d has some significance elsewhere in the law; our discussion of its scope applies only to the question whether a creditor can reach funds in bankruptcy.) <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Quite literally, everything contained in the quoted paragraph from <em>Baker </em>applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">As Judge Easterbrook went on to observe, \u201cSubchapter I of ERISA covers every \u2018employee benefit plan\u2019 established by an employer engaged in interstate commerce, with five exceptions.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Like the plan sponsor in <em>Baker, </em>Home Care is engaged in interstate commerce and none of these five exceptions applies to it. ERISA thus covers the Plan, which\u2014like the plan in Baker\u2014contains an ERISA anti-alienation clause. And, like the Seventh Circuit in <em>Baker, </em>we are satisfied that \u201c \u00a7 541(c)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code excludes the [Pjlan\u2019s value from [the Debtor\u2019s] estate in bankruptcy.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">We discern no reason to depart from the Seventh Circuit\u2019s analysis in <em>Baker </em>or to reach a different legal conclusion. We agree with the <em>Baker </em>court that taxation and tax qualification of employee pension benefit plans have nothing to do with the bankruptcy exclusion at issue in this case. Joining the Seventh Circuit, we hold for this Circuit that, for purposes of \u00a7 541(c)(2)\u2019s exclusion of a debtor\u2019s non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>transferable beneficial interest in an ERISA employee pension benefit plan such as Home Care\u2019s, the fact that the plan is not or may not be \u201cqualified\u201d for tax purposes does not preclude excludability.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\">.
