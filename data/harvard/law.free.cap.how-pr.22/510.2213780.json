Roelker, <em>attorney ana of counsel for defendants.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-7\">I. By the constitution of the United States, <em>(art. </em>III., <em>sec. </em>2,) the judicial power of the United States extends to all cases in law and equity affecting consuls, and in all such cases the supreme court of the United States has original jurisdiction ; and by act of congress of September 24, 1789, <em>(ch. </em>20, <em>sec. </em>9,) the district courts of the United States have jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the several states, of all cases against consuls or vice-consuls <em>(Davis </em>agt. Packard, 7 Peters, 276.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-8\">The jurisdiction in such case does not depend on the party on record. If the suit affects him, it must be dismissed, not because he is a party, but because it affects him. <em>(Osborn </em>agt. <em>U. S. Bank, </em>9 <em>Wheat., </em>738-854.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-9\">II. A consul cannot renounce or waive his exemption from liability of being sued in a state court, because it is not his personal privilege, but the privilege of the government of the United States. A state court has no jurisdiction in any suit which affects a consul, and a suit against the firm of which the consul is a partner, cannot be sustained by the same. <em>(Griffin </em>agt. <em>Dominguess, </em>2 <em>Duer, </em>656; <em>Valarino </em>agt. <em>Thompson, </em>3 <em>Seld., </em>576.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-10\">An attachment against a ncti-resident debtor is a suit within the meaning of the judiciary act, giving exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>jurisdiction to the United States courts. <em>(In the matter of Aycinena, </em>1 <em>Sand., </em>690.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-5\">One of the defendants, they being co-partners and alleged to be joint debtors, being a foreign consul, the state court had no jurisdiction, and all proceedings had in the action are void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-6\">III. By the constitution of the United States, <em>(art. </em>III., <em>sec. </em>3,) the President alone has the power of receiving foreign ministers, and the power includes the power to dismiss them, since he alone is the organ of communication with them, and accountable for the conduct of foreign agents. <em>(See Kent Com., I. p. </em>288.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-7\">The letter of the assistant secretary of state states that, \u201c I have deemed it proper to revoke his exequatur,\u201d and shows that the President of the United States never revoked the exequatur, who alone has the power so to do. It is an unwarrantable assumption of power on the part of the assistant secretary of state to attempt to do an act which the Executive alone has the right and the power to do. The exequatur was, therefore, never revoked, and if revoked, the letter produced was no legal evidence of the fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-8\">The exequatur is executed under the hand of the President and the seal of the United States, and a proclamation made by the President.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-9\">By acts of congress, July 27, 1789, 15 Sept. 1789, <em>(sec\u2019s </em>4 <em>and </em>5,) the duty and power of the secretary of state of the United States are simply to execute such duties as shall from time to time be intrusted to him by the President of the United States, relative to such matters respecting foreign affairs as the President shall assign to the department, and the principal officer of this department shall conduct the busin &gt;ss of the department in such manner as the President shall from time to time order or instruct. The secretary of state is only a ministerial officer, and he can act only by order of the President.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The office of assistant secretary is created by act of congress of March 3d, 1853, sec. 6, and this subordinate officer is enjoined only to perform all such duties in the office of secretary of state as shall be prescribed by the secretary of state, or as may be prescribed by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-5\">The evidence of the pretended revocation of the exequatur consists only in private letters of the assistant secretary of state. By the laws of New York, <em>(see Laws </em>1846, 303, <em>ch. </em>240, \u00a7 1,) it is provided that a copy of any document in any of the departments of the government of the United States, certified by the head of such department, and attested by the seal of the department, may be given in evidence. This act is in relaxation of the strict common law rule of evidence. But the evidence offered here falls short of all rules of evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-6\">IV. Even if the exequatur had been revoked it could not avail. The defendant was a foreign consul at the commencement of the proceedings and up to the time the motion came on to be heard, and the court had no jurisdiction when the suit and proceedings were instituted, and are therefore void. <em>(Perry </em>agt. <em>Mongomery, </em>2 <em>Sand., </em>261; <em>Cole </em>agt. <em>Kerr, </em>id.; <em>Hastings </em>agt. <em>Farmer, </em>4 <em>Comst., </em>293.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-7\">Y. The action is against the defendants as joint debtors alleged to be jointly liable. Judgment would therefore be entered up only against all of them, and not against one or two of them severally. Neither the legislature nor court can change the contract and make it joint and several, when it was made joint only. A recovery cannot be had against one of several defendants alone, except when such a judgment could have been had, if he had been sued alone. The action can therefore not be continued against two of the defendants, discontinuing against the consul.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-8\">In cases where defendants plead infancy, or discharge under an insolvent act, the contract is avoided, and no contract exists as to them, either joint or several. But the consul does <em>not avoid </em>the contract, but only excepts to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>tribunal that undertakes to pass upon it. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 136, 214, 119, 122; <em>Bridge </em>agt. <em>Payson, </em>5 <em>Sand., </em>217; <em>Slocum </em>agt. <em>Hooker, </em>13 <em>Barb., </em>536 ; <em>Parker </em>agt. <em>Jackson, </em>16 <em>Barb., </em>33; <em>Pruyn </em>agt. <em>Black, </em>21 <em>N. </em>Y. <em>R., </em>300 ; <em>Sturtevant </em>agt. <em>Brewer, </em>9 <em>Abb., </em>414.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-4\">VI. It is a fundamental rule that where there is an absence of jurisdiction, the defect cannot be supplied by amendment or supplemental proceedings so as make the void proceedings valid from beginning. It is only when the court has acquired jurisdiction that it can amend any process or proceeding to retain it and carry out its object in furtherance of justice. But it cannot make a void proceeding valid by an amendment in the same proceeding or matter. <em>(Bangs </em>agt. <em>McIntosh, </em>23 <em>Barb., </em>601; 18 <em>Wend., 675; Bloom </em>agt. <em>Burdick, </em>1 <em>Hill, </em>138-143; <em>Wright </em>agt. <em>Douglas, </em>10 <em>Barb., </em>110.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-5\">In the case at bar the warrant of attachment was void, because it affected a foreign consul, and so the suit brought by plaintiffs. The state court had no jurisdiction at the commencement of the suit, and therefore all subsequent proceedings are void. The warrants of attachment issued in both cases must be vacated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-6\">The points of plaintiffs for Rock River Bank were the same as used in the court below, <em>(ante, </em>250.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b519-7\">Andrews, Colby &amp; Thompson, <em>attorneys, and </em>Charles W. Prentiss, <em>of counsel, for pl\u2019ffs in No. </em>2. John G. Vose, <em>attorney, and </em>John T. Doyle, <em>of counsel for pl'ffs in No. </em>1.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b519-8\">Leonard, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A5Q\">When the attachment was granted</p>\n<p id=\"AGu\">the defendant Hoffman was consul for the Duchy of Saxe Coburg Gotha, for the state of Illinois. It issued against the property of all the defendants. The constitution and laws of the United States prohibit the state courts from taking cognizance of suits affecting consuls.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>It is thus apparent that this court was without jurisdiction to grant process of any kind against Hoffman when the attachment herein was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The question of jurisdiction must be disposed of accord? ing to the facts existing when the action was commenced or the process issued. Being without jurisdiction, then, there was no basis upon which to incorporate it subsequently. We think that the subsequent revocation of the <em>exequatur </em>of the consul did not give validity to process which was before invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">We think the case of <em>Valerino </em>agt. Thompson, (3 <em>Seld. R., </em>576,) is conclusive upon the questions here involved. The court of appeals there hold that the courts of the United States have jurisdiction where a consul is sued with another person. The court in that case say : \u201c The constitution extends the jurisdiction of the United States courts to all cases <em>affecting consuls,\u2019 </em>and the judiciary act makes it exclusive of the state courts \u2018 <em>in all suits against consuls.\u2019 \u201d </em>That case further holds, that where a consul and another are necessarily co-defendants, it brings the co-defendants within the jurisdiction of the United States courts, by unavoidable implication, (p. 582.) We think this decision of the first court of our state must be considered conclusive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">This action being <em>against a consul, </em>the state courts are ousted of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">There is no analogy between the contract of an infant, <em>feme covert, </em>bankrupt, &amp;c., and the contract of a consul when made jointly with others.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">In an action against an infant or <em>feme covert </em>on a joint contract with others, the name of such party may be stricken out, and the action proceed against the other joint contractors, because there never was any actual contract made by the infant or <em>feme covert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">The contract of the consul is, however, a valid and binding obligation, whether made jointly with others, or not. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>There is no principle upon which his name can be stricken from the action without disturbing the liability of the other joint contractors with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">We are compelled to hold that this court has no jurisdiction over the action, and of course none to grant an attachment therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The order appealed from is reversed, and the attachment is vacated. No costs are allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Clerke and Ingraham, J. J,, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
