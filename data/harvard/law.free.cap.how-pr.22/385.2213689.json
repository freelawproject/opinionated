After the order was made denying a new trial, the defendant entered a judgment on the verdict for costs against the plaintiffs. The defendant\u2019s counsel claimed that the plaintiffs should have appealed from the judgment, and could not appeal from the order refusing a new trial after the entry of the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-10\">George S.

The order in this case refusing a new trial, was regularly made before the judgment was entered; and we think an appeal lies from the order to the general term, notwithstanding the entry of the judgment before the same was taken. <em>(See </em>19 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>515.) The case of <em>Jackson </em>agt. <em>Fassett, </em>(33 <em>Barb., </em>645,) and others like it, only show that a motion for a new trial on a case cannot be made at a special term after judgment has been entered unconditionally in the action. Thosei decisions are not in point upon this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is therefore denied, with $10 costs to abide the event of the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
