The district court denied Pruitt\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP, Pruitt is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-24\">Pruitt alleged that Janice C. Brown, the Circuit Court Clerk for Washington County, Mississippi, denied his request for documents related to his criminal conviction. Pruitt alleged that Brown did not deliver the documents based on instructions from Circuit Judge Ashley Hines. \u201cJudicial officers are entitled to absolute immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>from claims for damages arising out of acts performed in the exercise of their judicial functions.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284 (5th Cir.1994). This immunity can be overcome only by demonstrating that the conduct complained of was non-judicial or by showing that the conduct was \u201cin the complete absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Judicial acts are those that are \u201c \u2018normally performed by a judge\u2019 \u201d and that affect parties who \u201c \u2018dealt with the judge in his judicial capacity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285. Court clerks \u201chave absolute immunity from actions for damages arising from acts they are specifically required to do under court order or at a judge\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Clay v. Allen, </em>242 F.3d 679, 682 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">On appeal, Pruitt\u2019s arguments are based solely on the irrelevant issue of qualified immunity for Brown. Pruitt makes the conclusional assertion that Brown\u2019s refusal was a ministerial act not covered by qualified immunity. Pruitt does not refute his allegation that Brown was acting on the instructions of Judge Hines. Pruitt has not presented a nonfrivolous issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Pruitt has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal would be frivolous was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Pruitt\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b664-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
