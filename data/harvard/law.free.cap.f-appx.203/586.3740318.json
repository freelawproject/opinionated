He argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a minor role adjustment to his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Jarvis contends that he was a mere courier who was substantially less culpable than other participants in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and review factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, a district court may decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if the defendant was a minor participant. An adjustment for a minor role applies to a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-18\">The district court did not clearly err in denying Jarvis a minor role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Atanda, </em>60 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 137-38 (5th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Nevarez-Arreola, </em>885 F.2d 243, 245 (5th Cir.1989). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
