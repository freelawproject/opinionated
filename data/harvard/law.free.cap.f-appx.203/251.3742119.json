The IRS responds that the Tax Court properly dismissed Salery\u2019s petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>it was untimely as to the notice of deficiency for the 2001 tax year, and there was no other basis for jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">We review questions of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Palmer v. Braun, </em>376 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir.2004). A taxpayer must file a petition challenging an income tax deficiency within 90 days after the notice of deficiency is mailed to the taxpayer\u2019s last known United States address. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212, 6213(a). According to this statute, the \u201ctimely filing of such a petition is a jurisdictional prerequisite for a suit in the tax court.\u201d <em>Pugsley v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>749 F.2d 691, 692 (11th Cir.1985). Thus, where the petition is untimely, the case should be dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 692-94; <em>Myles v. Comm\u2019r, I.R.S., </em>719 F.2d 373, 373-74 (11th Cir.1983). Upon dismissal of a late petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the taxpayer\u2019s only remedy is to pay the deficiency and bring a refund suit in the United States District Court. <em>See Sicari v. C.I.R., </em>136 F.3d 925 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The record reflects that the notice of deficiency for the 2001 tax year was mailed to Salery\u2019s last known Florida address in November 2003, but he did not file his petition challenging that deficiency until December 2005, more than two years later.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the district court correctly dismissed Salery\u2019s petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-17\">. Salary mentions, for the first time on appeal, tax years 2000 and 2002. We find that he waived any arguments regarding the 2000 and 2002 tax years by not raising them in the first instance in the Tax Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">. The address listed on the notice of deficiency, sent by certified mail, is the same address indicated on Salery's pleadings in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
