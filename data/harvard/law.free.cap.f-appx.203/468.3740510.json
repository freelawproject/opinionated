Merritt seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2000) motions and his motions for reconsideration of the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. Because the motions sought to attack sentences in two criminal proceedings, the district court recorded the motions in two separate cases, but dealt with them in an identical manner. The district court docketed Merritt\u2019s notice of appeal in both cases, and the two appeals from identical district court orders have been consolidated in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-25\">The orders denying the \u00a7 2255 motion and the motions for reconsideration are not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Merritt has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss this portion of the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Regarding the denial of Merritt\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion, we have reviewed the record and found no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the relevant portion of the district court\u2019s order for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Merritt, </em>No. 4:97-cr-00043; 4:01-cv-00016; 4:98-er-0006; 4:01-cv-00015 (E.D.Va. Mar. 22 &amp; Apr. 27, 2006). We deny Merritt\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
