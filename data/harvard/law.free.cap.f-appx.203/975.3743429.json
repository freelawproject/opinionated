We remanded Williams\u2019s case to the district court for a determination of excusable neglect or good cause for Williams\u2019s untimely filing of his notice of appeal, and the district court found that Williams\u2019s failure to file a timely notice of appeal was the result of excusable neglect and granted the motion for extension of time. Accordingly, we proceed to consider the merits of Williams\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Williams argues that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), provided grounds for reducing his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because <em>Booker </em>held that the mandatory sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional. However, in <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1643, 164 L.Ed.2d 351 (2006), we held that because <em>Booker </em>is a Supreme Court decision and not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment created by the Sentencing Commission, <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">Having reviewed the record, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
