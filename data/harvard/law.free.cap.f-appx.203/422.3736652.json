Troy was also convicted of one count of distribution of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). On appeal, counsel have filed an Anders<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brief, in which they state there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggest that the district court erred in enhancing Timothy\u2019s offense level for his role in the offense and for possession of a dangerous weapon, and erred in enhancing Troy\u2019s offense level for obstruction of justice by intimidating witnesses. Timothy and Troy each filed a pro se supplemental brief. The Government declined to file a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">In determining the sentencing range for Timothy under the Sentencing Guidelines,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the probation officer attributed a total of 7848.85 grams of crack cocaine and 39,000 grams of powder cocaine, which converted to a marijuana equivalency of 164,777 kilograms. This quantity yielded a base offense level of thirty-eight pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). The probation officer also recommended a two-level enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) because Timothy possessed a dangerous weapon in connection with the offense, and a four-level enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) because Timothy was an organizer or leader of an extensive criminal enterprise that involved five or more participants. The total offense level of forty-four was reduced to forty-three, the maximum recognized in the Guidelines. Timothy\u2019s prior criminal activity resulted in a total of seventeen criminal history points, placing him in criminal history category VI, which was also mandated by his career offender status. The resulting sentencing range based on a total offense level of forty-three and criminal history category VI was life imprisonment. At sentencing, the district court overruled Timothy\u2019s objections to the enhancements and imposed a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">In determining the sentencing range for Troy, the probation officer attributed a total of 1991.1 grams of crack cocaine and 627.575 grams of powder cocaine, which converted to a marijuana equivalency of 39,947.515 kilograms. This quantity yielded a base offense level of thirty-eight pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). The probation officer also recommended a two-level enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 because Troy intimidated witnesses. Troy\u2019s prior criminal activity resulted in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>total of nine criminal history points, placing him in criminal history category IV. The resulting sentencing range based on a total offense level of forty and criminal history category IV was 860 months to life imprisonment. The district court rejected Troy\u2019s objections and sentenced him to 360 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Counsel first suggests that the district court erred in enhancing Timothy\u2019s offense level for a leadership role in the offense and for possession of a dangerous weapon. A district court\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 224 (4th Cir.2002). A four-level adjustment for role in the offense is appropriate when \u201cthe defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3131.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">An enhancement for an aggravating role requires, at a minimum, that \u201cthe defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.2); <em>United States v. Harriott, </em>976 F.2d 198, 200 (4th Cir.1992) (two-level enhancement appropriate where defendant directed activities of one other person); <em>United States v. Kincaid, </em>964 F.2d 325, 329 (4th Cir.1992) (same). Factors distinguishing a leadership or organizational role from lesser roles include exercise of decision making authority, the nature of the participation in the offense, recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the proceeds, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised. USSG \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.4). In this case, the district court noted these factors and concluded that the enhancement was justified by the evidence at trial. Our review of the record convinces us that the district court\u2019s decision to impose the four-level enhancement was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The Guidelines provide for a two-level increase in a defendant\u2019s base offense level \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Application Note 3 of the Commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1 states that \u201c[t]he adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), comment. (n.3). \u201cIn order to prove that a weapon was present, the Government need show only that the weapon was possessed during the relevant illegal drug activity.\u201d <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001). The district court imposed the enhancement based on testimony that Timothy held a knife to the throat of a person he apparently suspected of stealing a quantity of cocaine. We conclude that the district court did not err in imposing this enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Counsel next asserts that the district court erred in enhancing Troy\u2019s offense level for obstruction of justice. We review a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant obstructed justice for dear error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 560 (4th Cir.2005). The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f(A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">\u201c[Tjhreatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully influencing a co-defendant, witness, or juror, directly or indirectly, or attempting to do so\u201d is specifical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>ly listed as an example of conduct for which the enhancement is appropriate. USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(a)). \u201cTo apply the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, the district court must find that a defendant consciously act[ed] with the purpose of obstructing justice.\u201d <em>United, States v. Stewart, </em>256 F.3d 231, 253 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court imposed the enhancement based on testimony that Troy threatened a co-defendant and coerced him into signing a letter exonerating Troy, and attempted to verbally intimidate other witnesses. Our review of the record demonstrates that the facts supporting the enhancement were sufficiently established.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We have considered the arguments asserted in the pro se briefs submitted by Timothy and Troy and find them to be without merit. We therefore affirm the convictions and sentences. We deny Troy\u2019s motion to proceed pro se as moot. This court requires that counsel inform their client, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\">. <em>Anders v.
