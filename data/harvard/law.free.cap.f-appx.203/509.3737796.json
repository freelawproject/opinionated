Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Chen fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Chen\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum\u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Chen fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">With respect to the Board\u2019s affirmance of the immigration judge\u2019s finding regarding relief under the Convention Against Torture, Chen failed to establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We find no merit in Chen\u2019s argument that the Board abused its discretion by failing to consider additional evidence regarding country conditions that he submitted on appeal, or remand to the immigration judge for further factfinding, because the additional evidence clearly could have been presented before the immigration judge in the first instance. Further, we reject Chen\u2019s argument that \u201ca remand for additional investigation regarding eligibility would be inappropriate,\u201d <em>He v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 593, 603 (9th Cir.2003), because Chen\u2019s case did not turn \u201centirely on his credibility\u201d as it did in <em>He. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-11\">. Chen did not petition this court for review of the Board\u2019s decision within thirty days as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000). Instead, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000) with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 15, 2004. That petition was accompanied by a motion for a stay of removal during the pen-dency of the \u00a7 2241 petition. The district court properly transferred Chen\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition to this court pursuant to the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, which was signed into law on May 11, 2005. This court addresses Chen\u2019s claims \"as if they were presented ... in the first instance as a petition for review.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 341, 344 (3d Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-24\">. Chen also argues that the immigration judge did not substantiate an adverse credibility finding, but our review of the record indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>cates that the immigration judge based her decision on a finding that Chen did not meet his burden of proof, rather than an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
