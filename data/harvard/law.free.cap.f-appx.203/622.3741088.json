Alternatively, he contends that the factual basis for his plea was insufficient because the mere movement of a firearm from one state or country to another at some undetermined time in the past does not constitute a substantial effect on interstate or foreign commerce. Garcia raises these arguments solely to preserve them for possible Supreme Court review. As he acknowledges, they are foreclosed by existing Fifth Circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Guidry, </em>406 F.3d 314, 318-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 190, 163 L.Ed.2d 198 (2005); <em>United States v.
