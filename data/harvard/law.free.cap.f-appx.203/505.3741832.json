(\u201cLMOS\u201d), filed suit against LMOS, alleging: <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1) violation of Cal. Lab.Code Ann. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>\u00a7 970 (West 2003);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) promissory fraud; (3) intentional concealment and omission of known material facts; (4) negligent misrepresentation; (5) breach of contract; (6) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (7) violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (2000) (\u201cTitle VU\u201d); and (8) violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 to 634 (2000) (\u201cADEA\u201d). The jury found for LMOS on all claims. The district court denied Lee\u2019s motion for new trial, and Lee appeals, giving rise to No. 05-1959.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> LMOS cross-appeals, challenging the district court\u2019s application of choice of law principles, giving rise to No. 05-1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">First, Lee asserts that the district court erred by issuing narrower jury instructions than those requested by Lee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In diversity cases, the content of jury instructions is governed by state law, while the form of the instructions is governed by federal law. <em>Hardin v. Ski Venture, Inc., </em>50 F.3d 1291, 1293 (4th Cir.1995). We review the jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>Chaudhry v. Gallerizzo, </em>174 F.3d 394, 408 (4th Cir.1999). On review, jury instructions must be viewed as a whole, and even where jury instructions are flawed, there can be no reversal unless the error seriously prejudiced the plaintiffs case. <em>Hardin, </em>50 F.3d at 1294, 1296. We have carefully reviewed the jury instructions in this case in light of the evidence presented at trial, and we find no reversible error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">Lee next challenges a clarifying instruction <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> given in response to a question from the jury during deliberations. We review a district court\u2019s decision to respond to a jury\u2019s question, and the form of that response, for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>62 F.3d 641, 646 (4th Cir.1995). \u201c[I] n responding to a jury\u2019s request for clarification on a charge, the district court\u2019s duty is simply to respond to the jury\u2019s apparent source of confusion fairly and accurately without creating prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An error requires reversal only if it is prejudicial in the context of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. United Med. &amp; Surgical Supply Corp., </em>989 F.2d 1390, 1406-07 (4th Cir.1993). We conclude that the district court\u2019s response in this case was fair and accurate, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>certainly not prejudicial when judged on the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Lee also challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a) motion for a new trial. \u201c[T]he granting or refusing of a new trial is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the trial judge, and ... his action thereon is not reviewable upon appeal, save in the most exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Yeatts, </em>122 F.2d 350, 354 (4th Cir.1941). Lee has offered no exceptional circumstances that would warrant a finding that the trial court abused its discretion. Thus, there was no error in denying the motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">We affirm the judgment of the district court. In light of this decision, we have no occasion to address the claim presented in LMOS\u2019s cross-appeal. We dispense -with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-13\">. Lee filed suit both in California (alleging the tort and contract claims) and in North Car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>olina (alleging the discrimination claims). The California action was transferred to the Eastern District of North Carolina, and the cases were consolidated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-6\">. A separate cause of action for violation of California public policy did not survive summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">. The Title VII and ADEA claims are not raised in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\">. The district court\u2019s instructions focused on Lee\u2019s allegations in his complaint that LMOS promised a five-year term of employment and agreed to an \"in good faith\u201d provision in its offer letter that dictated the terms of Lee\u2019s employment were not \"at will.\u201d Lee claims the district court\u2019s instructions gave short shrift to evidence of alleged misrepresentations, omissions, and false promises concem-ing the nature of the program for which he was hired, which was subject to a contract between LMOS and the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b534-14\">. Similarly, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion by issuing instructions on at-will employment and mitigation of damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b534-15\">. After hearing argument from counsel for both parties, the district court decided to respond to the jury with the direction to resolve its question \"by consideration of all the instructions I have previously given to you.\u201d The district court reasoned that because it could not discern the context of the jury\u2019s question, its response that the jury consider the instructions it had been given was best calculated to minimize the possibility of confusing the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\">. Even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Lee, the non-moving party, we find meritless Lee's contention that the district court erred in granting LMOS\u2019s Fed. R.Civ.P. 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to the availability of punitive damages on the California tort claims. <em>See Bryte ex rel. Bryte v. Am. Household, Inc., </em>429 F.3d 469, 479-80 (4th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2026, 164 L.Ed.2d 781 (2006); Cal. Civ.Code Ann. \u00a7 3294 (West 2003) (explicating standard upon which punitive damages may be attained).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
