We dismiss Morris\u2019 appeal of the district court\u2019s March 15, 2006 order for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was untimely. Morris\u2019 notice of appeal was filed on July 14, 2006, which was beyond the thirty-day appeal period. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">Regarding Morris\u2019 appeal of the district court\u2019s June 28, 2006 order, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Morris v. Henrico County Pub. Schs., </em>No. 3:06-cv-00051-REP (E.D. Va. June 28, 2006). We deny Morris\u2019 motion to appoint counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
