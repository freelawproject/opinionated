Upon review of the record, we find that none of the named defendants are subject to liability under \u00a7 1983, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-20\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-21\">Moore is currently serving a life sentence for a multiple count sexual battery conviction. He alleges that he was accused of the criminal act in 1992, and the accusation was investigated and deemed unfounded. He alleged that he was prosecuted on the basis of these allegations a year later, and sentenced to probation and a monetary fine following a guilty plea. He claims that in 2001 he was again prosecuted on the basis of the same allegations by the state\u2019s attorney, and that his public defenders refused to challenge the validity of the second prosecution at trial and on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Moore brought his claims under \u00a7 1983 against the following defendants: (1) Linda Bargstedt, mother of Moore\u2019s victim; (2) Michael Flippo, Moore\u2019s public defender at his criminal trial; (3) Kevin Holtz, Moore\u2019s public defender on direct appeal; and (4) Lawson Lamar, Florida Assistant State\u2019s Attorney. He claims that these individuals were involved in the denial of his constitutional rights and unlawful prosecution. His claims were dismissed, <em>sua sponte, </em>by the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) on the grounds that the complaint was frivolous and failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">We review frivolity dismissals, pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), for abuse of discretion. <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001). A claim is frivolous if it is \u201cwithout arguable merit either in law or fact\u201d. <em>Id. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1347 (11th Cir. 2004). In evaluating <em>pro se </em>claims, we construe the pleadings liberally and hold them to a less stringent standard than those drafted by attorneys. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">To successfully raise a \u00a7 1983 claim, Moore was required to show that he \u201cwas deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). For \u00a7 1983 purposes, a private person generally acts \u2018under color of state law' only when engaged in a conspiracy with state officials. <em>Tower v. Glover, </em>467 U.S. 914, 920, 104 S.Ct. 2820, 2824, 81 L.Ed.2d 758 (1984). Moore bases his claim against Linda Bargstedt, a private person, on the fact that she made repeated complaints about him to the police. Since he does not allege the existence of such a conspiracy, he fails to raise a valid \u00a7 1983 claim against her and we find that it was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Similarly, a state-appointed public defender \u201cdoes not act under color of state law when performing a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding.\u201d Polk <em>County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 453, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981). The decision by Moore\u2019s trial and appellate counsel not to challenge the second prosecution represents the exercise of their independent professional judgment. Such a decision, even when incorrectly made, can not be considered an action under color of state law. We therefore find that the district court made no error in dismissing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Finally, a prosecutor in a criminal proceeding is entitled to absolute immunity from \u00a7 1983 suits when acting within the scope of his prosecutorial duties. <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 427, 96 S.Ct. 984, 993, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). As Lawson Lamar, Moore\u2019s prosecutor, can not be held liable under \u00a7 1983 for his decision to initiate and prosecute the case against Moore, we agree with the district court that Moore\u2019s lacks a viable claim. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
