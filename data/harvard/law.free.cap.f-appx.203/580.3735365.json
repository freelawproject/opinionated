For the first time on appeal, he argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>district court erred by assessing separate criminal history points for his prior sentences for sexual assault of a child and possession of a controlled substance. As the Government concedes, those two sentences are related for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) because they occurred on the same occasion. <em>See United States v. Moreno-Arredondo, 255 </em>F.3d 198, 205 (5th Cir. 2001); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>961 F.2d 1188, 1189 (5th Cir.1992). Because the correct advisory guideline range is less than the sentence imposed, we vacate Reyes-Morales\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 275 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Reyes-Morales\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Reyes-Morales contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Reyes-Morales properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM Reyes-Morales\u2019s conviction, but we VACATE his sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
