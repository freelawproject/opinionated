Wright has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Wright filed a response in which he alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to fairly evaluate the merits of this issue. Therefore, it is not reviewable on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Our independent review of counsel\u2019s brief, Wright\u2019s response, and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b676-36\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, 'the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
