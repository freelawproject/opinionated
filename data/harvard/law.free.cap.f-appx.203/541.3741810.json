On appeal, she challenges the district court\u2019s loss calculation under the Sentencing Guidelines. She also asserts that her sentence was unreasonably harsh. We vacate the loss determination and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Wilson was employed by Branch Banking and Trust (\u201cBB <em>&amp; </em>T\u201d) as a relationship banker who assisted customers with Certificate of Deposit (\u201cCD\u201d) accounts. After two customers complained that money had been removed from their CD accounts without permission, BB &amp; T conducted an investigation which showed that Wilson had conducted twenty-eight improper transactions with customers\u2019 CD accounts, involving a total of $58,760.39. Of that amount, $40,560.39 came from withdrawals, while $18,200 constituted deposits into customer accounts. The amount of money Wilson actually removed from the accounts for her personal use was $22,360.59. Wilson stated that, after embezzling that amount of money, she made fraudulent transfers from one CD account to another in order to \u201cfix\u201d the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">At sentencing, Wilson argued for a loss amount of $22,360.59, representing the amount removed from BB &amp; T. The district court overruled the objection, stating that \u201cthe money was used to perpetrate the fraud. It was part of the money that was put at risk ... I think we ought to measure this by the entire sum of money that was misappropriated, regardless of whether some of it was placed in another depositor\u2019s account in an attempt to cover it up.\u201d Thus, the court calculated the loss to be $40,560.39, representing all of the withdrawals, including the withdrawals that were transferred into other customers\u2019 accounts. The court imposed a sentence of eight months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wilson timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">Because there are no factual disputes in this case, we review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201closs\u201d de novo. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 557 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cLoss\u201d is defined as \u201cthe greater of actual loss or intended loss.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. (n.3(A)). Defendants\u2019 sentences should reflect \u201cthe nature and magnitude of the loss caused or intended ... [Ljoss serves as a measure of the seriousness of the offense and the defendant\u2019s relative culpability.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. (backg\u2019d).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">The district court correctly determined that Wilson should be responsible for all funds she \u201cput at risk.\u201d <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>993 F.2d 1358, 1359 (8th Cir. 1993); <em>United States v. Brach, </em>942 F.2d 141, 143 (2d Cir.1991). However, contrary to the district court\u2019s conclusions, the funds transferred from one account to another were never \u201cat risk.\u201d There is no evidence that any of Wilson\u2019s deposits gave a customer access to more money than had been in their accounts originally. Thus, even if every customer who had benefitted from Wilson\u2019s deposits withdrew all the funds in their accounts, BB &amp; T would still have only suffered a loss of $22,360.59.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Because Wilson never removed more than $22,360.59 from BB &amp; T and because she never intended to remove more than that amount,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court erred in determining that she placed over $40,000 \u201cat risk.\u201d <em>See Johnson, </em>993 F.2d at 1359 (holding that \u201cmisapplied funds\u201d which were never removed from the credit union were never \u201cat risk\u201d and should have been excluded from loss calculation).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Accordingly, we vacate Wilson\u2019s sentence and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We decline to address her second argument concerning the reasonableness of her sentence at this time. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\">. The district court sentenced Wilson at the low end of the guideline range. Had the court adopted Wilson\u2019s argument regarding the loss amount, the guideline range would have been four to ten months imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\">. Wilson essentially removed $22,360.59 from CD accounts for her own use. She then moved $18,200 from <em>other </em>accounts into the pilfered accounts. Thus, the only loss to BB &amp; T was $22,360.59. The remaining withdrawals and deposits merely changed the accounts from which this money was missing, not the amount missing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\">. The Government argues that, even if Wilson did not remove $40,560.39 from BB &amp; T, she intended to do so. There is no evidence to support this conclusion. The PSR states that, after fraudulently obtaining funds that she used for personal expenses, Wilson \u201crealized she had to 'fix\u2019 the situation and began making other fraudulent withdrawals from other customer accounts to replace that which she had taken.\u201d In addition, she voluntarily left her employment with BB &amp; T prior to her crimes being discovered, so there was no intent to inflict any future harm. The Government presented no evidence at the sentencing hearing to contradict these conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b571-24\">. The Government argues that <em>Johnson </em>is no longer good law in light of <em>United States v. Hulshof, </em>23 F.3d 1470 (8th Cir.1994). However, in <em>Hulshof, </em>the funds that were misapplied were actually put at risk. The defendant \u201cimproperly indebted the line of credit of a bank customer ... and improperly credited that amount to the loan accounts of two other bank customers.\u201d Although the bank suffered no actual loss in the end, that was only \u201cbecause of the recovery of the farm economy in 1998, which enabled the defendant to reverse the entries which he had previously made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1471-73.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
