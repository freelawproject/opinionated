Deane seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying her leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismissing her civil action. The district court\u2019s final order was entered on the docket on May 25, 2006. Deane\u2019s notice of appeal was not received by the district court until July 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>2006. Although Deane\u2019s notice of appeal was filed beyond the thirty-day appeal period set forth in Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), she states in her notice of appeal that she did not receive the court\u2019s final order until July 7, 2006. The notice of appeal was filed both within thirty days of the expiration of the appeal period and within seven days of the date Deane asserts she received notice of the district court\u2019s entry of a final order. Thus, Deane\u2019s statement in her notice of appeal may be properly construed as either a motion for an extension of time in which to note an appeal under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or as a motion to reopen the time to note an appeal under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Accordingly, we remand the case to the district court for the limited purpose of determining whether Deane can satisfy the requirements for either an extension of time or a reopening of the appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
