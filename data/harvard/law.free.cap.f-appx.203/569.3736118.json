Pursuant to \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initiated removal proceedings against Daniels based on his convictions for crimes involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-17\">Daniels sought withholding of removal under \u00a7 241(b)(3) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), and under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16, based on alleged persecution in Ghana; Daniels claimed threats had been made against him due to his father\u2019s political views. The immigration judge (IJ) denied Daniels\u2019 request for withholding removal and ordered him removed to Ghana. The IJ\u2019s decision did not address specifically Daniel\u2019s CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-18\">Daniels appealed to the BIA, again seeking withholding of removal under the INA and also asserting the IJ erred in failing to address his CAT claim. The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and rejected Daniels\u2019 CAT claim, finding he \u201cfailed to allege facts which would indicate the applicability of this relief\u2019 and \u201cfailed to allege that he more likely than not would be tortured by, or with the acquiescence of, the government of Ghana\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-19\">Daniels contends he is entitled both to withholding of removal and to relief under CAT. The Government counters that this court lacks jurisdiction because Daniels\u2019 removal was predicated on his commission of crimes involving moral turpitude and does not present constitutional claims or questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-20\">Daniels admits that, pursuant to \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>\u00a7 1182(a) (2) (A) (i)(I), his removal order was based on his commission of crimes involving moral turpitude. Congress has restricted this court from reviewing such removal orders. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (stating \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1182(a)(2) ... of this title\u201d); <em>see also Alwan v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 507, 515 (5th Cir.2004) (applying jurisdictional bar to claims under both the INA and CAT). Therefore, concerning Daniels\u2019 claim that the decisions of the IJ and BIA were not supported by substantial evidence, the petition is DISMISSED IN PART for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Daniels also asserts the BIA erred in failing to address the merits of his CAT claim. This court has jurisdiction to review this question of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Contrary to Daniels\u2019 argument, however, the BIA considered and rejected the CAT claim. Therefore, with respect to this contention, Daniels\u2019 petition is DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b598-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
