Ali contends that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and relief under the CAT because he established that he suffered past persecution and torture and it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted and tortured if he returned to Pakistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">After careful review of the record and the briefs, this court concludes that the BIA\u2019s determination that Ali is not eligible for withholding of removal or relief under the CAT is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903, 906-07 (5th Cir.2002). Therefore, Ali\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b607-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
