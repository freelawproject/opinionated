Norman, Jr., was convicted of wire fraud, transportation of stolen property, engaging in illegal monetary transactions, and money laundering. He was sentenced to a 109-month term of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Norman now appeals the 12-month term of imprisonment imposed following the revocation of his supervised release. Norman argues that the district court reversibly erred because the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>of his ease do not warrant the term of imprisonment imposed in his ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Although the 12-month term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of Norman\u2019s supervised release exceeded the sentencing range indicated by the policy statements in Chapter Seven of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, it was less than the statutory maximum term of imprisonment that the district court could have imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8583(e)(3). Accordingly, Norman\u2019s sentence upon revocation was neither \u201cunreasonable\u201d nor \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006). Norman has not shown error.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b610-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
