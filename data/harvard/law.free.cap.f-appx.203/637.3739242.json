He now appeals the 24-month sentence imposed following the revocation of his term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-25\">Leal argues that the district court imposed a sentence above the statutory maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>mum. He contends that the top of the sentencing guidelines range found applicable by the district court, rather than the statutory maximum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), governs the classification of his underlying felony for purposes of revocation of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">In <em>United States v. Alfaro-Hernandez, </em>453 F.3d 280, 281-82 (5th Cir.2006), the court held that, in determining the statutory maximum penalty that can be imposed upon revocation of supervised release, the felony classification of the defendant\u2019s underlying offense was to be determined by statute and not by the Sentencing Guidelines. Leal acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Alfaro-Hemandez, </em>but he wishes to preserve the argument for possible further Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b665-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
