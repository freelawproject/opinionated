Smith\u2019s motion for supplementation of brief is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-16\">Smith argues that his sentence violated his Sixth Amendment rights as set forth in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was enhanced based upon facts not alleged in the indictment, mentioned in the plea agreement, admitted by him, or proven to a jury. The decision in <em>Booker </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review, and a <em>Booker </em>claim does not satisfy the test for filing a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-21\">For the first time on appeal, Smith argues that his conviction was improper under <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), and that this claim may be brought in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. This newly raised legal claim is not reviewable for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). Smith raised his <em>Richardson </em>claim in this court in his appeal from the denial of his previous \u00a7 2241 petition. We warn Smith that filing future repetitive appeals will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-22\">AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR SUPPLEMENTATION OF BRIEF GRANTED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b627-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
