Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief shows that there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and this appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
