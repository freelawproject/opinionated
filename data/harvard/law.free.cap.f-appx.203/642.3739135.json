She argues pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that (1) a defendant\u2019s knowledge of drug type and drug quantity are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>material elements of the offense of conviction which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury and, therefore, the evidence was insufficient to support her convictions and (2) 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">She correctly concedes that these issues are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Gamez-Gonzalez, </em>319 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir.2003), and <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000), respectively, and she raises them only to preserve their further review by the Supreme Court. We are bound by our precedent absent an intervening Supreme Court decision or a subsequent en banc decision. <em>See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
