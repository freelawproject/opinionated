He was sentenced to 27 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Wheat appeals the sentence imposed following the revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-25\">Citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Wheat complains that the 27-month term of imprisonment imposed for his conviction and the 14-month term of imprisonment imposed for his violation of supervised release exceeded in the aggregate the 33-month total term of imprisonment allowed under the United States Sentencing Guidelines for his initial conviction based on the facts alleged in his indictment and admitted by him. Wheat argues as a result that the district court was authorized to impose no more than a six-month term of imprisonment upon revocation of his supervised release unless the facts pertaining to his release violations were alleged in an indictment and found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Wheat contends that the alleged <em>Booker </em>violation in his case cannot be cured by application of <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial advisory guidelines system because his initial sentence is final and because it would violate due process and ex post facto laws. Wheat\u2019s arguments lack merit. <em>See United States v. Alfaro-Hernandez, </em>453 F.3d 280, 281-82 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 116-19 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The 14-month term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of Wheat\u2019s supervised release did not exceed the statutory maximum term of imprisonment that the district court could have imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Accordingly, Wheat\u2019s sentence upon revocation was neither \u201cunreasonable\u201d nor \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See Hinson, </em>429 F.3d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b609-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
