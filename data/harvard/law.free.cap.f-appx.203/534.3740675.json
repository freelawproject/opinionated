See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b563-21\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b563-22\">George Forba Nwana, a native and citizen of Cameroon, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals affirming the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-23\">In his petition for review, Nwana challenges the determination that he failed to establish his eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Nwana fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-24\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Nwana\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Nwana fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-25\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the finding that Nwana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>failed to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2006). We find that Nwa-na failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
