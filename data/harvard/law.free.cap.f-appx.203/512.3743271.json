On appeal, he argues that the district court improperly gave him six criminal history points for two Michigan convictions: (1) breaking without entering, and (2) receiving and concealing stolen property, which occurred more than fifteen years prior to the commencement of his instant offenses in violation of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(e) (2005). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings concerning sentencing factors for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. France, </em>164 F.3d 203, 209 (4th Cir.1998). We find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Bal-lestero was serving sentences of imprisonment for these two state offenses during the relevant fifteen-year period as discussed in USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.2). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
