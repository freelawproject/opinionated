Hawley argues that there was no res <em>judi-cata </em>bar to his complaint because he lacked a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues in his previous employment discrimination suit, and thus, there had been no \u201cfinal judgment on the merits\u201d of that case. We have reviewed the record and are satisfied that Hawley\u2019s complaint merely restated claims that already had been adjudicated in a previous action and did not properly raise any new causes of action. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
