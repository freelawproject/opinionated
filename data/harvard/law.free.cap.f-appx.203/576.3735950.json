Our examination of the record reveals that the dismissal was in accord with the rules and within the discretion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-23\">For many months the magistrate judge, district judge, and counsel for Lewis Food Town patiently and properly sought to obtain from the appellant information supporting his claim. The Rules of Civil Procedure were followed and appellant was informed of what was required and what consequences could result from failure to comply. Because appellant continued to refuse to comply, Rule 37(b)(2)(C) warrants the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b604-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
