Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000), \u201c[t]he petition for review must be filed not later than thirty days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d This time period is \u201cjurisdictional in nature and must be construed with strict fidelity to [its] terms.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Witherspoon\u2019s petition was filed over four years after the order of removal; thus, his petition is untimely. Because we lack jurisdiction to review the merits of Witherspoon\u2019s appeal, we dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-20\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
