Section 3582(c)(2) allows the court to modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the sentencing commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-26\">Amendment 505, effective November 1, 1994, amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 to estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>lish level 38 as the highest category of the drug quantity table. U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 505. Stewart was sentenced after amendment 505 took effect. Her argument is thus not one cognizable under \u00a7 3582. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The district court did not err in denying Stewart\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion. Because this issue had already been decided adversely to Stewart in the denial of her prior \u00a7 3582(c) motion, this appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir. 1983). Stewart is warned that future challenges to her sentence under amendment 505 will invite the imposition of sanctions against her. Those sanctions could include a monetary penalty and/or limitations on her ability to challenge her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b616-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
