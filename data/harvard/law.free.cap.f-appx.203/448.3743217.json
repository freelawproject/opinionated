Williams of possession of a firearm by a previously convicted felon, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000). The district court sentenced Williams to sixty-three months\u2019 imprisonment under the then-mandatory sentencing guidelines. The sentencing court also imposed an identical alternative sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>tence, pursuant to <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc), <em>vacated, </em>543 U.S. 1097, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005), <em>on remand, </em>405 F.3d 1034 (4th Cir.2005). Williams appeals, contending his sentence violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The Sixth Amendment error in this case, if any, was harmless because the district court imposed an identical alternative sentence in accordance with <em>Hammond. See United States v. Shatley, </em>448 F.3d 264, 267 (4th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s alternative sentence was within the range recommended by the sentencing guidelines, and this court takes the district court at its word when it states it would impose the same sentence under the advisory guideline system. <em>See id. </em>at 267-68. Therefore, we presume the district court properly considered the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), as required by <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-56 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449 (4th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); and <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424 (4th Cir.2006). <em>Shatley, </em>448 F.3d at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Williams\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
