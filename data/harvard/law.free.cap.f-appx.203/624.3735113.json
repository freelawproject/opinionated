She appeals the district court\u2019s denial of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion challenging her sentence. The district court granted a certificate of appealability. Sonnier argues that her sentence was imposed in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and that <em>Booker </em>applies retroactively on collateral review. Sonnier concedes that her argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent, but raises it to preserve further review. In <em>United States v. Gentry, </em>432 F.3d 600, 604 (5th Cir.2005), we held that <em>Booker </em>is not retroactively applicable to initial \u00a7 2255 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
