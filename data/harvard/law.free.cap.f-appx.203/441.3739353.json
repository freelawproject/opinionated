This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The portion of the order denying a temporary restraining order is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. Accordingly, we dismiss that aspect of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">On the other hand, the district court\u2019s denial of a request for a preliminary injunction is immediately appealable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (2000). With respect to the district court\u2019s denial of Cassell\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm this portion of the appeal for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Cassell v. Jagust, </em>No. 5:06-cM)3025-BO (E.D.N.C. Apr. 12, 2006). We also deny all of Cassell\u2019s pending motions for general relief in this court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b470-11\"> The district court\u2019s written order denied only Cassell's motion for a temporary restraining order. However, the district court\u2019s docket sheet indicates the court denied both a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. Cassell appealed from both denials.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
