Sypniewiski argues that the district court erred in enhancing her sentence based on her manufacture of counterfeit federal reserve notes pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.1(b)(2)(A) and (b)(3) (2004). Sypniewiski argues that the enhancement was inapplicable under application note 4, which states that the enhancement does not apply where the items manufactured \u201care so obviously counterfeit that they are unlikely to be accepted even if subjected to only minimal scrutiny.\u201d \u00a7 2B5.1, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-26\">Based on the personal inspection of the notes by the district court judge, the evidence regarding the number of times the bills were successfully and unsuccessfully passed, and the testimony of various witnesses including a Secret Service agent, the district court found that the counterfeit notes were not so obviously counterfeit that they were unlikely to be accepted even if subjected to only minimal scrutiny. The district court\u2019s finding was plausible in light of the record as a whole and thus was not clearly erroneous. <em>United States v.
