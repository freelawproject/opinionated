We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-16\">The NFMA establishes a two-step process for forest planning. <em>See Native Ecosystems Council v. United States Forest Serv., </em>418 F.3d 953, 957 n. 1 (9th Cir.2005). First, USFS develops and maintains a forest plan, or Land Resource Management Plan (\u201cLRMP\u201d), that determines what outputs a national forest shall produce. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604(a); <em>Native Ecosystems Council, </em>418 F.3d at 957 n. 1. Second, USFS implements the LRMP by approv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ing or disapproving site-specific acts such as timber sales that are consistent with the LRMP. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 16040); <em>Native Ecosystems Council, </em>418 F.3d at 957 n. 1. Nothing in the NFMA or the regulations USFS promulgated in 1982 requires site-specific analyses to monetize nontimber resources. 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 219.12(g)(3)(ii) of the 1982 regulations requires \u201cthe expected real-dollar value\u201d of forest outputs to be monetized at the LRMP level, but this requirement does not apply to USFS\u2019s analyses of site-specific acts. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 219.12(a); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 219.4(b)(3) (equating forest plans with LRMPs).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Nor does NEPA require monetization of nontimber resources. NEPA\u2019s mandate to agencies is essentially procedural. <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>435 U.S. 519, 558, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978). Those procedures do not include a requirement that agencies monetize outputs related to different alternatives. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Finally, we fail to find merit in FCC\u2019s claim the district court erred in striking two USFS publications. USFS correctly points out this claim is based on incorrect facts, and FCC agrees there is no dispute as to the contents of the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">FCC\u2019s claim USFS had to monetize non-timber resources in its site-specific timber sale analyses fails. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b102-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
