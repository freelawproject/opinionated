Hall (\u201cHall\u201d) appeals his conviction and sentence following a jury trial for conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute more than 5 kilograms of cocaine and more than 50 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)\u00ae, and (b)(l)(A)(in) and 846. On appeal, Hall argues that the district court erred as a matter of law when it denied his motion to suppress a firearm and money seized during a May 1, 2001, investigatory stop of his vehicle. The investigatory stop occurred after a confidential informant (\u201cCI\u201d) told police that persons in a vehicle matching the description of Hall\u2019s vehicle would be traveling to a particular location to sell drugs. Hall asserted that there was no evidence from which the court could determine whether the CI was reliable, or even if the CI existed, because the officer who testified at the suppression hearing could not identify the CI. Further, the police could not produce the name or any documentation concerning the CI.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-16\">\u201cA district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Zapata, </em>180 F.3d 1237, 1240 (11th Cir.1999). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and review the district court\u2019s application of the law to those facts <em>de novo. Id. </em>These factual findings include the district court\u2019s credibility determinations, to which we will \u201caccord considerable deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir. 2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[A]ll facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below.\u201d <em>United States v. Bervaldi </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cThe individual challenging the search has the burdens of proof and persuasion.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>133 F.3d 1394, 1398 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-17\">The Fourth Amendment provides that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. The Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections extend to \u201cbrief investigatory stops of persons or vehicles.\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>For brief investigatory stops, the Fourth Amendment is satisfied if the police officer has a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to believe that criminal activity \u201cmay be afoot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). \u201cReasonable suspicion\u201d on the part of the officers is more than a hunch and requires at a minimum some objective justification for the investigatory stop. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>68 F.3d 1267, 1271 (11th Cir.1995). When determining whether reasonable suspicion exists, courts must consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the police officer had a \u201cparticularized and objective basis\u201d for suspecting legal wrongdoing. <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Reasonable suspicion, however, does not exist based solely on anonymous telephone tips, absent sufficient corroboration, including whether the informant callers had the ability to predict the defendant\u2019s future actions. <em>Lee, </em>68 F.3d at 1271. For example in <em>Lee, </em>\u201c[t]he fact that the officers found a car precisely matching the caller\u2019s description\u201d is only a presently observable fact. <em>Id. </em>Anyone could have \u201cpredicted\u201d that fact, but the informant caller\u2019s ability to predict future behavior demonstrated inside information. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">We conclude from a review of the record that the totality of the circumstances in this case supports the district court\u2019s finding that the officers conducting the traffic stop had a \u201cparticularized and objective basis\u201d for suspecting legal wrongdoing. The district court did not err in denying Hall\u2019s motion to suppress because (1) the officer at the suppression hearing testified that the Cl was rehable because the Cl had previously made at least three successful controlled drug buys; (2) it was reasonable to conclude that the testifying officer would be unable to recall the identity of the Cl because the suppression hearing took place more than four years after the stop; (3) the Cl provided detailed information about the make, model, color, and license plate number of Hall\u2019s vehicle and accurately described its occupants; (4) the Cl\u2019s information predicted Hall\u2019s future behavior; and (5) law enforcement officers were able to corroborate the information before initiating the stop. Accordingly, we affirm Hall's conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Hall also argues that district court erred in imposing a two-level firearm enhancement for the firearm found in his car at the time of the investigatory stop because Hall did not possess the firearm at the site of any crime, and it was not connected with the offense. Hall further argues that it was clearly improbable that he used the firearm in the offense because he did not know that his co-conspirator left the gun in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s findings of fact when it enhances a defendant\u2019s sentence in cases involving U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and review the application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Gallo, </em>195 F.3d 1278, 1280 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">Section 2Dl.l(b)(l) provides a two-level enhancement \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The enhancement \u201cshould be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3). Once the government has shown that a firearm was present at the site of the charged conduct, \u201c \u2018the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant to show that a connection between the firearm and the offense is clearly improbable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Fields, </em>408 F.3d 1356, 1359 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 221, 163 L.Ed.2d 193 (2005) (quoting <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number><em>States v. Hall, </em>46 F.3d 62, 63 (llth Cir. 1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">In <em>United States v. McClain, </em>252 F.3d 1279, 1288 (llth Cir.2001), we held that a defendant possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d the offense of check counterfeiting when he kept a gun in the vehicle that he used to drive coconspirators to the banks at which they negotiated counterfeit checks. (applying former U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(7)(B)). Similarly, in <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 694-96 (llth Cir.2002), we concluded that the firearms found in the defendant\u2019s car with the counterfeit money were used \u201cin connection with\u201d the counterfeiting offense because the firearm\u2019s presence \u201cprotected the counterfeit money from theft\u201d while the defendants executed the felony, (applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">In the instant case, the district court enhanced Hall\u2019s sentence based on his own possession of the firearm, not his co-conspirator\u2019s possession. First, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Hall possessed a firearm at the site of the charged conduct because (1) one of Hall\u2019s co-conspirators testified that the firearm had been on the console, and, as soon as the patrol car began flashing its blue lights, Hall tried to push the firearm under his seat; (2) the firearm was found in Hall\u2019s vehicle, which he used to deliver drugs that same day; and (3) the money seized diming the investigatory stop was proceeds from drug sales. Accordingly, we are persuaded that the fact that Hall had a firearm in his vehicle, which he had used to deliver drugs and collect the proceeds that same day, is sufficient to show his possession of the firearm at the site of the charged conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Second, the burden then shifted to Hall to establish that it was clearly improbable that the firearm was connected to his drug sales earlier in the day. Although Hall claims that he did not know that the gun was in the vehicle, the court did not clearly err in discrediting this assertion because (1) Hall knew that the gun was in his car before he was stopped by the police because Hall placed the gun under his seat when the police stopped his car; (2) officers on the scene confirmed that they saw Hall making movements as if he was placing something under his seat; and (3) even if Hall\u2019s co-conspirator left the gun in the vehicle earlier in the day, Hall did not establish that it was clearly improbable that the gun had been in the vehicle when Hall was selling drugs earlier in the day. Accordingly, Hall did not meet his burden of showing that it was clearly improbable that the gun was connected with his drug trafficking activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Hall\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
