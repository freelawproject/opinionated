Because the petition for review is timely-only as to the December 23, 2005, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>order, we lack jurisdiction to address Ok-ogwu\u2019s arguments concerning the merits of the order of removal. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). We also lack jurisdiction to consider Okogwu\u2019s request for discretionary cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(b)(a) because he has not exhausted administrative remedies as to this issue. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Okogwu has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. <em>Manzano-Garcia v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 462, 469 (5th Cir.2005). He has not identified any \u201cextraordinary or unique circumstances\u201d that would explain the delay in delivery or why he could not mail the motion to reopen to the BIA at an earlier date. He has failed to show that he warrants tolling of the limitation period for filing the motion with the BIA. <em>Zhong Guang Sun v. United States, </em>421 F.3d 105, 110-11 (2nd Cir.2005). We note that the \u201cmailbox rule\u201d does not apply to filings in administrative agency proceedings. <em>Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 112 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b674-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
