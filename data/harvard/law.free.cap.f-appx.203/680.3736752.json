He argues that the district court\u2019s determination that it was bound to impose the statutory mandatory minimum sentence was plain error and an incorrect application of the Guidelines in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Hernandez-Losoya did not raise this issue in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631-32, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Hernandez-Losoya has not shown that <em>Booker </em>rendered the application of the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision or the statutory mandatory minimum sentences in \u00a7 841 discretionary. He has not shown that the sentencing judge would have reached a significantly different result under an advisory sentencing scheme. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Accordingly, Hernandez-Losoya has not shown that the district court committed error, much less plain error, by sentencing him to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence or by declining to apply the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision when he failed to meet the criteria. <em>See Cotton, </em>535 U.S. at 631-32, 122 S.Ct. 1781.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b709-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
