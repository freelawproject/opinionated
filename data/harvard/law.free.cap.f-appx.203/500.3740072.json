Lunardi petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of his requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because the Board affirmed under its streamlined process, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2006), the immigration judge\u2019s decision is the final agency determination. <em>See Camara, v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 366 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Lunardi challenges the immigration judge\u2019s determination that he failed to establish his eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of an adverse eligibility determination, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Lunardi fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">Similarly, as Lunardi does not qualify for asylum, he is also ineligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum\u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-17\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b529-11\"> Lunardi does not challenge the Board\u2019s denial of his application for protection under the Convention Against Torture. Therefore, this claim is abandoned. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
