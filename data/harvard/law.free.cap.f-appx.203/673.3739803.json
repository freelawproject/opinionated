Perez argues that the district court erred by imposing a 16-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based upon his Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation. As Perez concedes, his argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Valdez-Maltos, </em>443 F.3d 910, 911 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>2006 WL 2094539 (U.S. Oct.2, 2006) (No. 06-5473); <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 455-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Perez also challenges, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than as elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This issue is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Perez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Perez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b701-40\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
