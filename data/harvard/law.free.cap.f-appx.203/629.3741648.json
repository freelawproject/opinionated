Jendrzey appeals his conviction, arguing that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional because it does not require a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Alternatively, he contends that evidence of mere movement of the ammunition across state lines is insufficient to establish a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Jendrzey concedes that his arguments are foreclosed, but he raises them to preserve additional review.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-22\">The \u201cconstitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) is not open to question.\u201d <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 517 (5th Cir. 2001). Evidence that a firearm or ammunition has traveled in interstate commerce at some point in the past is sufficient to support a conviction under \u00a7 922(g), even if the defendant possessed the firearm or ammunition entirely intrastate. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>310 F.3d 787, 788-89 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v.
