Zagal contends that his Minnesota conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance is a misdemeanor under federal law and should not have been treated as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) and that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-22\">Zagal\u2019s \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) argument is unavailing in light of our precedent. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312-13 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997). Zagal argues that our precedent is inconsistent with <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943). Having preceded <em>HinojosaLopez, </em>however, <em>Jerome </em>is not \u201can intervening Supreme Court case explicitly or implicitly overruling that prior precedent.\u201d <em>See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-23\">Zagal\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Athough Zagal contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Zagal properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b626-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
