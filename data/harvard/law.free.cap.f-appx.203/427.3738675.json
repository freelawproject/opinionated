On appeal he alleges that his guilty plea is invalid because his interpreter was not certified under the Court Interpreters Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1827-28 (West 1994 &amp; Supp.2006). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">Benitez-Arzate did not object to the non-certification of his Spanish interpreter. Indeed, Benitez-Arzate chose to use the services of the very interpreter of whom he now complains in lieu of the court-certified interpreter originally provided to him by the court and used at his arraignment. We find no plain error in the district court\u2019s decision to allow Benitez-Ar-zate to use the services of the interpreter obtained by his defense counsel. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>981 F.2d 199, 201 (5th Cir. 1992) (providing review standard for claim of an uncertified interpreter under the Court Interpreters Act); <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>339 F.3d 725, 728-29 (8th Cir. 2003) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
