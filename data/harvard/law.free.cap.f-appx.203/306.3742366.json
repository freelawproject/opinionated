Issues not argued on appeal are deemed waived. <em>See United States v. Curtis, </em>380 F.3d 1308, 1310 (11th Cir.2004) (discussing longstanding rule in this circuit that issues not raised in a party\u2019s initial brief on appeal are deemed waived), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 418, 163 L.Ed.2d 319 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of trial continuances for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Bowe, </em>221 F.3d 1183, 1189 (11th Cir.2000). We also review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for leave to amend a complaint for an abuse of discretion. Car<em>ruthers v. BSA Advertising, Inc., </em>357 F.3d 1213, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Assuming we have jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s order filed on October 18, 2005, which denied Barfield\u2019s motion to continue and motion for leave to amend, we affirm that order because we conclude from the record that the district court did not abuse its discretion in its rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
