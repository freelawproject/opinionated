The district court determined, based on an offense level of 13 and a criminal history category of TV, that Gamez\u2019s Guideline imprisonment range was 24-30 months. The district court departed upward 11 months pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, finding that Gamez\u2019s criminal history was substantially underrepresented and was more comparable to that of a defendant with a criminal history category of VI. Gamez argues that the departure was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">This court reviews upward departures for reasonableness, which entails review of the district court\u2019s decision to depart and the extent of the departure for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2954, 165 L.Ed.2d 975 (2006). The district court here determined that Gamez\u2019s five prior immigration-related adjudications and multiple deportations had not deterred him from illegally entering the country and stated that the departure was an attempt to deter future recidivism. The sentencing transcript reflects that the district court also considered the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors in reaching its decision. The district court did not abuse its discretion in departing, as the sentence advanced the objectives set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and was justified on the facts of the case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Gamez next argues that \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors is unconstitutional. This constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Gamez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Gamez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b706-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
