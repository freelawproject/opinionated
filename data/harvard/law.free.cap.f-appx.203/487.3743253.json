Sealey appeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred in applying a cross reference to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2A2.1(a)(2) (2005) (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder), rather than to USSG \u00a7 2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), and in refusing to depart downward based on the victim\u2019s conduct, USSG \u00a7 5K2.10, p.s. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-15\">In October 2004, Sealey and his friend, Charles Cribb, went to the home of Terrance Ford because they believed Ford had acquired drugs that had been stolen from Sealey. When they confronted Ford outside his house and asked him to come with them, Ford displayed a knife and refused to go with them. A few days later, Sealey and Cribb were at a club when Ford stopped there. Sealey approached Ford in the parking lot, and an argument followed during which Ford drew a .22 caliber pistol. Sealey retreated to his vehicle. Cribb got a .22 caliber rifle out of the trunk of Sealey\u2019s vehicle and handed it to Sealey, who fired repeatedly at Ford and hit him in the abdomen, buttocks, right hand, left wrist, and right thigh.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ford was taken to the hospital, where he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>underwent surgery for serious abdominal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The guideline applicable to the offense of conviction was USSG \u00a7 2K2.1. However, the probation officer recommended application of the cross reference in \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l), which directs that, under USSG \u00a7 2X1.1, when the firearm was used in connection with an attempt, the base offense level and adjustments for the intended offense should be used if the resulting offense level is higher. The probation officer applied USSG \u00a7 2A2.1 (Attempted Murder). Under \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(2), the base offense level was 27. The probation officer added a four-level enhancement under subsection (b)(1)(A) because the victim sustained permanent or life-threatening injuries. This calculation resulted in an adjusted offense level of 31. With a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, the final offense level was 28.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sealey was in criminal history category III, which gave him a recommended advisory guideline range of 97-121 months, reduced to 97-120 months because the statutory maximum for the \u00a7 922(g) offense was ten years. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Sealey objected to application of the cross reference to \u00a7 2A2.1. At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel argued that the cross reference should be to the guideline for aggravated assault because Ford had displayed a gun first. The district court determined that the uncontested facts established malice aforethought on Sealey\u2019s part, and an intent to commit murder. The court then decided that it would not depart downward based on Ford\u2019s conduct, as Sealey requested, but that it would consider the possibility that Ford\u2019s conduct might have contributed, although not significantly, to provoking Sea-ley\u2019s attempted murder of Ford. After considering the advisory guidelines and the factors set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), the court imposed the minimum guideline sentence of ninety-seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">On appeal, Sealey argues that the district court erred by making a cross reference to the guideline for attempted murder, \u00a7 2A2.1, instead of to the guideline for aggravated assault, \u00a7 2A2.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">When the facts are not contested, the issue is a legal one and our review is de novo. <em>United States v. Butner, </em>277 F.3d 481, 488 (4th Cir.2002). Sealey argues that the cross reference to the guideline for attempted murder was error because there was no evidence that he intended to kill Ford apart from his prior confrontation with Ford over the missing drugs and the number of shots he fired at Ford.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He contends that the only reasonable inference is that he acted in response to Ford\u2019s display of a firearm. He relies on two cases where the aggravated assault guideline was applied even though, in his view, the evidence established actual malice. In <em>United States v. Terry, </em>86 F.3d 353 (4th Cir.1996), two co-defendants were convicted of the assimilated Virginia crime of shooting into an occupied vehicle. The victim was not injured, but his vehicle sustained considerable damage. <em>Id. </em>at 355. The issue the defendants raised on appeal was whether the court should have applied USSG \u00a7 2B1.3(a), the guideline for property damage or destruction. <em>Terry </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>thus provides no guidance in this case. Sealey also relies on dicta in <em>United States v. Goodman, </em>No. 93-5821, 1995 WL 58558 (4th Cir. Feb. 14, 1995) (unpublished). The case has no precedential value and would not be helpful if it did, as it does not establish that \u00a7 2A2.2 should have been applied in Sealey\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Murder is defined in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1111 (West Supp.2006) as \u201cthe unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.\u201d To show that malice is present, the government is not required to show an intent to kill or injure. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>342 F.3d 350, 356 (4th Cir.2003) (citing <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>739 F.2d 945, 947 (4th Cir.1984)). Instead, \u201cmalice aforethought may be established by evidence of conduct which is reckless and wanton and a gross deviation from a reasonable standard of care, of such a nature that a jury is warranted in inferring that defendant was aware of a serious risk of death or serious bodily harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In this case, Sealey\u2019s conduct in shooting Ford multiple times was at best reckless and wanton, and demonstrated a gross deviation from a reasonable standard of care. The district court did not err in inferring that Sealey was aware that his conduct created a serious risk that Ford would be killed, and in therefore applying the cross reference to \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\">. Sealey also contested the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward, but in a letter to this court, has abandoned the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-16\">. According to the presentence report, Sealey fired at Ford at least eleven times.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b517-7\">. Had the cross reference not been applied, the final offense level would have been 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\">. He also suggests that the government mistakenly misrepresented the facts by stating that Sealey went to the club looking for Ford. Regardless of whether the government was clear about the sequence of events, the district court reviewed the presentence report carefully, and stated the facts accurately in making its ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
