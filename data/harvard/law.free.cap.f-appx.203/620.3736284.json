He argues that the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), is unconstitutional as applied because the statute requires a substantial effect on interstate commerce and the factual basis for his plea established only that the firearm traveled in interstate commerce at some point in the past. Solomon concedes that his constitutional challenge is foreclosed by circuit precedent, and he raises it only to preserve its further review by the Supreme Court. We have indeed held that \u201cthe 3 of \u00a7 922(g) is not open to question,\u201d <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), and, additionally, that the Government need only establish that the firearm was manufactured out of state to satisfy the interstate commerce element of the offense. <em>See United States v. Guidry, </em>406 F.3d 314, 318-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 190, 163 L.Ed.2d 198 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b648-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
