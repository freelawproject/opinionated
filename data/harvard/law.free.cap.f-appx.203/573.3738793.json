He contends that reversible error resulted when the government, while cross-examining him, referred to out-of-court statements of a co-conspirator who was not present to testify. Pineda objected to the line of questioning, and the district court sustained his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Assuming without deciding that the questioning was improper, we conclude that \u201cthe evidence as a whole before the jury was sufficiently convincing of guilt as to overcome any error committed by the government during its cross-examination.\u201d <em>See United, States v. Smith-Bowman, </em>76 F.3d 634, 636-37 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Pepper, </em>51 F.3d 469, 472 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, any error resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination was harmless. Pineda\u2019s conviction and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
