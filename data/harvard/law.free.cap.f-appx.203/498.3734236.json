Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 366 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-20\">Murenzi challenges the Board\u2019s finding that his testimony was not credible, and that he otherwise failed to meet his burden of proof to qualify for asylum. We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted), and uphold credibility determinations if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Tew-abe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding and the ruling that Murenzi failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution as necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zaca-rias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b526-13\">As Murenzi's brief raised no claims concerning the denial of withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture, any such claims are waived. <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
