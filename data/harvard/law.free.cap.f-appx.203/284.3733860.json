Because substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s decision, we DENY Cardoza\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b313-20\">Cardoza entered the United States at Miami, Florida, on 6 October 2002. <em>See </em>AR at 266. Cardoza admitted to the Immigration and Naturalization Service<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u201cINS\u201d) that she was a citizen and native of Colombia and that she had come to the U.S. to apply for asylum. <em>Id. </em>at 273-74. She also admitted that she had overstayed her visitor\u2019s visa the last time she had been in the country, and that she had paid 200,000 Colombian pesos to get a fraudulent back-dated stamp on her passport to hide this fact. <em>Id. </em>at 276. She stated that she left Colombia because the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) guerillas had been threatening to kill her family since 1998, and she feared returning to Colombia. <em>Id. </em>at 276, 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-21\">At a credible fear interview, Cardoza testified that she \u201cwas involved with\u201d the Liberal Party in Colombia, that she \u201chelp[ed] peasants and farmers in the rural areas with various activities[,] in-cludfing] farming, education, etc.,\u201d and that the FARC threatened to harm her if she continued to help the farmers. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>268. She further testified that her husband was a police officer, and that the FARC also wanted to harm her and her husband \u201cbecause he refused to provide them with information about police operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, she stated that in December 1998, \u201cseveral men went to [her] house\u201d looking for her and her husband and beat her mother. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The INS subsequently issued a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) to Cardoza. <em>Id. </em>at 287-88. The NTA charged that Cardoza was removable pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), as \u201can alien who, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, [sought to procure] admission into the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The NTA also charged that she was inadmissible pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(B)(i)(II), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(B)(i)(II), \u201cbecause [she was] a nonimmigrant who [was] not in possession of a valid nonimmigrant visa or border crossing identification card at the time of application for admission into the United States.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">On 10 June 2003, Cardoza filed an application for asylum and for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 216-17. She sought asylum based on her political opinion and her membership in a particular social group. <em>Id. </em>at 216-20. Her asylum application contained many of the same allegations Cardoza made in her credible fear interview, including persecution by the FARC due to her political activity in the Liberal Party and her husband\u2019s employment as a police officer. <em>Id. </em>She also stated that she was persecuted because her daughter was born in the United States, and the FARC had designated her daughter a military target, as they had all U.S. citizens. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">At her removal hearing, Cardoza admitted to proper service and receipt of the NTA and admitted all but one of the allegations and the second charge. <em>Id. </em>at 72-73. The IJ found that the charge Cardoza did not concede was true \u201cbased on her admissions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73. Cardoza also submitted copies of a number of documents, including her membership card in the Liberal Party, dated 30 March 2000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 161-62. However, the IJ found that this evidence was untimely under the immigration court\u2019s local rules, and did not admit the documents into evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 89-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Cardoza testified that in 1990, while living in Bogota, she joined the Liberal Party. <em>Id. </em>at 104-05. After that, she visited Tolima every two or three weeks. <em>Id. </em>at 105. There she \u201cparticipated in ... political activities, ... checking the IDs of the peasants and telling them where they had to go to vote\u201d and organizing education for \u201cthe peasants\u201d in \u201cagricultural techniques for better farming.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">In response to questions regarding when the threats from the FARC began, Cardo-za stated the threats \u201c[had] always been there more or less since 1986.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106. However, when questioned again she stated that they began in 1998. <em>Id. </em>at 108. When this discrepancy was pointed out to her, she stated that \u201cthe threats [had] always been there since 1982, when two of my brother\u2019s cousins were kidnaped\u201d and taken to a distant village by the FARC, never to be seen again. <em>Id. </em>at 109-11. She further testified that, in 1986, when her stepfather died, the guerillas wanted to take Cardoza\u2019s stepfather\u2019s four children. <em>Id. </em>at 111. To avoid this, her family took the children to the Bogota. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>When asked about the next time she had contact with the FARC, Cardoza testified that in 1998, prior to her first trip to the United States, she began receiving threatening phone calls at her home in Bogota. <em>Id. </em>at 112. She stated that the first time the FARC called her, they told her that \u201cit would go well\u201d for her if her husband at the police station helped them. <em>Id. </em>at 113. In subsequent calls, the caller would simply tell Cardoza that they were going to kill her. <em>Id. </em>at 113-14. Cardoza stated that she received approximately five such calls in 1998. <em>Id. </em>at 114. In addition to the phone calls, Cardoza testified that people to whom she delivered bread would tell her that \u201cthey had been asking about [her].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In response to the threats, and because she was pregnant and feared miscarrying, Cardoza traveled to the United States in July 1998. <em>Id. </em>at 105-06. She gave birth in November 1998, and in December 1998 she returned to Colombia after learning that her mother had been attacked her home in Bogota by FARC guerillas. <em>Id. </em>at 114-15. She testified that after her return, she received phone calls threatening to kill her and her family, and asking her to influence a local politician in Tolima with whom she was acquainted, Alvaro Esquivel, in order to help the guerillas. <em>Id. </em>at 116,119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Cardoza visited the United States for a second time in October 1999. <em>Id. </em>at 103, 122. During this period, her mother continued to live in Bogota, but traveled to Medellin and other places, sometimes alone and sometimes with Cardoza\u2019s brother. <em>Id. </em>at 122-23. Cardoza testified that she returned to Colombia in March 2002 and stayed in her house in Bogota with her mother, although she also traveled to Toli-ma where she sought medical treatment and conducted some personal business. <em>Id. </em>at 104,126-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Cardoza testified that while in Colombia in 2002 she did not receive any phone calls in Bogota, but explained that the guerillas left a threatening pamphlet for her at the house in Tolima. <em>Id. </em>She also said that Esquivel told her the FARC were threatening both him and Cardoza because of their support of Alvaro Uribe\u2019s presidential campaign. <em>Id. </em>at 128-29. In addition, Esquivel told Cardoza that the FARC were threatening her daughter because her father was a policeman and because she was born in the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 128-29. When the IJ asked her how she could say that the FARC \u201creally wanted to harm\u201d her when she was able to travel and conduct business alone without being harmed, she stated that they were simply pressuring her because they wanted her to help them. <em>Id. </em>at 130. Cardoza also testified that her mother still lives in Bogota, in the same house, with two of Cardoza\u2019s brothers. <em>Id. </em>at 123-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Cardoza further testified that while in the United States on her third visit, she learned that both Esquivel and his wife had been killed by the FARC guerillas. <em>Id. </em>at 131-36. She testified that the FARC would still be interested in her, despite Esquivel\u2019s death, and explained that his death was simply a warning to everyone that they will \u201cend up like [him].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">In his oral decision, the IJ summarized the facts, noting a number of inconsistencies, as well as his \u201cdeep concerns\u201d regarding the authenticity of Cardoza\u2019s Liberal Party membership card, and found that her testimony was \u201c[a]t times ... rambling!,] vague[,] and often not specific to the question that was being posed to her,\u201d and that he had \u201cserious questions\u201d about her documentation. <em>Id. </em>at 55-56, 60-62, 66. The IJ found that Cardoza had \u201cfailed to establish [that] any fear that she had even at a subjective level existed on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>countrywide basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64. The IJ noted the amount she traveled in Colombia, as well as her three trips to the United States, and noted that the only contact with the guerillas she had during the last trip was the pamphlet, the contents of which were unclear. <em>Id. </em>at 65. Based on Cardoza\u2019s testimony and the evidence submitted, the IJ found Cardoza failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Because she failed to establish the requirements for asylum, the IJ also found that she had failed to establish entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 67. Accordingly, the IJ ordered Cardoza removed. <em>Id. </em>at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Specifically, the BIA found that Cardoza\u2019s testimony that she received several phone call threats and one threatening pamphlet but was never confronted personally or harmed by the FARC did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. Further, the BIA found that she had not established that she had a well-founded fear of future persecution, noting that (1) she had traveled back and forth between Colombia and the United States, but did not apply for asylum until June 2003, and (2) she had not supported her claim that the FARC would still want to \u201csingle her out for persecution approximately 6 years after reportedly threatening her for the first time in 1998, and nearly 2 years after she last left the country in 2002.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. Finally, the BIA found that, because she failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum, she also failed to satisfy the \u201cclear probability\u201d standard for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>Cardoza filed a timely petition for review with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001)). We review legal issues de novo, <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001), and \u201cadministrative fact findings under the highly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir. 2004) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). \u201cUnder the substantial evidence test, we view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027. To reverse the BIA\u2019s factual finding, we not only must conclude that the record supports such a conclusion, but compels it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">B. <em>Credibility Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">The IJ must determine the asylum applicant\u2019s credibility, and we may not substitute our judgment for the IJ\u2019s with respect to credibility findings. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Vasquez-Mondragon v. INS, </em>560 F.2d 1225, 1226 (5th Cir.1977) (per curiam)). The IJ\u2019s credibility determination is a factual finding, and is reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>See Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283). Nonetheless, the IJ must support an adverse credibility determination with \u201cspecific, cogent reasons.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">In this case, the IJ characterized Cardo-za\u2019s testimony as \u201c[a]t times ... rambling[,] vague[,] and often not specific to the question that was being posed to her,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>and declared that he had \u201cserious questions\u201d and \u201cdeep concerns\u201d about the authenticity of some of the documents she had submitted. AR at 60-62, 66. While the IJ found Cardoza\u2019s testimony vague, and questioned certain documents submitted by her, the IJ\u2019s comments do not appear to amount to an express adverse credibility determination, leaving us \u201cin the dark\u201d on the matter. <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. In such a situation, we should presume that credibility was not a disposi-tive issue. <em>Id. </em>In this regard, as the remainder of this discussion demonstrates, it was not necessary for the IJ to discount any of Cardoza\u2019s testimony in order to deny her relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">C. <em>Asylum,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">An alien who is present in or arrives in the United States may apply for asylum, which the Attorney General may grant if the alien is a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of the INA. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1), (b)(1)). The INA defines a refugee as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Thus, an alien may establish eligibility for asylum by demonstrating \u201c(1) past persecution on account of her political opinion or any other protected ground, or (2) a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that her political opinion or any other protected ground will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230-31 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b)). The burden of proving \u201crefugee\u201d status, and thereby establishing asylum eligibility, is the applicant\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 1230 (citing <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">1. Past Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">\u201cTo establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that she was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Se-pulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230-31). While the INA does not define the term \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have observed that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1237 (citing <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231). \u201cNot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000). In addition, the petitioner must demonstrate that the persecution is because of a statutorily protected ground; \u201cevidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (citing <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">Cardoza\u2019s evidence of past persecution consists of the episodes of threatening telephone calls, the threats conveyed to her through Esquivel, the pamphlet, the kidnaping of her relatives, and the attack on her mother. We have found that written threats and threatening telephone calls constitute mere harassment, not rising to the level of persecution. <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1237-38. Moreover, Cardoza\u2019s testimony regarding the kidnaping of her cousins and the attack on her mother does not compel a finding of past persecution within the meaning of the INA. Neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>kidnaping nor the attack were directed at Cardoza herself. Furthermore, both the attack and the kidnaping appeared to be isolated incidents, the kidnaping occurring in 1982, and the attack on Cardoza\u2019s mother occurring in 1998. Accordingly, the record does not compel this Court to reverse the BIA\u2019s finding that Cardoza failed to show past persecution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">2. Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Cardoza failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. To demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution, an applicant generally must show (1) a \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable\u201d fear of persecution, (2) based upon a protected ground. <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236 (internal citations omitted). The fact that she had traveled in Colombia unmolested for years despite apparently being a target of the FARC for almost two decades, her low-level political participation, and the fact that she had been out of Colombia for over two years all undercut her argument that she has an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution. Further, the fact that Cardoza did not apply for asylum until 2003, and the fact that she was willing to go back to Colombia alone and travel and conduct business, undermine her assertion that she was subjectively afraid. <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Cardoza argues that under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(iii), the BIA and IJ erred by requiring individualized evidence of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Under that section, the IJ may not require evidence that an asylum applicant would be singled out individually for persecution if the applicant establishes (1) a pattern or practice in her home country of persecution of a group of similarly situated persons on account of political opinion, and (2) her inclusion in the group. Cardoza argues that she has established a pattern or practice of persecution of Liberal Party members by the FARC, as well as her membership in the Liberal Party. We find that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Cardoza testified that the FARC is \u201cinterested in all that have cooperated in the campaigns\u201d in Colombia, A.R. at 136, and she cites the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2002 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Colombia (\u201cCountry Report\u201d) for the proposition that Liberal Party supporters are subject to persecution by the FARC. While Cardoza\u2019s testimony may permit a finding that the FARC targets all politically active persons, it does not compel such a finding, nor does it compel a finding of a pattern or practice of persecution of Liberal Party members by the FARC. Moreover, the Country Report does not state that Liberal Party members are targeted by the FARC, and therefore it does not compel such a finding. Because Cardoza has failed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution of a group of similarly situated persons within the meaning of section of section 1208.13(b)(2)(iii), we need not reach the question whether she has established her own membership in such a group.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">D. <em>Withholding of Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must establish that it is more likely than not that her life or freedom would be threatened on account of a statutorily protected factor if returned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>her home country. <em>See Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1243 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)). This is a more stringent standard than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard required for asylum eligibility, and an applicant who is unable to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard generally fails to qualify for either asylum or withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93). Accordingly, the BIA\u2019s denial of Cardoza\u2019s application for \"withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Cardoza did not suffer past persecution on the basis of a protected ground, that she does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution, and that she failed to show that it is more likely than not that she will be persecuted in the future. Accordingly, the BIA did not err by denying Cardoza\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-16\">. In her application, Cardoza also sought relief from removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Although the IJ and BIA denied such relief, she does not raise this issue on appeal. Accordingly, this issue is waived. <em>Sepulveda v.
