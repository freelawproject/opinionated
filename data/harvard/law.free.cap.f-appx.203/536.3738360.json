The district court sentenced Cave to life imprisonment. On appeal, Cave\u2019s attorney filed a formal brief, raising two grounds of error. Cave then filed a pro se motion to strike the formal brief and a motion for leave to file a pro se supplemental brief. We have considered the claims in the formal brief and the pro se supplemental brief. Finding no merit to the claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">First, Cave challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him. A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden. <em>See United, States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir. 1997). In reviewing a sufficiency challenge, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). This court \u201cha[s] defined \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 in the context of a criminal action, as that evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-14\">Cave claims the evidence was insufficient because the evidence does not show he had knowledge that a box he dropped from a window contained cocaine, or that he intended to distribute the cocaine. However, taken in the light most favorable to the Government, there was ample evidence to convict Cave. This court will uphold the jury\u2019s verdict if there is substantial evidence to support it, and will reverse only in those rare cases \u201cwhere the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>Beidler, </em>110 F.3d at 1067 (quoting <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 17, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978)). Trooper Brannock saw Cave drop the box later determined to contain cocaine base out of a bathroom window. Sherwood Barksdale, a prisoner subsequently incarcerated with Cave, testified that Cave admitted that he transported the cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>base to the residence and had dropped it out the bathroom window. Finally, a Government expert testified that the amount and packaging of the cocaine base in the box was consistent with distribution and inconsistent with personal use. We find that viewing all the evidence together, there was more than sufficient evidence for a reasonable finder of fact to conclude that Cave was guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Cave also argues the district court erred when it denied his motion for a new trial based on the perjured testimony of fellow prisoner Jesse Hairston. Pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a district court may grant a defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial \u201cif the interest of justice so requires.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 33(a). A district court \u201c \u2018should exercise its discretion to grant a new trial sparingly,\u2019 and ... should do so \u2018only when the evidence weighs heavily against the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Perry, </em>335 F.3d 316, 320 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>118 F.3d 228, 237 (4th Cir.1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted). This court reviews the denial of a Rule 33 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Adam, </em>70 F.3d 776, 779 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Cave contends that he has met the standard for a new trial under the <em>Larrison </em>rule. <em>See Larrison v. United States, </em>24 F.2d 82, 87-88 (7th Cir.1928), overruled by <em>United States v. Mitrione, </em>357 F.3d 712 (7th Cir.2004) (adopting reasonable probability test). According to that standard\u2014 which has been the test employed in this Circuit \u2014 the district court may grant a new trial following the recantation of a government witness\u2019 testimony if the court is \u201creasonably well satisfied\u201d that: (1) \u201cthe testimony given by a material witness is false,\u201d (2) \u201cwithout it the jury might have reached a different conclusion,\u201d and (3) \u201cthe party seeking the new trial was taken by surprise when the false testimony was given and was unable to meet it or did not know of its falsity until after the trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>528 F.2d 863, 866 (4th Cir.1976) (quoting <em>Larrison, </em>24 F.2d at 87-88). <em>See also United States v. Lofton, </em>233 F.3d 313, 318 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cave\u2019s motion for a new trial because Cave cannot satisfy the second prong under <em>Larrison. </em>Hairston\u2019s testimony was simply cumulative of the testimony given by inmate Barksdale. Even without Hairston\u2019s testimony, the uncontroverted evidence is that Trooper Brannock saw Cave drop the box of cocaine base from the bathroom window, and Cave admitted his conduct to Barks-dale.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Cave alleges that the trial court erred by failing to inquire into his prior convictions as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000). Cave contends that the district court incorrectly added one point to his criminal history score by adding one point for his state conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana in the fourth degree. Cave contends that this prior conviction does not qualify as a \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d Cave argues that he would have corrected the court\u2019s alleged error had the court asked him about the prior conviction at the sentencing hearing. Finally, Cave argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Because Cave raises the \u00a7 851 issue for the first time on appeal, it is reviewed for plain error. The procedure set forth in \u00a7 851(b) \u201cprovides the defendant with a full and fair opportunity to establish that he is not the previously convicted individual or that the conviction is an inappropriate basis for enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>326 F.3d 593, 599 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>980 F.2d 245, 252 (4th Cir.1992)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Even if the district court does not act in strict compliance with \u00a7 851, on plain error review, Cave \u201cmust prove that the error \u2018actually affected the outcome of the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ellis, </em>326 F.3d at 599 (quoting <em>United States v. Hastings, </em>134 F.3d 235, 240 (4th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">We find Cave fails to demonstrate any error committed by the district court that affected the outcome of the sentencing proceeding. Prior to the sentencing, Cave received notice of the precise conviction that would form the basis for his enhancement. The court asked defense counsel whether he and Cave had read the presentence report and whether there were any objections to it. Counsel answered that they had discussed it and there were no objections. In addition, we have reviewed the district court\u2019s criminal history calculation and find the court did not err. As a result, Cave cannot demonstrate prejudice with respect to the \u00a7 851 claim or an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">For these reasons, we deny Cave\u2019s motion to strike the formal brief filed by his attorney, grant Cave\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief, and affirm Cave\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
