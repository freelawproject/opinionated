On appeal, Adkins contends the district court erred in ruling that he discharged the firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d the carjacking and applying the ten-year statutory minimum sentence on count two under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">We will affirm the sentence imposed by the district court as long as it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). An error of law or fact can render the sentence unreasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). In considering whether a sentence is unreasonable, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>441 F.3d 284, 287 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-18\">Adkins does not dispute that he discharged the firearm while escaping with the carjacked vehicle by firing shots back at a pursuing vehicle approximately three and one-half minutes after carjacking the vehicle from its owner. However, he contends that because the carjacking was complete before he fired the gun, he did not discharge the weapon \u201cduring\u201d the carjacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-19\">We conclude the district court did not err in ruling the carjacking was still ongoing under the facts and circumstances of this case for purposes of determining whether Adkins discharged the firearm during and in relation to a crime of vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>lence. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>344 F.3d 365, 373-76 (3d Cir.2003) (defendant who carried a gun in the getaway car after completing a bank robbery carried a firearm \u201cduring\u201d and in relation to the crime of bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)); <em>see also United States v. Martinez-Ber-mudez, </em>387 F.3d 98, 102 (1st Cir.2004) (carjacking was still in progress during flight with carjacked vehicle prior to reaching temporary safety for purposes of determining whether death occurred in perpetration of carjacking).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Adkins\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
