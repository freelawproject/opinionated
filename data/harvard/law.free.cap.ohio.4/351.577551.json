At the time of the purchase, Stewart exhibited to the plaintiff a deed for the lot, from Longworth to himself, and assured the plaintiff that the purchase money was fully paid to Longworth. At this time the plaintiff, Longworth, and Stewart were residents of Cincinnati. The plaintiff, fully believing that the purchase money had been paid to Longworth, erected a dwelling house, and made other improvements upon the lot, to the value of <em>six hundred </em>dollars. Longworth knew that these improvements were making, yet <em>fraudulently concealed </em>from the plaintiff the fact, that, a,t the time, he held a mortgage on the lot for <em>one thousand five hundred and seventy-five </em>dollars, the whole amount of the purchase money due from Stewart for the lot. Some time in 1818, after these improvements were made, and before any steps were taken to foreclose the mortgage, Longworth took possession of the lot, and on Nobember 15, 1822, sold a part of it to the defendant, Jacob Flagg, for <em>one thousand three hundred </em>dollars, and the residue to one Matthew Yandusen, for <em>one thousand </em>dollars. Yandusen afterward relinquished his part to Longworth, who is still the\u2019owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-8\">*The defendants, Longworth and Flagg, continued in possession and received the rents and profits, to the amount of <em>nine hundred </em>dollars, until the year 1826, when Longworth sued out a. <em>scire facias </em>upon the mortgage, and upon the return of two <em>nihils </em>recovered a judgment by default for the whole amount of the purchase money, with interest, giving no credits for the rents and profits. The plaintiff was not made party to the <em>scire facias.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-9\">The bill charges that Longworth extended credit to Stew<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>art \u2014 gave him a deed for the lot, and thereby enabled him to defraud the plaintiff, by inducing him to believe that the lot was paid for, when, in fact, it was not. That the plaintiff is the only person injured in the premises, and that injury was sustained by the <em>fraud </em>and <em>combination </em>of Longworth and Stewart. The bill did not state the date of the deed from Longworth to Stewart, or of the mortgage; nor did it appear that either of them were ever recorded. It did not appear that the lot had been sold under the judgment upon the <em>scire facias. </em>The deed of the plaintiff was duly recorded. Stewart is insolvent and a non-resident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\">The bill contained a prayer for redemption, account, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-6\">The defendants, Longworth and Flagg, demurred generally to the whole bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-7\">The defendant, Stewart, made no defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-8\">The court below sustained the demurrer, and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-9\">The decision of the court rested upon other grounds than those argued by counsel.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-10\">Longworth &amp; Worthington,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AfQ\">in support of the demurrer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-11\">Gaines, contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b356-12\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">If the defendants are bound to answer any part of the bill, the demurrer, being entire to the whole bill, must be overruled. A demurrer, bad in part, is bad <em>in toto. </em>1 Ves. 248; 1 Atk. 450; 2 Atk. 44; Mad. Ch. 226; 1 Johns. Ch. 51; 5 Johns. Ch. 186. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ADIR\">*The main question intended to be presented by the demurrer, whether a <em>scire facias </em>binds subsequent incumbrances, need not be determined. The bill charges \u201c a fraudulent concealment of title, while the complainant was making improvement.\u201d A demurrer to such charge of fraud is bad. In the case of Higingbothem <em>v. </em>Burnet, 5 Johns. Ch. 184, the bill charged that the party in interest stood by and saw great and costly improvements made upon the land, by persons claiming and believing themselves to be owners in fee, and never interposed any pretension of right or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>title. There was a demurrer to the whole bill, which was overruled, because the charge amounted to an imposition and fraud. Here the charge of fraud is direct and positive, and must be met otherwise than by a demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Demurrer overruled.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b356-14-pl-split\"> Contra, 2 Bibb, 484.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
