The government necessarily acts by its officers ; and whenever an individual undertakes to justify a trespass, under the authority of government, that authority must bo traced to some officer of the government, known and recognized by law as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">*The defendant, however, in this ease seems to have rested his defense principally upon the grounds that the National road had boon located near the plaintiff\u2019s close, and that stone were necessary in the construction of that road. Admitting these grounds^ it by no means follows that it was necessary to use the plaintiff\u2019s stone. If he chose to rest his defense upon the necessity of using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s stone, he ought to have set forth the facts, that the court might judge of the necessity, A man may justify going over another\u2019s ground, by reason that the common highway is founderous, or out of repair; but, in his plea of justification, it is not enough to say, that it was necessary for him to go upon the adjacent land, but he must allege specially, that the highway was out of repair, or founderous.
