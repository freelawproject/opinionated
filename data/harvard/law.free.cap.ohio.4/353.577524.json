The indictment was founded upon section 16 of the act for the punishment of crimes, vol. xxii. 261, which provides : That if any person shall steal, etc., auy bank-bills, etc., of fifty dollars, or upward, <em>knowing them to he such, </em>every person, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-10\">The indictment contained no averment that the prisoner <em>knew </em>the bills stolen to be bank-bills. The prisoner was convicted and sentenced ; and this writ was sued out to reverse the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-11\">Strait &amp; Hawes, for the plaintiff in error :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-12\">*An indictment for an offense against the statute must, with certainty and precision, charge the defendant to have committed the facts under the circumstances, and with the intent mentioned in the statute, and if any one of these ingredients be omitted, the omission is fatal on demurrer, in arrest of judgment or on error. Arch. C. L. 23, 25; Stark. C. L. 242.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-13\">The indictment, then, ought to have averred that the defendant <em>knew </em>the bills to be bank-bills.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-14\">On the statute Eliz., which makes it high treason to clip, round, or file any coin, etc., for wicked lucre or gain\u2019s sake, the indictment must charge the offense to have been committed for the sake of wicked lucre or gain. 1 Hale, 220.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-15\">The same doctrine applies to an indictmen t upon the black act. Leach, 556 ; Arch. C. L. 223.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-16\">The same principle is found in Stark. O. L. 244.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-17\">The case of The King <em>v. </em>Lukes and others, 3 Term, 537, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>the statute 36 Geo. III., Ch. 60, see. 2, is fully in point with the present case, and shows the indictment to be bad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-5\">There was no argument in behalf of the state.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b358-6\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The objection taken is fatal. Where the <em>scienter </em>is part of the statutory description of the offense, it must be so laid in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
