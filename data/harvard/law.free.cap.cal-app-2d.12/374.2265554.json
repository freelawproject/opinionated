The widow and minor children are entitled to. such reasonable allowance out of the estate as shall be necessary for their maintenance according to their circumstances, during the progress of the settlement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>estate, which, in case of an insolvent estate, must not continue longer than one year after granting letters. \u2019 \u2019 In the instant ease the court found \u201cthat the estate is,' and has been at all times during the progress of administration, solvent,\u201d so there must have been some reason other than insolvency to prompt the court to terminate the allowance, while the settlement of the estate was still in progress. It appears that after the second order granting the allowance was made, a probate homestead was set aside, September 24, 1934, to the widow for her lifetime, the property being valued at $5,500', subject to an encumbrance amounting, at the date of the order, to $4,700; also that an order was made November 23, 1934, authorizing the widow, as administratrix, \u201cto apply the general assets of the estate towards the. payment of said encumbrance on said homestead.\u201d It also developed at the hearing that the widow was rendering special services to the estate in the care of an apartment house which, in the opini\u00f3n of the court, entitled her to compensation in the sum of $75 per month. The court declined to vacate the order authorizing application of the general assets of the estate to reduction of the debt on the homestead property although requested by the daughter to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The situation at the end of a year\u2019s administration was as follows: the widow had received from an estate appraised at $33,206.96, an allowance of $2,100 paid at the rate of $175 per month, and in addition had received a probate homestead for life with full authority to clear .the encumbrance upon it by drawing upon the assets of the estate; had also received certain exempt personal property appraised at $100, and was in position to derive income from the estate, as caretaker, in the sum of $75 per month. Possibly the court would be entitled to consider also that the widow, acting as administratrix, would earn fees by that service, and when the estate is closed, will take her share of the property that belonged' to her husband, the daughter, respondent here, being ihe only other heir. Since section 680 of the Probate Code contemplates \u201csuch reasonable allowance of the estate as shall be necessary for their maintenance according to their circumstances\u201d we are inclined to the belief that the trial judge, considering all the circumstances, decided that reasonable provision was made for the widow by his final order supplementing the former favorable orders in regard to the probate homestead and exempt property.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>We recognize the propriety and humanity of the rule that has long made a widow\u2019s allowance favored of the law. (11 Cal. Jur. 507.) We realize, also, that the rule must be applied according to the discretion of the trial court (11A Cal. Jur. 527), when the order is made, or later, when modified. As to the right of the court under changed circumstances, to modify a former order, even an order made after inventory, we entertain no doubt <em>(Estate of Boselly, </em>179 Cal. 218 [176 Pac. 45]), and since it appeared that, following the second order granting the allowance, certain changes had taken place in the estate, not by way of reduction or disposal of its assets, perhaps, but in the establishment of a probate homestead, we do not consider that the action of the trial court in this case constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>(Estate of Nelson, </em>167 Cal. 321, 325 [139 Pac. 692].) <em>Estate of Levy, </em>141 Cal. 646, 653 [75 Pac. 301, 99 Am. St. Rep. 92], presents a case where the allowance was discontinued upon the granting of a probate homestead.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">York, Acting P. J., and Doran, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
