Counsel have stipulated that this appeal \u201cmay be submitted upon the rule in <em>Brown </em>v. Ferdon, 5 Cal. (2d) 226 [54 Pac. (2d) 712]\u2019\u2019. Under the rule in that case the note and deed of trust here in question, having been executed and delivered'prior to the effective date of section 2924\u00bd of the Civil Code, are not subject to the provisions of said section. The judgment is therefore reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
