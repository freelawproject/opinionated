(2d) 226 [54 Pac. (2d) 712], said section cannot apply to instruments executed prior to its effective date, and since the record discloses no other ground upon which a general demurrer might properly be sustained to the complaint, the judgment must be, and it is, reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
