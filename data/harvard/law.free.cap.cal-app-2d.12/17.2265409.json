After paying certain installments pursuant to the terms of the contract, defendants declined to make further payments. Plaintiff commenced this action to recover the unpaid balance and interest due according to the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">Defendants \u2019 amended answer alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">(a) Fraud and misrepresentation by plaintiff in procuring the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-11\">(b) Failure of the plaintiff to perform conditions precedent to its right to demand performance by defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-12\">(c) Failure of consideration for the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">Defendants also sought to recover the amount which they had paid to plaintiff upon the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">The trial court found in favor of plaintiff on all of the material allegations of the complaint and against defendants\u2019 alleged defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-16\">The sole question presented for our determination is:</p>\n<p id=\"b56-17\"><em>Was there substantial evidence to sustain the findings of fact in favor of plaintiff and against defendants on the issues raised by the affirmative defenses? </em>. S</p>\n<p id=\"b56-18\">An examination of the record discloses that there was' substantial evidence considered in connection with such inferences as the trial court may have reasonably drawn therefrom to sustain each and every material finding of fabt in favor of plaintiff and against defendants. We therefore refrain from further discussion of the evidence. <em>(Koeberle </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>v. <em>Hotchkiss, </em>8 Cal. App. (2d) 634 [48 Pac.
