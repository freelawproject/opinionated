(2d) 226 [54 Pac. (2d) 712]\u201d. Since the notes and the deeds of trust securing the same are alleged to have been executed and delivered prior to the enactment of section 2924% of the Civil Code, said section, under the rule in the case referred to, can have no application. The judgment is therefore reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
