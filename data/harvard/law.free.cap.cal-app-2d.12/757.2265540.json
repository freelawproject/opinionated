The trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend, and the appeal is taken from the judgment subsequently entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">The note and deed of trust were executed May 28, 1930. The note became due May 28, 1933, and the sale was made on October 17, 1933, under the provisions of the deed of trust. The action was commenced January 13, 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">The only question presented upon the appeal is the right of the defendant to claim the benefits of sections 580a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>of the Code of Civil Procedure, or 2924\u00bd of the Civil Code.
