Such contention by an appellant has always been deemed to have been one involving the merits of the controversy. The transcript of the testimony taken at the trial contains some 120 pages. Under such circumstances we cannot say that the question is \u201cso unsubstantial as not to need further argument\u201d,\u2014 (quotation from sec. 3, rule V, of Rules for Supreme Court and District Courts of Appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Thompson, J., and Pullen, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
