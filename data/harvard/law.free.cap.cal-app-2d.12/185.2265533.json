The defendant interposed a general demurrer upon the ground that the complaint failed to state a cause of action because of the provisions of section 2924\u00bd, Civil Code, enacted in 1933. The demurrer was sustained without leave to amend, and the appeal is from the judgment subsequently entered. The note and deed of trust were executed October 24, 1929. The note became due three years thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">In the case of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Fordon, </em>5 Cal. (2d) 226 [54 Pac. (2d) 712], it was held that the code section mentioned cannot apply retroactively to instruments executed before its effective date. The judgment is, therefore, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-16\">Houser, P. J., and York, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
