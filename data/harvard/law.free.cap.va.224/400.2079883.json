Bolling, was injured in a 1978 mining accident which rendered him a paraplegic confined to a wheelchair. His employer and its insurance carrier, Old Republic Insurance Company (collectively, the employer), agreed that the accident was compensable, and the Commission awarded Bolling temporary total disability payments and medical benefits for as long as necessary. Additionally, by order entered June 25, 1979, the Commission made an award to Bolling of $1,500, pursuant to a compromise agreement, for various expenses to that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In September of 1981, Bolling filed his application for \u201cmodifications to claimant\u2019s home and construction of suitable ramp system.\u201d A deputy commissioner conducted a hearing on the application on November 19, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The evidence is uncontradicted. At the time of the industrial accident, Bolling lived with his wife and two daughters in a \u201cdouble-wide\u201d mobile home in Wise County. About six weeks after the accident, Bolling\u2019s brother constructed without charge a plywood ramp to provide ingress and egress for Bolling by wheelchair to and from the rear entrance of the dwelling. With assistance, Bolling had been utilizing this ramp since his return home, but the ramp had no guardrails and some of the plywood had deteriorated. He wished to install an improved concrete ramp that he could use without assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Because of the small size of the bathroom, Bolling could not turn his wheelchair around inside, although he could wheel himself into the room either forward or backward. He sought to have the bathroom enlarged and handrails installed so that he could shut the bathroom door and use the facilities without assistance and without embarrassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Bolling\u2019s physician, Dr. Richard Whitehill, testifying by deposition, described the claimant\u2019s condition when he last saw him on April 11, 1979. Dr. Whitehill was unable to express an opinion as to the adequacy of Bolling\u2019s physical surroundings and said that he would defer to a rehabilitation specialist on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">C. Mack Cain, a rehabilitation counselor of the Virginia Department of Rehabilitative Services, testified for the claimant, over the employer\u2019s objection, that it was unsafe for Bolling to use the present ramp unassisted because the wood in the ramp was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u201crotten,\u201d the incline was too steep, and the ramp did not have a guardrail or a curb. Cain also was of opinion that the bathroom was too small, and without handrails Bolling could not move without assistance from his wheelchair to the commode or the tub. Two bids had been obtained for making the improvements for which Bolling had applied, one in the amount of $25,868, which Cain felt was exorbitant, and the other in the amount of $15,350. Cain recommended that the improvements be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The deputy commissioner, by opinion dated January 4, 1982, ruled that in enacting Code \u00a7 65.1-88,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entitling claimant to lifetime medical and vocational rehabilitation services, the General Assembly contemplated the \u201cvery situation\u201d presented by the facts in this case. Accordingly, the deputy commissioner entered an award directing the employer to assume responsibility for payment of the sum of $15,350 to the low bidder for the structural modifications that Bolling sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Upon review, the full commission, by opinion dated March 5, 1982, approved the deputy commissioner\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and agreed that the improvements were required under \u00a7 65.1-88 \u201cproviding for medical attention and vocational rehabilitation.\u201d The opinion further stated that the new ramp would be necessary to enable Bolling to go \u201cto and from medical attention outside his house.\u201d The Commission, however, modified the deputy commissioner\u2019s requirement that the employer pay the sum of $15,350 for the improvements by directing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>that the employer \u201cpromptly provide\u201d such facilities or be responsible for the reasonable costs thereof as secured by the claimant. We granted the employer an appeal from this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">On appeal, the employer argues that the language of \u00a7 65.1-88 cannot properly be read to include the structural improvements in question as either \u201cother necessary medical attention\u201d or \u201creasonable and necessary vocational rehabilitation training services.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The interpretation of \u00a7 65.1-88 made by the deputy commissioner and approved by the full commission was based upon the long-established principle that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is to be liberally construed for the benefit of employees and their dependents. <em>See, e.g., Byrd </em>v. <em>Stonega Coke, Etc., Co., </em>182 Va. 212, 221, 28 S.E.2d 725, 729 (1944). Liberal construction, however, may not be used to amend a statute by changing the meaning of the statutory language. <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Town of So. Boston, </em>141 Va. 517, 524, 127 S.E. 380, 382 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The first paragraph of \u00a7 65.1-88 requires the employer to provide a physician and \u201csuch other necessary medical attention\u201d as the employee\u2019s injury may require. The employee is required to accept the physician, unless otherwise ordered by the Industrial Commission, and \u201csuch surgical and hospital service and supplies as may be deemed necessary by the attending physician or the Industrial Commission.\u201d If the accident results in amputation or loss of specified parts of the body, the employer must furnish prosthetic devices and.training in the use of such appliances; Bolling\u2019s injury was not one of those specifically enumerated. Thus, Bolling is entitled to free medical attention, including diagnosis, treatment, hospital care, and surgical procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">We have held that subject to certain conditions \u201cother necessary medical attention\u201d may include \u201cnursing care at home given a disabled employee by the spouse.\u201d <em>Warren Trucking Co. </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>221 Va. 1108, 1116, 277 S.E.2d 488, 493 (1981). Bolling asks us to approve a broader reading of \u201cmedical attention\u201d in this case. The construction work which Bolling argues is compensable, however, is beyond the plain meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The term \u201cattention,\u201d as used here, means \u201cobservant care.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 141 (1971). \u201cCare\u201d connotes \u201csupervision, . . . responsibility for or attention to safety and well-being (under a doctor\u2019s care).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338. To furnish care is to \u201cprovide for or attend to needs or perform neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>sary personal services (as for a patient or a child).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the word \u201cservice\u201d has been defined as \u201cuseful labor that does not produce a tangible commodity\u2014usu[ally] used in pl[ural] (. . . physicians perform services although they produce no goods).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2075.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Thus, the term \u201cattention,\u201d as commonly understood, does not embrace structural alterations. Furthermore, we note that the statute declares that <em>\u201cmedical </em>attention\u201d is to be provided. (Emphasis added). The construction of a ramp and modification of a bathroom are not <em>medical </em>care, supervision, or services.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Cases from other jurisdictions construing similar terminology are instructive. In <em>Spiker </em>v. <em>John Day Co., </em>201 Neb. 503, 270 N.W.2d 300 (1978), an employee was held not entitled to an award for the cost of adding a room to his home to enable him to be cared for at home. The cost of an elevator has been denied as not being medical in nature. <em>Savaria </em>v. <em>DiSano, </em>118 R.I. 357, 373 A.2d 820 (1977). A special chair recommended by the employee\u2019s physician was held not to come within the meaning of \u201cmedical services.\u201d <em>In re Compensation of Smith, </em>54 Or. App. 261, 634 P.2d 809 (1981). In <em>Nallan </em>v. <em>Motion Picture Studio Mechanics Local 52, </em>49 A.D.2d 365, 375 N.Y.S.2d 164 (1975), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>40 N.Y.2d 1042, 360 N.E.2d 353, 391 N.Y.S.2d 853 (1976), a specially equipped automobile was held not to be a \u201cmedical apparatus or device.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Indeed, the Industrial Commission itself in the past has construed \u201cother necessary medical attention\u201d not to include a wheelchair lift, <em>Windel </em>v. <em>Hercules, Inc., </em>53 O.I.C. 392 (1971), or a specially equipped camper-type truck, <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Goins Enterprises, Inc., </em>56 O.I.C. 112 (1975), <em>appeal refused, </em>216 Va. lxx (1976). We hold that \u201cother necessary medical attention\u201d is limited to services and does not include the structural renovations and modifications sought by Bolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The improvements also are not included as \u201creasonable and necessary vocational rehabilitation training services\u201d under the third paragraph of \u00a7 65.1-88. This paragraph was added by amendment to the Act in 1975. Acts 1975, c. 280. Here again, as we have already demonstrated, structural additions and modifications to a building are not \u201cservices\u201d as that term is generally defined. The kind of services within the meaning of the paragraph is assistance by competent teachers or therapists to enable a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>abled employee to learn a new skill to prepare him for reemployment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The evidence shows that Bolling, after utilizing the services of the rehabilitation facilities at the University of Virginia Hospital and at the Woodrow Wilson Rehabilitation Center, was not engaged in vocational rehabilitation training subsequent to his return home in 1979. Construction of the proposed new ramp and bathroom facilities is neither vocational rehabilitation training nor the furnishing of vocational rehabilitation training services.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">That Bolling was grievously injured in undeniable. No one can fail to sympathize with him and admire his desire to achieve independence in entering and leaving his residence and in using the bathroom facilities therein. Nevertheless, the employer is responsible for providing only those services and those prosthetic appliances specifically delineated in the statute. If Bolling should find it advisable or convenient to find another house with easier means of access, his employer could not be held responsible for providing such a residence. If Bolling should find it expedient to relocate to an apartment with elevator service, the employer could not be required to provide this for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In this legislation the General Assembly balanced the competing needs of employers and employees and enacted a statutory scheme which limits the employee\u2019s recovery as compared to full tort damages, but guarantees the injured workman greater security in that to obtain compensation he need not prove negligence and counter traditional defenses such as contributory negligence and assumption of the risk. <em>Fauver </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>192 Va. 518, 521-22, 65 S.E.2d 575, 577 (1951). We will not interfere with that far-reaching compromise by requiring the employer to provide compensation for claims which do not come within the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Accordingly, we will reverse the award of the Industrial Commission and dismiss Bolling\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-6\"> Code \u00a7 65.1-88 (Repl. Vol. 1980), applicable in this case, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">As long as necessary after an accident the employer shall furnish or cause to be furnished, free of charge to the injured employee, a physician chosen by the injured employee from a panel of at least three physicians selected by the employer and such other necessary medical attention, and where such accident results in the amputation of an arm, hand, leg or foot or the enucleation of an eye or the loss of any natural teeth or loss of hearing, the employer shall furnish prosthetic appliances, proper fitting thereof, and training in the use thereof, as the nature of the injury may require, and the employee shall accept the attending physician, unless otherwise ordered by the Industrial Commission, and in addition, such surgical and hospital service and supplies as may be deemed necessary by the attending physician or the Industrial Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">The employer shall repair, if repairable, or replace dentures, artificial limbs or other prosthetic devices damaged in an accident otherwise compensable under workmen\u2019s compensation, and furnish proper fitting thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">The employer shall also furnish or cause to be furnished, at the direction of the Industrial Commission, reasonable and necessary vocational rehabilitation training services.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\"> \u201cVocational\u201d means \u201cof, relating to, or being in training in a specific skill or trade . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2561 (1971). \u201cRehabilitation\u201d is \u201cthe process of restoring an individual (as ... a disaster victim) to a useful and constructive place in society through some form of vocational... or therapeutic retraining . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1914.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
