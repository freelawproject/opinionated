The Industrial Commission dismissed the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">The record shows that Mrs. Smith has been employed by Field-crest in a Henry County towel mill for more than thirty-four years. During most of that time, she worked in the yarn preparation department, located at one end of \u201ca great big room.\u201d Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>though Mrs. Smith\u2019s activity produced no significant amount of cotton dust, she testified that she constantly was exposed to large quantities of dust generated by the receiving, carding, and spinning operations conducted in other parts of the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In 1971, Mrs. Smith began experiencing chest tightness, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Annually thereafter, the medical department of Fieldcrest performed pulmonary function tests upon Mrs. Smith; the results showed she suffered reduced lung capacity. In 1979, at Fieldcrest\u2019s request, Mrs. Smith was examined by Dr. T. R. Harris. He reported that she had \u201csignificant obstructive lung disease which is most likely both byssinosis and emphysema.\u201d The doctor noted that Mrs. Smith had been a smoker for a number of years, but that she had stopped and had not smoked for \u201c5 months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">In May, 1980, Mrs. Smith was examined by Dr. Herbert Saltzman, a physician of her own choice. He reported that Mrs. Smith had \u201csevere chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\u201d and that \u201c[e]mphysema and chronic bronchitis are the evident causes for [this] disease.\u201d He said that he interpreted byssinosis \u201cto be a more likely than not etiologic factor in the evolution of chronic bronchitis',\u201d but that \u201c[c]igarette smoking may be a relative causative factor.\u201d The doctor evaluated Mrs. Smith as having \u201cClass III AMA respiratory ailment\u201435% whole body,\u201d and he interpreted \u201chalf of this impairment to reflect byssinosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">In a deposition submitted to the Commission, Dr. Saltzman reiterated his diagnosis that Mrs. Smith suffered from both byssinosis and emphysema. He distinguished the two diseases by saying that byssinosis causes obstruction of the airways of the lungs, while emphysema causes actual loss of lung tissue. The doctor stated further that emphysema and chronic bronchitis are common diseases, but that, because byssinosis requires \u201cexposure to cotton dust... in cotton textile mills,\u201d it is not a disease suffered by the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Upon examination by Fieldcrest\u2019s counsel, Dr. Saltzman conceded that he did not know \u201cthe level of cotton dust\u201d to which Mrs. Smith had been exposed and that he had used \u201conly her subjective description\u201d of her exposure in making his diagnosis. When asked by Fieldcrest\u2019s counsel whether \u201call of Mrs. Smith\u2019s problems could have been caused by the cigarette smoking,\u201d Dr. Saltzman answered affirmatively. However, the doctor immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>ately reasserted his belief that \u201cchronic byssinosis is a . . . significant component of [Mrs. Smith\u2019s] pulmonary problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Mrs. Smith filed her claim under Code \u00a7 65.1-56(20), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">\u00a7 <em>65.1-56. Cases in which incapacity shall be deemed to continue for periods specified in section; </em>compensation.\u2014In cases included by the following schedule the incapacity in each case shall be deemed to continue for the period specified and the compensation so paid for such injury shall be as specified therein and shall be in lieu of all other compensation ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">(20) For the pneumoconiosis, including but not limited to silicosis, asbestosis, coal miner\u2019s pneumoconiosis and byssinosis, medically determined to be in the:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">(c) Third stage, sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the average weekly wages during 300 weeks. [<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">Dr. Saltzman rated Mrs. Smith\u2019s byssinosis at \u201cstage 3\u201d on the Schilling Index. The doctor admitted this index is a \u201ccrude classification,\u201d but he said it is the only rating \u201cspecifically related to byssinosis.\u201d He explained that \u201cClass 3 refers to the irreversible impairment\u201d phase of the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">In its written opinion, the Commission stated Mrs. Smith had the burden of proving that she had contracted an occupational disease and that the disease was caused by her employment. The Commission then wrote: \u201cIf it is just as probable that [Mrs. Smith\u2019s condition] resulted from a non-compensable cause (smoking) as that it resulted from a compensable cause (cotton dust exposure), the claim must fail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">Continuing, the Commission said it was \u201creadily apparent that [Doctors Harris and Saltzman] have found that this claimant suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>fers with . . . byssinosis and also suffers from emphysema and bronchitis all of which are causing the claimant discomfort and disability.\u201d The Commission observed, however, that the physicians\u2019 diagnosis of byssinosis was made solely upon the \u201chistory given by the person involved\u201d and \u201cwithout any first-hand knowledge as to the extent of [Mrs. Smith\u2019s] exposure to cotton dust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The Commission stated further that Mrs. Smith was \u201csuffering apparently from two conditions and perhaps three, one of which is not job related in any form or fashion (emphysema).\u201d The Commission then held that Mrs. Smith must prove her \u201cdisabling condition ... is <em>solely </em>the result of her employment [and that she had failed to] so prove\u201d (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Commission dismissed Mrs. Smith\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">From a reading of the Commission\u2019s opinion, we are uncertain of the basis for its decision. We are unable to determine whether the Commission dismissed Mrs. Smith\u2019s claim because (1) it found that she does not suffer from byssinosis, or (2) it found that she does suffer from byssinosis but that the disease is not the sole cause of her disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">We recently considered a nearly identical situation. In <em>Bergmann </em>v. <em>L &amp; W Drywall, 222 </em>Va. 30, 278 S.E.2d 801 (1981), the claimant strained his back at work, disabling him from performing his duties as a drywall hanger. Following this injury, the claimant was stricken with a non-occupational neurological disorder. When the employer sought to terminate compensation benefits, the Commission ordered the submission of additional medical evidence. This evidence consisted of a report from a neurologist stating that the claimant suffered from \u201ca neurological disability caused by both his injury and the non-job-related illness\u201d and a report from an orthopedist stating that the claimant did not have \u201can orthopedic disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 278 S.E.2d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Relying upon the \u201cjust as probable\u201d rule, the Commission dismissed the claim. We reversed, stating that the Commission had \u201cconfused two rules of law, combining them into one erroneous statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first, or \u201cjust as probable,\u201d rule, we said, means merely that \u201ca claimant must prove his case by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d; the second, or \u201ctwo causes,\u201d rule \u201crefers to the case where a disability has two causes; one related to the employment and one unrelated.\u201d <em>Id., </em>278 S.E.2d at 803. Under the second rule, we stated, full benefits will be allowed when it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>shown that \u201cthe employment is a <em>contributing </em>factor to the disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">It was unclear, we continued, whether the Commission held the claimant\u2019s disability was not work-related or if it \u201cerroneously denied him benefits for a disability that had both a work-related and a personal cause.\u201d Because of this \u201cconfusion,\u201d we remanded the case so the parties could have \u201cthe opportunity to present additional evidence and arguments.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">We believe the same course should be followed here. Aided by such additional evidence and arguments as the parties may submit, the Commission should decide (1) whether Mrs. Smith suffers from byssinosis, and (2) if so, whether the disease is a contributing factor to her disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">If the Commission decides these inquiries favorably to Mrs. Smith, it must then determine whether she has staged her disease according to Code \u00a7 65.1-56(20)(c). In this connection, we note the criticism leveled at the Schilling Index by Fieldcrest. Essentially, Fieldcrest complains that, because byssinosis is undetectable by X ray, the Schilling Index does not conform to Commission guidelines requiring radiographic findings in lung disease cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">The Commission stated, however, that, because it is impossible to determine the presence of byssinosis by radiographic findings, Commission-set guidelines \u201ccannot take precedence over ... \u00a7 65.1-56 which contains no guidelines.\u201d We agree. It follows that Mrs. Smith took the proper approach in attempting to stage her disease with reference to the Schilling Index. The record shows that, although the Index is a \u201ccrude classification,\u201d it is the only scientific scale \u201cspecifically related to byssinosis.\u201d In the hearing upon remand, the Commission shall permit Mrs. Smith to rely upon the Index as an appropriate staging guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">For the reasons assigned, we will reverse the Commission\u2019s award and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b57-14\"> An <em>amicus </em>brief filed by Dan River Inc. in support of Fieldcrest contains the remarkable statement that \u201c[b]yssinosis is not one of the compensable diseases contemplated by the legislature in Section 65.1-56(20).\u201d The term \u201cbyssinosis,\u201d <em>amicus </em>states, \u201cwas inserted into Section 65.1-56(20). . . under the mistaken assumption that it was \u2018a pneumoconiosis similar to silicosis, asbestosis and coal miner\u2019s pneumoconiosis.\u2019 \u201d It is now \u201cwell settled,\u201d <em>amicus </em>asserts, that \u201cso called \u2018byssinosis\u2019 is <em>not </em>a pneumoconiosis like asbestosis or silicosis.\u201d We suggest <em>amicus </em>direct these observations to the General Assembly.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
