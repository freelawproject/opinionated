McCutcheon, was convicted under this provision and sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment. The principal question in the case is whether the statute requires the Commonwealth to show a causal relationship between the use of a false name and the procurement of a drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The record shows that sometime prior to January 15, 1980, the defendant was injured in an automobile accident. He was treated for \u201cbroken bones\u201d by a Dr. Durica, who sent him to Dr. Robert Swan for treatment of \u201csome neurological damage.\u201d The defendant identified himself to Dr. Swan, not by his true name, but as Jimmy David Johnson. Dr. Swan treated the defendant throughout 1980, giving him several prescriptions for Dilaudid, a pain killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Becoming suspicious of the defendant, Dr. Swan called the police. On September 4, 1980, the defendant, still posing as Johnson, visited Dr. Swan and secured from him a prescription for Dilaudid. Police officers observed the defendant as he left the doctor\u2019s office, drove to a pharmacy, and had the prescription filled. When he exited the pharmacy, the officers stopped him, advised him he was under investigation, and asked him what was in the pill bottle. The defendant \u201ctook [the bottle] out\u201d and said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know I broke the law. I did use a false name.\u201d He was then placed under arrest and charged with obtaining the Dilaudid by the use of a false name.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">Testifying below, Dr. Swan acknowledged that Dilaudid was \u201ca proper drug to prescribe\u201d for treatment of the defendant\u2019s symptoms. The doctor also conceded \u201cit didn\u2019t matter\u201d that the defendant had given him a false name; he had not been \u201ctricked or in any way induced\u201d to prescribe the drug for the defendant. Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Swan added that, even after the incident of September 4, 1980, when he learned the defendant\u2019s real name, he continued to prescribe Dilaudid in treating the defendant because \u201cit was still a proper drug . . . under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. He argues that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving Dr. Swan would not have issued the September 4 prescription but for the use of a false name. The Commonwealth failed in this burden, the defendant maintains; indeed, Dr. Swan admitted that he had not been tricked into issuing the prescription and that, because the defendant needed the drug, he would have prescribed Dilaudid even had he known about the use of a false name.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">On the other hand, the Attorney General contends that the Commonwealth was not required to prove a causative connection between the defendant\u2019s use of a false name and Dr. Swan\u2019s issuance of the prescription. Under Code \u00a7 18.2-258. l(A)(iv), the Attorney General asserts, the Commonwealth establishes a violation when it shows the accused obtained a controlled substance \u201cwhile using a false name.\u201d The Commonwealth proved this violation, the Attorney General submits, and it is irrelevant whether Dr. Swan relied upon the false name or whether use of the name motivated the doctor\u2019s issuance of the prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">We agree with the Attorney General. In our opinion, the purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-258.l(A)(iv) is not to protect physicians and pharmacists from fraud or deceit in their issuance and filling of prescriptions, although this protection may be an incidential result of the statute\u2019s enforcement. Rather, the statute\u2019s purpose, we believe, is to aid in curbing the excessive use of drugs and the obtaining of drugs unlawfully. This has been held the purpose of similar statutes. <em>E.g., State </em>v. <em>St. John, </em>544 S.W.2d 5, 8 (Mo. 1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>62 Wash. 2d 228, 233, 382 P.2d 491, 494 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-258.1(A)(iv) is included in Article 1, Chapter 7 of Title 18.2. Article 1 contains a series of sections relating to all facets of illegal drug traffic, including possession, sale, and distribution. Several of these Code sections, including \u00a7 18.2-258.1, refer specifically to the Drug Control Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 54-524.1 <em>et seq. </em>Section 54-524.56(bl), a part of that Act, imposes upon each person selling, administering, or dispensing drugs the duty of recording the name and address of the person to whom or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>for whose use a drug is sold, administered, or dispensed, together with the kind and quantity of the drug involved. These records must be maintained \u201ccompletely and accurately\u201d for a period of two years, Code \u00a7 54-524.56(e), and they shall be open for inspection by agents of the State Board of Pharmacy, Code \u00a7 54-524.57, who may divulge their knowledge of the records in connection with a prosecution or proceeding involving the person to whom the records relate. Code \u00a7 54-524.58.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">When we examine these provisions of the Drug Control Act, we find that the General Assembly has established a system of record-keeping designed to reflect the identity of all persons to whom controlled drugs are sold, administered, or dispensed. These records, the Act states, shall be complete and accurate and, as the Act permits, their contents may be divulged for law-enforcement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">We believe that, in determining legislative intent, Code \u00a7 18.2-258.1(A)(iv) and the Act should be read together. This reading reveals the intent to insure the accuracy and completeness of drug-control records and to aid their law-enforcement role by penalizing the use of a false name in obtaining or attempting to obtain a controlled drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">This legislative intent would be subverted, in our opinion, by requiring the Commonwealth to prove that a prescription would not have been written or filled but for the use of a false name. The adoption of this requirement would render Code \u00a7 18.2-258.1(A)(iv) virtually inoperative against a person \u201cwith a seemingly legitimate complaint\u201d who is wont to use \u201ca different name ... in any number of physicians\u2019 offices [or] pharmacies\u201d in an effort to obtain a supply of drugs. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>62 Wash. 2d at 233, 382 P.2d at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Such a person is an obvious target of the statute\u2019s focus. Application of a \u201cbut for\u201d rule, however, would place the statute\u2019s emphasis upon a physician\u2019s or pharmacist\u2019s motivation to write or fill a prescription. Where, as here, the doctor\u2019s motivation is to heal the sick, the user of a false name would go unpunished. We believe that the emphasis should be placed where it was intended, <em>viz., </em>upon the motivation of the person using a false name, and that the inquiry should be whether the motivation is culpable or innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">In our view of Code \u00a7 18.2-258. l(A)(iv), when the Commonwealth shows that the accused has used a false name in ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>taining or attempting to obtain a drug, a prima facie violation is established. The burden then shifts to the accused to go forward with evidence showing that his motivation to use a false name was innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">This record shows the nature of the defendant\u2019s motivation. He testified that he gave Dr. Swan a false name \u201cto get the drugs\u201d and that he \u201cneeded the drugs for pain.\u201d He said he was \u201cembarrassed to use [his] real name\u201d because his brother was a \u201cjunkie\u201d and abused drugs and he was \u201cashamed of him.\u201d From these statements, the trial court could have inferred that the McCutcheon name was well known on the local drug scene and that the defendant feared he would not have gotten drugs from Dr. Swan under his real name.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The defendant contends also that, unless we place a \u201cbut for\u201d interpretation upon Code \u00a7 18.2-258.l(A)(iv), the statute would be unconstitutionally vague. We disagree. A statute passes constitutional muster if it specifies \u201cwith reasonable certainty and definiteness the conduct which is commanded or prohibited ... so that a person of ordinary intelligence may know what is thereby required of him.\u201d <em>Caldwell </em>v. Commonwealth, 198 Va. 454, 458, 94 S.E.2d 537, 540 (1956). We believe that the Code section in question passes this test; it tells any person of ordinary intelligence not to use a false name when he obtains or attempts to obtain drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">For the reasons assigned, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b62-11\"> The Code section also makes it unlawful to obtain or attempt to obtain drugs by \u201cthe giving of a false address.\u201d Because this case involves only the use of a false name, we will not again mention the false address aspect of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
