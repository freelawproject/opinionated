After stopping the automobile, the officer stated that Brooks, the driver, had a strong odor of alcohol about him; his eyes were red and glassy; his speech was slow; and he was unsteady on his feet. Results from the sobriety tests revealed that Brooks was unable to perform the \u201cstork test, balance test, or finger-to-nose test.\u201d When the officer requested Brooks to count backwards from 35 to 10, Brooks replied \u201cI don\u2019t know my letters too well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">The officer arrested Brooks and took him to the police station where D. W. Brown, the breath-test operator, made an analysis of Brooks\u2019 breath. Upon completion of the test, Brown filled out a form entitled \u201cCertificate of Breath Alcohol Analysis\u201d certifying, <em>inter alia, </em>that Brooks\u2019 alcohol content was 0.11 percent by weight by volume. From the face of the certificate, it appears that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Brown\u2019s license number 80033227, issued by the Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services, expired on March 19, 1981.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">At a bench trial, Brooks\u2019 counsel objected to the introduction into evidence of the certificate on the ground that Brown\u2019s license had expired when he administered the breath-analysis test. The trial judge, however, overruled counsel\u2019s objection and admitted the certificate, stating that the purpose of the license requirement was to ensure that operators were properly trained, as Brown was. The trial court then convicted Brooks, fined him $200 and costs, and suspended his Virginia driver\u2019s permit for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">I. <em>Admissibility of the Certificate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Brooks contends that the breath analysis could be made only by a person possessing a valid license, and that the certificate shows on its face that Brown did not, on April 13, 1981, possess a valid license.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268(rl) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">Chemical analysis of a person\u2019s breath, to be considered valid under the provisions of this section, shall be performed , by an individual possessing a <em>valid </em>license to conduct such tests, with a type of equipment and in accordance with the methods approved by the Division. Such breath-testing equipment shall be tested for its accuracy by the Division at least once every six months. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">The Division is directed to establish a training program for all individuals who are to administer the breath tests, of at least forty hours of instruction in the operation of the breath-test equipment and the administration of such tests. Upon the successful completion of the training program the Division may issue a license to the individual operator indicating that he has completed the course and is authorized to conduct a breath-test analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">While the statute does not require the expiration date of the license to be recorded on the certificate of analysis, the form does and thus <em>points up </em>a patent inconsistency with Brown\u2019s certification that he possessed a valid license.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The City contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-268(s)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> controls and that the defect is procedural, not substantive, and thus does not prohibit the admissibility of this certificate. This is the conclusion reached by the trial court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The statute requires the test to be administered by an operator with a valid license, and the self-authenticating certificate indicates that Brown\u2019s license was invalid. The qualification of the operator is a matter of substance, not procedure, and is not waived by subsection (s). The lower court, therefore, was in error in admitting the certificate into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">II. <em>Was the Erroneous Ruling Fatal to a Conviction? </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-268(i) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">In any trial for a violation of \u00a7 18.2-266 of the Code or of a similar ordinance of any county, city or town, this section shall not otherwise limit the introduction of any relevant evidence bearing upon any question at issue before the court, and the court shall, regardless of the result of the blood or breath test or tests, if any, consider such other relevant evidence of the condition of the accused as shall be admissible in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268 (r) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">The court or the jury trying the case shall determine the innocence or the guilt of the defendant from all the evidence concerning his condition at the time of the alleged offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">The statutory mandate is that the guilt or innocence of the accused be determined from all the evidence of his condition at the time of the alleged offense, with or without a breath analysis. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>195 Va. 945, 954, 81 S.E.2d 614, 619 (1954), we equated \u201cunder the influence of alcohol\u201d with intoxication and adopted the statutory definition in Code \u00a7 4-2(14).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Accord, Clemmer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 661, 159 S.E.2d 664 (1968). The result of a breath analysis is but auxiliary proof which may tend to corroborate evidence of the objective symptoms adopted in <em>Gardner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Under the facts and circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s erroneous ruling admitting the certificate was not fatal to a conviction. The testimony at the trial clearly showed that there was no room for reasonable doubt about Brooks\u2019 actual condition at the time of his arrest. The evidence of his guilt was clear and compelling, and the erroneous ruling of the trial court was harmless. <em>Yager </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 608, 260 S.E.2d 251 (1979), <em>Rozier </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 525, 248 S.E.2d 789 (1978), and <em>Goins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 285, 237 S.E.2d 136 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-11\"> Code \u00a7 46.1-188 permits localities to enact ordinances adopting by reference certain provisions of the motor vehicle code and of \u201carticle 2 (\u00a7 18.2-266 et seq.) of chapter 7 of Title 18.2.\u201d This was implemented in Newport News by \u00a7 26-72 of the 1961 City Code, as amended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-11\"> In the statement of facts contained in the record, March 19, 1981, is the alleged expiration date.
