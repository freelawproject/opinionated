Bryan sued Arthur C. Bunton, III and appellant Fred Autry in the general district court for $4800 plus attorney\u2019s fees of $960. The claim was for \u201crent due for the months of January through August 1979 as per lease.\u201d Wayne Lustig, a Virginia Beach attorney, filed a timely affidavit of substantial defense on behalf of both defendants, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Code \u00a7 16.1-92, setting forth the defendants\u2019 grounds of defense, and the action was removed to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The case was set to be tried once in November of 1979 and again in January of 1980. On each occasion, the trial was continued on motions of Lustig, counsel of record for defendants, apparently without objection by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In March of 1980, Lustig filed a proper motion under Rule 1:5 for leave to withdraw as counsel for defendant Bunton only.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> According to the attached certificate, copies of the motion were sent to counsel for the plaintiff and to Bunton; notice was not given to Autry. In April of 1980, the court below entered an order granting Lustig\u2019s motion. There was no appearance at the motion hearing by or on behalf of Autry.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Subsequently, Autry appeared in person, but late, for a regular docket call in May of 1980. He learned the case already had been set for a non-jury trial on July 11, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">On the day of trial, Autry appeared in court without counsel and asked the trial judge for a continuance. He represented that he had \u201ctalked with\u201d Samuel Goldblatt, a Norfolk attorney, \u201cabout the case,\u201d that he had not \u201cgiven\u201d Goldblatt a retainer, and that Goldblatt, \u201ccould not be present on that day for the trial.\u201d According to the sparse record on appeal, nothing was said about why Lustig, who remained counsel of record, was absent. Noting the case previously had been continued at the request of the defendants \u201ca number of times\u201d and that the defendants had sufficient time to be prepared for trial on July 11, the court below denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">The court then proceeded to hear the evidence. Autry appeared <em>pro se </em>and testified. He denied any liability to the plaintiff, claiming that the permitted use of the premises had been misrepresented by plaintiff and that Bunton, his former partner, had promised to save him harmless from any liability under the lease. Bunton did not appear in person or by counsel. At the conclusion of the evidence, judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff against both defendants in the requested amounts. Later, Autry, with Goldblatt as his counsel, moved the trial court to set aside the judgment. The motion was denied, and Autry appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Recognizing that ordinarily a litigant in a civil case is not entitled, as a matter of right, to be represented at trial by an attorney, Autry argues the court below nonetheless acted arbitrarily, and erroneously refused to continue the trial to another day. Relying in part on cases from other jurisdictions as well as Rule 1:5, he says that he had employed Lustig, who was counsel of record, and he thus was entitled to be represented by that attorney \u201cunless he properly withdrew under the Rules of Court.\u201d Autry, claiming to be \u201cunlettered,\u201d says it was reversible error to require him to go to trial \u201cwithout his counsel [of record] who for some unexplained reason [did] not show up for trial where there is no showing of fault or attempt to delay on the part of the defendant\u201d individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">It is fundamental that a motion for a continuance is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge who must consider all the circumstances of the case. The judgment or decree below will not be reversed on appeal due to the action of the trial court on such motion, \u201cunless such action is plainly erroneous and prejudicial to the rights of the complaining party. Abuse of discretion and prejudice to the complaining party are essential to reversal.\u201d <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Colonial Pipeline Company, </em>206 Va. 719, 721-22, 146 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">From this record we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion. Eleven months after the suit had been filed, and following two prior continuances at defendants\u2019 request, Autry appeared for trial unaccompanied by counsel. Apparently, as early as two months before the trial date he assumed Lustig no longer represented him because Autry went to the May docket call in person. Also, he had discussed the matter with Goldblatt. Yet he appeared for trial alone and sought postponement, indicating he had merely \u201ctalked with\u201d Goldblatt who \u201ccould not be present\u201d at the time. Based upon these circumstances, the trial judge was justified in concluding that Autry had ample opportunity to procure counsel and be ready for trial on July 11. The court below could also have believed that Autry was attempting to prevent the case from being tried promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The fact that Lustig remained \u201ccounsel of record\u201d for Au-try within the meaning of Rule 1:5 is irrelevant to the continuance issue, given the facts of this case. Under these circumstances, a client is not to be rewarded with a continuance when there is an unexplained, unexcused nonappearance by his attorney of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>In addition, there is no showing the denial of a continuance prejudiced Autry\u2019s rights. The record reveals that he was afforded an opportunity to testify fully and to cross-examine the plaintiff in this uncomplicated suit on a written lease involving some disputed questions of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">For these reasons, the judgment below will be</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-10\"> As pertinent to this appeal, Rule 1:5 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-11\">\u201cCounsel of record shall not withdraw from a case except by leave of court after notice to the client of the time and place of a motion for leave to withdraw.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
