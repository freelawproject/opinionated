Because of the negligence of James Steward, his vehicle struck the Dwyer vehicle broadside and knocked it across the median strip into the westbound lanes of Highway 29, rendering it inoperable. Approximately one minute later, before Dwyer could extricate herself from the disabled car, Alexander T. Yurgaitis, who was traveling in the westbound lane, struck the Dwyer vehicle. Dwyer sued Steward for personal injuries in Fairfax County and sued Yur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>gaitis for personal injuries in Fauquier County. Just before trial in the Fairfax County suit, Dwyer executed a general release and received a settlement from Steward, and the trial court dismissed the case. Upon learning of this action, counsel for Yurgaitis filed a plea of release in the Fauquier County suit. The Fauquier County trial court ruled that the release of Steward also released Yurgaitis and dismissed the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Dwyer\u2019s argument suggests that she was denied her right to a jury trial on the release issue. The record shows, however, that she affirmatively waived this right.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *Her arguments also imply that the trial court decided the issues in the case as a matter of law. The record does not support this implication. The trial court made a number of findings of fact upon which it based its conclusion that Dwyer had suffered an indivisible injury and had settled in full therefor. Accordingly, the real question in the case is whether the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Our standard of review is mandated by Code \u00a7 8.01-680. The judgment of the trial court will not be disturbed unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The record clearly shows that there was sufficient evidence to support the decision of the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The allegations contained in the two motions for judgment, in terms of description of the injuries, are practically the same.* Dwyer never attempted to amend either pleading to distinguish the injuries between the respective collisions.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqy\">Although the answers to the interrogatories in the Steward case and the response to the bill of particulars in the present case are not stated <em>in haec verba, </em>they, too, are alike in terms of substance. Neither makes any distinction between the injuries received in the two crashes. Once again, no effort was ever made to try to differentiate the injuries by means of supplementary responses to either the interrogatories or the bill of particulars.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0W\">The medical reports submitted by the principal treating physician, outlining his evaluation and treatment of Dwyer, encompassed identical injuries. Furthermore, Dwyer supplied copies of this same report in response to both defense discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">During the negotiations over the settlement of the Steward case, Dwyer\u2019s attorney always contended that Steward was wholly responsible for the injuries described in the medical report.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>deposition of Steward\u2019s attorney, submitted into evidence below, is replete with references to claims by Dwyer\u2019s attorney that all the injuries to Dwyer were the result of the first collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">As to the release form, it is a general release to Steward and \u201call other persons\u201d who may be claimed to be liable \u201cfrom any and all claims\u201d that may arise from the accident. This blanket release refers only to a single accident that occurred on April 27, 1977. It does not refer to the collision with Yurgaitis. Also, Dwyer never attempted to limit liability by amending the wording of the release or substituting a covenant not to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">It is apparent from the record that Dwyer failed to segregate the injuries caused by the two collisions. Consequently, the release of Steward released all other tort feasors from liability for the same injuries, including Yurgaitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">It is true, as Dwyer argues, that in the letter of May 7, 1979, from her counsel to Steward\u2019s counsel, the attorney stated the majority of Dwyer\u2019s injuries did not result from the second accident, but he in no way sought to separate or classify the injuries. This communication between counsel was not binding on the trial court which obviously reached its conclusion from an appraisal of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the litigation. The record abundantly supports the conclusion reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">We cannot say as a matter of law that the trial court\u2019s decision is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it, and we will, therefore, affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-9\"> At the hearing on the plea of release on October 16, 1979, this dialogue transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">The Court: <em>All right, counsel agree that the court should decide the issue of fact on this question? </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-11\">Mr. Monahan [Yurgaitis* counsel]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">Mr. Duff [Dwyer\u2019s counsel]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-13\">The Court: Is there any other testimony, or any other witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-14\">Mr. Monahan: No, sir, we have also subpoenaed the original court record, which I believe is now in the court\u2019s possession from the companion case. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-16\">The Court: Very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-17\">Mr. Monahan: I believe that is the only testimony that would be appropriate, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-18\">The Court: All right, Mr. Duff, do you agree that this is correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-19\">Mr. Duff: Your Honor, that is correct.

That might be, I don\u2019t know what was in his mind, As far as I\u2019m concerned, the plaintiff was pushing for our two defendants to claiming that all of these injuries came from our accident. I didn\u2019t believe so, I don\u2019t know what was in Mr. Duffs mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-14\">Q. No, sir, but I\u2019m not asking about his mind, I\u2019m asking about the representations made to you in an effort to achieve a compromise at the highest possible figure. He represented that that was his position, did he not? He wanted to be paid for everything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-15\">A. Well, sure, I mean he was trying to get every penny he could for his client. I\u2019m sure and I\u2019m sure no matter what was in his mind he had never gotten down from asserting that all of these injuries were caused in our accident and we were responsible for them.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
