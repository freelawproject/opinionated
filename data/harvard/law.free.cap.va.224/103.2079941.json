The basic question is whether the presumption in favor of the validity of the assessments was overcome. We hold it was not and reverse, finding in favor of the taxing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">The subject property is an apartment complex, known as Rittenhouse Square, located among low income housing in the City of Richmond. Constructed in 1968, the complex is on 13 acres of land. There are 19 separate buildings containing 319 residential apartment units. The City determined that the fair market value of the property as of January 1, 1974, was $2,760,800 and as of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>January 1, 1975, was $2,300,000. Real estate taxes were assessed accordingly for those years.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\">Contesting the assessments, the owners of the property, appellees Paul Gordon and others, members of a partnership known as Rittenhouse Square Associates (hereinafter collectively referred to as the Taxpayer), filed separate Petitions For Relief From Erroneous Assessment against the City in 1975 under Code \u00a7 58-1145. Following a 1977 ore tenus hearing in the consolidated cases, the trial court decided in favor of the Taxpayer, reducing the assessments for both years. We awarded the City an appeal from the September 1979 judgment orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The following table summarizes the values fixed by the City Assessor; the witness J. B. Call, III, the City\u2019s independent appraiser; the witness C. W. Simmons, the Taxpayer\u2019s appraiser; and the trial court. The experts evaluated the property by employing the capitalization of income approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">\n<em>1974 1975</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Assessor $2,760,800 $2,300,000</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Call 2,500,000 2,600,000</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Simmons 2,000,000 2,100,000</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">Court 2,000,000 2,100,000</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">During the evidentiary hearing, the Taxpayer, through its expert and other witnesses, sought to demonstrate the City had overvalued the subject property in both years. The Taxpayer showed the complex was adjacent to the City\u2019s sanitary landfill and a cemetery. There was evidence of offensive odor throughout the apartments caused by the city dump and of \u201cbig rats\u201d that \u201cwalk over\u201d from the dump. The Taxpayer claimed that as a result of these and other conditions prevailing in the area, there were high vacancy rates during the years in question, 27.6 percent in 1974 and 34.2 percent in 1975, with declining net profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Simmons, who made his \u201cretrospective appraisal\u201d for the Taxpayer during September of 1977, stated that the assessed values for 1974 and 1975 were \u201cclearly and convincingly too high.\u201d Describing his appraisal technique employing the income approach, Simmons testified that he inspected the property; examined the Taxpayer\u2019s actual gross income, net income, and expenses; analyzed the vacancy rates; reviewed the rental market in the immediate area; considered the \u201cpotential of the project\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>producing income; sought to ascertain the anticipated gross income of the project as compared with similar complexes in the area; and studied the \u201cpeculiar problems of Rittenhouse,\u201d which was called \u201cRottenhouse Square,\u201d according to one witness, because the project had a drug problem in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Simmons opined that \u201calmost all\u201d of the \u201cindicators\u201d he had for 1974 resulted in a valuation of $2,000,000, and $2,100,000 for 1975, noting that the \u201cextremely high\u201d vacancy rates for those years were not attributable to poor management but to \u201cmarket factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Richard A. Chandler, the City Assessor, testified that, using a uniform procedure, the appraisals of apartment complexes in the City are reviewed \u201cconstantly and continually.\u201d As market data are collected, the Assessor conducts an ongoing cost, sales, and income analysis, utilizing certain \u201cvalue trends or value indicators,\u201d such as \u201crental levels, expenses, operation ratios, capitalization rates, yield rates, . . . sales of any apartments and current construction costs of various apartments.\u201d Whenever the analysis suggests that the value of particular property is different from the tax assessment, then \u201cappraisal updates\u2014reassessments\u201d are initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Chandler further testified that in 1972 there were \u201cindications\u201d that the market value of apartments in the City had begun to exceed the then assessed values. Thus, all apartments, including Rittenhouse Square, were scheduled for reappraisal and updating during 1973 for the January 1, 1974 assessment. The Assessor\u2019s staff during 1973 mailed questionnaires to every apartment owner seeking certain information, including \u201cincome statements,\u201d that would enable the Assessor to make accurate appraisals of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Chandler stated that an \u201cappraisal team\u201d consisting of a supervising appraiser, plus one or more senior appraisers who actually performed the work, analyzed the data previously collected, and developed \u201ceconomic rental levels.\u201d The team developed \u201ctypical operating expenses,\u201d indicated \u201cgross cap rates,\u201d and developed a \u201cgross rent market\u201d described as a \u201cprice earnings ratio,\u201d which could be applied to the updating of each apartment appraisal. As a part of the process, according to Chandler, the senior appraisers of the team \u201cfield-check\u201d each apartment project. The Assessor also stated that of the accepted appraisal methods the capitaliza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>tion of income approach was given the greatest weight in appraising apartments, and that it was used for Rittenhouse Square.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Garland Johnson was the City\u2019s Senior Appraiser on the \u201cteam\u201d responsible for evaluating the property in question. He testified that in making the appraisals he \u201cestimate[d] the gross potential income of the subject property,\u201d which is \u201cwhat the property should rent for if all the units were occupied.\u201d This was accomplished \u201cby looking at other properties in the general area of the subject, obtaining rents from these projects, and adjusting, if possible, the rents that the subject should command.\u201d Using the standard procedure, according to Johnson, of gathering data in April or May, and finishing in December, for the assessment effective the following January 1, he made inquiry of the rental manager of the subject property to ascertain the rents in effect at that time, and whether the rents were going to change in the immediate future. After obtaining this information, Johnson consulted his office files, which indicate the number and size of the apartment units, in order to compute the \u201ceconomic rents\u201d and the \u201cgross income figure\u201d used for his appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Johnson testified that he requested the Taxpayer to submit operating and expense statements to be used in connection with the 1974 appraisal and that he \u201cnever could get the information,\u201d despite promises from the Taxpayer that it would be forthcoming. The City\u2019s evidence showed that efforts to obtain that data continued without success into 1974 and past March 15, when the Assessor\u2019s administrative review period expired for the 1974 valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Johnson testified that finally he received an operating statement from the Taxpayer for the period January 1, 1974 to September 30, 1974, indicating a higher vacancy rate than experienced by the typical apartment project in the area. As a result, Johnson fixed the 1975 assessment at $2.3 million, about $400,000 below the 1974 valuation. He also testified that if, at the time of the 1974 appraisal, he had been able to use actual figures which established \u201ca track record\u201d for the subject property, the assessment for that year would probably have been between $2.3 million and $2.7 million. He responded during cross-examination, when asked if he \u201cnow\u201d believed the 1974 assessment was \u201ctoo high,\u201d that: \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Johnson further testified that in making his appraisals he took into account the fact that \u201csome of the buildings face the dump,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>which, according to the evidence, was in operation in 1968 when the complex was constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The witness Call, an independent appraiser who made \u201cretrospective appraisals\u201d at the City\u2019s request for the years in question, testified in support of his valuations set forth in the foregoing table.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The trial court, in a letter opinion, decided that the Taxpayer had \u201cclearly rebutted\u201d the presumption of correctness that attached to both assessments. The court decided that the evidence \u201cestablished more than a mere disagreement between expert appraisers,\u201d and held the assessments erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">On appeal, the Taxpayer argues the trial court correctly declared the assessments invalid. It contends \u201c [t] he City cannot disregard the actual income and expense figures for Rittenhouse Square for periods prior to the date of the determination of fair market value.\u201d Noting the trial court\u2019s finding \u201cthat the City did, in fact, disregard certain actual income and expense figures\u201d concerning the subject property, the Taxpayer argues the City\u2019s use of pro forma figures was improper. The Taxpayer says that \u201c[bjecause the complex was being utilized at its highest and best use, the performance of other apartment complexes in the City of Richmond cannot be arbitrarily imposed upon Rittenhouse Square.\u201d The Taxpayer urges that the performance of other like income-producing property is \u201centitled to little weight when actual income and expense experience was available for the appraised property at the time of the appraisal.\u201d The Taxpayer\u2019s argument is built on a faulty premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The record shows without contradiction that actual income and expense figures were not available to the City during its preparation of the 1974 appraisal; indeed, the Taxpayer failed to furnish such information in response to repeated requests by the Assessor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The City nevertheless used other available, actual information, such as the amount of rents being charged at the subject complex, in computing economic rent for the purpose of capitalizing income, a procedure specifically approved by us recently in <em>Fairfax County </em>v. <em>Nassif </em>223 Va. 400, 290 S.E.2d 822 (1982). And for the 1975 assessment, the record likewise shows the As<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>sessor considered, along with other information, a 1974 nine-month operating statement, eventually furnished by the Taxpayer. Therefore, we reject the Taxpayer\u2019s contention that the Assessor employed faulty methodology in reaching the determinations of fair market value for the years in issue. To the contrary, the record shows the City employed a thorough and professional appraisal procedure, using objective information when available.1 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Secondly, the Taxpayer argues its \u201cevidence rebutted the presumption of correctness which applies to the City\u2019s determination of fair market value.\u201d In a variation of its initial contention, the Taxpayer argues the evidence shows and the court correctly found that \u201cthe City constructed an artificial income and expense situation for Rittenhouse Square without reference to the actual experience of the apartment complex and without reference to the unique factors which differentiated the complex from other apartment complexes in the City of Richmond.\u201d The Taxpayer maintains the City disregarded evidence which should have been controlling in that the actual experience of 1974 and 1975 showed \u201cthe absurdity of the City\u2019s artificial estimates.\u201d The Taxpayer says the appraisals were \u201cbased upon pure speculation and conjecture\u201d and it has shown there was \u201cmanifest error in the manner of making the estimate^]We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Under Code \u00a7 58-1145, as pertinent here, the Taxpayer has the burden \u201cto show that the property in question is assessed at more than its fair market value.\u201d We repeatedly have said that in a proceeding under this statute, \u201cthere is a clear presumption in favor of the validity of the assessment.\u201d <em>Fairfax County </em>v. <em>Leasco, </em>221 Va. 158, 165, 267 S.E.2d 608, 612 (1980). The taxpayer must show \u201cmanifest error in the manner of making the estimate, or that evidence which should be controlling has been disregarded.\u201d <em>City of Norfolk </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>161 Va. 288, 293, 170 S.E. 721, 723 (1933). And because fixing property values is a matter of pure opinion, the courts must be hesitant, within reasonable bounds, to set aside the judgment of assessors; otherwise, the courts will become boards of assessment \u201cthereby arrogating to themselves the function of the duly constituted tax authorities.\u201d <em>Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad </em>v. <em>State Cor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>poration Commission, </em>219 Va. 301, 313, 247 S.E.2d 408, 415 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Having already disposed of the Taxpayer\u2019s complaint that the City employed an invalid method of appraisal, we will focus on the balance of the second contention, <em>i.e., </em>that the City failed to consider certain unspecified \u201cunique factors\u201d of the subject property and that the \u201cactual experience\u201d of 1974 and 1975 demonstrates the City\u2019s valuations were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">We assume the \u201cunique factors\u201d to which the Taxpayer alludes relate to the location of the complex. The record is clear that Johnson did, in fact, consider the peculiar site of the apartments, adjacent to the City landfill, and that they were in an area of low income housing. Moreover, the City appraiser made a \u201cfield-check\u201d of the subject property, and certainly was cognizant of any odor or other offensive factor present that could influence value.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The effect of the Taxpayer\u2019s \u201cactual experience\u201d argument is that an appraisal like Simmons\u2019, made after the fact in 1977 based on full and refined data for 1974 and 1975, should override the presumption in favor of the validity of the assessments properly made before the fact for those years. We will assume, and not decide, that evidence of actual operating figures, such as income, expenses, and vacancy rates, developed after taxes have been imposed is relevant when property has been valued by use of the capitalization of income approach. But such evidence is not conclusive and is merely one of the factors to be taken into consideration by the trial court in determining whether the challenged assessment is excessive. <em>See American Viscose Corp. </em>v. <em>City of Roanoke, </em>205 Va. 192, 196, 135 S.E.2d 795, 798 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">As we have stated, because of the Taxpayer\u2019s refusal to respond in 1973 and early 1974 to the City\u2019s request for actual data, the 1974 assessment of necessity was based, in the main, on pro forma figures. Had the Taxpayer disclosed \u201cthe track record\u201d for the complex when asked to do so, it is likely the 1974 assessment would have been lower. At any rate, the information was withheld and the City proceeded to use such data as was available. Accordingly, the City has not \u201cdisregarded\u201d controlling evidence; it was not privy to all the important actual figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Moreover, we cannot say that \u201cmanifest error\u201d has been demonstrated by the Taxpayer for 1974 merely because its expert fixed a lower value for that year using figures which, in part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>should have been made available to the City at the time of its appraisal. As to the 1975 assessment, made after the City had received actual experience figures, particularly 1974 vacancy rates, the most that can be said from the Taxpayer\u2019s perspective is that there is a reasonable difference of opinion among the experts as to the value of the property which ranges from an estimate below to an estimate above the value fixed by the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Given the circumstances of this case, we hold the assessments in question come \u201cwithin the range of a reasonable difference of opinion,\u201d <em>Snyder, </em>161 Va. at 293, 170 S.E. at 723. Thus, when considered in light of the presumption of validity, we cannot say they are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">For these reasons, we hold the trial court erred in reducing the assessments for 1974 and 1975. Consequently, we will reverse the orders appealed from and enter final judgment dismissing the respective petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\"> During the 1982 session, the General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 58-769.3:2, effective July 1, 1982, which permits real estate assessors to require owners of income-producing real estate to furnish the Assessor income and expense statements attributable to each parcel of realty. Acts 1982, ch. 619.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-6\"> At the bar, the Taxpayer argued that because full, complete, and accurate data eventually became available to the taxing authority months after the assessments had been made and the taxes imposed, there was a mandatory duty on the City, even during the course of this litigation, to reduce the valuations. We dismiss such a notion out of hand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
