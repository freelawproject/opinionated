After reviewing the evidence, the trial court held that one of the three offenses upon which the Commonwealth relied was not a \u201cconviction\u201d for the purposes of Code \u00a7 46.1-387.2, because it was based upon a forfeiture of appearance bond on a charge of driving under the influence (\u201cDUI\u201d) in North Carolina, rather than upon a finding of guilt after a trial. The Commonwealth appeals the trial court\u2019s dismissal of this civil proceeding, contending that a bond forfeiture constitutes a \u201cconviction\u201d for the purposes of the Habitual Offender Act. We agree, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The facts are undisputed. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney filed an information against Brumfield based upon a certified abstract of convictions furnished by the Division of Motor Vehicles. The abstract showed three convictions: (1) \u201cDUI\u201d in the Municipal Court of the City of Danville on June 19, 1970, (2) \u201cDUI\u201d in the District Court at Roxboro, Person County, North Carolina on March 9, 1978, and (3) \u201cDriving on Revoked License\u201d in the General District Court of Danville on February 13, 1980. A show cause order was issued and served on Brumfield. At the hearing, Brumfield contested only the effect of the North Carolina record. The court examined a certified abstract of the North Carolina conviction and ascertained that Brumfield was charged with operating a motor vehicle \u201c[wjhile under the influence of intoxicating liquor. G.S. 20-138. .18%\u201d in Person County, North Carolina on September 3, 1977, and the summons had been marked \u201cbond forfeiture\u201d on March 9, 1978. The defendant conceded that he had been charged with \u201cDUI\u201d as shown by the North Carolina record, that he had failed to appear in response to the summons, and that he had not been represented by counsel. The sole question presented for the trial court\u2019s determination was whether the bond forfeiture amounted to a \u201cconviction\u201d of the North Carolina offense. Holding that it was not a \u201cconviction,\u201d the court dismissed the Commonwealth\u2019s information because the two remaining convictions were not a sufficient basis for adjudication under the Virginia Habitual Offender Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">For the purposes of determining who is an habitual offender, the Act, Code \u00a7 46.1-387.2(c), expressly includes offenses committed under the laws of sister states which substantially conform to specified Virginia statutes. <em>See Davis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 808, 252 S.E.2d 299 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The question whether the bond forfeiture amounted to a conviction must be determined by the law of North Carolina, which had sole jurisdiction of the subject matter of the 1977 \u201cDUI\u201d offense. <em>See Nelson </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>195 Va. 1043, 81 S.E.2d 762 (1954); <em>accord Keith </em>v. <em>Capers, 362 </em>So.2d 130 (Fla. App. 1978); <em>Cofer </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>148 Ga. App. 572, 252 S.E.2d 6 (1978). North Carolina\u2019s Habitual Offender Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-220 <em>et seq. </em>(1975), was repealed in 1977. It contained a specific provision, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-221(4), which equated the forfeiture of bail or collateral, deposited to secure a defendant\u2019s apperance in a North Carolina court, with a conviction. The Court of Appeals of North Carolina held, in <em>Rhyne </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>18 N.C. App. 565, 197 S.E.2d 235 (1973), that the forefeiture of collateral on a \u201cDUI\u201d charge was equivalent to a conviction for the purpose of mandatory administrative suspension of an operator\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Section 20-24(c) of the General Statutes of North Carolina provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">For the purpose of this Article the term \u201cconviction\u201d shall mean a final conviction. Also, for the purposes of this Article a forfeiture of bail or collateral deposited to secure a defendant\u2019s appearance in court, which forfeiture had not been vacated, shall be equivalent to a conviction ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Brumfield argues that this section is restricted by its own terms to \u201cthe purposes of this Article,\u201d referring to Article 2 of the North Carolina Motor Vehicle Act, the Uniform Driver\u2019s License Act. Therefore, Brumfield contends, forfeiture of bail is equivalent to a conviction only for the purposes of the administrative suspensions of operator\u2019s licenses required by that same article.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">In the case of <em>In Re Sparks, </em>25 N.C. App. 65, 212 S.E.2d 220 (1975), the court applied N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-24(c) to a judicial proceeding under Article 3 of the North Carolina Motor Vehicle Act. There, Sparks had been charged with \u201cDUI\u201d in Indiana in 1968. He had posted bond, but had forfeited it by failing to return for trial. He was convicted of a like offense in North Carolina in 1974. The law then in effect permitted a district judge to issue a limited operator\u2019s license to a defendant convicted of \u201cDUI\u201d as a first offender. A district judge disregarded the Indiana bond forfeiture, treated the defendant as a first offender, and issued a limited operator\u2019s license. On appeal by the Department of Motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Vehicles, the issuance of the license was upheld by the superior court. The Court of Appeals of North Carolina reversed. It applied N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-24(c) to this judicial proceeding and held that the Indiana bond forfeiture was equivalent to a conviction for the purposes of the North Carolina \u201cDUI\u201d Statute, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-179. It thus appears that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a720-24(c) has broader application than Brumfield contends, and that a bond forfeiture is clearly equivalent to a conviction in judicial proceedings under North Carolina law.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Brumfield\u2019s 1978 North Carolina bond forfeiture was a conviction under the law of that state. Code \u00a7 46.1-387.2(c) requires that it be counted for the purpose of determining his status under the Virginia Habitual Offender Act. For this reason, the order appealed from will be reversed, and the case will be remanded with direction to the trial court to enter an order adjudicating Brumfield an habitual offender pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.1-387.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
