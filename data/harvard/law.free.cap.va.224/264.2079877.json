R. Forrest, III, and Virginia B. Forrest, his wife, to liquidate their assets, and pay claims as authorized by the court. S. W. Rawls, Inc. (Rawls), contended its claim was entitled to priority over the claims of general creditors because it was secured by a lien of attachment perfected before appointment of the receiver. The commissioner in chancery to whom the matter was referred reported that Rawls was not entitled to priority; the trial court, overruling Rawls\u2019s exceptions, approved the commissioner\u2019s report. We agree with Rawls that the court erred in denying priority to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The facts are undisputed. On March 14, 1979, Rawls filed a motion for judgment against Forrest in the general district court. The same day counsel for Rawls, G. Daniel Forbes, was informed that Richard E. Railey, a creditor as well as attorney for other creditors of the Forrests, was \u201ctrying to set up a receivership.\u201d Confirming this information in a telephone conversation with Railey, Forbes authorized Railey, subject to approval by Rawls, to include Rawls as a complainant in the creditors\u2019 bill that Railey was preparing.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Aware that attachments had been filed against Forrest and that a public sale of his assets had been advertised for March 16, Forbes recommended that Rawls authorize him to file an attachment and also join in the bill for appointment of a receiver. According to Forbes\u2019s testimony, his recommendation was prompted by his belief that \u201ca race to the courthouse was on\u201d and his doubt whether the court would appoint Railey, a principal creditor, as receiver. He said his main objective, however, was to stop the sale scheduled for March 16. Rawls approved the proposed course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">Forbes filed the Rawls petition for attachment at 1:00 p.m. on March 15. He testified he had not formally agreed at that time to join in the bill of complaint for appointment of a receiver, although he had informed Railey he would recommend that Rawls authorize him to do so. About 2:30 or 3:00 p.m., Forbes went to Railey\u2019s office, discussed the receivership, and helped Railey proofread some of the suit papers. At 6:00 p.m., the papers were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>signed on behalf of the complainants named therein, who sued for themselves and all other creditors; Forbes signed as counsel for Rawls. The bill of complaint sought the immediate appointment of a receiver pursuant to the emergency provisions of Code \u00a7 8.01-592. About 8:30 p.m., Forbes was advised, the court appointed Railey receiver. In the meantime, at 6:10 p.m., as shown on his return, a deputy sheriff had levied the Rawls attachment on Forrest\u2019s real and personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The commissioner in chancery reported to the trial court that when the Rawls attachment was filed Rawls \u201cwas aware of and had informally agreed\u201d to Join in the bill of complaint for appointment of a receiver. Although finding \u201cno fault or ulterior motive in filing the attachment while joining in the receiver appointment,\u201d the commissioner reported that Rawls would be given \u201can inequitable preference\u201d if its claim were accorded priority. Accordingly, the commissioner recommended, and the court subsequently ruled, that Rawls be treated as a general creditor. As reported by the commissioner, the Rawls claim was $3,703.57; the amount remains unchallenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The lien of an attachment is perfected by the levy of the officer. Code \u00a7 8.01-557; <em>see Jackson </em>v. <em>Valley Tie Co., </em>108 Va. 714, 720-22, 62 S.E. 964, 966-67 (1908). Appointment of a receiver does not affect vested rights or the order of priority of existing liens. <em>Peoples Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Va. Textile Co., </em>104 Va. 34, 37, 51 S.E. 155, 156 (1905); <em>see </em>3 <em>Clark on Receivers </em>\u00a7 667.4 (3d ed. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Applying these rules, the commissioner in chancery approved the priority of claims of two complainants whose attachments were levied on March 9 and March 14, respectively. The only feature distinguishing the status of these attaching creditors from that of Rawls is that Rawls had prior knowledge that the appointment of a receiver would be sought and agreed informally to become a complainant in the proposed proceeding. This distinction alone is insufficient to invalidate the priority of the Rawls lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Under Virginia law,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> preferential transfers for full value to bona fide creditors by an insolvent debtor are not invalid absent fraud. <em>Bank of Commerce </em>v. <em>Rosemary and Thyme, </em>218 Va. 781, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>784, 239 S.E.2d 909, 912 (1978). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 55-80. It follows, as a corollary, that successful efforts by such creditors to receive preferential treatment from an insolvent debtor will not be invalidated unless fraud is established. There is no suggestion, however, that Forrest had any part in the perfection of Rawls\u2019s lien or that Rawls attempted to obtain from him any preferential treatment. Since in Virginia a creditor may lawfully receive preferential treatment with the non-fraudulent cooperation of his debtor, we see no reason to refuse priority to a creditor like Rawls who perfects his lien entirely independently of the debtor and without fraud. A creditor who acts without the assistance of his debtor should not be held to a more stringent standard than a creditor who is intentionally preferred. We hold, therefore, that absent fraud a bona fide creditor may obtain a valid priority by perfecting his lien at any time until the appointment of a receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">There is no evidence that Rawls attempted to prevent other creditors from obtaining liens before appointment of the receiver, or that Rawls committed any other fraudulent act. Counsel for Rawls, perceiving a creditors\u2019 race for liens and fearing a possible delay in the appointment of a receiver, was under a continuing duty to represent his client zealously within the constraints of the law and the ethical standards of professional conduct. <em>See Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility </em>DR 7-101, 216 Va. 1117-18 (1976). He recommended a two-pronged course of action and, with the client\u2019s authorization, pursued each course with diligence to protect the claim entrusted to him. Although the race, whether to the courthouse or elsewhere, is not always to the swift, in this instance the deputy sheriff\u2019s levy perfected Rawls\u2019s lien some two hours before the receiver was appointed. Consistent with the commissioner\u2019s finding that Rawls was free from fault or bad faith, we hold that the priority of its lien is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-9\"> We are not here concerned with federal bankruptcy law, which defines a preference, with some exceptions, as a \u201ctransfer of property of the debtor ... to or for the benefit of a creditor; for or on account of an antecedent debt . . .; made while the debtor was insol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>vent\u201d within certain prescribed time periods prior to the filing of the petition for bankruptcy. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(b) (Supp. Ill 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
