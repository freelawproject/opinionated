Thp wound became infected, and Talley nearly lost his hand. After he attained a plateau of medical improvement, Talley, who had been receiving disability compensation pursuant to an agreement with his employer, was awarded, on the employer\u2019s application, a specific disability rating pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.1-56. The employer paid Talley the required 37.50 weeks of specific disability compensation based upon 25% functional loss of use of his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">When his specific disability payments terminated, Talley filed a change-of-condition application alleging incapacity to engage in his previous occupation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At a hearing conducted on December 22, 1980, the employer\u2019s defense was that Talley had refused an offer of selective work. Relying on the October 16, 1980, report of the attending physician, Dr. Daniel N. Kulund, that Talley was \u201cunable to engage in his previous occupation at the sawmill,\u201d and the failure of the employer to submit to Dr. Kulund for approval a detailed job description, the hearing commissioner stated in his opinion that the employer had not established a \u201cdefinite refusal of an offer of selective work within the claimant\u2019s physical capabilities.\u201d The commissioner awarded Talley compensation to continue during temporary total incapacity. The full Commission, on review, reversed the award, finding in its opinion that Talley had, without justification, refused selective employment offered by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">On appeal, Talley contends that he was justified in refusing an offer of selective employment without the prior approval of his attending physician, or alternatively, that the evidence was insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>dent to support the Commission\u2019s finding of unjustified refusal of selective employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Talley\u2019s contentions focus on events occurring just prior to the hearing on December 22, 1980. On December 16, 1980, Dr. Kulund reported to the employer\u2019s insurer concerning Talley\u2019s condition. The report, filed by the employer with the Commission on December 18, 1980, concluded with the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">Although Mr. Talley cannot return to his old job at the sawmill, he can certainly do any job that does not involve the use of two good hands. I would not want his hand with the finger sticking out near any machinery, or in work that would involve carrying objects of over ten pounds with both hands, pushing, pulling or climbing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">By letter to Talley of December 16, 1980, signed by W. T. Goodwin, the employer requested that Talley report to work on December 19, 1980, at a specified hourly rate of compensation to perform duties \u201ccleaning up and driving a short bed dump truck.\u201d The letter recited the employer\u2019s understanding that Dr. Kulund had \u201cadvised\u201d that Talley was able to return to work provided he did not get his \u201cbad finger\u201d near machines, did not lift more than 10 pounds and did not do any pushing, pulling or climbing. The letter than stated, \u201cYou will not have to push, pull or climb or lift over 10 lbs., and we do not want you to put your bad hand near any machines that would possibly injure your hand.\u201d The employer also filed a copy of this letter with the Commission on December 18, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">In support of his contention that the employer\u2019s tender of selective employment was invalid as a matter of law, Talley relies on past decisions of the Commission that state or imply that the attending physician must approve a specific job description prior to its being offered to the employee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its opinion in the present case, however, the Commission acknowledged its requirement of medical approval where the claimant is receiving compensation for temporary total or temporary partial disability. But the Commission implied that the requirement would not be applicable in the present case, one of first impression, where an offer of selective employment was made following a rating for permanent disability. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Here, permanent partial incapacity was uncontested, but the employer raised the refusal of selective employment as an affirmative defense to the employee\u2019s application for continued compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Nothing in Code \u00a7 65.1-63, which defines the consequences of an employee\u2019s refusal of selective employment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> prohibits its use by the employer as an affirmative defense rather than as a basis for an employer\u2019s change-in-condition petition. Thus, the Commission was entitled to consider the tender and refusal of selective employment during the hearing on Talley\u2019s application. The employer, acknowledging that it had the burden of persuasion to show that a job offer was tendered within Talley\u2019s residual capacity, says that if it carried this burden, the burden of persuasion then shifted to Talley to show that he was justified in refusing the offer of modified work. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Whether refusal of selective employment is used offensively or defensively, the tender of limited employment must necessarily be based upon informed medical opinion. We will assume, therefore, that prior medical approval is required. As Talley conceded in oral argument, however, where the attending physician has specified the limitations in detail and it is obvious that the proffered job fits these limitations, it may not always be necessary to submit the job description to the physician for what would be merely a \u201crubber stamp action.\u201d <em>See Ross </em>v. <em>Fincastle Country Club, Inc., </em>53 O.I.C. 315 (1971). Talley says this is not such a case. We disagree. The tender of selective employment mirrored the precise physicial limitations specified by the attending physician. The Commission reasonably could find as a fact from this evidence that the employer made a valid tender of selective employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Talley asserts that the Commission erroneously based its decision on a handwritten notation from Dr. Kulund made on a copy of the employer\u2019s letter to Talley offering the selective employment. This document was not placed in the record until some two months after the evidentiary hearing. The notation from Dr. Kulund stated that the job offer \u201ccorrespond [ed] to the limitations in my Dec. 16, 1980 letter.\u201d There is no indication in the record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>however, that the Commission relied on Dr. Kulund\u2019s post-hearing notation in arriving at its decision. Indeed, the notation was nothing more than confirmation of what was apparent from the language of the physician\u2019s report and the employer\u2019s job offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The finding that selective employment had been offered shifted the burden of persuasion to Talley to show that his refusal of the offer was justified, and the Commission stated in its opinion that it could not find from the evidence such justification. Talley relies on the testimony of W. T. Goodwin that the job offered was \u201cpractically the same job\u201d Talley had when he was injured. This reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The evidence showed that Talley, though illiterate, received the letter offering selective employment and had it read to him five days before the hearing. The letter referred to the limitations imposed by Dr. Kulund and specifically excluded them from the specified duties which Talley would be required to perform on the job. Moreover, at the hearing, counsel for Talley had ample opportunity to inspect both Dr. Kulund\u2019s letter and the offer of selective employment as well as to cross-examine Goodwin on the precise nature and limitations of the proffered job. During the hearing, Goodwin testified that the job was \u201cstill available for Mr. Talley.\u201d While the job undoubtedly would have been similar to Talley\u2019s job prior to his injury, the duties had been modified to ensure that Talley would not exceed the limitations placed on his capacity by Dr. Kulund. If Talley did not know before the hearing that the proffered job met Dr. Kulund\u2019s requirements, he acquired, or should have acquired, that information at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">It thus appears that the Commission\u2019s finding that Talley failed to show justification for his refusal of selective employment is based upon credible evidence and is therefore binding upon us. <em>Sky Chefs, Inc. </em>v. Rogers, 222 Va. 800, 805, 284 S.E.2d 605, 607 (1981). Accordingly, we will affirm the decision of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-9\"> Prior to 1975, an employee could not receive further incapacity compensation following payment of compensation for a specific disability.
