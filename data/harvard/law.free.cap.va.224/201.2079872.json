Blodinger and four other attorneys (collectively, the attorneys) filed a declaratory judgment action against Broker\u2019s Title, Inc., and certain of its officers (collectively, the company or Broker\u2019s Title), asking the trial court to determine that the company was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. The trial court dismissed the suit, holding there was no actual, justiciable controversy between the parties and, therefore, declaratory judgment did not lie. The attorneys appeal this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Broker\u2019s Title serves as the local agent for a title insurance company. As such, it participates in the closing of real estate transactions. The attorneys refused to deal with the company or to participate in closings where it was represented, believing to do so would aid the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Counsel for Broker\u2019s Title wrote the attorneys, denied the company was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, and suggested the parties seek an \u201camicable remedy\u201d to the situation. If this was not possible, the company suggested the parties seek a judicial determination. Less than two weeks later, the attorneys brought this suit. Thereafter Broker\u2019s Title brought an antitrust action against the attorneys in federal court. (The federal suit has been stayed pending a resolution of this case.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Broker\u2019s Title asserts no actual controversy exists between the parties and, therefore, declaratory judgment is not proper. <em>Virginia Bus Assoc, </em>v. <em>Tunnel Dist., </em>219 Va. 988, 990, 254 S.E.2d 54, 55 (1979); <em>City of Fairfax </em>v. <em>Shanklin, </em>205 Va. 227, 229, 135 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1964). This assertion is contradicted by the company\u2019s actions. It was the company that suggested the parties seek a judicial determination, which the attorneys proceeded to do. It is the company that alleges, in the federal suit, that the attorneys are engaged in an illegal boycott. Clearly, an actual controversy exists between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The company argues that while there may be a disagreement over whether it is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, no rights or obligations of the attorneys have been infringed entitling them to a declaration of this fact. The attorneys, however, had a vested interest in this determination. They feared participation in closings with Broker\u2019s Title would subject them to possible disciplinary action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Conversely, they worried, as has turned out to be the case, their continued refusal to deal with the company would lead to possible antitrust liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The attorneys were not seeking an answer to a hypothetical question. A determination of the legality of the company\u2019s activities was essential if the attorneys were to avoid the possibility of both disciplinary action and a law suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The company asserts further that if a controversy exists it has matured past the point where declaratory judgment would lie. Citing <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>211 Va. 414, 177 S.E.2d 519 (1970), it argues once damages accrue the proper remedy is an action at law. Broker\u2019s Title argues it was damaged the moment the attorneys started their boycott.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Unlike <em>Liberty Mutual, </em>this case involves an alleged continuing harm and mounting damages. Further, the company\u2019s position is that the attorneys could not bring a declaratory judgment action because it was entitled to file an antitrust suit. This argument puts the attorneys at the company\u2019s mercy, forcing them to continue their boycott and subject themselves to possible growing liability until the company sees fit to file suit. Yet the purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act is to \u201cafford relief from the uncertainty and insecurity attendant upon controversies over legal rights, without requiring one of the parties interested so to invade the rights asserted by the other as to entitle him to maintain an ordinary action therefor.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-191.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Finally, Broker\u2019s Title argues declaratory judgment was precluded by the availability of other remedies. It argues a determination of its conduct could have been made through a criminal prosecution (Code \u00a7 54-44), a writ of quo warranto (Code \u00a7 8.01-636,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or an advisory opinion of the Virginia State Bar (Rules of Court, Part 6, \u00a7 IV, 11 10, 219 Va. 367-71 (1978)). We reject the argument that the existence of any of these remedies precluded the use of declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Neither a criminal proceeding nor a writ of quo warranto was available to the attorneys, since such actions may be brought only on behalf of the Commonwealth. Nor does the fact that unauthorized practice of law is a misdemeanor preclude declaratory relief. The attorneys were not vigilantes seeking to prosecute the company in the stead of the Commonwealth. <em>See Connecticut Soc'y. of Architects, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bank Bldg. &amp; Equipment Corp., </em>151 Conn. 68, 193 A.2d 493 (1963); <em>Wisconsin Pharmaceutical Ass\u2019n. </em>v. <em>Lee, 264 </em>Wis. 325, 58 N.W.2d 700 (1953). Their goal was not solely to stop the illegal conduct of others, but to insure their own conduct conformed to the law and the tenets of the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Further, the availability of an advisory opinion did not preclude the use of declaratory judgment. In fact, the attorneys sought help from the State Bar, only to be told all advisory opinions in regard to the subject recently had been withdrawn.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In any event, an advisory opinion, based on a hypothetical set of facts, could not resolve questions regarding the actual conduct of Broker\u2019s Title. These issues could be resolved by declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">For the reasons stated, we conclude the bill of complaint stated a cause of action for declaratory judgment under the statute, and the trial court erred in dismissing the suit. Indeed, the court had the \u201cinherent power, apart from statute\u201d to inquire into possible unauthorized practice of law. <em>Richmond Ass\u2019n of Cr. Men </em>v. <em>Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>167 Va. 327, 335, 189 S.E. 153, 157 (1937). Accordingly, the decree of the trial court will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\"> The attorneys were concerned that by dealing with Broker\u2019s Title they would violate Disciplinary Rule 3-101A which prohibits a lawyer from aiding the unauthorized practice of law. 216 Va. 1090 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\"> After the present suit was brought, this section was amended to provide for the issuance of a writ against any person engaged in the unauthorized practice of a profession.
