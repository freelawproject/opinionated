Plaintiff alleged that Ford Motor Company and Dave Pyles Lincoln Mercury, one of its retail dealers, were liable to her on theories of negligence, strict liability, failure to warn of a design defect, and breach of implied warranty. The trial court granted Dave Pyles\u2019 motion to strike plaintiffs evidence against it but refused Ford\u2019s motion. At the conclusion of all the evidence, the trial court struck plaintiffs claim for punitive damages. The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff and fixed her damages at $50,000. Ford filed a motion to set aside the verdict and to enter judgment in its favor or, in the alternative, to award a new trial on liability and compensatory damages. The trial court overruled Ford\u2019s motion but ordered a remittitur of $33,500. Plaintiff elected to accept the remittitur under protest, and the trial court entered judgment in her favor for $16,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">The accident occurred on October 22, 1976, in a parking lot near a grocery store where plaintiff had gone to shop. After she had bought her groceries, plaintiff, accompanied by her two-month-old son, drove her four-door Lincoln sedan to the front of the store, stopped in the parcel pick-up lane, and waited for help in loading her purchases. When help did not arrive, she decided to load the groceries herself. The pick-up lane was on a slight grade, so plaintiff \u201cput the car in Park, . . . put the brake on, and . . . got out of the car, leaving the door open\u201d. The weather was \u201cchilly\u201d, and to keep the infant warm, she left the motor and heater running. After placing several grocery bags in the back seat, she noticed that the car was moving backwards. She began running with the car, trying to get back into the front seat, but the door knocked her down and the left front wheel ran over her left leg. The car continued moving across the parking lot until it collided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>with several other cars. Panic-stricken, plaintiff \u201cdragged\u201d herself to her car to check on her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The infant was not injured, but plaintiff suffered soft tissue damage to her leg, with swelling and bleeding under the skin. She incurred $292.10 in medical expenses for treatment as an outpatient. A month after the accident, the bruise had almost disappeared, but swelling, pain, and some limitation of flexion of the knee persisted over a period of nearly two years. Plaintiffs friends testified that she had undergone noticeable personality changes as the result of her experience. Plaintiff introduced no evidence of loss of earnings or earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Plaintiff purchased the 1973 Lincoln, formerly owned by her father, from the dealer who had taken it in trade. She drove the car for nearly two years and had experienced no difficulty with the transmission until March 1975. On that occasion, she had parked her car facing away from a wall in a parking garage. She remembered that she had \u201cput the car in Park and . . . press [ed] the emergency brake\u201d. When she \u201cwent to turn the key in the ignition . . . the car slammed into the back wall.\u201d Dave Pyles towed the car to its shop, inspected the transmission, and made repairs. Plaintiff was not satisfied that the problem had been corrected because the gear shift lever \u201chad a little bit of play in it\u201d and \u201cthe needle never quite went completely into \u2018P\u2019 \u201d. She took the car back to the dealer \u201cseveral times\u201d and, on each occasion, the mechanics assured her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Nothing\u2019s wrong with it.\u201d Following the accident out of which this suit arose, she took the car to a different mechanic who replaced a \u201cgrommet\u201d or bushing in the transmission linkage. The grommet, which was located \u201cright next to the column shift lever\u201d, was \u201csplit in two different pieces.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">William H. Divine, a mechanical-electrical engineer, qualified as plaintiffs expert witness. Divine testified that, based upon his study of \u201cthe transmission linkages and ... the adequacy of the pieces in the linkage\u201d, the system was \u201cdangerous and unsafe\u201d. He explained that \u201cthe transmission is designed in a manner that a reasonable, prudent individual can be led to place the shift lever on the land between park and reverse\u201d.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Thus, the transmission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>could \u201chave the appearance of . . . being in Park\u201d when, in fact, it was not fully engaged, a phenomenon referred to at trial as the \u201cillusory park position\u201d. In that position, vibration could cause the transmission to slip into reverse gear. It was Divine\u2019s opinion that plaintiff \u201cdid not truly put the transmission into Park\u201d even though \u201c[s]he thought she did\u201d. Divine believed that a split grommet could have caused \u201cincreased sloppiness\u201d in the linkage and aggravated the risk of mispositioning the shift lever.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">In the opinion of Robert Everson, one of Ford\u2019s expert witnesses, the transmission system in plaintiffs car \u201cwas not unreasonably dangerous for its intended use; in fact, it was safe for its intended use. It met the state of the art.\u201d He acknowledged that a driver, \u201cthrough carelessness\u201d, might \u201cput the tang up on the land\u201d, but he said that the same was true with respect to the automatic transmission systems in Chrysler and General Motors products. If such a car were parked on a grade, Everson stated, placing the transmission in illusory park would \u201chave the same effect\u201d as placing it in neutral, <em>i.e., </em>if the emergency brake were not set, the car would start to roll if there were \u201c[a]ny kind of force input; slamming the door or opening the door, shaking the car, putting groceries in and that sort of thing.\u201d Speaking of the split grommet, Everson said that \u201cno single missing bushing in the linkage would cause you to not be able to get into park.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Plaintiff introduced as exhibits a number of Ford\u2019s interoffice communications. These documents showed that Ford had received numerous customer complaints concerning the illusory park problem. Ford\u2019s witnesses testified that they had investigated all reports and concluded that the cause of the problem was driver carelessness. Nevertheless, their engineers evaluated several proposals for design modifications and adopted one. Other proposals were rejected because experiments indicated that they would not reduce the risk of driver error. We will discuss these proposals in more detail later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Ford\u2019s major contention on appeal, structured in several parts, is that the evidence was insufficient \u201cto establish a prima facie case\u201d of negligence and causal connection. Plaintiff cannot rely upon the testimony of her expert witness to support the verdict, Ford says, because his testimony \u201cwas speculative and not based on facts in evidence\u201d and because it \u201ccontradicted [plaintiff\u2019s] own unequivocal testimony of facts within her knowledge.\u201d Even if the expert testimony is considered, however, Ford believes that the evidence fails to establish liability for negligence, breach of implied warranty, or failure to warn. Further, Ford argues that plaintiff is not entitled to recover because she \u201cmisused her vehicle and was contributorily negligent as a matter of law.\u201d Finally, Ford maintains that the trial court should have set aside the verdict and awarded a new trial on the ground the damage award was so excessive that it tainted the validity of the jury\u2019s liability verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">By assignments of cross-error, plaintiff attacks the trial court\u2019s rulings on punitive damages, remittitur, and certain other questions raised at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">I. PRIMARY NEGLIGENCE</p>\n<p id=\"A0N\">(a) <em>Expert Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Ford\u2019s assignments of error do not challenge the credentials of plaintiff\u2019s expert witness or question the admissibility of his testimony. Rather, Ford\u2019s position is that Divine\u2019s opinion concerning the cause of the accident \u201chas no probative value\u201d because it was based on speculation rather than facts in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s case,\u201d Ford contends, \u201cdepends upon Mr. Divine\u2019s analysis of the \u2018land\u2019 in the Ford transmission.\u201d Ford explains why it believes his analysis has no evidentiary merit. There was no evidence of \u201cobjective engineering standards governing the width of the land or any other aspect of transmission design\u201d and \u201cthe jury was not given any objective measure to apply\u201d. Divine\u2019s opinion that Ford\u2019s design was \u201cdangerous and unsafe\u201d and \u201cdoes not conform with what I consider to be . . . safe engineering standards\u201d was based upon a comparison with the design in only one other automobile, an Oldsmobile, \u201cwithout regard to what anyone else in the industry did.\u201d And, Ford complains, Divine \u201cdid not offer any test results to verify his theory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>As we read Divine\u2019s testimony, his analysis was not limited to the design of the land. In the course of his analysis, Divine studied instruction manuals and data compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; consulted with other experts; experimented with the transmission systems in plaintiff\u2019s Lincoln, a Cadillac, and his own Ford automobile; observed mechanics as they disassembled transmission components; and disassembled one transmission with his own hands. Describing himself as an \u201capplication engineer\u201d, Divine repeatedly explained that his opinion was based upon the experiments he conducted and upon an analysis of the interrelationship of all the components of the transmission linkage system \u2014 \u201cthe shift lever to the insert plate to the steering column, on down to the rooster comb.\u201d The dimension of the land, he said, was only \u201cone of the reasons\u201d that \u201cthe design of the Ford transmission . . . encourages the prudent operator to have the selector lever tang wind up on the land between reverse and park.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">To demonstrate the validity of his opinion, Divine used a mockup of the Ford transmission system introduced as an exhibit. In the experiments he had conducted on automobiles, he had found that vibration could cause a tang placed on the land to slip into the reverse detent. In the presence of the jury, he placed the tang on the land and vibrated the exhibit. The demonstration confirmed the results of his extra-judicial experiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">As Ford says, plaintiff introduced no evidence to show that Ford\u2019s design failed to satisfy \u201cobjective engineering standards\u201d. But the record indicates that safety standards for automatic transmission design had never been promulgated. Absent an established norm in the industry, it was a matter of opinion of trained experts what design was safe for its intended use.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Divine\u2019s opinion was that Ford\u2019s design was \u201cdangerous and unsafe\u201d. The opinion of Ford\u2019s experts was otherwise. But the contradiction does not nullify the probative value of Divine\u2019s opinion. We believe that his opinion was based upon a proper foundation and that it was for the jury to determine what weight to accord his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">(b) <em>Rule In Massie </em>v. <em>Firmstone</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Yet, Ford maintains that plaintiff cannot rely upon Divine\u2019s theory of causation, <em>viz., </em>that defective design had induced plaintiff not to shift fully into park, because plaintiff testified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>car <em>was </em>in park. Invoking the rule in <em>Massie </em>v. <em>Firmstone, </em>134 Va. 450, 114 S.E. 652 (1922), Ford says that plaintiff is bound by her testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The <em>Massie </em>doctrine is not to be read as a rule of thumb, categorical, absolute, and universally applicable. By definition, it applies only to \u201cstatements of fact\u201d made by the litigant, to statements of facts \u201cwithin his own knowledge\u201d, and to \u201cthe necessary inferences therefrom\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">It does not apply to statements of opinion. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\"><em>Baines </em>v. <em>Parker and Gladding, </em>217 Va. 100, 104, 225 S.E.2d 403, 406-07 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Moreover, when a litigant-witness explains or clarifies an adverse statement, his testimony must be considered as a whole, \u201c[a]nd it is generally for the jury to determine whether it will accept such explanation or clarification.\u201d <em>VEPCO </em>v. Mabin, 203 Va. 490, 494, 125 S.E.2d 145, 148 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Plaintiff testified on cross-examination that \u201c[a]s far as I am concerned it was in park.\u201d This clarifies her earlier testimony. Plaintiff took her car out of gear, moved the shift lever toward the park indicator, and applied the emergency brake. Since the brake could not be engaged with the car in an operating gear, and since the car remained stationary, plaintiff <em>thought </em>the car was in park. Given the facts within her knowledge, she was justified in that impression. Her impression proved to be a misimpression, caused by a lack of knowledge of physical facts essential to an informed opinion. Plaintiff did not know what the experts knew. She did not know that it was mechanically impossible for the transmission to \u201cjump\u201d out of park into reverse. She was not aware that the emergency brake could function when the tang was on the land or that vibration could cause a tang resting on the land to slip from that position into reverse gear. Her testimony that she placed the car in park was not a statement of fact within her knowledge but an expression of opinion, and we hold that the rule in <em>Massie </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">In our view, plaintiffs testimony describing what happened and Divine\u2019s testimony explaining why it happened is sufficient to prove primary negligence and causal connection. But that testimony does not stand alone. Indeed, the testimony of Ford\u2019s own experts tends to strengthen plaintiffs proof of defective design. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Although Ford\u2019s officials abandoned proposals to redesign the transmission because they proved to be ineffectual, the testimony of Ford\u2019s experts, reinforced by interoffice communications, reflects their concern that the original design was a contributing cause of accidents reported by Ford drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">We are of opinion that the testimonial, documentary, and demonstrative evidence, considered as a whole, constitutes a preponderance of proof in plaintiff\u2019s favor. Specifically, we hold that the evidence fully supports the jury\u2019s findings that Ford\u2019s transmission was not safely designed for its intended use; that the design defect substantially enhanced the danger of misuse and personal injury by leading an ordinarily prudent driver into a false sense of security; and that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were the proximate result of Ford\u2019s negligence in design.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">II. MISUSE AND CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Standing alone, such findings are not enough to establish liability. A defendant is not liable if the plaintiff was guilty of negligence which proximately contributed to his injury, and \u201cimplied warranty does not apply when the product is being used in a manner ... for which it was not intended.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Manning, Etc., </em>216 Va. 245, 252, 217 S.E.2d 863, 869 (1975). Invoking these two rules without distinction, Ford argues that plaintiff cannot recover because she \u201cmisused her vehicle and was contributorily negligent as a matter of law.\u201d In particular, Ford says that Divine\u2019s testimony shows that, while \u201cmillions of drivers accomplish the task of shifting each day without any difficulty\u201d, plaintiff \u201cmisplaced [the shift lever] somewhere between \u2018park\u2019 and \u2018reverse\u2019 \u201d; that she failed to \u201cjiggle\u201d the lever \u201cto be sure that the car was fully in park\u201d; that she left the motor running when she got out of the car; and that, but for such negligence, the accident \u201cwould not have happened\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Negligence, a breach of the duty of ordinary care under the circumstances, is a question of law only when it clearly appears that fair-minded jurors could not differ in resolving the question. Ford overlooks some of the facts and circumstances relevant to the question whether plaintiff exercised ordinary care in the use of her car. Even when the park gear was fully engaged, the gear indicator did not point directly to \u201cP\u201d. Aware of that fact, an ordinarily perceptive observer might be deceived by what he saw. There was \u201ca little bit of play\u201d in the shift lever, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>most dexterous operator might be unable to distinguish between \u201cplay\u201d and a \u201cjiggle\u201d. Plaintiff engaged the emergency brake, which was not designed to hold while the transmission was in a powered gear, and the car, positioned on a slope, remained stationary. Under such circumstances, it would not be an act of negligence for a driver to leave the motor running. Finally, whether plaintiff exercised ordinary care in the use of her automobile must be determined in light of the fact that she had been assured and repeatedly reassured by trained mechanics that her transmission was in proper working order.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Considering all the facts and circumstances, we agree with the trial judge that this was a jury question. And, since Ford does not challenge the court\u2019s instructions on this issue, we will not presume to substitute our judgment for that of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">III. DENIAL OF NEW TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">When the jury announced its verdict, Ford moved the court to set it aside and \u201cgrant a new trial on the issues of liability and compensatory damages\u201d on the ground the damage award \u201cwas so excessive as to be shocking and compel the conclusion that the jury misconceived or misunderstood the facts, the law, or the Instructions of the Court.\u201d The trial court denied the motion but ordered a remittitur which plaintiff accepted under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">On appeal, Ford argues that the court should have applied the rule in <em>Rawle </em>v. <em>McIlhenny, </em>163 Va. 735, 177 S.E. 214 (1934). There, a plaintiff moved to set aside a verdict on the ground the damage award was inadequate. The trial court granted the motion and ordered a new trial limited to damages. Summarizing the rules in five classes of cases, this Court said that when \u201cthe evidence warrants the inference that, instead of deciding the question of liability, the jury has arbitrarily determined to make both parties bear a part of the burden of the injury . . . [and] the court sets aside a verdict of this class, it should grant a new trial on \u00bf11 issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 750, 177 S.E. at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Obviously, when a plaintiff\u2019s damage award is so inadequate that it bespeaks a compromise verdict, the integrity of the jury\u2019s finding on liability is suspect, and the only just remedy is a trial <em>de novo. See Rome </em>v. <em>Kelly Springfield, </em>217 Va. 943, 234 S.E.2d 277 (1977). The same is true when the damage award is inadequate and the court concludes that \u201cthe merits of the case as to liability appear not to have been reasonably well developed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>upon the trial, or the question as to the amount of damages is not distinctly separable from the matters involved in the issue as to liability, or the evidence with reference to liability has probably exerted a material influence upon the jury in determining the amount of the verdict\u201d. <em>Rawle, </em>163 Va. at 750, 177 S.E. at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The rule applied in cases where the damage award is inadequate may also apply when the award is excessive. Thus, when the evidence does not preponderate in favor of either party and the damage award is so large that it appears to be solely the product of sympathy, the jury\u2019s finding on liability is impeached and the court should order a new trial on all issues. <em>Rutherford </em>v. <em>Zearfoss, </em>221 Va. 685, 272 S.E.2d 225 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">A trial <em>de novo </em>is not mandatory, however, when the monetary award, though out of proportion to the injuries suffered, is not so excessive as to compel the conclusion that the liability verdict was the product of sympathy for the plaintiff or bias against the defendant. In such case, if the evidence before the jury clearly supports its finding of liability, a trial judge has two options. He may put the plaintiff on terms to accept a remittitur in lieu of a new trial, Code \u00a7 8.01-383.1, or he may grant the defendant a new trial limited to damages, Code \u00a7 8.01-383. <em>Edmiston </em>v. <em>Kupsenel, </em>205 Va. 198, 202, 135 S.E.2d 777, 780 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In determining whether an excessive damage award requires a new trial on all issues, a new trial limited to damages, an order of remittitur, or a judgment confirming the award, a trial judge is vested with broad discretion, and we will not reverse his ruling unless the record plainly shows an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">In support of its argument that the excessive damage award was so great that it tainted the decision on liability, Ford charges that plaintiffs evidence and her attorney\u2019s opening argument were designed to persuade the jury that \u201cFord had made a cynical decision to sacrifice safety for profit.\u201d Ford insists that \u201cwhere the issues of liability and damages were not clearly separable, it is unrealistic to assume that a jury which is carried away by emotion as to damages will be dispassionate as to liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The trial judge believed the issues were separable. \u201cThe award,\u201d he said, \u201cis so out of proportion to the injuries suffered as to suggest that the award is not the product of a fair and impartial decision.\u201d But while the judge found that the jury\u2019s decision on the quantum of the award was disproportionate to the damages proved, he expressly ruled that \u201cthere is no reason to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>that an excessive damage award tainted the legitimacy of the jury\u2019s finding on liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The judge who conducted the trial was in a better position than we to make that determination, and, confined as we are to the printed record, we cannot say. that his ruling denying Ford\u2019s motion was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">IV. ASSIGNMENTS OF CROSS-ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"AKm\">(a) <em>Remittitur</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Addressing one of the issues raised by assignment of cross-error, plaintiff asks us to \u201creinstate the jury\u2019s verdict and enter final judgment\u201d because, she contends, \u201cthe judge\u2019s remittitur was an abuse of his discretion\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">In determining whether a trial judge has abused the discretion vouchsafed to him by the statutes and the common law we must examine the grounds upon which he based his order of remittitur. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">[Wjhen it appears from the record before us that the trial judge made a finding that the verdict was plainly excessive and remittitur should be ordered and that, in reaching his conclusion, he considered factors in evidence relevant to a reasoned evaluation of the damages incurred and to be incurred, his order will not be disturbed on appeal if the recovery after remittitur bears a reasonable relation to the damages disclosed by the evidence. \u201cReasonableness\u201d in this context is the standard by which the exercise of discretion must be tested in this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-9\"><em>Bassett Furniture </em>v. <em>McReynolds, </em>216 Va. 897, 911-12, 224 S.E.2d 323, 332 (1976) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">The record before us shows that the trial judge first made a finding that \u201ca $50,000 award in the instant case is excessive and unfair\u201d and \u201cshocks the conscience of the Court\u201d and then expressly articulated the factors in evidence upon which he based that finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">[Pjlaintiff incurred medical expenses of $292.10; she suffered the pain and emotional trauma of the car rolling over her leg, her anguish over the safety of her infant, an ugly and severe bruise, and several years of occasional discomfort. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>In addition she was inconvenienced in caring for her children and home. Plaintiff was not hospitalized, suffered no permanent injury and had no out of pocket expense other than the $292.10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">We believe that, in keeping with the rule in <em>Bassett Furniture, </em>the trial judge made a \u201creasoned evaluation of the damages\u201d and that \u201cthe recovery after remittitur bears a reasonable relation\u201d to those damages. Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs argument and her plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">(b) <em>Punitive Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Plaintiff maintains that the trial court erred in striking her claim for punitive damages. She argues that Ford, although aware of the danger inherent in the design defect, rejected the corrective modifications suggested by its own engineers and issued no warning to its customers other than an instruction in the owner\u2019s manual, \u201cWhenever the car is parked be sure the selector lever is in \u2018P\u2019 position.\u201d Such conduct, she says, was motivated by cost considerations and reflects \u201ca conscious disregard of the rights of others.\u201d The trial judge found that \u201cthe evidence was to the contrary, that cost was not a factor, that that did not enter into the decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The record supports that finding. Ford did not ignore customer complaints about the transmission. It dispatched engineers to investigate. While Ford drivers generally acknowledged that the cause of the problem was \u201ccustomer carelessness\u201d, the investigators recommended Ford consider design modifications. It was thought that the broad space required to print the letters of the word \u201cpark\u201d on the gear selector indicator might cause a driver to think his car was fully in park when the needle pointed to any of the four letters. To minimize the risk of such a misimpression, Ford redesigned the indicator by eliminating the last three letters of the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Two other proposals were outlined in a document prepared by the head of Ford\u2019s Project Development Group. To further reduce the risk of driver negligence in manipulating the shift lever, his report suggested that the land be widened. This suggestion was analyzed but rejected because the experts agreed that \u201c[t]he wider the land the more possibility it was, for the malfunction\u201d and \u201cit might provide a greater area to place the lever up on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>land, rather than putting it in the proper position.\u201d Ford conducted an experiment on another proposal. The land was tapered and sloped and the tang was chamfered. The theory was that such a design would make it impossible for a tang inadvertently placed on the land to remain there. But the experiment disproved the theory. The tang would not slide off the land because \u201ctwo pieces of steel that are sheared and rubbing together . . . will just hang.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">In support of her charge that cost considerations dictated Ford\u2019s design decisions, plaintiff relies solely upon two sentences at the foot of the Ford document: \u201cBased on cost and vehicle tryout, we will determine if the first proposal is satisfactory. If this is satisfactory, the second proposal will not be pursued past the layout steps.\u201d According to plaintiff, this proves that cost was \u201cthe first priority\u201d. In our view, the fair import of that language is that one proposal would be tested first; that if the vehicle tryout proved satisfactory but the cost was high, the other proposal would be evaluated; and that, if both proposals proved satisfactory, the comparative costs would be a relevant consideration. Our construction is reinforced by the testimony of the author of the language: \u201cThe cost was never a factor when safety was involved,\u201d he said. \u201c[A]nything that I thought was needed in the automobile was put in the automobile as long as it was under my control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">It is true, as plaintiff argued below, that a \u201cconscious disregard of the rights of others\u201d is \u201cone of the standards of punitive damages.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Jordan </em>v. <em>Sauve and Koons, </em>219 Va. 448, 247 S.E.2d 739 (1978). But we believe fair-minded jurors could not disagree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[a]t best, plaintiff established that defendant\u2019s corporate officers and employees erred in judgment resulting in simple negligence in design and negligent failure to correct or to warn.\u201d Consequently, we will uphold his ruling that plaintiff failed to carry her burden of showing that Ford \u201chad made a decision that [was] wanton, willful, malicious or in conscious disregard of the rights of others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Plaintiff also assigns cross-error to a ruling excluding certain written data offered to show that Ford\u2019s design was unsafe and to a ruling against an instruction defining an evidentiary presumption in her favor. In light of our holding that the evidence was sufficient to uphold the jury\u2019s finding of actionable primary negligence, we need not address these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Finding no reversible error in the court below, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\"> The shift control mechanism employs a stamped metal \u201cinsert plate\u201d mounted inside the steering column beneath the gear indicator. The edge of this plate has \u201cdetents\u201d or notches which correspond with the several gears and modes printed on the gear indicator. The detents for park and reverse are separated by a raised surface called the \u201cland\u201d. As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>driver moves the shift lever, a \u201ctang\u201d at the end of the lever moves across the land and lodges in the detent selected. A linkage system which runs down the inside of the steering column transmits this movement to the \u201crooster comb\u201d, a device containing detents which correlate to those on the insert plate. The expert witnesses agreed that it is mechanically impossible for such a transmission to \u201cjump\u201d out of park into reverse gear. The emergency park brake is designed to hold only when the transmission is in the park or neutral mode and to release when it is shifted to a powered gear, but Divine demonstrated that the brake would operate when the tang is placed on the land.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
