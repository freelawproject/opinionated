(Sea-Land), for its alleged breach of an employment contract and its alleged fraud in inducing O\u2019Neal to resign from, one position in return for a promise, never fulfilled, of employment in another. A jury awarded O\u2019Neal $125,000 in compensatory damages but denied her any punitive award. Sea-Land has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The record shows that O\u2019Neal was first employed by Sea-Land in 1970 as a teletype operator/messenger in its Portsmouth terminal. Through a series of promotions, she advanced to management level. At the time of the incidents in question, she occupied the position of sales representative in one of the company\u2019s divisions, earning in excess ofi$ 19,000 annually, with extensive fringe benefits. Her most recent performance appraisal was \u201cexcellent,\u201d and she intended to remain in Sea-Land\u2019s employ until retirement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In the performance appraisal form, a space was provided to indicate the \u201cperformance improvement plan\u201d the \u201cevaluator\u201d and the employee agreed upon \u201cfor the next year.\u201d One of the suggestions listed in this space on O\u2019Neal\u2019s appraisal form was that she \u201c[ajttend junior college - spring of summer 1978.\u201d It was O\u2019Neal\u2019s desire to secure a college education that brought about the incidents in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Stated in the light most favorable to O\u2019Neal, the evidence relating to these incidents shows that in late December, 1977, or the early part of January, 1978, O\u2019Neal learned that her old job of teletype operator/messenger was or soon would be vacant. This position required less travel than the sales representative job, and she believed it would permit her to attend school at night while providing her with sufficient funds to support herself until a better-paying position at Sea-Land became available.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She discussed the possibility of a transfer with James Chang, her immediate supervisor, with Ruby Porter, under whom she would work if transferred, and with Louis Nappi, the terminal manager whose approval of the transfer was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Chang, Porter, and Nappi all approved the transfer. They told O\u2019Neal, however, that she would have to resign from her position as sales representative before \u201cthey could officially say that [she] had the teletype and messenger job.\u201d Nappi expressly stated to O\u2019Neal that she \u201ccould have the other job\u201d if she \u201cturned the letter [of resignation] in.\u201d Accordingly, on Friday, January 13, O\u2019Neal signed and delivered to Chang a letter in which she resigned as sales representative and accepted the teletype position. At an operational sales meeting held in the office the same day and attended by O\u2019Neal, Chang announced that she was leaving his division and Nappi stated that she \u201cwould be taking the teletype and the messenger\u2019s job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">When O\u2019Neal reported for work Monday morning, Nappi informed her she \u201ccould not have the job\u201d as teletype operator/messenger because she was \u201cover qualified [and] all he needed was somebody with two legs and a driver\u2019s license.\u201d When she asked him why he was \u201cdoing this,\u201d he replied that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have time to be bothered with [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">O\u2019Neal then telephoned Charles Hauser, Chang\u2019s superior in Jacksonville, Florida, and asked whether she could retract her letter of resignation. He agreed to look into the matter, but told her afterward that \u201cit was too late\u201d to retract the letter. Hauser did tell her \u201cnot to worry about it,\u201d for there were \u201ca couple other positions that might be coming open,\u201d and he would be \u201cgetting back to [her].\u201d No other offers of employment with Sea-Land developed, however, and O\u2019Neal\u2019s last day of work was March 10, 1978, after she had spent eight weeks training her replacement. At the time of trial, she was employed as a \u201csales representative\u201d in a furniture store, working on a \u201cstraight commission\u201d basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">On appeal, Sea-Land assigns ten separate errors and condenses them into these four questions, as quoted from its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">I. Whether Nancy O\u2019Neal had an employment contract with the defendant and if she did what was the nature of the contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">II. Whether the evidence was sufficient as a matter of law to permit Nancy O\u2019Neal\u2019s claim of fraud and deceit to go to the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">III. Whether the matter of damages was properly submitted to the jury under either the contract or the fraud and deceit theories?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>IV. Whether, if either . . . Nancy O\u2019Neal\u2019s contract or tort claim is deficient, the rendering of a general verdict requires remand?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">With respect to the contract question, Sea-Land first complains of the trial court\u2019s failure \u201cto require Mrs. O\u2019Neal to identify and describe the contract which she alleged was breached by [Sea-Land].\u201d Sea-Land points out that, in her motion for judgment, O\u2019Neal alleged the breach of a \u201ccontract of employment,\u201d and later, in response to an interrogatory seeking the terms of the contract, she identified two contracts of employment, \u201c#1\u201d being the contract covering her position as a sales representative, and \u201c#2\u201d the agreement under which she \u201cwas to be\u201d a teletype operator/messenger. When Sea-Land moved to compel O\u2019Neal to provide \u201cmore specific answers as to the contract,\u201d the court deferred the motion to the date of trial. Then, at trial, Sea-Land claims, the court not only failed to require O\u2019Neal to identify further the contract she .relied upon but also permitted her to inject a third contract, <em>viz, </em>an \u201cagreement to exchange one job for the other.\u201d This action of the court, Sea-Land maintains, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">We disagree with Sea-Land. It argued below that the contract O\u2019Neal asserted at trial was not \u201cthe contract . . . sued on,\u201d that the \u201csuit speaks in terms of a contract of employment,\u201d and that O\u2019Neal had changed her position \u201cto say it\u2019s a contract to exchange jobs.\u201d We fail to see, however, why a contract to exchange jobs should not be considered a contract of employment; indeed, we do not believe it can logically be considered otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Furthermore, O\u2019Neal\u2019s identification at trial of a contract to exchange jobs did not constitute the allegation of a third contract or even of a new theory. In her answers to interrogatories, O\u2019Neal stated that, under position \u201c#2\u201d she \u201cwas to be\u201d a teletype operator/messenger, that this represented a \u201cswitch from management to [non-management] status,\u201d and that upon assuming her duties \u201cunder #2 [she] was to relinquish [her] position under #1.\u201d These statements were sufficient to apprise Sea-Land of O\u2019Neal\u2019s theory of a contract based upon an exchange of positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">But, Sea-Land argues, under all the alleged contracts, the \u201cemployments involved were terminable at the will of either plaintiff or defendant and thus were indefinite as to duration\u201d; accordingly, \u201cthere was no contract whatsoever.\u201d O\u2019Neal admitted at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>trial, Sea-Land says, that there were \u201cno \u2018terms\u2019 as to the duration of her contract\u201d of employment, either as a sales representative or as a teletype opera tor/messenger, and that there was \u201cno limitation on [Sea-Land\u2019s] right to terminate her employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">In a case cited by Sea-Land, we recognized that, where no specific time is fixed for the duration of employment, it is presumed to be an employment terminable at will, providing a dismissed employee no basis for recovery of damages against his erstwhile employer. <em>Hoffman Company </em>v. <em>Pelouze, </em>158 Va. 586, 164 S.E. 397 (1932). We said, however, that \u201cthis presumption ... is rebuttable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 164 S.E. at 399. We held that the presumption was rebutted in <em>Hoffman </em>by \u201cthe interpretation which the parties themselves placed upon the matter\u201d; although the employer \u201cundoubtedly had the right to terminate the -contract at any time without more ado,\u201d it did not do so, but asked the employee by letter to submit his resignation and \u201cthrew out to him the gratuity of more than a month\u2019s salary as an inducement.\u201d This, we said, \u201cdoes not import overmuch confidence in [the employer\u2019s] contention that the contract was of indefinite duration and so terminable at will.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Here, as in Hoffman, although Sea-Land may have had the right to terminate O\u2019Neal\u2019s employment at will either while she was still a sales representative or in the event she became a teletype operator/messenger, the company did not dismiss her this way. Instead, it promised her that, if she resigned from the one position, she would be employed in the other. This was an undertaking separate and apart from any contract covering the particular position involved and was not subject to any presumption of terminability at will that might have applied to such a contract. Once O\u2019Neal performed her part of the bargain by resigning from the first position, Sea-Land became obligated to perform on its part and breached that obligation to her damage when it refused to employ her in the teletype operator/messenger position.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Sea-Land suggests, however, that this separate agreement was not supported by a valid consideration. Sea-Land cites <em>Tow </em>v. <em>Miners Memorial Hospital Association, Inc., </em>199 F. Supp. 926 (S.D. W. Va. 1961), <em>aff'd, </em>305 F.2d 73 (4th Cir. 1962), a case interpreting West Virginia law, which Sea-Land says is \u201cclosely analogous to the present matter.\u201d In Sea-Land\u2019s words, <em>Tow </em>stands for the proposition that \u201cthe surrender by the employee of former employment as a necessary incident to the acceptance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>new employment is not such consideration as will make the contract of employment anything other than terminable at will.\u201d The court did say this was the law in West Virginia; however, it stated that \u201cthe rule in Virginia is to the contrary,\u201d 199 F. Supp. at 937, citing <em>Twohy </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>194 Va. 69, 72 S.E.2d 329 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><em>Twohy </em>involved an employee who threatened to resign because of inadequate compensation. The employer promised to hold certain corporate stock for the benefit of the employee if he would agree to continue his employment. We held that the employer\u2019s promise concerning the stock was supported by consideration when the employee refrained from exercising his right to resign and continued to perform the services required of him. We quoted with approval the rule that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">[W]here one makes a promise conditioned upon the doing of an act by another, and the latter does the act, the contract is not void for want of mutuality, and the promisor is liable .... [U]pon the performance of the condition by the promisee, the contract becomes clothed with a valid consideration which renders the promise obligatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">194 Va. at 81, 72 S.E.2d at 336. We believe this rule is applicable to the present case and demonstrates that O\u2019Neal\u2019s act of resigning furnished adequate consideration for Sea-Land\u2019s promise to employ her in the teletype operator/messenger position.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">As a corollary to its contract argument, Sea-Land contends that the trial court erred in granting Instruction No. 4. This instruction permitted the jury to find a plaintiffs verdict if it believed O\u2019Neal and Sea-Land entered into \u201can employment agreement whereby [she] was to resign as sales representative and be employed as teletype operator and messenger.\u201d Sea-Land objected to the instruction on the ground that it \u201cassumes existence of a contract which has never been proven.\u201d Because, as we have demonstrated, O\u2019Neal did prove the existence of the contract specified in Instruction No. 4, we hold that the granting of the instruction was not error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Sea-Land contends that O\u2019Neal failed, as a matter of law, to establish fraud by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. Sea-Land points out that O\u2019Neal alleged the fraud was intentional and with malice; intentional fraud \u201cconsists of deception, intentionally practiced, to induce another to part with property or to surrender some legal right, and which accomplishes the end designed.\u201d Further, Sea-Land maintains, an action of fraud cannot be based upon a statement or promise relating to future events. Yet, Sea-Land asserts, O\u2019Neal failed to show any intentional act on its part, to establish that any of its representatives bore her any ill will, or to prove that anyone made her a promise based upon existing or past events.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">A case called to our attention by Sea-Land provides a complete answer to this argument. Sea-Land cites <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>150 Va. 132, 142 S.E. 363 (1928), for the proposition that \u201can action based upon fraud must aver the misrepresentation of present [or] pre-existing facts, and cannot ordinarily be predicated on unfulfilled promises or statements as to future events.\u201d 150 Va. at 145, 142 S.E. at 365. We opined further that, \u201c[w]ere the general rule otherwise, every breach of contract could be made the basis of an action in tort for fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, in the very next paragraph of the opinion, we said this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">There are, however, some real and apparent exceptions. The courts are not agreed as to all of these exceptions, but there is much authority to the effect that an action in tort for deceit and fraud may sometimes be predicated on promises which are made with a present intention not to perform them .... It has been stated that the gist of fraud in such case is not the breach of the agreement to perform, but the fraudulent intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\"><em>Id. See also Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 530 comment c (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The evidence in this case clearly, cogently, and convincingly supports the conclusion that, when Nappi told O\u2019Neal she \u201ccould have the [teletype operator/messenger] job\u201d if she \u201cturned [in] the letter [of resignation from the sales representative position],\u201d he made this promise with the then present intention not to perform it. Hence, O\u2019Neal proved her allegation of intentional fraud, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>and it was not error for the trial court to submit the fraud question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">With respect to the damage issue, the trial court granted Instruction No. 8, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">The Court instructs the jury that if, from the evidence and the other instructions of the Court, you find your verdict in favor of the plaintiff for compensatory damages, then in assessing the damages to which she is entitled, you may take into consideration any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">1. Any loss of severance pay and any loss of earnings in the past and any loss of earnings she may reasonably be expected to sustain in the future;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">2. Any other financial losses directly related to the loss of a job with the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">3. Any damage caused by embarrassment or humiliation resulting from the loss of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">And from these as proven by the evidence, your verdict should be for such sum as will fully and fairly compensate the plaintiff for the damages sustained by her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">In the court below, Sea-Land confined its objections concerning this instruction to those portions permitting the jury to award damages for future loss of earnings and for embarrassment and humiliation. Consequently, we will confine our consideration to the same portions and the same objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">Regarding future loss of earnings, Sea-Land argued below that Instruction No. 8 permitted the jury to speculate because there was no evidence of any future loss nor were there any facts upon which the jury could intelligently assess the loss. Particularizing, Sea-Land told the court there was no evidence \u201cas to [O\u2019Neal\u2019s] future working life\u201d and no showing she would remain in Sea-Land\u2019s employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">It is true that O\u2019Neal did not introduce any specific evidence to establish the span of her \u201cworking life.\u201d She did tell the jury, however, that she was thirty-nine years old and that she intended to work until she was at least fifty-five. This testimony would have permitted the jury to make an informed and reasonable estimate of the duration of O\u2019Neal\u2019s \u201cworking life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>O\u2019Neal also testified that she intended to remain in Sea-Land\u2019s employ until she retired. Sea-Land argues, however, that, although the trial court failed to require O\u2019Neal to specify what contract she relied upon and, further, even instructed the jury on a contract \u201cnever described,\u201d her employment was terminable at will under all the alleged agreements. Hence, Sea-Land says, there was nothing to support an award for future loss of earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">But, as we demonstrated in Part I, <em>supra, </em>the so-called \u201cnever described\u201d contract was properly submitted to the jury. We noted further that this contract carried no presumption of terminability at will and that Sea-Land breached the contract when it refused to employ O\u2019Neal in the teletype operator/messenger position.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Considering O\u2019Neal\u2019s age, the past recognition of the quality of her work, and her intention to remain in Sea-Land\u2019s employ, we believe there was an adequate basis for the jury to determine a reasonable period during which O\u2019Neal would have continued in Sea-Land\u2019s employ as a teletype operator/messenger, had she been given that position. Hence, she was entitled to have the jury consider whether she suffered damage for future loss of earnings on her breach of contract theory.</p>\n<p id=\"AqW\">On her tort theory, however, O\u2019Neal was entitled to have the jury consider damages resulting from future loss of earnings based upon her former position as a sales representative. After all, it was that position from which she resigned as a result of Sea-Land\u2019s trickery. Of course, she could not recover the same damages twice, once on a contract basis and once on a tort theory, but the jury was warned against this sort of duplication in an instruction granted at Sea-Land\u2019s request.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aaz\">Concerning the portion of Instruction No. 8 which permitted the jury to award \u201cdamage caused by embarrassment or humiliation resulting from the loss of employment,\u201d Sea-Land objected below on the ground there was no \u201cphysical harm sustained by [O\u2019Neal]\u201d and \u201cno evidence concerning intent or ill will\u201d on Sea-Land\u2019s part which would support such an award.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Citing D. Dobbs, <em>Handbook on the Law of Remedies </em>\u00a7 12.25 (1973), Sea-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Land argues \u201c[i]t is settled law that an employee cannot recover damages from an employer in a breach of contract for humiliation or injury to feelings.\u201d Then, citing <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>May, </em>159 Va. 419, 166 S.E. 550 (1932), Sea-Land maintains there can be no recovery of damages for harm to feelings in the absence of physical injury or wanton or willful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Sea-Land\u2019s analysis of Dobbs\u2019 views is correct as far as it goes. What the author actually says is that, \u201cabsent some tort,\u201d damages for \u201chumiliation or injury to feelings\u201d are not recoverable in an action for breach of contract. D. Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.25, at 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Sea-Land does state correctly the general rule applicable to tort cases that, absent proof of physical injury or wanton or willful conduct, there can be no recovery of damages for mental anguish, emotional distress, or humiliation. As with most general rules, however, there are recognized exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">We established in Part II, <em>supra, </em>that Sea-Land committed an intentional tort against O\u2019Neal. Previously, in at least five classes of cases involving intentional torts, we have approved the recovery of damages for humiliation, embarrassment, and similar harm to feelings, although unaccompanied by actual physical injury, <em>where a cause of action existed independently of such harm. </em>The cases and the torts are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\"><em>Peshine </em>v. <em>Shepperson, </em>58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 472, 486 (1867) (deliberate trespass); <em>Ches. &amp; Pot. Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Carless, </em>127 Va. 5, 9, 102 S.E. 569, 570 (1920) (wrongful suspension of telephone service); <em>W. T. Grant Co. </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>149 Va. 906, 925, 141 S.E. 860, 866 (1928) (false imprisonment); <em>James </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>154 Va. 96, 117, 152 S.E. 539, 547 (1930) (libel); and <em>Spitzer </em>v. <em>Clatterbuck, </em>202 Va. 1001, 1006-07, 121 S.E.2d 466, 469-70 (1961) (malicious prosecution).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">By way of comparison, the potential for distress to O\u2019Neal from the loss of her job through Sea-Land\u2019s trickery was not substantially less than the harm caused by the torts involved in the cases cited above. Similarly, the wrong committed by Sea-Land was not materially less egregious than the conduct of at least several of the defendants involved in the earlier decisions. In this case as well as each of those cited, harm to the feelings of the prospective victim was readily foreseeable. We perceive no logical reason, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>therefore, to permit recovery of distress damages there and to deny similar damages here.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Finally, Sea-Land contends that, because the jury returned a general verdict, the judgment appealed from must be reversed and the case remanded \u201cif this court determines that either the contract claim or fraud claim is deficient . . . .\u201d Having determined that neither claim is deficient, and finding that Sea-Land has failed to demonstrate reversible error otherwise, we will aifirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\"> O\u2019Neal was 39 years old at time of trial and would have been eligible to retire at age 55-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b376-10\"> The teletype operator/messenger job paid $168.68 per 35-hour week, with the opportunity for overtime pay.. . \u25a0</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\"> Sea-Land originally assigned error to the refusal of its proffered Instruction No. Al, relating to the terminability at will of an employment contract of indefinite duration.
