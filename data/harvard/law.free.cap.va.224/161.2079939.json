Smolka\u2019s license to practice law. We address two assignments of error: whether our Rule 6:IV:K13(B)(2), 217 Va. 155, 174-75 (1976), setting forth the Bar Committee\u2019s duty to investigate is in the nature of venue or subject matter jurisdiction, and whether a prior circuit court judgment limits the Board\u2019s factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Smolka was a Norfolk attorney and held a license to sell real estate. Busch Properties, Inc. (Busch) employed him as a sales agent to sell lots in its Kingsmill subdivision in James City County. Smolka had access to Busch\u2019s Kingsmill offices. A dispute arose between Smolka and Busch over Smolka\u2019s commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">On December 2, 1978, Smolka removed two typewriters and two electric calculators valued at $2,270 from Busch\u2019s office and took them to his Norfolk law office. He used them approximately three months until a James City County investigator discovered and seized them on February 24, 1979. Smolka falsely explained that he had bought them at a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Smolka was indicted in the Circuit Court for the City of Williamsburg and the County of James City for statutory burglary with the intent to commit larceny and grand larceny. Before trial, Smolka and the prosecutor made a plea agreement. Smolka agreed to plead guilty to the statutory burglary indictment if the Commonwealth submitted a plea of <em>nolle prosequi </em>on the grand larceny charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The court accepted the plea agreement, found Smolka guilty of statutory burglary, and ordered a presentence report. Based on the report and counsel\u2019s argument, the court reconsidered and vacated its prior finding. Instead, it found Smolka guilty of trespass and sentenced him to twelve months in jail, with all but one month suspended. Smolka served the one-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">The Second District Committee<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> certified Smolka\u2019s misconduct for a hearing before the Board. On March 27, 1980, the Board heard the evidence and counsel\u2019s argument. It found that Smolka <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>had violated Disciplinary Rules (DR) 1-102(A)(1), (3), (5), and (6)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> set forth in the Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility, and by formal order of April 7, 1980, suspended his license for four years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ***56*8</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Thereafter, Smolka filed a petition with the Board contending for the first time that the Second District Committee had no jurisdiction to certify the matter to the Board. He requested the Board to remand the case to the First District Committee. The Board denied the petition. Smolka appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">I. <em>Jurisdiction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The Second District Committee\u2019s duty to investigate stems from Rule 6:IV:1il3(B)(2), 217 Va. at 174-75. The Rule states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\"><em>Duties of Committee: </em>It shall be the duty of each Committee to receive and investigate all charges of Misconduct against any Attorney (a) when the Misconduct occurs in its district or (b) when the Attorney resides in or maintains an office in its district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">If two or more Committees may have jurisdiction to investigate the same charge of alleged Misconduct, the Committee of the district where the offense occurs shall have jurisdiction;. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Smolka relies upon what he says is the mandatory language of the Rule\u2019s second paragraph. Complaining that the alleged misconduct occurred in James City County, he insists that only the First District Committee had jurisdiction to investigate. When the Second District Committee investigated, it violated the mandatory jurisdictional requirements. The Board never had the authority to entertain the case when the Second District Committee certified it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>and, thus, should have remanded it to the First District Committee. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Larceny is a continuing offense. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cousins, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 708 (1830). <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When Smolka took the typewriters and calculators, he placed them in his Norfolk office. For nearly three months he used them in his law practice. This constitutes misconduct occurring in Norfolk. The Second District Committee could investigate based on this misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Even if this were not so, we interpret the rule\u2019s jurisdictional requirements as involving venue and not subject-matter jurisdiction. A provision may use the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in the sense that the court has territorial jurisdiction over the subject matter, meaning that the court is the proper venue. <em>See Moore </em>v. <em>N. &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>124 Va. 628, 635, 98 S.E. 635, 637 (1919). (\u201cJurisdiction\u201d used in Code \u00a7 3214 of the Code of 1904 is in the nature of venue.) In <em>Southern Etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Massaponax Corp., </em>145 Va. 317, 326, 133 S.E. 812, 814 (1926), we construed former Code \u00a7\u00a7 6318 and 6321, stating that \u201c[wjhile these sections use the word \u2018jurisdiction,\u2019 they merely fix the \u2018venue\u2019.\u201d We interpret the use of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in Rule 6:IV1T13(B)(2) as establishing the territorial jurisdiction, or venue, of the Committee. The provision in no way limits the Board\u2019s authority to determine cases of attorney misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Ordinarily, venue is waived if the defendant does not make a timely objection. Code \u00a7 8.01-264. T. Boyd, E. Graves, and L. Middleditch, Jr., <em>Virginia Civil Procedure </em>\u00a7 5.6 (1982). This concept is implicit in Rule 6:IV:1113(C)(5), 217 Va. at 178, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Upon certification by a Committee of a charge of Misconduct ... the Board . . . shall cause to be served by certified mail on the Attorney involved a clear and concise statement of the alleged Misconduct. The Attorney may, within twenty-one days after such mailing, (a) file his answer which shall be conclusively deemed to be a consent to the jurisdiction of the Board. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Because Smolka filed his answer, he waived his privilege to assert lack of venue. Smolka waited until after the Board\u2019s adverse decision to state his objection to venue. His objection was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">II. <em>Effect of Prior Judicial Determination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Smolka assigns error to the Board\u2019s finding that his actions constituted misconduct in violation of DR 1-102(A)(1), (3), (5), and (6). He insists that the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that he committed mere trespass is binding on the Board and th^t the Board may not reexamine his conduct, but must accept the circuit court\u2019s determination. We find Smolka\u2019s position incorrect and without legal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">We find no Virginia case on this point; however, the majority of courts elsewhere have concluded that an acquittal in a criminal proceeding presents no bar to a disciplinary proceeding arising out of substantially the same facts. <em>See </em>Annot., 76 A.L.R.3d 1028, 1033 \u00a7 3 (1977). The rationale which underlies this distinction is that the purpose of the disciplinary proceeding is not to punish, but to protect the public from unfit members of the bar. <em>Blue </em>v. <em>Seventh District </em>Committee, 220 Va. 1056, 265 S.E.2d 753 (1980); <em>Wilder </em>v. Committee, 219 Va. 175, 247 S.E.2d 355 (1978).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">A recent California case, <em>In Re </em>Hurwitz, 17 Cal.3d 562, 551 P.2d 1234, 131 Cal. Rptr. 402 (1976), is factually similar to the case at bar. Hurwitz was attempting to burglarize his client\u2019s house when neighbors observed and stopped him. Hurwitz was carrying a crowbar and gave various contradictory explanations for his presence in the house. The police discovered pry marks on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the front door and papers scattered on the floor of a back room. Originally indicted for burglary, a felony, Hurwitz was found guilty of unauthorized entry, a misdemeanor. The Disciplinary Board found that he committed an offense involving moral turpitude or misconduct and disbarred him. The California Supreme Court independently reviewed the record. It stated that, even though the jury had acquitted Hurwitz of the burglary charge and convicted him of the lesser included offense, that action was not conclusive upon the issue of his fitness to practice law. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 551 P.2d at 1237, 131 Cal. Rptr. at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">W\u00e9 hold that the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that Smolka\u2019s offense did not rise above trespass in no way precluded the Board from independently examining the matter and reaching a determination of misconduct. Accordingly, we will order that Smolka\u2019s license to practice law in the Commonwealth of Virginia be suspended for four years. This suspension shall begin on November 1, 1982. Further, Smolka shall give notice, by certified mail, of his suspension to all his current clients, to all opposing attorneys, and to all judges presiding in pending litigation. Smolka shall make immediate appropriate arrangements for the disposition of those matters presently in his care in conformity with his clients\u2019 wishes and shall comply with the Order of the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Board entered in this matter April 7, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The order appealed from will be</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\"> Rule 6:IV:H5, 216 Va. 941, 1143 (1976), provides in pertinent part that \u201cthe powers of the Virginia State Bar shall be exercised by a Council.\u201d Rule 6:IV:1il3(B)(l)(a) provides that \u201cCouncil shall appoint a District Committee for each congressional district of the State.\u201d 217 Va. 155, 174 (1976).
