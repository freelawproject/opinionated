EYLER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">Charles Stanley, appellant, was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of possessing a firearm after having been previously convicted of a crime of violence and discharging a firearm within the City of Baltimore. The trial court sentenced appellant to a term of five years\u2019 incarceration without the possibility of parole for the firearm possession and to a concurrent sentence of time served for the conviction of discharging a firearm. Appellant presents two questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>I. Did the trial court err in admitting evidence that appellant was previously convicted of a crime of violence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">II. Did the trial court impose an illegal sentence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Perceiving no error, we affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">At approximately 3:00 on the morning of October 30, 2001, Baltimore City Police Officer Joe DiCandaloro went to 4114 Haywood Avenue in Baltimore City in response to a call for discharging of a firearm. He approached appellant, who was at that address, and asked if he had a weapon inside the house. Appellant told the officer that he had a handgun inside his house, but that he had dropped it into the heating duct. Appellant took the officer into the basement, where the officer ripped out a piece of the heating duct and recovered a loaded .32-caliber handgun. The gun had four rounds of ammunition and two empty shell cases in the cylinder. Appellant told the officer that he had fired the gun twice outside his bedroom window to see if the gun was operational.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">A true-test copy of appellant\u2019s prior conviction for second degree assault was admitted into evidence without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">On cross-examination, Officer DiCandaloro testified that he initially charged appellant with unlawful firing of a firearm in the City of Baltimore and possession of a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a misdemeanor assault, in violation of an <em>ex parte </em>order. The officer acknowledged that he initially charged appellant with a misdemeanor for the gun possession, but that appellant\u2019s current charge was a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">Appellant sought jury nullification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He testified that he was 57 years old, that he was retired from General Motors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>where he had worked for thirty years, and that he had three grown children.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Appellant said that he bought a handgun and, after drinking, he wanted to see if the gun worked. He said that he fired the gun out of his back window, then threw it in the corner. He recounted that the police officer came the next morning and he decided to give up the gun because \u201cI didn\u2019t want nobody to get hurt -with it and I didn\u2019t want the gun anymore.\u201d He related that, when the officer asked about the gun, he decided \u201chere\u2019s my chance to do the right thing, and [he] told him the truth.\u201d He said that he told the officer he had fired the gun, but was sorry, and that he did not want to hurt anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Appellant discussed a previous conviction for second degree assault. He related that his son \u201cwas trying to put [him] out of the house.\u201d He said that his son was \u201ca big guy,\u201d and that he had not hit his son but \u201cjust had him by the legs.\u201d Appellant explained, with regard to the <em>ex parte </em>order, that he was supposed to stay out of his house. He also told the jury, however, that he and his wife were back together and \u201ceverything [was] fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor elicited that the incident in which he was convicted of second-degree assault on his son was separate from the assault conviction based on violation of an <em>ex parte </em>order.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Prior to trial, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">THE COURT: Do you have to offer the prior conviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amp0\">[PROSECUTOR]: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">THE COURT: That is what I thought you did, that is my understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: In this case, since we are trying this case alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">THE COURT: Now how much do you think people can get into what it really was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: I do not think they are supposed to get into what it was, it does not matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-12\">THE COURT: It is going to be\u2014it is going to read off the record as what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Assault, second-degree assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-14\">THE COURT: Second-degree assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-15\">THE COURT: Yes, which is a statutory crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdS\">THE COURT: All right, and which is a legal\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: See, I do not understand\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-17\">THE COURT:\u2014dispute in terms of what it means in the statute, but that is the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-18\">[PROSECUTOR]: That is why I kind of object to that question, because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-19\">THE COURT: What was the date of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-20\">[PROSECUTOR]: I think it was 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-21\">THE COURT: Is it that recent? I thought it was older, but maybe I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-22\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think that\u2014oh, well, second degree assault was added in 1996 because that is when they broke assault into degrees. Before, it was just generally assault and battery common law. But that part, the thing that defines crime of violence, that has been around since, I think the 1970\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Actually, it might be even later than that, 1999\u20141999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">THE COURT: What were the facts? Are you going to try to offer the facts of that assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It was domestic violence. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Because there are three really that are connected to it. I am only offering one because that is all I need in my statutory verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">THE COURT: I mean, there are cases that clearly say, as I recall from reading them, that you are allowed to do that and there is not reversible error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: That is the only way to prove the case in this situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">A short while later, the issue was revisited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFn\">[PROSECUTOR]: It is an essential element of the State\u2019s proving and it is case law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">THE COURT: Right, and I think that is the case law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALZv\">[PROSECUTOR]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I know, but I do not see how anybody can get a fair trial if that is what the law is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQk\">THE COURT: Look, I am happy to tell you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I know, I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-13\">THE COURT: You have reserved (sic) the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">Appellant contends that this Court should recognize plain error and reverse appellant\u2019s convictions because at the time of his trial, this Court had decided <em>Carter v. State, </em>145 Md.App. 195, 802 A.2d 460 (2002), but that case was reversed by the Court of Appeals after appellant\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He asserts that, in <em>Carter, </em>\u201cthis Court held that the State had a right to disclose to the jury both the fact that the prior conviction was for a crime of violence and the name of the offense of which the defendant had [been] previously convicted.\u201d He argues that, \u201c[w]ith this Court\u2019s <em>Carter </em>acting as the last word on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>issue, it is unlikely that the trial judge would have been willing to give relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Plain Error</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Plain error is error which \u201cvitally affects a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>Clermont v. State, 348 </em>Md. 419, <em>433, 704 </em>A.2d 880 (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>523 U.S. 1141, 118 S.Ct. 1849, 140 L.Ed.2d 1098 (1998); <em>Richmond v. State, </em>330 Md. 223, 236, 623 A.2d 630 (1993) (citation omitted). An appellate court should take cognizance of unpreserved error only in those instances which are \u201ccompelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.\u201d <em>Richmond, </em>330 Md. at 236, 623 A.2d 630 (citation omitted). There is no \u201cfixed formula for determining when we should exercise our discretion.\u201d <em>Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 588, 602 A.2d 677 (1992) (citation omitted). The Court of Appeals has stated, \u201cwe do expect that the appellate court would review the materiality of the error in the context in which it arose, giving due regard to whether the error was purely technical, the product of conscious design or trial tactics or the result of bald inattention,\u201d and has observed that such factors \u201care ordinarily inconsistent with circumstances justifying an appellate court\u2019s intervention\u2019 under plain error.\u201d <em>Rubin, 325 </em>Md. at 588, 602 A.2d 677 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\n<em>Carter v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In <em>Carter, </em>Antwon Leroy Carter was charged with possession of a regulated firearm by one previously convicted of a crime of violence, possession of a regulated firearm by a person under the age of twenty-one, and unlawful discharge of a firearm within the City of Baltimore. <em>Carter, </em>145 Md.App. at 200, 802 A.2d 460. Carter requested that the trial court not inform the jury that he had been previously convicted of a crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>at 200-02, 802 A.2d 460. When the trial court rejected that request, Carter offered to stipulate that he had been convicted of a crime of violence to prevent the State from offering evidence that his prior conviction was for rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>bery with a deadly weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 202, 802 A.2d 460. That offer, too, was rejected. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">On appeal, Carter contended that the trial court erred in permitting the State to disclose to the jury evidence of his prior conviction for robbery with a deadly weapon, asserting that \u201c[o]nce the defense indicated that it was willing to stipulate to the existence of that conviction, the State had no legitimate need for the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203, 802 A.2d 460. Carter also argued that the trial court\u2019s refusal to exclude evidence of the prior conviction constituted an abuse of that discretion because, \u201c[gjiven the defense counsel\u2019s willingness to concede the existence of the prior conviction, it was simply unnecessary to apprise the jury of this prejudicial element.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203-04, 802 A.2d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">After reviewing case law from other jurisdictions, we concluded that it was not error for the trial court to allow the State to inform the jury that a defendant had previously been convicted of a crime that disqualified him from possessing a gun. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 802 A.2d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">We then considered whether the trial court erred in permitting the State to disclose the <em>nature </em>of the prior conviction to the jury, in addition to the <em>fact </em>of the prior conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 224, 802 A.2d 460. We discussed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997), involving an appeal of a conviction for possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony. Prior to trial, Old Chief moved to preclude the government from mentioning any prior convictions at his trial, except to state that he \u201chad been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one (1) year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 117 S.Ct. 644. Old Chief also agreed to stipulate to the fact of that conviction. <em>Id. </em>The trial court refused to require the government to join in the stipulation. <em>Id. </em>at 177, 117 S.Ct. 644. Old Chief was convicted, and his appeal ultimately reached the United States Supreme Court. That Court concluded that the trial court erred in not requiring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>government to accept Old Chiefs stipulation. The Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">[T]here can be no question that evidence of the name or nature of the prior offense generally carries a risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant. That risk will vary from case to case, for the reasons already given, but will be substantial whenever the official record offered by the Government would be arresting enough to lure a juror into a sequence of bad character reasoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\"><em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 185, 117 S.Ct. 644. The Court went on to say, \u201cThe most the jury needs to know is that the conviction admitted by the defendant falls within the class of crimes that Congress thought should bar a convict from possessing a gun, and this point may be made readily in a defendant\u2019s admission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190-91, 117 S.Ct. 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In <em>Carter, </em>we recognized the danger with which the Supreme Court was concerned. \u201cIt is well established in Maryland that evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior crime can tempt the jury into convicting the defendant because he has committed bad acts in the past rather than because the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>145 Md.App. at 229-30, 802 A.2d 460. After reviewing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Old Chief, </em>we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">We, too, agree with the majority in <em>Old Chief </em>that when a defendant\u2019s legal status is an element of the crime, and the defendant offers to stipulate and disclose to the jury that legal status, the trial court should perform a Md. Rule 5-403 balancing test before admitting evidence of the name or nature of the previous conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 229, 802 A.2d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Analyzing the specifics of Carter\u2019s case, we concluded that the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the state to inform the jury that Carter was previously convicted of robbery with a deadly weapon did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 234-35, 802 A.2d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">The Maryland Court of Appeals granted <em>certiorari. See Carter v. State, </em>371 Md. 261, 808 A.2d 806 (2002). It agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>with this Court that the jury should be told of the prior conviction. <em>Carter v. State, </em>374 Md. 693, 714, 824 A.2d 123 (2003). It disagreed, however, that admission of the name or nature of the prior conviction should fall within the trial court\u2019s discretion. After discussing decisions in other jurisdictions, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">We see no meaningful difference between <em>Old Chief; Brown</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>; Lee,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the case before us. In all of those cases, the prosecution needed to prove only that the defendants were felons to satisfy the prior conviction element. Maryland courts, like their Federal, Florida, and Kansas counterparts, permit the exclusion of evidence if \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d Maryland Rule 5-403. We agree with <em>Old Chief </em>that the name and nature of a previous conviction, although \u201ctechnically relevant,\u201d \u201caddresse[s] no detail in the definition of the prior-conviction element that would not [be] covered by the stipulation or admission [of that element].\u201d Therefore, we, too, are of the opinion that, when requested by the defendant in a criminal-in-possession case under Maryland Code, Article 27, Section 445, the trial court must accept a stipulation or admission that the defendant was convicted of a crime that qualifies under the criminal-in-possession statute. We hold also that, in such situations, the name or nature of the previous conviction should not be disclosed to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\"><em>Carter, </em>374 Md. at 720-21, 824 A.2d 123 (internal and end footnotes omitted). The Court held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApNq\">when the defendant admits or the parties stipulate to the previous-conviction element of a charge under Section 445(d), the trial judge should inform the jury that the defendant admits that he or she has been convicted of a crime for which he or she is prohibited from possessing a regulated firearm under the law. The judge should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>describe the previous conviction with any more particularity or by using the categories of crimes under Section 445.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIT\"><em>Id. </em>at 722, 824 A.2d 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Although this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carter </em>did not require the trial court to accept a stipulation, it did require that the trial court perform a balancing test before admitting evidence of the name and nature of the prior conviction. Appellant did not offer a stipulation, nor did he request that the trial court perform a balancing test and tell the jury only that he had been convicted of a prior disqualifying crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Appellant asserts that \u201c[bjefore the trial began, the parties discussed the issue and the defense attorney objected to the jury learning this information.\u201d A look at the transcript reveals, however, that the parties were discussing the fact of a prior conviction, not whether its name or nature should be disclosed. There is nothing that suggests that the trial court would have been unsympathetic to appellant\u2019s request.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although appellant complains that \u201cit was disclosed to the jury that appellant had previously been convicted of second degree assault on more than one occasion,\u201d it was defense counsel who elicited information about the second conviction. And, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>although appellant is aggrieved that the trial court instructed the jury that second degree assault was a crime of violence, the trial court asked defense counsel whether she \u201cobject[ed] to the portion of this instruction that identifies assault as a crime of violence,\u201d and she said she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We disagree with appellant\u2019s assertion that this case is like <em>Squire v. State, </em>280 Md. 132, 368 A.2d 1019 (1977). In <em>Squire, </em>the Court of Appeals recognized plain error when the trial court propounded an instruction four days after the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975), which was contrary to that decision. The <em>Squire </em>Court was \u201cwell satisfied that the failure to object did not result from trial tactics or inadvertence, but from a [not unfounded] belief of counsel [ ] that the instruction was in accord with Maryland and federal law.\u201d <em>Squire, </em>280 Md. at 136, 368 A.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Here, Maryland case law at the time of appellant\u2019s trial required that the trial court perform a balancing test before disclosing the name and nature of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction to the jury. Appellant offered no stipulation, nor did he request a balancing test. Considering the lack of a request for a stipulation, defense counsel\u2019s eliciting the underlying facts of appellant\u2019s prior convictions and defense counsel\u2019s jury nullification argument, we cannot say that appellant\u2019s failure to stipulate or ask for a balancing test was not the result of a strategic trial decision. We decline to consider whether the trial court committed plain error in admitting evidence of appellant\u2019s prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that the trial court erred in sentencing him to a term of 5 years without parole for the illegal possession of a firearm. He asserts that the plain meaning of Md.Code (1957, 1996 RepLVol., 2001 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 449(e) requires that he be convicted of both a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>crime of violence and a felony before he can be sentenced to a term of years without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Section 449(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">(e) Illegal possession of firearm with certain previous convictions.\u2014A person who was previously convicted of a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441(e) of this article or convicted of a violation of \u00a7 286 or \u00a7 286A of this article, and who is in possession of a firearm as defined in \u00a7 445(d)(1)(f) and (ii) of this article, is guilty of a felony and upon conviction shall be imprisoned for not less than 5 years, no part of which may be suspended and the person may not be eligible for parole. Each violation shall be considered a separate offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Section 445(d)(1)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">(d) A person may not possess a regulated firearm if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">(1) Has been convicted of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">(i) A crime of violence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">(ii) Any violation classified as a felony in this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-11\">(iii) Any violation classified as a misdemeanor in this State that carries a statutory penalty of more than 2 years; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-12\">(iv) Any violation classified as a common law offense where the person received a term of imprisonment of more than 2 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">In Price <em>v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 835 A.2d 1221 (2003), the Court of Appeals considered whether Price\u2019s conviction of statutory daytime housebreaking was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 449(e). Although it concluded that it was not, and that \u00a7 449(e) therefore did not apply to Price, it noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-14\">Petitioner does not raise, and we do not decide, any question with respect to the second requirement of \u00a7 449(e). Therefore, we do not consider whether \u00a7 449(e)\u2019s mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>sentencing imperative requires a conviction under both \u00a7 445(d)(1)\u00ae and (ii), as the plain language indicates. Although Price was convicted pursuant to only \u00a7 445(d)(1)(h), we assume for purposes of this case alone that this was sufficient to satisfy the second requirement of \u00a7 449(e), and that the only issue before us is whether the first requirement, that his prior crime fall within \u00a7 441(e), was satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><em>Price, </em>378 Md. at 384, n. 4, 835 A.2d 1221. The Court again noted this issue in <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 842 A.2d 743 (2004). There, the defendant had been convicted of both a felony and a crime of violence, so, again, the construction of \u00a7 449(e) did not matter. Again, however, the Court of Appeals noted the \u201cpossible problem in the language of \u00a7 449(e).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 842 A.2d 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Appellant\u2019s prior conviction was for second-degree assault, which is a crime of violence as defined in Article 27, \u00a7 441(e), but is not a felony.

Section 449(e) applies to \u201ca person who was previously convicted of a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441(e)\u201d or of a violation of Article 27 \u00a7 286 or \u00a7 286A. Article 27 \u00a7\u00a7 286 and 286A prohibit various drag crimes. None of the offenses prohibited by those statutes is a \u201ccrime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441(e).\u201d It would be illogical for the legislature specifically to have listed \u00a7\u00a7 286 and 286A in \u00a7 449(e) if it intended that the section apply only to persons who have previously been convicted of both a felony and a crime of violence. In addition, \u00a7 445(d)(1) does not prohibit possession of any firearm, but of a \u201cregulated firearm.\u201d Reading \u00a7 449(e) together with \u00a7 445(d)(1) indicates that the phrase, \u201cwho is in possession of a firearm as defined in \u00a7 445(d)(1)\u00ae and (ii) of this article,\u201d refers to a person who is in possession of a regulated firearm and that the legislature used the word \u201cand\u201d because the definition of \u201cregulated firearm\u201d is the same in \u00a7 445(d)(1)\u00ae as it is in \u00a7 445(d)(1)(h). As seen above, section 445(d)(1) lists subsections (i) and (ii) in the disjunctive.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The legislative history also indicates that the section was not intended to require a previous conviction of both a crime of violence and a felony. Section 449(e) is part of the Responsible Gun Safety Act of 2000. <em>Melton </em>sets out the relevant portion of the Bill Analysis of House Bill 279, the Maryland House of Delegates\u2019 version of that act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>The bill creates a new felony and a five-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for a person who illegally possesses a firearm and <em>has certain qualifying convictions for crimes of violence or certain controlled dangerous substances.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\u201cIX. <em>Mandatory Minimum for Certain Repeat Offenders </em>The bill creates a new felony and a five year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for a person who illegally possesses a regulated firearm (Article 27, \u00a7 445(d)(l)(i) and (ii)) if that individual and has been convicted of <em>either: (1) a crime of violence; or (2) unlawful possession, distribution, or importation of a controlled dangerous substance (Article 27, \u00a7 286 and \u00a7 286A).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\"><em>Melton, </em>879 Md. at 485, 842 A.2d 743 (some emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The Bill Analysis for Senate Bill 211, the Senate\u2019s version of the Responsible Gun Safety Act of 2000, similarly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A01\">The bill establishes a felony that provides a 5 year minimum mandatory term of imprisonment for a person who illegally possesses a firearm and who was previously convicted of <em>a crime of violence or certain serious controlled dangerous substances violations.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">* * 3\u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">\u201cIX. <em>Mandatory Minimum for Certain Repeat Offenders </em>The bill establishes a felony that provides a 5 year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for a person who illegally possesses a firearm (Article 27, \u00a7 445(d)(l)(i) and (ii)) if that individual has previously been convicted of <em>either: (1) a crime of violence; (2) a felony; or (8) unlawful possession, distribution, or importation of a controlled dangerous substance (Article 27, \u00a7 286 and \u00a7 286A).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">The language of the revised statute also supports the view that the legislature intended \u00a7 449(e) to apply to a person previously convicted of either a felony or a crime of violence. Construing the statute as intending to include prior convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>tions of crimes of violence or serious drug crimes suggests that a simpler way of establishing penalties for those offenses would be to prohibit possession of regulated firearms for one who has been convicted of an enumerated offense. That is what the revisers did. Md.Code (2003), Public Safety Article, sec. 5-133(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">(1) A person may not possess a regulated firearm if the person was previously convicted of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">(1) a crime of violence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">(ii) a violation of \u00a7 5-602, \u00a7 5-603, \u00a7 5-604, \u00a7 5-605, \u00a7 5-606, \u00a7 5-607, \u00a7 5-608, \u00a7 5-609, \u00a7 5-612, \u00a7 5-613, or \u00a7 5-614 of the Criminal Law Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">(2) A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a felony and on conviction is subject to imprisonment for not less than 5 years, no part of which may be suspended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">(3) A person sentenced under paragraph (1) of this subsection may not be eligible for parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">(4) Each violation of this subsection is a separate crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">The revisor\u2019s note states: \u201cThis section is new language derived <em>without substantive change </em>from former Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 449(e) and 445(d), (e), and, except as it related to the transfer of regulated firearms, (a).\u201d (Emphasis added). Sections 5-602, \u00a7 5-603, \u00a7 5-604, \u00a7 5-605, \u00a7 5-606, \u00a7 5-607, \u00a7 5-608, \u00a7 5-609, \u00a7 5-612, \u00a7 5-613, and \u00a7 5-614 of the Criminal Law Article are essentially the statutes that replaced \u00a7\u00a7 286 and 286A.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">We conclude, therefore, that Article 29, \u00a7 449(e) is applicable to defendants who have previously been convicted either of a felony or a crime of violence.

Supp.), art. 27, \u00a7 449(e), has been repealed and re-codified as \u00a7 5-133(c) of Md.Code (2003), Public Safety art. (P.S.).

Former Art. 27, \u00a7 445(d)(1)\u00a9 and (ii) prohibited a person who has been convicted of a crime of violence or any violation classified as a felony in this State from possessing a regulated firearm. The General Assembly may wish to clarify the meaning of former Art. 27, \u00a7 449(e), which is revised in subsection (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">I certainly do not take issue with the well-settled precepts of statutory construction reiterated by the majority, including the requirement that a statutory scheme be analyzed in its entirety; that no word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory; and that the construction not have an illogical result. <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 418, 722 A.2d 887 (1999); <em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 134, 669 A.2d 1339 (1996). Moreover, the repeal of \u00a7 449(e) of Article 27 and its re-codification in P.S. \u00a7 5-133 indicate that the legislature did not intend that the mandatory sentencing imperative of \u00a7 449(e) require a conviction under both \u00a7 445(d)(1)\u00a9 and (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Notwithstanding, the Court of Appeals, in <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387-88, 835 A.2d 1221 (2003), recently explicated the importance of beginning with the plain language of the statute in divining legislative intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">The chief goal of statutory interpretation is to discover the actual intent of the legislature in enacting the statute, and the legion of cases that support this proposition need not be repeated here. In fact, all statutory interpretation begins, and usually ends, with the statutory text itself, <em>Marriott </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number><em>Employees v. MVA, </em>346 Md. 437, 444-45, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997), <em>for the legislative intent of a statute primarily reveals itself through the statute\u2019s very words, Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478, 483 (2000). A court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application. <em>County Council v. Dutcher, </em>365 Md. 399, 416-417, 780 A.2d 1137, 1147 (2001). In short, if the words of a statute clearly and unambiguously delineate the legislative intent, ours is an ephemeral enterprise. We need investigate no further but simply apply the statute as it reads. <em>Derry, </em>358 Md. at 335, 748 A.2d at 483; <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 515, 525 A.2d 628, 633 (1987).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">In some cases, the statutory text reveals ambiguity, and then the job of this Court is to resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, using all the resources and tools of statutory construction at our disposal. <em>See Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 653-654, 705 A.2d 1128, 1130-31 (1998); <em>Haupt v. State, </em>340 Md. 462, 471, 667 A.2d 179, 183 (1995); <em>Marriott, </em>346 Md. at 445, 697 A.2d at 459. <em>However, before judges may look to other sources for interpretation, first there must exist an ambiguity within the statute, i.e., two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute. See Greco v. State, </em>347 Md. 423, 429, 701 A.2d 419, 421 (1997). Where the statutory language is free from such ambiguity, courts will neither look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent nor add to or delete words from the statute, <em>see Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 222, 804 A.2d 426, 427 (2002). Only when faced with ambiguity will courts consider both the literal or usual meaning of the words as well as their meaning in light of the objectives and purposes of the enactment. As our predecessors noted, \u201cWe cannot assume authority to read into the Act what the Legislature apparently deliberately left out. Judicial construction should only be resorted to when an ambiguity exists.\u201d <em>Howard Contr. Co. v. Yeager, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>184 Md. 503, 511, 41 A.2d 494, 498 (1945). Therefore, the strongly preferred norm of statutory interpretation is to effectuate the plain language of the statutory text.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 387-88, 835 A.2d 1221 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">From the above, there really is no ambiguity in the statute itself, but rather in the statutory scheme, as the majority explains. (Op. at 378, 851 A.2d at 620.) As I see it, the fact that the plain language represents the manner in which a sentence enhancement is determined in a criminal proceeding casts the provision in a light different from other matters, requiring an additional consideration. The majority opinion sets forth a quotation from <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 842 A.2d 743 (2004), in which the Court of Appeals considered the heightened scrutiny to which a statute providing for an enhanced penalty must be subjected. A more expansive version of the text of the <em>Melton </em>quotation is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">The plain language of \u00a7 449(e) argument, urged on this Court by the State, appears to be directly at odds with this subsequent history. At best for the State, the language is ambiguous, and ambiguous units of prosecution and penalty provisions in criminal statutes, pursuant to the rule of lenity, must normally be construed in favor of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">In discussing what the rule of lenity requires in the context of former Md.Code (1957, 1996 RepLVol., 1998 Supp.), Art. 27 \u00a7 286(d), this Court has stated that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANs\">an enhanced penalty statute, is highly penal and must be strictly construed so that the defendant is only subject to punishment contemplated by the statute. When doubt exists regarding the punishment imposed by a statute, the rule of lenity instructs that a court \u201cnot interpret a ... criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what [the legislature] intended.\u201d <em>Melgar v.

State, </em>356 Md. 20, 25, 736 A.2d 1067, 1069 (1999).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there is no doubt that \u00a7 449(e), a statute which creates a mandatory minimum five-year sentence without the possibility of parole, fits within the definition of \u201can enhanced penalty statute.\u201d As \u00a7 449(e) provides no definition of the term \u201cviolation,\u201d and provides no specific direction as to the proper unit of prosecution, we hold that \u00a7 449(e) is ambiguous as to that point and accordingly construe \u00a7 449(e) narrowly. The fact that the plain language of \u00a7 449(e), as it existed at the time of the offense here at issue, leaves us nothing more than \u201ca guess\u201d as to which violation (the illegal possession or prior felony or both, <em>see Price, supra </em>at 387[, 835 A.2d 1221], as of the time of convictions in the case at bar) <em>triggers the mandatory minimum sentence, requires that the rule of lenity be applied.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 488-89, 842 A.2d 743 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Clearly, under the rule of lenity, any ambiguity in the language of a criminal statute must be construed against the State and in favor of the defendant. Not only must the statute be strictly construed to insure that a defendant is only subject to punishment contemplated by the statute, it must serve to put the defendant on notice as to what conduct violates the law and therefore makes him or her criminally responsible. <em>See Finucan v. Md. Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance, </em>380 Md. 577, 846 A.2d 377 (2004), and <em>Galloway v.

A criminal statute must put the defendant on notice as to what conduct is proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Judge Adkins, writing for the Court of Appeals in <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 525 A.2d 628 (1987), considered competing canons in divining statutory intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">We are faced with a battle between contending canons of construction. Just as in the science of Physics every action has an equal and opposite reaction, so it seems that every canon of statutory construction has an equal and opposite canon. Indeed, it has been suggested that the canons of construction should be abandoned because they \u201cobscure the factors actually at work in the construction of statutes.\u201d Sykes, <em>A Modest Proposal for a Change in Maryland\u2019s Statutes Quo, </em>43 Md.L.Rev. 647, 666 (1984). Instead, this Court \u201cshould turn ... to the task of explaining more forthrightly its reasons for adopting a particular construction in an individual case.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>667. Nevertheless, the canons have long been with us. To a considerable extent they are founded on both logic and common sense. Indeed, objections to them seem to be based more on the way in which they have been used, rather than on their content. But properly used, they afford an opportunity for principled decision making, as opposed to ad hoc judicial legislation. It is sound policy for a court to recognize legislative preeminence, subject to constitutional restraints, when legislation is involved. We shall apply the canons here, and at the same time attempt to give forthright explanations for the result we reach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 512, 525 A.2d 628 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">On October 30, 2001, the plain language of a Maryland statute put appellant on notice that he could be subjected to enhanced punishment if two preconditions were established, i.e., that he had previously been convicted of a crime that was classified as a felony and that it was a crime of violence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>While rules of statutory construction require giving effect to legislative intent, when the plain language fails to give notice to the defendant that the proscribed conduct can subject the defendant to an enhanced penalty, I believe the plain language must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Although quite apart from the question of whether \u00a7 449(e) of art. 27 should be upheld, the fact that the trial judge felt compelled by law to impose the mandatory five-year sentence, without parole, on a fifty-seven-year-old man with a relatively clean criminal record, obviously caused him some consternation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">THE COURT: I cannot change the law to make people feel better.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">THE COURT: I know, but I cannot do anything about this.

And it is an uncomfortable situation,\u201d and \u201cI know, I mean, it drives you nuts,\u201d after appellant\u2019s counsel observed that appellant was not \u201csome gang-banger who is going to get off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The issue of the trial judge\u2019s dilemma is not before this Court, but that dilemma underscores the necessity that, in implementing a statute requiring an enhanced penalty, more specifically, a mandatory sentence without parole, it is imperative that we (the judicial system) get it right. Viewing the propriety of the mandated sentence from the perspective of the trial judge\u2019s consternation (as he is in the best position to evaluate appellant\u2019s entire history, including the predicate convictions for the enhanced penalty), exercise of prosecutorial discretion, ranging from placing the case on the stet docket to proceeding only on the current charges, might well have been the most appropriate way to obviate the apparent dilemma. At this juncture, assuming the majority decision is not disturbed, executive clemency may well be appellant\u2019s only resort.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-12\">. In her opening, defense counsel told the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Now, you can see Mr. Stanley is not some young guy that would be hanging on the corner. He worked 35 years for General Motors. He is retired. He is here with his wife today.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>She told the jury that when the police came, appellant cooperated and gave the gun to the police. She said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">He said officer, I am sorry, I did a really dumb thing. You know, here is the gun, take it away, I don\u2019t want it, and for that, he is being punished. That is why at the end of this case, I want you to look at Mr. Stanley and I want you to find him not guilty of this crime. In her closing, defense counsel said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">[Appellant] did the right thing, and he should not be punished for it, and he is going to be punished for it unless you find him not guilty. The jury in the State of Maryland are the judges of the law and the facts. You are the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">In fact, during its deliberations, the jury sent a note asking whether, if they found appellant guilty, he could be offered probation before judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-15\">. <em>Carter v.
