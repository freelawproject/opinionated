DID THE TRIAL COURT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION IN DENYING COOLEY\u2019S MOTION FOR MISTRIAL AFTER, IN THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY, SEVERAL SHERIFFS ESCORTED A STATE\u2019S WITNESS FROM THE COURTROOM?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">III. DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN ADMITTING INTO EVIDENCE DRUGS AND AMMUNITION SEIZED FROM THE HOME OF COOLEY\u2019S GIRLFRIEND?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">IV. WAS THE EVIDENCE INSUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN APPELLANTS\u2019 CONVICTIONS?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">For the reasons that follow, we answer \u201cno\u201d to each question and shall therefore affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">On May 5, 2001, in the 700 block of Baker Street in Baltimore City, Anthony Williams, Jr. (Williams) was murdered. As a result of information provided by Eddie Terrell (Terrell), a friend of the victim, appellants were ultimately charged with that murder. On May 11, 2001, Terrell was arrested on an unrelated crime and questioned about the murder. At that point, he told detectives that he knew nothing about what happened to Williams. On May 21, however, he returned to the police station and gave a recorded statement that included the following assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">About 4:00 p.m. on May 5, 2001, Terrell and Williams brought drugs to a location on Pennsylvania Avenue, where they had \u201cjunkies\u201d sell the drugs for them. When the junkies ran out of the drugs supplied by Terrell and Williams, Cooley and four other males started selling drugs at that location. Williams told one of the people who had been selling drugs for him not to buy anything from Cooley and his companions.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">Terrell and Williams then left the scene, cut across a playground, walked down Baker Street, and made a left onto Windsor Avenue. As they were walking down Windsor, a white Crown Victoria pulled around the corner. Cooley was driving that vehicle. Gibson got out of the passenger side of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the car and asked Williams if Williams had \u201ca lot of big words.\u201d At this point, Gibson started shooting. Terrell turned, ran down an alley, and hid in an old refrigerator until the shooting stopped. He then returned to the location of the shooting and saw Williams\u2019 body on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">At trial, Terrell denied having any knowledge of the shooting. He testified that he did not witness the crime, that his May 21st statement was a lie, that the information he gave the police on that day was based only on information he had received from people in the neighborhood, that he implicated appellants because he believed that he was going to be charged with the shooting, and that no one had warned him that the appellants would kill him if he told the truth about what happened to Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Because Terrell\u2019s trial testimony was inconsistent with his May 21st statement, the State introduced that statement into evidence. The State also introduced evidence that drugs and ammunition of the same caliber as those recovered from the victim were found during a search of the home of Cooley\u2019s girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Appellants interposed \u201cconfrontation\u201d and \u201chearsay within hearsay\u201d objections to the introduction of Terrell\u2019s recorded inconsistent statement. In one portion of that statement, Terrell described what he had witnessed. That portion, which was admitted pursuant to the \u201ccatchall\u201d exception to the rule against hearsay, was clearly admissible under Rule 5-802.1(a)(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In another portion of Terrell\u2019s statement, he reported that he had received information that appellants said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>they would kill him if he cooperated with the officers investigating Williams\u2019 murder. That portion of the statement was admissible to explain why Terrell had initially denied knowing what happened to Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The \u201cconfrontation\u201d objection presents the question of whether any of Terrell\u2019s prior recorded statement was admissible. We hold that, when a witness testifies at trial that the defendant did not commit the crime, the Confrontation Clause does not prohibit the jury from convicting the defendant on the basis of the witness\u2019 prior written and/or recorded statement in which the witness stated that the defendant did commit the crime. This holding is consistent with <em>Nance v. State, </em>331 Md. 549, 629 A.2d 633 (1993), and with Md. Rule 5-802.1(a)(3), which codified the holding in <em>Nance. </em>We also hold that the recent decision of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) has no effect upon the admissibility of Terrell\u2019s out-of-court statement, because <em>Crawford </em>did not overrule the unbroken line of cases holding that the Confrontation Clause does not operate to exclude pretrial statements made by a witness who actually testifies at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>In <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970), the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause does not require excluding from evidence the prior statements of a witness who concedes making the statements, and who may be asked to defend or otherwise explain the inconsistency between his prior and his present version of the events in question, thus opening himself to full cross-examination at trial as to both stories.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 90 S.Ct. 1930. That is precisely what occurred in the case at bar.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">The <em>Green </em>Court was not presented with the issue of whether the Confrontation Clause would operate to exclude the prior statements \u201cof a witness who disclaims all present knowledge of the ultimate event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169, 90 S.Ct. 1930. That precise issue was decided in <em>United States v. Owens, </em>484 U.S. 554, 108 S.Ct. 838, 98 L.Ed.2d 951 (1988), in which a majority of the Supreme Court held \u201cthat neither the Confrontation Clause nor Federal Rule of Evidence 802 is violated by admission of an identification statement of a witness who is unable, because of a memory loss, to testify concerning the basis for the identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564, 108 S.Ct. 838. Writing for the majority in <em>Owens, </em>Justice Scalia expressly relied upon <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 21, 106 S.Ct. 292, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985), a per curiam opinion in which a majority of the Court held that the Confrontation Clause does not require exclusion of expert opinion testimony that the hair of a murder victim had been \u201cforcibly\u201d removed, even though the expert also testified that (1) there are three methods of determining whether a hair has been removed by force, and (2) he could not remember which method he used in that case. <em>Owens, </em>484 U.S. at 558-60, 108 S.Ct. 838 (citing <em>Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. at 19-22, 106 S.Ct. 292). The <em>Fensterer </em>Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">The Confrontation Clause includes no guarantee that every witness called by the prosecution will refrain from giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>testimony that is marred by forgetfulness, confusion, or evasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">The Court has recognized that \u201cthe cross-examiner is not only permitted to delve into the witness\u2019 story to test the witness\u2019 perceptions and memory, but [also] ... allowed to impeach, <em>i.e., </em>discredit, the witness.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>415 U.S., at 316, 94 S.Ct., at 1110. But it does not follow that the right to cross-examine is denied by the State whenever the witness\u2019 lapse of memory impedes one method of discrediting him. Quite obviously, an expert witness who cannot recall the basis for his opinion invites the jury to find that his opinion is as unreliable as his memory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the assurances of reliability our cases have found in the right of cross-examination are fully satisfied in cases such as this one, notwithstanding the witness\u2019 inability to recall the basis for his opinion: the factfinder can observe the witness\u2019 demean- or under cross-examination, and the witness is testifying under oath and in the presence of the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">This Court held that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause does not require excluding from evidence the prior statements of a witness who concedes making the statements, and who may be asked to defend or otherwise explain the inconsistency between his prior and his present version of the events in question, thus opening himself to full cross-examination at trial as to both stories.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">To the contrary, the Confrontation Clause is generally satisfied when the defense is given a full and fair opportunity to probe and expose these infirmities through cross-examination, thereby calling to the attention of the factfin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>der the reasons for giving scant weight to the witness\u2019 testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">474 U.S. at 19-23, 106 S.Ct. at 294-96 (some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\"><em>Crawford v. Washington, supra, </em>which involved the testimonial hearsay statement made by a declarant who was unavailable to testify at trial, is in no way inconsistent with <em>Owens, Fensterer, Green, Nance, </em>Md. Rule 5-802.1, or Md. Rule 5-616(e). We therefore hold that the Confrontation Clause does not require the exclusion of any out-of-court statement made by a person who actually testifies at trial and is therefore subject to cross-examination concerning the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Appellants\u2019 objections also present the question of whether Judge Schwait erred by admitting that portion of Terrell\u2019s statement in which he said that his cousin told him that someone in the community had said that Gibson and Cooley were going to kill Terrell if he told the police what happened. It is clear that this portion of the statement was not admissible to prove the fact that Gibson and Cooley had actually threatened Terrell. It is also clear, however, that appellants (1) were not entitled to the precise relief that they requested, and (2) did not request the precise relief to which they were entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">The portion of Terrell\u2019s statement in which he referred to the threats that had come to his attention was admissible because \u201cevidence of threats to a witness or fear on the part of a witness, in order to explain an inconsistency, is admissible in criminal cases for credibility rehabilitation purposes.... \u201d <em>Washington v. State, </em>293 Md. 465, 470, 445 A.2d 684 (1982) (citations omitted); <em>see also Brown v. State, </em>80 Md.App. 187, 194-95, 560 A.2d 605 (1989). Appellants were entitled to a limiting instruction that would have restricted the evidence of threats to the purpose for which it was admissible, but they were not entitled to a ruling that excluded this evidence altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Cooley argues that he was unfairly prejudiced when the jury saw sheriffs escort Terrell from the courtroom after Terrell completed his testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The record shows that, on the day after Terrell testified, Cooley\u2019s trial counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">[O]n tape, Mr. Terrell told the police officers that he was scared. It was brought to my attention after the jury left yesterday that there were several sheriffs from the Baltimore City Sheriffs Office that were in the courtroom who then left the courtroom with Mr. Terrell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">Your Honor, that would leave an impression on the jury that Mr. Terrell is under some kind of guard because of the information that was elicited on tape by the Baltimore City Police Department on May the 21st.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">Mr. Terrell never testified yesterday that he was scared. He said that he lied when he said those statements to the police. I was not aware that the sheriffs were going to come into the courtroom and I was not aware that the sheriff would have been escorting the witness out of the presence of the jury....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The prosecutor responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">Quite frankly, I didn\u2019t see the extent of the entourage or whatever she\u2019s claiming escorting Mr. Terrell out, so I don\u2019t know how many sheriffs we\u2019re talking about here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">Quite frankly, I don\u2019t think that, that is not prejudicial. While on the stand, it came out that he was scared and he received threats.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">Furthermore, I can proffer to this Court while Mr. Terrell and his grandmother were sitting outside, people\u2014and I can\u2019t say for sure who they were\u2014approached him about testifying in this case. So obviously there was a reason for him to have some protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>In denying appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial, Judge Schwait stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">I didn\u2019t ask for extra sheriffs to come in during that testimony. They believed it was in the best interest of the security of the courtroom for them to come in. That\u2019s in their discretion. They certainly know what this case is about. And if they believed that we needed extra personnel here, I\u2019m not going to second guess that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In addition to which, there are facts in this case that would indicate that there is some need for security in this kind of situation and I\u2019m not, as [I] said, going to second guess how much security and when it comes in. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\"> A trial judge has broad discretion in maintaining the security of the courtroom. <em>Whittlesey v. State, </em>340 Md. 30, 84, 665 A.2d 223 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1148, 116 S.Ct. 1021, 134 L.Ed.2d 100 (1996). That broad discretion, however, must be exercised by a judicial officer rather than by a law enforcement officer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Bowers v. State, </em>306 Md. 120, 507 A.2d 1072, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 890, 107 S.Ct. 292, 93 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), the Court of Appeals quoted with approval the following analysis found in <em>United States v. Samuel, </em>431 F.2d 610, 615, <em>final decision entered, </em>433 F.2d 663 (4th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 946, 91 S.Ct. 964, 28 L.Ed.2d 229 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">\u201cIt is [the trial judge] who is best equipped to decide the extent to which security measures should be adopted to prevent disruption of the trial, harm to those in the courtroom, escape of the accused, and the prevention of other crimes.... As a discretionary matter, the district judge\u2019s decision with regard to measure[s] for security is subject to a limited review to determine if it was abused. We stress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>that the discretion is that of the district judge. He may not ... delegate that discretion to the Marshal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">306 Md. at 133, 507 A.2d 1072 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">There are situations in which the trial judge must \u201csecond guess\u201d a \u201ccourtroom security\u201d decision that would result in unfair prejudice to the accused. No such situation, however, occurred in the case at bar. The record shows that, on the afternoon <em>before </em>Cooley\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial, (1) Terrell was the last witness to testify that day, (2) all counsel of record were present in the courtroom when Terrell was \u201cexcused,\u201d (3) the jurors were not \u201cexcused\u201d until after all counsel returned to the trial tables following an on-the-record bench conference, and (4) neither defense counsel complained about whatever occurred as Terrell left the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">We are persuaded that if appellants had been unfairly prejudiced by something that occurred when Terrell left the courtroom, Cooley\u2019s motion for mistrial would have been made immediately after the allegedly prejudicial incident occurred. We are also persuaded that there is evidentiary significance in the fact that Gibson\u2019s trial counsel did not join in the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">In <em>In re Devon T., </em>85 Md.App. 674, 584 A.2d 1287 (1991), while rejecting the respondent\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he knew the difference between right and wrong, this Court held that an \u201cexchange\u201d between the respondent and his lawyer (during which the lawyer explained the respondent\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination) (1) permitted the inference that the lawyer believed that the respondent \u201cunderstood the significance of criminality and incrimination,\u201d and (2) \u201c[ujnder the classic case ... of <em>Wright v. Tatham, </em>5 Cl. &amp; Fin. 670, 1838 WL 3779 (1838), this belief on the part of a close observer is relevant evidence for the proposition that the thing believed is true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696-97, 584 A.2d 1287. That analysis is equally applicable to the case at bar, in which the decision of Gibson\u2019s trial counsel to refrain from joining in Cooley\u2019s motion constituted an implied assertion by Gibson\u2019s trial counsel that appellants were not unfairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>prejudiced by whatever occurred when Terrell left the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">In the final analysis, even assuming that more reasonable security measures should have been taken,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the dispositive question is whether the security measures that were taken created the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendants. <em>See Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 408, 583 A.2d 218 (1990); <em>see also Bruce v. State, </em>318 Md. 706, 721, 569 A.2d 1254 (1990). Judge Schwait did not err in finding that appellants were not unfairly prejudiced by what occurred when Terrell left the courtroom. Moreover, had Judge Schwait declared a mistrial, Gibson would then have been in a position to argue that, because there was no \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d to declare a mistrial in his case,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the charges against him must be dismissed on double jeopardy grounds. Under these circumstances, Cooley was not entitled to a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Appellants argue that Judge Schwait erred in admitting irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial evidence of drugs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ammunition found in the home of Cooley\u2019s girlfriend, Zakia Jones. According to appellants, there was insufficient evidence to establish that Cooley and Jones were residing together at 2001 McCullough Street when that residence was searched. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The State\u2019s case included testimony that, when the search warrant was executed about 6:20 a.m. on July 20, 2001, both Jones and Cooley were present, along with their child. Cooley was sleeping when the police arrived. Both Cooley and Jones were in the bedroom at the time the bullet cartridges were recovered. In addition, paperwork in the names of both Jones and Cooley was recovered from the premises. This evidence was sufficient to establish that Cooley and Jones were residing together at 2001 McCullough Street when the search warrant was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Appellants also argue that the probative value of the seized evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. We disagree with that argument as well. It is well settled that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">[w]ith respect to issues involving the admissibility of evidence, although relevant evidence is generally admissible, <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 404, 697 A.2d 432 (1997), it \u201cshould be excluded by the trial court, if the probative value of such evidence is determined to be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Andrews v. State, </em>372 Md. 1, 19, 811 A.2d 282 (2002) (citing Maryland Rule 5-403). \u201c \u2018[A] decision to admit relevant evidence over an objection that the evidence is unfairly prejudicial will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. at 405, 697 A.2d 432 (quoting <em>Williams v. State, </em>342 Md. 724, 737, 679 A.2d 1106 (1996), <em>overruled on other grounds, Wengert v. State, </em>364 Md. 76, 89, 771 A.2d 389 (2001)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\"><em>Carter v. State, </em>374 Md. 693, 706, 824 A.2d 123 (2003); <em>see also Smith v. State, </em>299 Md. 158, 179, 472 A.2d 988 (1984) (citing <em>Poole v. State, </em>295 Md. 167, 180, 453 A.2d 1218 (1983)). As the ammunition recovered from the home was identical to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>caliber of the bullet recovered from the victim\u2019s body, and the seized evidence therefore corroborated Terrell\u2019s recorded statement, we hold that Judge Schwait did not err or abuse his discretion in admitting the evidence at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">We review a \u201csufficiency of the evidence\u201d argument to determine \u201cwhether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Bloodsworth v. State, </em>307 Md. 164, 167, 512 A.2d 1056 (1986) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 313, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). Cooley argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for second-degree murder and wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun. In support of that argument, he emphasizes that the only evidence linking him to the murder was Terrell\u2019s statement that, when Terrell saw Gibson get out of the Crown Victoria, Cooley was in the driver\u2019s seat. There is no merit in that argument. Evidence that Cooley transported the shooter to the murder scene, and drove the shooter away after the shooting, was sufficient to establish that Cooley participated in the murder.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Both appellants argue that the evidence was insufficient to sustain their convictions because the testimony was simply too inconsistent to be believed. This argument presents yet another situation in which \u201cthe so-called <em>Kucharczyk </em>doctrine [based upon <em>Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334, 201 A.2d 683 (1964) ] ... has been invoked in vain.\u201d <em>Bailey v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number><em>State, </em>16 Md.App. 88, 94-95, 294 A.2d 123 (1972). In <em>Bailey, </em>Judge Moylan stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">our system of jurisprudence places reliance in the fact finder to take contradictions or equivocations properly into account and then to make informed judgment in assessing a witness\u2019s credibility and in weighing that witness\u2019s testimony-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 97, 294 A.2d 123. That statement is applicable to the case at bar, in which it was for the jury to resolve testimonial inconsistencies.
