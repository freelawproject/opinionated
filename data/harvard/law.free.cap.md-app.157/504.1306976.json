Their quarrel, which began over a basketball hoop and a parking space, has resulted in at least four separate actions, with an intimation of more to come. At a loss as to why so little has generated so much conflict, we can only surmise that we are in the middle of what may be the litigatory equivalent of road rage. The number of actions, the sheer ferocity with which they have been pursued, and the inconsequential nature of what has been sought offer us little hope that we are wrong in this assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">Whatever the driving force behind this battery of cases, this appeal does present important questions as to the applicability of the collateral estoppel doctrine where an appeal is pending or where an appeal is subsequently dismissed as moot, questions which have not heretofore been fully addressed by our appellate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>To answer these and other questions posed by the parties to this appeal, we must delve into the three other actions between them, which we shall designate, to avoid confusion: the \u201cadministrative action,\u201d the \u201cinjunction action,\u201d and the \u201cpeace order action.\u201d The instant action, on the other hand, defies facile labels. It combines a derivative action and claims of malicious use of process and abuse of process. It began when appellant Brian Campbell, the homeowner, filed a complaint against his homeowners association, appellee Lake Hallowell Homeowners Association and its Board of Directors, which we shall hereafter collectively refer to as the \u201cAssociation\u201d and its president, appellee Phillip D. Peters, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. That complaint contained three counts: a \u201cderivative action\u201d against the Association and the Board, and claims for malicious use of process and abuse of process against Peters.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Appellees responded by filing a motion requesting dismissal of the complaint or, in the alternative, summary judgment as to all three counts. That motion met with only partial success. While the court dismissed the abuse of process claim against Peters, it denied the motion as to the other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">After the discovery deadline, imposed by the circuit court, had passed, appellant moved to compel the Association to produce documents that the Montgomery County Commission on Common Ownership Communities (\u201cCommission\u201d) had ordered were to be made available to appellant in one of the other actions between the parties. When that motion was denied, appellees renewed their motion for summary judgment. This time, they were more successful. Granting that motion in its entirety, the circuit court entered judgment in favor of appellees as to all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">From that judgment, appellant noted this appeal <em>pro se, </em>presenting two questions, which we have set forth below as they appear in appellant\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">I. Did the trial court err in entering summary judgment as to, or dismissing, any of the counts brought against the Association by appellant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>II. Did the trial court err in denying Campbell\u2019s motion, and/or denying Campbell\u2019s request for a hearing on Campbell\u2019s motion, to compel the Association to comply with the Commission\u2019s order?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\n<em>Prior Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In 1990, appellant purchased a townhouse in the Lake Hallowell Community, a planned community in Olney, Maryland. By virtue of that ownership, appellant was, until he sold his property in 2002, a member of the Lake Hallowell Homeowners Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">While appellant was living in the Lake Hallowell Community, a dispute arose between appellant and the Association as to where appellant was permitted to park his car. Upon learning that appellant and his family were parking their car in an overflow parking lot designated for visitors, the Association informed appellant that he was not permitted to park there. To comply with that directive, appellant began parking his car elsewhere. Unfortunately, the \u201celsewhere\u201d was a \u201cfire lane\u201d in front of his townhouse. The Association advised appellant that his new choice of a parking space\u2014the fire lane\u2014was even less acceptable than his previous selection. By letter, the Association requested, \u201c[pjlease park your car on your property.\u201d It should have been more specific. Appellant complied and parked his car on his front lawn\u2014which, we are confident, was not what the Association had in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Unfortunately, the discord between the parties did not end here. Indeed, it was only the first battle in what was to become a war. Appellant next placed a basketball hoop on his front lawn. The hoop, the Association claimed, violated the community\u2019s architectural guidelines prohibiting the installation of basketball hoops in front of townhouses, and it demanded that appellant remove both his car and basketball hoop from his front lawn. That demand, to no one\u2019s surprise, went unheeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>On September 11, 2001, appellant filed a complaint against the Association with the Montgomery County Commission on Common Ownership Communities (the \u201cadministrative action\u201d). The record does not disclose the details of the complaint but the Commission\u2019s order lists the four issues that were before it: (1) \u201cDoes the Fire Lane Establishment Order of November 16, 1990, Order No. DFRS 39-90, prohibit [appellant] from parking [on the street in front of his townhouse]?\u201d; (2) \u201cMay the Association prohibit the Complainants from parking in the 25 overflow spaces on Dumfries Circle as well?\u201d; (3) \u201cDo the documents of the Association, specifically the Declaration of Covenants and/or the revised Architectural Control Guidelines effective November 1, 1998, prohibit [appellant] from maintaining the movable, collapsible basketball goal in the front yard of [his] townhouse?\u201d; and (4) \u201cHas the Association improperly denied or limited [appellant\u2019s] right to inspect the books, records and papers of the Association\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Following a hearing, the Commission found that the Association had properly prohibited appellant from parking his vehicle in the fire lane, but that nothing in the Association\u2019s rules, regulations, or guidelines prohibited appellant from parking in the overflow visitors\u2019 parking lot. It further found that the Association\u2019s Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions prohibited appellant from placing a basketball hoop in his front yard. On the other hand, it agreed with appellant that the Association had improperly denied him access to its records. The Commission declared that the Association had \u201ccrossed the line\u201d by \u201cconstructively precluding] inspection of [the Association\u2019s records] through charging a substantial fee\u201d to inspect those records. It therefore ordered the Association to permit appellant \u201cto inspect all of [its] books, records and papers ... without restriction as to date,\u201d subject to the payment by appellant of reasonable copying fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">On September 12, 2001, one day after appellant filed his complaint with the Commission, the Association filed suit against appellant in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County seeking an injunction to enjoin him from parking his car on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>front lawn and placing a basketball hoop in front of his townhouse (the \u201cinjunction action\u201d) and requesting an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Granting the Association\u2019s request for injunctive relief, the circuit court issued a temporary injunction ordering appellant and his wife to \u201cremove the vehicle\u201d and to place \u201call vehicles under their control ... in a designated parking [area].\u201d Three weeks after the issuance of that injunction, appellant chose a new location for his vehicle\u2014his backyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">At the trial of the injunction action, Ed Thomas, the Association\u2019s agent, testified that appellant \u201cwould have been permitted to park his car in the visitors\u2019 lot all along, provided he moved it at least once a week,\u201d but admitted that the Association had not conveyed this information to appellant until two weeks before trial. When appellant had his chance to testify, he attributed the actions of the Association to a desire to discriminate against him and his family because he had two young children while most of the homeowners in the community were childless. The Association, he claimed, \u201cbent\u201d the rules for other homeowners, but strictly applied them to him and his family, even to the extent of \u201cinterpreting the rules and regulations to prohibit actions that were not truly prohibited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Dismissing appellant\u2019s claim as \u201cbizarre,\u201d the circuit court granted the Association\u2019s request for a permanent injunction requiring appellant to refrain from parking on his lawn and to remove his basketball hoop from his front yard. The circuit court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">[T]he covenants do apply to [appellant] and his wife and that the ... architectural guidelines do apply to him, and they clearly discussed the basketball issue[.] I think it is certainly worth saying that the ... actual words in the covenants are not specific, but their intent is clear, the intent being you don\u2019t park your car on the grass and you don\u2019t put a basketball hoop in the front of the yard, it is as clear as it can be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>It further ordered appellant to pay the Association $12,500.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Appellant noted an appeal to this Court but, before argument, moved out of the Lake Hallowell Community. That act of relocation, we held, rendered his appeal moot, leaving only the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees for our consideration. <em>Campbell v. Lake Hallowell Homeowners Ass\u2019n, </em>152 Md.App. 139, 148-49, 831 A.2d 465, <em>cert. denied, </em>378 Md. 614, 837 A.2d 926 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In addressing that issue, the Association asserted that the award was lawful because it was authorized by resolution to recover attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in enforcing community regulations and covenants. <em>Id. </em>at 144, 831 A.2d 465. We disagreed, observing that the Association\u2019s membership had never voted on that resolution and that it had not been filed in the Montgomery County Land Records Office as required by the Community\u2019s Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions. <em>Id. </em>at 150, 831 A.2d 465. We further noted that, \u201c \u2018[i]n Maryland, the general rule is that costs and expenses of litigation, other than the usual and ordinary Court costs, are not recoverable in an action for [compensatory] damages\u2019 \u201d but that \u201c[attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded where a statute allows for the imposition of such fees, ... and where parties to a contract have an agreement regarding attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hess Constr. Co. v. Bd. of Educ., </em>341 Md. 155, 159-60, 669 A.2d 1352 (1996) (citations omitted)). Finding that \u201cthe award of attorneys\u2019 fees was authorized by neither statute nor agreement,\u201d we vacated the circuit court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Id. </em>at 151, 831 A.2d 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">While the administrative and injunction actions were still pending, Peters filed a petition in the District Court for Montgomery County requesting that the court issue an ex parte temporary peace order, prohibiting appellant from any further contact with Peters or his family (\u201cpeace order action\u201d). Peters alleged that appellant was stalking and harassing him and his family. The district court granted Peters\u2019 request and issued an order, directing appellant to refrain from having any contact with Peters or his family and to stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>away from Peters\u2019 residence, place of employment, and his children\u2019s school, which appellant\u2019s children also attended. A hearing on the petition followed. When that hearing ended, the district court issued a peace order, which largely incorporated restrictions imposed by the ex parte order<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but also required appellant to participate in any anger management and psychiatric or psychological counseling deemed necessary by the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">From that order, appellant noted an appeal to the circuit court. Finding that there was \u201cno evidence presented to support the allegations of stalking or harassment,\u201d the circuit court vacated the peace order. That action prompted appellant to move for sanctions. Claiming that Peters filed the petition for a peace order in bad faith and without substantial justification, appellant requested an award for counsel fees and costs. The circuit court denied that motion, stating that it \u201c[did] not find that there was bad faith and a lack of substantial justification in the filing and prosecution of the Petition for Protective Order.\u201d It added that \u201csanctions [were] not appropriate in a matter that went to hearing in both the District and Circuit Courts for Montgomery County, Md, after which the hearing judges reached opposite conclusions.\u201d \u201cOn this basis alone,\u201d the circuit court opined, \u201cthere was clearly a colorable claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\n<em>The Instant Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Appellant filed a complaint against the Association, the Board, and Peters in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. That complaint contained three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The first count was a derivative action against the Association. It alleged that the counsel fees incurred by the Association in pursuit of an injunction against appellant \u201c[was] not in the interest of the [Association] and [was] detrimental to the same\u201d and that it was \u201cfruitless and futile for [appellant] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>make a demand upon the Board of Directors\u201d to correct these expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The second count was an abuse of process claim against Peters. It alleged that Peters had obtained a peace order with the \u201culterior motive\u201d of \u201cpreventing appellant from attending, presenting his position, and/or otherwise exercising his rights at meetings of the ... Association.\u201d And the third and final count was a malicious use of process claim against Peters. It alleged that Peters had maliciously sought the issuance of the peace order against appellant, that he did not have probable cause to do so, and that, as a result, he had been \u201cdamaged\u201d by appellant; the nature of those damages was not spelled out.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Appellees responded by filing a motion requesting dismissal of the complaint or, in the alternative, summary judgment as to all counts. Granting that motion in part, the circuit court dismissed appellant\u2019s abuse of process claim against Peters, but granted him leave to amend that count. Appellant did, but to no avail as the circuit court again dismissed that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Appellant then filed a \u201cMotion to Compel Fulfillment of Discovery Requests.\u201d In that motion, he asked, among other things, that the circuit court compel the Association to make available to him certain records that he claimed he had requested and that the Commission had ordered the Association to produce in the administrative action. Finding that appellant had \u201cnot complied] with the applicable rules of procedure,\u201d the circuit court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">On the day of trial, appellees moved for summary judgment as to the remaining two counts. The circuit court granted that motion and entered judgment in favor of the Association and Peters.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in dismissing the abuse of process claim against Peters and granting summary judgment in favor of the Board on the derivative action and in favor of Peters on the malicious use of process claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>We begin our review of these contentions by first addressing appellant\u2019s claim that summary judgment should not have been granted as to his derivative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\n<em>Derivative Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the Association as to appellant\u2019s derivative action on the grounds that it was barred by collateral estoppel. The court erred, appellant claims, because that defense was waived by the Association and it was, in any event, not applicable to his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we turn first to the rule that governs such decisions, Maryland Rule 2-501. That rule provides: \u201cAny party may file at any time a motion for summary judgment on all or part of an action on the ground that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md. Rule 2-501. Thus, our task is to determine if there is a \u201cgenuine dispute of material fact\u201d and, if not, whether the moving party \u201cis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\u201cIn determining whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists and, if not, what the ruling of law should be, the court examines the pleadings, admissions, and affidavits, etc., resolving all inferences to be drawn therefrom against the moving party.\u201d <em>Gross v. Sussex, Inc., </em>332 Md. 247, 256, 630 A.2d 1156 (1993) (citations omitted). \u201cIn other words, all inferences must be resolved against the moving party when determining whether a factual dispute exists, even when the underlying facts are undisputed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, we caution, \u201cthe mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is insufficient to preclude the grant of summary judgment; there must be evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Prods., Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 738-39, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Finally, \u201c[i]n reviewing [the circuit court\u2019s] decision to grant a motion for summary judgment, we evaluate \u2018the same material from the record and decide[ ] the same legal issues as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>circuit court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crews v. Hollenbach, </em>126 Md.App. 609, 624, 730 A.2d 742 (1999), <em>aff'd, </em>358 Md. 627, 751 A.2d 481 (2000) (quoting <em>Lopata v. Miller, </em>122 Md.App. 76, 83, 712 A.2d 24 (1998)). Indeed, \u201can appellate court ordinarily may uphold the grant of a summary judgment only on the grounds relied on by the trial court.\u201d <em>Ashton v. Brown,, </em>339 Md. 70, 80, 660 A.2d 447 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Having reviewed when summary judgment is appropriate, we turn to the question of whether summary judgment was appropriate in this instance. In doing so, we shall consider only the ground upon which that judgment was granted: that it was barred by collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u201c \u2018When an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the doctrine of collateral estoppel renders that determination conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Janes v. State, </em>350 Md. 284, 295, 711 A.2d 1319 (1998) (quoting <em>Murray Int'l Freight Corp. v. Graham, </em>315 Md. 543, 547, 555 A.2d 502 (1989)). To invoke the doctrine of collateral estoppel,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201c[t]he proponent must establish that: (1) the issue sought to be precluded is identical to one previously litigated; (2) the issue must have been actually determined in the prior proceeding; (3) determination of the issue must have been a critical and necessary part of the decision in the prior proceeding; (4) the prior judgment must be final and valid; and (5) the party against whom estoppel is asserted must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the previous forum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\"><em>Thacker v. City of Hyattsville, </em>135 Md.App. 268, 288-89, 762 A.2d 172 (2000) (quoting <em>Sedlack v. Braswell Servs. Group, </em>134 F.3d 219, 224 (4th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Appellant argued in the injunction action that the Association was motivated, not by a wish to enforce the community\u2019s covenants, rules, and regulations, but by a desire to discriminate against him because he had children. The circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>rejected that argument, characterizing it as \u201cbizarre.\u201d It then granted the Association\u2019s request for injunctive relief and \u201corder[ed] that [appellant and his wife] not park any of their motor vehicles ... on the grass in front or in the rear of their home, [and] that they remove the basketball hoops from the front of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Having lost in the injunction action, appellant raises the same issue in the instant case. This time, however, he casts it in the form of a \u201cderivative action.\u201d In pleading that action, appellant argues, once again, that the Association was motivated by a discriminatory intent in bringing the injunction action against him. But, instead of asking that the injunctive relief requested be denied, he seeks \u201cto the use of all members\u201d of the Association, legal fees and costs incurred in the prosecution of that action. Thus, the underlying issue in both cases is the same: whether the Association\u2019s actions were prompted by an unlawful discriminatory intent or by a lawful desire to enforce community covenants, rules, and regulations. Indeed, appellant conceded as much below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">As there is no dispute that this issue was \u201ca critical and necessary part of the decision in the prior proceeding\u201d and that appellant had a \u201cfull and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the previous forum,\u201d only one question remains before we can conclude that the derivative action was, as found below, barred by collateral estoppel. That question, compound and complicated, is whether the finality of the judgment rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>in the injunction action was vitiated by either the filing of an appeal or the dismissal of that appeal as moot. To answer that question, we begin by summarizing the litigatory events leading up to the dismissal of the derivative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">After the Association filed the injunction action, seeking the removal of the basketball hoop and appellant\u2019s car, appellant filed a three count complaint in the instant case. Twelve days after the Association answered that complaint, the circuit court granted the Association\u2019s request for injunctive relief. Challenging that decision, appellant noted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">That appeal was decided one week before trial commenced in the instant case. In a reported opinion, this Court dismissed all of the issues of that appeal, relating to the injunction, as moot. We explained: \u201cNow that the Campbells have moved from the Lake Hallowell community, there is no reason for us to resolve whether they were properly barred from parking their car on their lawn or keeping a basketball hoop in the front portion of their property.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>152 Md.App. at 149, 831 A.2d 465. But the mandate of this Court was not issued until after the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the Association. Consequently, under Maryland Rule 8-606(a), the appeal was still technically pending when summary judgment was entered in the instant case. That rule provides that \u201c[a]ny disposition of an appeal, including a voluntary dismissal, shall be evidenced by the mandate of the Court, which shall be certified by the Clerk under the seal of the Court and shall constitute the judgment of the Court.\u201d Md. Rule 8-606(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The finality of a judgment on appeal for purposes of res judicata and collateral estoppel remains, as of today, an open question in Maryland, <em>In re Cmty. Mgmt. Corp. of Md. v. Weitz, </em>288 B.R. 104, 110 (D.Md.2002), <em>aff'd, </em>Docket No. 03-1020, 2003 WL 22952624 (4th Cir., Dec.16, 2003) (unpublished table decision); <em>Badders v. Uhler, </em>233 Md. 441, 442-43, 197 A.2d 120 (1964); <em>Davis v. Frederick County Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>25 Md.App. 68, 73 n. 4, 334 A.2d 165 (1975), though that issue was addressed by the United States Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>more than a century ago. In <em>Deposit Bank of Frankfort v. Board of Councilmen, </em>191 U.S. 499, 514, 24 S.Ct. 154, 48 L.Ed. 276 (1903), the Supreme Court held that a final judgment of a federal trial court is conclusive, for purposes of res judicata, until that judgment is modified or reversed. And that rule has defied the vagaries of time. As the United State Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently observed: \u201c[T]he established rule in the federal courts [is] that a final judgment retains all of its res judicata consequences pending decision of the appeal.... \u201d <em>Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Co. v.

Schopler, <em>Judgment as res judicata pending appeal or motion for a new trial, or during </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>the time allowed therefor, </em>9 A.L.R.2d 984 \u00a7 2 (1950) (quoting 2 A.C. Freeman, <em>Law of Judgments </em>1526 (5th ed.1925)). But, on the other hand, the rule that the pendency of an appeal does not prevent a judgment from operating as a res judicata may permit an erroneous judgment, facing certain reversal, to be used to preclude further inquiry into a key issue, before reversal, \u201c \u2018and thereby lead to another judgment, from which it may be impossible to obtain relief notwithstanding such reversal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Freeman, <em>supra, </em>at 1528).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Nonetheless, a broad consensus has emerged that the pendency of an appeal should not suspend the operation of a judgment for purposes of res judicata or collateral estoppel. This view is, in the words of Comment f to the Restatement (Second) of Judgments, \u201c[t]he better view.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 13(f) (1982). And we agree. As one legal commentator has pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">Despite the manifest risks of resting preclusion on a judgment that is being appealed, the alternative of retrying the common claims, defenses, or issues is even worse. All of the values served by res judicata are threatened or destroyed by the burdens of retrial, the potential for inconsistent results, and the occasionally bizarre problems of achieving repose and finality that may arise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, 18A <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 4433, at 94 (2d ed.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Indeed, to strip a judgment of its preclusive effect merely because an appeal is pending, in our view, undermines the very purpose of the doctrine of res judicata, which is \u201cto avoid the expense and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and foster reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibilities of inconsistent decisions.\u201d <em>Janes, </em>350 Md. at 295, 711 A.2d 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The United States District Court for the District of Maryland has further observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">If a judgment was denied its <em>res judicata </em>effect merely because an appeal was pending, litigants would be able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>refile an identical case in another trial court while the appeal is pending, which would hog-tie the trial courts with duplicative litigation. If the plaintiff wants to appeal the decision of a trial court, the appropriate course is to ... appeal the ruling in the state appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><em>Warwick Corp., </em>573 F.Supp. at 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Moreover, if the pendency of an appeal prevented a judgment from having a res judicata effect, litigants would be encouraged to file meritless appeals to obtain a second chance to relitigate the same issue or to delay the imposition of a valid judgment. And, finally, the danger that an erroneous judgment will affect the rights of the parties in subsequent and related litigation, while an appeal of that judgment is pending, is avoidable. In an appropriate case, the trial court in the second proceeding may simply stay that proceeding, pending appellate review of the judgment, whose validity is at issue. <em>See </em>1A C.J.S. <em>Actions </em>\u00a7 249a, at 735 (1985) (\u201cWhere two actions are pending, and a decision in the prior one will adequately determine the rights of the parties, the second action may be stayed until the first is determined, and the same rule applies where the prior action is pending on appeal .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We stress that we are not suggesting that the mere pendency of an appeal should necessarily cause a trial court in a subsequent proceeding, in which some of the same issues arise, to stay that proceeding, upon a party\u2019s request to do so. In fact, no stay should be issued until the trial court has \u201cbalanc[ed] the competing interests\u201d at stake and determined that a stay will not \u201cwork injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 244, at 725. If, for example, a second action \u201cpresents claims or issues that must be tried regardless of the outcome of the first action and there are cogent reasons to fear the effects of delay,\u201d then a stay of that action would be, under most circumstances, inappropriate. <em>See 18A </em>Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4433, at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">For these reasons, we hold that the pendency of an appeal does not affect the finality of a judgment for res judicata purposes. But this does not end our inquiry. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>appeal of the judgment at issue has an added wrinkle: it was dismissed as moot. Consequently, we must now consider whether a dismissal of an appeal for mootness vitiates the preclusive effect of the underlying judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The Court of Appeals has held that it does. In <em>Murray International, </em>315 Md. 543, 555 A.2d 502, the Court of declared that \u201c \u2018[wjhere a party to a judgment cannot obtain the decision of an appellate court because the matter determined against him is ... moot, the judgment is not conclusive against him in a subsequent action on a different cause of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552 n. 5, 555 A.2d 502 (quoting <em>Restatements of Judgments </em>\u00a7 69(2) (1942)). But that rule, as the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit noted, has exceptions. In <em>Gelpi v. Tugwell, </em>123 F.2d 377 (1st Cir.1941), the First Circuit held that collateral estoppel still attaches when the party against whom the defense is raised is the party who causes the case to become moot. <em>See id. </em>at 378. And that, of course, is what occurred here. Appellant moved out of the Lake Hallowell Community and thereby rendered his own appeal moot. Hence, we hold that he may not now avoid the preclusive effect of the circuit court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">But even if that is so, the Association\u2019s defense of collateral estoppel must fail, appellant insists, because it runs afoul of Rule 2-323. That rule requires that affirmative defenses be raised by answer not, as here, by motion or other litigatory devices. Having failed to raise collateral estoppel in its initial answer or any amended version of that answer, as required by Rule 2-323(g), the Association, appellant argues, waived that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u201cRule 2-323 provides that all defenses of law or fact to claims filed must be asserted in an answer. Subsection (g) enumerates various affirmative defenses, including collateral estoppel and <em>res judicata, </em>that must be \u2018set forth by separate defenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyd v. Bowen, </em>145 Md.App. 635, 654, 806 A.2d 314 (2002) (quoting Md. Rule 2-323). As this Court stated in <em>Gooch v. Maryland Mechanical Systems, Inc., </em>81 Md.App. 376, 384-85, 567 A.2d 954 (1990): \u201cThe requirement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>affirmative defenses be set forth separately is not a mere nicety; it is designed to give notice to the plaintiff of the defenses asserted to his complaint.\u201d Furthermore, \u201c[t]his rule prevents unfair surprise and enables a plaintiff to concentrate the focus of his discovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, 567 A.2d 954. For that reason, \u201cthe failure of a defendant to include an affirmative defense in its original answer or a properly amended answer bars the defendant from relying on the defense to obtain judgment in its favor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">When the Association filed its answer in this action, it did not assert the defense of collateral estoppel. It was not until June 23, 2003, at a hearing on its motion to quash appellant\u2019s subpoenas, that it even suggested that the derivative action was barred by collateral estoppel. Two weeks later, on July 7, 2003, the first day of trial, the Association moved for summary judgment on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">But the Association\u2019s failure to raise the defense of collateral estoppel, at the time it filed its answer to appellant\u2019s complaint, is understandable: It filed its answer in the instant case two weeks before the circuit court rendered a decision in the injunction case and thus, that defense was not available to the Association at the time that it filed its answer. That of course does not explain or justify the Association\u2019s failure to subsequently amend its answer to include the defense of collateral estoppel under Maryland Rule 2-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">That rule permits a party to amend its pleading \u201cat any time prior to 15 days of a scheduled trial date.\u201d Md. Rule 2-341(a). Even within that fifteen day period, a party may amend its pleading with leave of the court or with the written consent of the adverse party. Md. Rule 2-341(b). An amendment to a pleading may, among other things, \u201cset forth transactions or events that have occurred since the filing of the pleading sought to be amended,\u201d Md. Rule 2-341 (c)(3), and \u201cchange the nature of the action or defense.\u201d Md. Rule 2-341(c)(1). \u201cAmendments shall be freely allowed,\u201d the rule states, \u201cwhen justice so permits.\u201d Md. Rule 2-341(c). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Association therefore could have amended its answer to include the defense of collateral estoppel before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">We nonetheless conclude that the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the Association on that ground. The Supreme Court has held that in \u201cspecial circumstances!,][m]ost notably, \u2018if a court is on notice that it has previously decided the issue presented, the court may dismiss the action <em>sua sponte, </em>even though the defense has not been raised.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arizona v. California, </em>530 U.S. 392, 412, 120 S.Ct. 2304, 147 L.Ed.2d 374 (2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians, </em>448 U.S. 371, 432, 100 S.Ct. 2716, 65 L.Ed.2d 844 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)). In so holding, the Court noted that \u201c \u2018[t]his result is fully consistent with the policies underlying res judicata: it is not based solely on the defendant\u2019s interest in avoiding the burdens of twice defending a suit, but is also based on the avoidance of unnecessary judicial waste.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sioux Nation, </em>448 U.S. at 432, 100 S.Ct. 2716 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)). The Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion in <em>Johnston v. Johnston, </em>297 Md. 48, 465 A.2d 436 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In that case, Mr. Johnston filed a petition to set aside a separation agreement that had been incorporated, but not merged, into the parties\u2019 divorce decree, arguing that, at the time he entered the agreement, he was suffering from a mental illness that impaired his capacity to enter into the agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 50-51, 465 A.2d 436. Because Mr. Johnston had failed to allege fraud, mistake or irregularity as grounds for his request, the circuit court declined to set aside the agreement and, granting Mrs. Johnson\u2019s motion to strike, struck the petition. <em>Id. </em>at 52, 465 A.2d 436. Finding no error, we affirmed the circuit court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 52-53, 465 A.2d 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The Court of Appeals took a different path to reach the same result. It focused on the parties\u2019 separation agreement, holding that \u201cthe approval and incorporation of the agreement conclusively established the validity of the agreement and precludes a collateral attack by either party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 465 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>A.2d 436. It reached that conclusion despite the failure of the parties to raise this issue, observing: \u201c[W]e believe that in the interests of judicial economy it is appropriate for us to address it as it is dispositive of the matter before us.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59, 465 A.2d 436. The Court thus declared that, in the interests of judicial economy, it may sua sponte invoke res judicata or collateral estoppel to resolve a matter before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the Association had discriminated against him in the enforcement of its rules was fully litigated and decided in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County before this matter came to trial in the same court. To now permit appellant to relitigate this issue or to remand this case for the sole purpose of permitting the Association to raise this defense would constitute an unacceptable waste of the parties\u2019 and the circuit court\u2019s resources, particularly when appellant was not prejudiced by the Association\u2019s belated assertion of that defense. Indeed, appellant was given the opportunity to present any argument he might have had in connection with this issue below. We therefore hold that the court did not commit reversible error in granting summaiy judgment in favor of the Association as to appellant\u2019s derivative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\n<em>Abuse of Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Appellant argues that the circuit court erred in granting Peters\u2019 motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s abuse of process claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">We begin our analysis of this claim by noting that, \u201c[i]n reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss, we must determine whether the complaint, on its face, discloses a legally sufficient cause of action.\u201d <em>Fioretti v. Md. State Bd. of Dental Exam\u2019rs, </em>351 Md. 66, 72, 716 A.2d 258 (1998). To make that determination, we view all well-pleaded facts \u201c \u2018in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tavakoli-Nouri v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 716, 725, 779 A.2d 992 (2001) (quoting <em>Parker v. Kowalsky &amp; Hirschhorn, P.A., </em>124 Md.App. 447, 458, 722 A.2d 441 (1999)). That means that any \u201c[ajmbiguities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>and uncertainties\u201d in the complaint must be construed in his or her favor. <em>Downs v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Balt., </em>111 Md.App. 616, 619, 683 A.2d 808 (1996). After doing so, we may affirm a grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim \u201con any ground adequately shown by the record, even one upon which the circuit court has not relied or one that the parties have not raised.\u201d <em>Pope v. Bd. of Sch. Comm\u2019rs, </em>106 Md.App. 578, 591, 665 A.2d 713 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The tort of abuse of process \u201c \u2018is concerned with the improper use of civil or criminal process in a manner not contemplated by law after it has been issued....\u2019\u201d <em>One Thousand Fleet Ltd.

The elements of abuse of process are: \u201cfirst, that the defendant wilfully used process after it has issued in a manner not contemplated by law; second, that the defendant acted to satisfy an ulterior motive; and third, that damages resulted from the defendants use of perverted process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 694 A.2d 952 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The mere issuance of the process itself, however, is not actionable, even if it is done with an \u201culterior motive\u201d or \u201cbad intention.\u201d <em>Herring v.

The Court further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqi1\">\u201cThe most common instance of the operation of this principle is an attempt to extort money from the person subjected to the process....

Unfortunately, appellant has failed to allege either impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Appellant alleges that \u201c[b]y instituting the [peace order proceedings], Peters\u2019 [sic] misused and perverted the process for an improper purpose, namely, to keep [appellant] away from the [Association] meetings in which Campbell had a right to attend, restricting [appellant\u2019s] freedom and liberty and resulting in the wrongful deprivation of said liberty.\u201d But he does not claim that Peters took any action apart from seeking a peace order. Mere initiation of such proceedings, as noted above, does not constitute the tort of abuse of process. <em>Herving, </em>21 Md.App. at 534, 321 A.2d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Appellant also failed to allege he had been arrested or that his property had been seized. <em>See One Thousand Fleet, </em>346 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Md. at 45-48, 694 A.2d 952; <em>Herring, </em>21 Md.App. at 539, 321 A.2d 182. He simply asserted in his complaint that, \u201cas a proximate result and cause of Peters\u2019 perverted use of process, [he] was damaged.\u201d Because appellant failed to allege a legally sufficient claim for abuse of process, the circuit court did not err in dismissing that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\n<em>Malicious Use of Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in granting Peters\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to appellant\u2019s malicious use of process claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">To begin with, \u201c[s]uits for malicious use of process are viewed with disfavor in law and are to be carefully guarded against.\u201d <em>One Thousand Fleet, </em>346 Md. at 37, 694 A.2d 952 (quoting <em>N. Pt. Constr. Co. v. Sagner, </em>185 Md. 200, 207, 44 A.2d 441 (1945)). Unlike the abuse of process tort, which, as discussed earlier, is \u201cconcerned with the improper use of civil or criminal process in a manner not contemplated by law after it has been issued,\u201d the malicious use of process tort is \u201cconcerned with maliciously causing criminal or civil process to issue for its ostensible purpose, but without probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39, 694 A.2d 952 (quoting <em>Walker, </em>237 Md. at 87, 205 A.2d 302). Such a claim has five elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">First, a prior civil proceeding must have been instituted by the defendant. Second, the proceeding must have been instituted without probable cause.... Third, the prior civil proceeding must have been instituted by the defendant with malice.....Fourth, the proceedings must have terminated in favor of the plaintiff. Finally, the plaintiff must establish that damages were inflicted upon the plaintiff by arrest or imprisonment, by seizure of property, or by other special injury which would not necessarily result in all suits prosecuted to recover for a like cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 37, 694 A.2d 952 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">In this case, the circuit court found that appellant could not establish, as a matter of law, two of those five elements\u2014that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the proceeding was instituted without probable cause and that \u201cdamages were inflicted upon the plaintiff by arrest or imprisonment, by seizure of property, or by other special injury which would not necessarily result in all suits prosecuted to recover for a like cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">As for want of probable cause, the Court of Appeals has held that probable cause \u201cmeans \u2018a reasonable ground for belief in the existence of such state of facts as would warrant institution of the suit or proceeding complained of.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, 694 A.2d 952 (quoting <em>Sagner, </em>185 Md. at 208-09, 44 A.2d 441). \u201cWhether the evidence in any given case is legally sufficient to show want of probable cause is a question of law.\u201d <em>Sagner, </em>185 Md. at 207, 44 A.2d 441. Moreover, as a matter of law, \u201ca judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction adverse to the defendant [in the original suit] is, in general, conclusive proof of probable cause, although the judgment ... was later reversed in an appellate court.\u201d <em>Herring, 21 </em>Md.App. at 540, 321 A.2d 182 (quoting <em>Owens v. Graetzel, </em>149 Md. 689, 696, 132 A. 265 (1926)).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Appellant argues that Peters initiated the peace order process in the district court without probable cause. The circuit court, appellant points out, vacated the district court\u2019s order following a <em>de novo </em>appeal. That the circuit court found it unnecessary to hear closing arguments before ruling in his favor, appellant claims, is further evidence that the petition for a peace order was not supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">But appellant\u2019s claim fails as a matter of law. Peters\u2019 victory in the district court, though later vacated by the circuit court, is \u201cconclusive proof\u201d that Peters had probable cause to initiate the process. <em>See Herring, 21 </em>Md.App. at 540, 321 A.2d 182. And, although the circuit court in the peace order proceedings found that \u201cthere ha[d] been no evidence presented to support [Peters\u2019 allegations],\u201d it also expressly found that Peters had a substantial justification for instituting the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">After the circuit court vacated the peace order against the appellant, appellant moved for sanctions against Peters. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>circuit court denied that request, finding that \u201cthere was [not] bad faith and a lack of substantial justification in the filing and prosecution of the Petition for Protective Order.\u201d These facts are not disputed, and they establish, as a matter of law, that Peters had probable cause to initiate the peace order process.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The circuit court also found that appellant could not establish special damages, which the Court of Appeals has defined as \u201cdamages ... inflicted upon the plaintiff by arrest or imprisonment, by seizure of property, or by other special injury which would not necessarily result in all suits prosecuted to recover for a like cause of action.\u201d <em>One Thousand Fleet, </em>346 Md. at 37, 694 A.2d 952. As the Court of Appeals observed in <em>One Thousand Fleet:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cMaryland has steadfastly adhered to the so-called \u2018English\u2019 rule that no action will lie for the malicious prosecution of a civil suit when there has been no arrest of the person, no seizure of the property of the defendant, and no special injury sustained which would not ordinarily result in all suits prosecuted for like causes of action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">346 Md. at 44, 694 A.2d 952 (quoting <em>Sagner, </em>185 Md. at 207, 44 A.2d 441).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Appellant argues that his \u201cdeprivation of liberty,\u201d specifically, his inability to attend Association meetings during the four months that the peace order was in effect, constitutes \u201cspecial damages.\u201d He is incorrect. Special damages are those that \u201c\u2018would not ordinarily result in all suits prosecuted for like causes of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sagner, </em>185 Md. at 207, 44 A.2d 441). Appellant\u2019s restricted liberty, on the other hand, is a damage that would ordinarily, if not always, result from the issuance of a peace order. For that reason, it is not a \u201cspecial injury\u201d as contemplated by malicious use of process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in refusing to grant his motions to compel discovery. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Appellant filed a motion, inartfully titled \u201cMotion to Compel\u00ed Fulfillment of Discovery Requests.\u201d In that motion, he requested, among other things, that the circuit court compel the Association to produce certain records that the Commission had ordered, in another case, be made available to him. Finding that appellant had \u201cnot complied] with the applicable rules of procedure\u201d for discovery, the circuit court denied the motion. Appellant does not contest that finding. In fact, he asserts in his reply brief that \u201cboth parties ... agree that [appellant] did not comply with the rules of discovery when requesting discoverable material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">But in his reply brief, he does allege that the Association committed fraud by failing to produce the documents that the Commission ordered were to be made available to him. He also requests that we \u201csanction [appellees\u2019 counsel] by whatever means is appropriate,\u201d in order \u201cto remedy\u201d what appellant contends are numerous \u201cfalse statements made and evidence offered in the case at bar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Having failed to raise those arguments or seek that relief in his initial brief, appellant may not raise them for the first time in his reply brief. <em>See Beck v. Mangels, </em>100 Md.App. 144, 149, 640 A.2d 236 (1994) (\u201cMd. Rule 8-504(a)(5)) requires a party to present \u2018argument in support of the party\u2019s position[;] ... [thus], it is necessary for the appellant to present <em>and argue </em>all points of appeal in his initial brief.\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Fed. Land Bank of Balt., Inc. v. Esham, </em>43 Md.App. 446, 457, 406 A.2d 928 (1979)). We therefore decline to address these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\">. This order, however, permitted appellant to go to the school, as long as he had no contact with Peters' children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b542-7\">. Appellant admitted, during the following exchange at the July 7th hearing, that the central issue of both cases was the same. He further conceded if the circuit court\u2019s decision in the injunction action was a final judgment then he was precluded by collateral estoppel from raising the same issues which had been litigated during that proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">[The Court]: Isn\u2019t a simpler way to say what you\u2019re saying is that [the circuit court's ruling in the injunction action] is not a final judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIe\">[Appellant]: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">[The Court]: Okay. I hear you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">[Appellant]: I\u2019m in big trouble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\">[The Court]: Okay. It seems to me that if your claims rest on that and [if] it is a final judgment, then collateral estoppel applies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-12\">[Appellant]: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\">.
