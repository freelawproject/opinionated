Doe d. Tatham, </em>7 Adolphus &amp; E. 313, 112 Eng. Rep. 488 (King\u2019s Bench, 1837), <em>aff'd, </em>5 Cl. &amp; F. 559, 47 Rev. Rep. 136 (House of Lords, 1838), still rises periodically from an unquiet grave and, like old King Hamlet, is \u201cdoomed for a time to walk the night.\u201d It was in the 1837 opinion of Baron Parke that the term of art \u201cimplied assertion\u201d first saw the light of day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">John Marsden was possessed of a great country estate in Lancashire, including Hornby Castle as well as numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>mines, fisheries, commons, and a variety of manorial rights. The contest between Wright, Marsden\u2019s steward and devisee, and Admiral Tatham, Marsden\u2019s cousin and heir at law, hinged upon old Marsden\u2019s testamentary capacity to make a will in 1822 and a codicil in 1825.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Admiral Tatham challenged his cousin\u2019s testamentary capacity by introducing evidence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">that Marsden was treated as a child by his own menial servants; that, in his youth, he was called, in the village where he lived, \u201cSilly Jack,\u201d and \u201cSilly Marsden,\u201d ...; that a witness had seen boys shouting after him, \u201cThere goes crazy Marsden,\u201d and throwing dirt at him, and had persuaded a person passing by to see him home.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">112 Eng. Rep. at 490. In response, three letters to Marsden from three separate and then deceased correspondents were offered by Wright to prove that Marsden was, in fact, competent. A letter from a cousin in America, in 1784, recounted the details of the trans-Atlantic voyage and described conditions in the former colonies. A second letter, from the local vicar, in 1786, discussed the settlement of a legal dispute between Marsden and the parish. A third letter, from a Reverend Ellershaw, in 1799, thanked Marsden for having obtained Ellershaw\u2019s earlier appointment as a curate. The evidentiary theory of the proponent was that the tone of the letters indicated that the correspondents believed Marsden to be competent and that those beliefs by persons who knew him, in turn, proved that Marsden was competent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The holding of <em>Wright v. Tatham </em>was that the letters were \u201cimplied assertions\u201d of Marsden\u2019s competency and were, therefore, inadmissible hearsay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The imprimatur of the House of Lords was placed on that holding in 1838.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">For more than a century after 1838, <em>Wright v. Tatham </em>assumed a generative lead role in the law of evidence comparable to that played by <em>Palsgraf </em>in torts, by <em>Adam,s v. Lind,sell </em>in contracts, and by <em>Shelley\u2019s Case </em>in the law of trusts. Both 1) non-assertive non-verbal conduct and 2) non-assertive utterances were regularly held to be hearsay as \u201cimplied assertions\u201d when they were offered for the two-step inferential process of 1) first implying a belief on the part of the declarants and 2) then implying the truth of the things believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">It was only 34 years after the House of Lords affixed its seal of approval that the Maryland Court of Appeals also signed on to <em>Wright v. Tatham </em>in <em>Waters v. Waters, </em>35 Md. 531, 543-46 (1872), a case involving testamentary capacity. (\u201cWe yield our unqualified assent to the rule of evidence established in that case.\u201d) Citing <em>Waters v. Waters, </em>the Court of Special Appeals continued to pursue the siren call in <em>Eiland v. State, </em>92 Md.App. 56, 79-82, 607 A.2d 42 (1992), rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. <em>Tyler v. State, </em>330 Md. 261, 623 A.2d 648 (1993). In <em>Eiland, </em>to be sure, we held three challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>utterances to be admissible, but we did so, not on the ground that they were non-hearsay, but on the very different ground that they qualified as trustworthy under four separate exceptions to the Rule Against Hearsay.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Notwithstanding a massive pull-back by the Federal Rules of Evidence in 1973, and by the Maryland Rules of Evidence in 1994, from what had been deemed hearsay in the case of non-assertive non-verbal behavior and an apparent, albeit less explicit, pullback in the case of non-assertive utterances and even some assertive utterances, the law of evidence still struggles to fence off the outer boundary of the \u201cimplied assertion\u201d as an instance of possible hearsay, and there are still randomly reported sightings of Old Marsden along the forest edges of that boundary. The most recent alleged sighting was by the appellant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The Murder of Three-Year-Old Caler\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The appellant, Erik Stoddard, was convicted by a Baltimore City jury, presided over by Judge Roger W. Brown, of the second-degree murder of three-year-old Calen DiRubbo and of child abuse resulting in death. The appellant was the live-in boyfriend of the victim\u2019s mother and was regularly, albeit not exclusively, the daytime caretaker of Calen.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The immediate cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries. Although the time of Calen\u2019s death was between 8:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. on June 15, 2002, the state of Calen\u2019s body indicated to the medical examiner that the fatal injuries had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>been inflicted at some time between 4:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. that day. The onset of vomiting by Calen at about noon, which the medical examiner opined would have followed shortly after the infliction of a \u201ctremendous amount of force\u201d to the abdomen, resulting in a severed bowel, further pinpointed the likely timing of the injury to shortly before noon. It was at noon that the appellant called Calen\u2019s mother to report the vomiting. Moving downward from the earliest end of the time range, the presence in the home of Calen\u2019s mother until she went to work at 9 a.m., and the presence of Calen\u2019s maternal grandfather until about 11 a.m., permits the inference that the ultimately fatal injuries were not inflicted before 11 a.m. Inferentially, the critical time period may well have been between 11 a.m. and noon.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The medical examiner also established that there was evidence of numerous injuries on various parts of Calen\u2019s body and that those injuries had been inflicted over a period of a month or more prior to Calen\u2019s death. The maternal grandmother noticed, beginning in March, various bruises on Cal-en\u2019s body, a \u201cgoose egg\u201d on her forehead, and black eyes. She warned her daughter that if she saw any more injuries to the child, she was going to call social services. In June, she testified, Calen became extremely upset about returning home when the appellant was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Calen\u2019s aunt also testified that, beginning in March, Calen became more withdrawn and began to regress in her speaking skills. The aunt also noticed a large bruise on Calen\u2019s forehead, black eyes, and a bruise on the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Calen\u2019s mother began noticing bruises on Calen\u2019s body over a period of four or five months before she died. She recounted, in a statement to the police that was introduced as substantive evidence, that the appellant was toilet training Calen by spanking her so hard that it left bruises on her buttocks. The appellant ignored the mother\u2019s admonishment that he was hitting Calen too hard. She stated that she heard Calen cry out in pain with \u201cshrill shrieks\u201d when Calen was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>alone in the bathroom with the appellant. She stated that the appellant once injured Calen by \u201cwhacking\u201d her on the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In any event, the appellant does not challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions. He raises the two contentions, challenging evidentiary rulings,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">1. that Judge Brown erroneously admitted an out-of-court implied assertion in violation of the hearsay rule, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">2. that Judge Brown erroneously permitted the State to question three separate witnesses about prior acts of violence on the part of the appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">An Out-of-Court Utterance By Eighteen-Month-Old Jasmine Pritchett</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">On June 15, Jennifer Pritchett, Calen\u2019s aunt, dropped off her eighteen-month-old daughter, Jasmine, Calen\u2019s cousin, to stay with Calen while she, the mother, was attending a wedding. Jasmine arrived at between 11:15 and 11:30 a.m. At home were Calen and Calen\u2019s five-year-old brother, Nick. Attending the three children was the appellant. The timing was such that Jasmine may well have been present when the fatal injuries were inflicted on Calen. Jennifer Pritchett picked Jasmine up between 4:15 and 4:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Jennifer Pritchett testified about dramatic changes in Jasmine\u2019s behavior immediately following her visit to 2505 Moore Avenue on the day Calen died. She testified that, although Jasmine had never before in her life exhibited any such behavior, she suddenly began suffering nightmares, hives, unaccustomed fear of strangers or loud noise, and screaming fits.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">Q. Ma\u2019am, <em>have you noticed any behavioral changes in Jasmine since Saturday June 15th?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">A. <em>Yes, I have.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">Q. And would you describe just the behavioral changes for the jury, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-13\">A. Jasmine has become-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An_\">THE COURT: Keep your voice up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>A. <em>Jasmine is very petrified of any strangers introduced to her or if there is any form of loud noise, yelling, anything, she has gotten so upset that she\u2019s broken out in hives. She has nightmares and screaming fits.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">Q. <em>Have you ever seen any of these beha/oiors prior to June 15th?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">\n<em>A. No.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">At that point Ms. Pritchett had not repeated a word that had been uttered by Jasmine and there was demonstrably no hearsay problem. The examination then proceeded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">Q. Has she ever\u2014you have never discussed this case with her, have you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">A. No, I have not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">Q. And has she ever\u2014has she ever asked you any questions about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">A. She asked me if Erik was going to-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alj\">MR.McFADDEN: Object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\">THE COURT: No, Pm going to overrule it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-13\">Q. Go ahead, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-14\">A. <em>She asked me if Erik was going to get her.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">The issue is a very narrow one. Is a frightened eighteen-month-old\u2019s question to her mother, \u201cIs Erik going to get me?\u201d an instance of hearsay? In <em>Holland v. State, </em>122 Md.App. 532, 543, 713 A.2d 364 (1998), we at least anticipated the question.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-17\"><em>When a witness testifies as to words spoken by some other person </em>on some other occasion, <em>it has become, </em>sadly, <em>a Pavlovian reflex among lawyers to leap to their feet and yell, \u201cHearsay!\u201d </em>The reflex is frequently as nonsensical as it is automatic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-18\">(Emphasis supplied). On this occasion, we are not suggesting that the reflex was nonsensical. It was, as the necessary complexity of our analysis will demonstrate, ingeniously clev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>er. Like Scrooge on Christmas Eve, we are confronted by the Ghost of the Hearsay Rule Past.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The ABC\u2019s of Hearsay As a Point of Analytic Departure</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">To a student first embarking on Evidence 101, the key to understanding hearsay is, long before venturing into the thicket of the hearsay exceptions, to develop a sure \u201cfeel\u201d for the difference between those utterances that are hearsay and those that are not. One must be able to negotiate the territory that McCormick called \u201cthe borderland of hearsay.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is not enough to know that a challenged statement is admissible. That can be a lucky guess. Is it admissible because the hearsay rule is satisfied?, or is it admissible because the hearsay rule is inapplicable?</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The classic classroom teaser posits a witness who testifies that he spoke by telephone with his brother in London, who said, \u201cIt is raining in London.\u201d To the professor\u2019s query as to whether that brotherly utterance is hearsay, the only intelligent answer is \u201cI don\u2019t have the foggiest.\u201d It depends on the purpose for which the statement is offered. If it is offered to prove that at a given time it was raining in London, it is, of course, hearsay. If it is offered to prove that at a given time the brother was alive and able to speak, it is, with equal certainty, non-hearsay. The first purpose needs the brother to be shown to be trustworthy. The second purpose is indifferent to trustworthiness, and the hearsay rule is only designed to guarantee trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">In <em>Ali v. State, </em>314 Md. 295, 304, 550 A.2d 925 (1988), Judge McAuliffe gave a classic common law definition of hearsay.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">Hearsay is generally defined as a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Thus, when a statement is offered for some purpose other than to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein, it is not hearsay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>See also Burgess v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 522, 537 n. 12, 598 A.2d 830 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The Maryland Rules of Evidence, \u00a7 5-801 (c), promulgated six years after <em>Ali v. State, </em>defined \u201chearsay\u201d in almost verbatim terms.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">\u201cHearsay\u201d is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Federal Rule of Evidence 801(c), from which the Maryland Rule is derived, is absolutely verbatim with the Maryland definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">At the most basic level, under both the common law and the new Federal and Maryland Rules, a hearsay statement consisted routinely of the speaking of a declarative sentence in the indicative mood, which sentence stated the very fact which the proponent of the statement sought to prove by its use. Early on, however, it was recognized that a hearsay statement could be a writing of an assertion as well as a speaking of it. It was also universally recognized, virtually <em>ab origine, </em>that a hearsay statement could consist of a non-verbal action if the action were intended by the actor to be an assertion. The pointing of a finger at Suspect # 4 is just as assertive as are the words, \u201cThe man who robbed me is Suspect # 4.\u201d Just as surely assertive, in response to a question, is a vertical shaking of the head (\u201cYes\u201d), a horizontal shaking of the head (\u201cNo\u201d), or a shrug of the shoulders (\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Reflecting that common law understanding of a hearsay \u201cstatement\u201d is Maryland Rule 5-801(a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>A \u201cstatement\u201d is (1) an oral or written assertion or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by the person as an assertion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Federal Rule of Evidence 801(a), from which the Maryland Rule derives, is absolutely verbatim. To complete the three intertwined definitions that go into the collective definition of \u201chearsay,\u201d both Maryland Rule 5-801 (b) and Federal Rule of Evidence 801(b) define \u201cdeclarant.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">A \u201cdeclarant\u201d is a person who makes a statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">With the earlier, and essentially indistinguishable, common law counterparts of such definitions, the law of evidence had clean-cut paradigms of hearsay and of non-hearsay, and there was a well-marked boundary between them. The hearsay rule, without disruptive aberrations, was \u201cship shape and Bristol fashion.\u201d Then Admiral Tatham elected to challenge his cousin\u2019s will, and, even as we write, we are still being assailed by the consequences of that caveat.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">At the most basic level (pre-1838 and post-1994), little Jasmine\u2019s question to her mother, \u201cIs Erik going to get me?\u201d clearly would not fit the hearsay mold. In <em>Holland v. State, </em>122 Md.App. at 543-44, 713 A.2d 364, we discussed the ordinarily tell-tale grammatical and syntactical characteristics of a hearsay statement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\"><em>To qualify as hearsay, the words recounted </em>in court <em>must, </em>for starters, <em>constitute an assertion or statement of a fact. </em>Many out-of-court utterances are self-evidently not assertions. If a witness testifies to the out-of-court inquiry, \u201cWhat time is it?,\u201d that inquiry is obviously not an assertion of anything. <em>For an out-of-court utterance to qualify as an assertion, it generally must be in the indicative or declarative mood, rather than in the interrogative mood, the imperative mood, or the subjunctive mood. </em>An out-of-court assertion of a fact may be true or untrue. For that reason, its admissibility in evidence is problematic if offered to prove that fact. <em>An out-of-court inquiry, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d can be, by its very nature, neither true nor untrue </em>and there is, therefore, no such credibility problem. <em>The out-of-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>court command, \u201cStop!\u201d can be, by its very nature, neither true nor untrue </em>and there is, therefore, no such credibility problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In <em>Burgess v. State, </em>89 Md.App. at 537-38, 598 A.2d 830, Judge Alpert quoted with approval from D. Binder, <em>Hearsay Handbook </em>18 (3rd ed. 1991):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\"><em>Many out-of-court utterances fall 'within such categories as </em>greetings, pleasantries, expressions of gratitude, courtesies, <em>questions, </em>offers, instructions, warnings, exclamations, <em>expressions of joy, </em>annoyance, or other <em>emotion, </em>etc. <em>Such utterances are not intended expressions of fact </em>or opinion. <em>They are not assertions, </em>at least for purposes of the hearsay rule. <em>Thus they are not hearsay.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">\u201cHello.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">\u201cHow are you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">\u201cHave a nice day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">\u201cWould you like to have lunch?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">\u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t rain tomorrow.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-12\">\u201cI wonder what he paid for that car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">\u201cThank you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-14\">\u201cCan you join me for a drink?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-15\">\u201cDon\u2019t do that, or else.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-16\">\u201cWatch your step.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-17\">\n<em>None of the above utterances is an intended expression of fact or opinion. None is hearsay.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-18\">(Emphasis supplied). And see <em>United States v. Oguns, </em>921 F.2d 442, 448-49 (2d Cir.1990) (an inquiry is not an assertion); <em>United States v. Long, </em>905 F.2d 1572, 1579-80 (D.C.Cir.1990) (questions are non-assertive).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-19\">To say that little Jasmine\u2019s frightened question to her mother does not lit within the classic paradigm of hearsay, however, is not to say that it might not be embraced by the bloated definition of hearsay spawned by <em>Wright v. Tatham. </em>Indeed, the appellant proposes just that. He posits as an implied assertion the following attenuated inference: 1) From <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Jasmine\u2019s question we may infer that Jasmine was afraid of Erik; 2) from Jasmine\u2019s fear of Erik we may infer that Erik had done something to generate that fear; 3) from that likely causation, plus the timing, we may finally infer that Erik had assaulted Calen in the presence of Jasmine. The appellant then concludes that such an implied assertion is inadmissible hearsay. This argument requires us to turn our attention to the rise and fall of the implied assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The Rise and Fall of the Implied Assertion</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">A. The Implied Assertion at Perihelion</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Having revisited briefly the heartland of the hearsay rule, we now venture into what was, for 136 years, its borderland. With the decision in <em>Wright v. Tatum, </em>Pandora\u2019s Box was opened and implied assertions were loosed upon the law of evidence. Virtually any action or any utterance by someone not present in court to testify that had even circumstantial probative value could arguably be excluded as hearsay. Proceeding not from the holding of <em>Wright v. Tatham, </em>involving letters to Marsden which were at least verbal statements of something, but from <em>Wright v. Tatham\u2019s </em>encyclopedic dicta, the notice of an implied assertion soon embraced not only non-assertive verbal utterances but, even more sweepingly, non-assertive non-verbal conduct as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\"><em>Wright v. Tatham\u2019s </em>illustrative hypothetical about a sea captain has become as famous as the decision in <em>Wright v. Tatham </em>itself. On the issue of whether a ship was seaworthy, the hypothetical evidence was that its captain thoroughly inspected the ship and then boarded it for a long sea voyage accompanied by his wife and children. <em>Wright v. Tatham </em>gave this as an example of an implied assertion. It was the initial predicate for a classic two-step inference:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 1) it could be inferred from the captain\u2019s actions that he believed the ship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>to be seaworthy; 2) it could, in turn, be inferred from his belief that the ship was, indeed, seaworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">With that dicta, the notion of implied assertions was loose and running in an open field. Ronald J. Bacigal, \u201cImplied Hearsay: Defusing the Battle Line Between Pragmatism and Realism,\u201d 11 <em>Southern Illinois L.J. </em>1127 (1987), observed, \u201cThe riddle of implied assertions has delighted academicians for 150 years with the subtleties of its intellectual challenges.\u201d Almost every academic discussion of implied assertions now adds to the case of the sea captain the example of the raising of an umbrella as an implied assertion that it is raining. Circumstantial evidence of rain, to be sure, but an implied assertion? Does one who concluded that it was raining from looking out the window and seeing a dozen raised umbrellas need to produce the umbrella holders in court for cross-examination? <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> R. Lempert and S. Saltzburg, <em>A Modem Approach to Evidence </em>367 n. 41 (2d ed.1982), wonders if \u201cthe issue would not have disappeared entirely by now if the problems were not so intriguing to commentators and teachers of evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">B. Academic Disenchantment with the Implied Assertion</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In the Twentieth Century academic criticism of the implied assertion as something necessarily covered by the hearsay rule became widespread. One such criticism was that the very term \u201cimplied assertion\u201d drained the word \u201cassertion\u201d of almost all of its intended content. \u201cAssertion\u201d traditionally connoted a deliberate communicative intention, something that \u201cimplied assertion\u201d totally lacked. Mueller, \u201cPost-Modern Hearsay Reform,\u201d criticizes Baron Parke for having \u201cbroadly applied the term [implied assertion] across the board to any indication that any human behavior provides about acts, events or conditions, treating as hearsay all human conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>offered for the two-step inference.\u201d Professor Mueller goes on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">\u201c[Ijmplied assertion\u201d is a singularly inept and artificial umbrella term. It requires us to understand \u201cimply\u201d in the weak sense of \u201csuggest\u201d or \u201cindicate,\u201d not in the usual strong sense of describing what a person means to convey. It divorces \u201cassertion\u201d from normal usage, making it mean essentially \u201cevidence\u201d and severing it from expressive or communicative purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">If an ordinary letter is an implied assertion that its recipient is competent, then an overcast sky is an implied assertion that rain is in the offing. Absent an intent to express or communicate competence, it is no more illuminating to describe a letter as an implied assertion of this point than it is to describe clouds as implied assertions that it will rain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">76 <em>Minn. L.Rev. </em>at 419 n. 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Another criticism of the expanded definition of hearsay was that the evidentiary reception of a merely implied assertion did not threaten the special dangers, particularly that of testimonial deception, that the hearsay rule was designed to forfend. <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>at 110, measures implied assertions consisting of non-assertive non-verbal conduct against \u201cthe dangers which the hearsay rule is designed to guard against,\u201d and concludes that such implied assertions are nothing more than circumstantial evidence and should not be embraced within a proper definition of hearsay.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">A satisfactory resolution can be had only by making an evaluation in terms of the dangers which the hearsay rule is designed to guard against, i.e., imperfections of perception, memory, and narration. It is believed that <em>such an analysis can result only in rejecting the view that evidence of conduct, from which may be inferred a belief, from which in turn may be inferred the happening of the event which produced the belief, is the equivalent of an assertion that the event happened and hence hearsay. </em>People do not, prior to raising their umbrellas, say to themselves in soliloquy form, \u201cIt is raining,\u201d nor does the motorist go forward on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the green light only after making an inward assertion, \u201cThe light is green.\u201d <em>The conduct offered in the one instance to prove it was raining and in the other that the light was green, involves no intent to communicate the fact sought to be proved, </em>and it was recognized long ago that purposeful deception is less likely in the absence of intent to communicate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Even acknowledging that an opponent might wish, through cross-examination, to probe the actor\u2019s perception and memory, <em>McCormick </em>still concludes that such evidence should not be subjected to the exclusionary sanction of the hearsay rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfI\">Even though the risks arising from purposeful deception may be slight or nonexistent in the absence of intent to communicate, the objection remains that the actor\u2019s perception and memory are untested by cross-examination for the possibility of honest mistake. However, <em>in contrast to the risks from, purposeful deception, those arising from the chance of honest mistake seem, more sensibly to be factors useful, in evaluating weight and credibility rather than grounds for exclusion. </em>Moreover, the kind of situation involved is ordinarily such as either to minimize the likelihood of flaws of perception and memory or to present circumstances lending themselves to their evaluation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Maguire, \u201cAround and Through the Thicket,\u201d p. 773, sadly described evidence as \u201ca field of probative law long befogged by memories of <em>Wright, v. Tatham </em>and by fitful revival of like uncertainties in the minds of perplexed lawyers.\u201d Mueller, \u201cPost-Modern Hearsay Reform,\u201d p. 418, characterized the term \u201cimplied assertion\u201d as an \u201cancient formalism which once described all human behavior (both assertive and non-assertive) when offered for the two-step inference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">C. The Retreat of the Implied Assertion From Hearsay Coverage</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The reaction against the implied assertion as an instance of hearsay finally reached critical mass with the promulgation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the Federal Rules of Evidence in 1973. By defining \u201chearsay\u201d more tightly and precisely than the common law had done, Federal Rule of Evidence 801 effectively barred most, if not all, instances of what had been called \u201cimplied assertions\u201d from the coverage of the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Maryland Rule 5-801, effective in 1994, is based on Federal Rule 801(a), (b), and (c) and is indistinguishable from it. <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>at 97, points out that, as of 1992, the definition of \u201chearsay\u201d in Federal Rule 801 was in effect in about half the states and had, in addition, been quoted with approval or been adopted outright on a case-by-case basis in a number of other states where the Federal Rules had not been adopted in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">As far as the definition of hearsay is concerned, Maryland Rule 5-801 is identical to Federal Rule 801(a), (b), and (c),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and there is no remote suggestion anywhere that Maryland\u2019s interpretation will not follow the interpretation of its federal model. If any passing phraseology in the Maryland caselaw might seem at odds with the federal rule, what is almost certainly revealed is simply an inadvertent lapse of understanding or careless phrasing by the Maryland opinions and not a deliberate policy decision to have Maryland depart from its federal counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">1. Non-Assertive Non-Verbal Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Although the hearsay rule\u2019s pull-back from the implied assertion has been a broad strategic retreat along the entire front, that front is divided into three separate sectors. The retreat in each sector requires a slightly different analysis. Those separate sectors are 1) non-assertive non-verbal conduct, 2) non-assertive verbal utterances, and 3) assertive ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>bal utterances offered as a basis for inferring something other than the thing asserted (the two-step or attenuated inference).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The exclusion from coverage of non-assertive non-verbal conduct is absolute and the easiest of the exclusions to analyze. Federal Rule 801(a) expressly provides that \u201cnonverbal conduct of a person\u201d qualifies as a \u201cstatement\u201d only \u201cif it is intended by the person as an assertion.\u201d The Advisory Committee\u2019s note to Federal Rule 801(a) explains in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atm\">Some nonverbal conduct, such as the act of pointing to identify a suspect in a lineup, is clearly the equivalent of words, assertive in nature, and to be regarded as a statement. <em>Other nonverbal conduct, </em>however, <em>may be offered as evidence that the person acted as he did because of his belief in the existence of the condition sought to be proved, from which belief the existence of the condition may be inferred. </em>The sequence is, arguably, in effect an assertion of the existence of the condition and hence properly includable within the hearsay concept. Admittedly evidence of this character is untested with respect to the perception, memory, and narration (or their equivalents) of the actor, but <em>the Advisory Committee is of the view that these dangers are minimal in the absence of an intent to assert and do not justify the loss of the evidence on hearsay grounds. </em>No class of evidence is free of the possibility of fabrication, but the likelihood is less with nonverbal than with assertive verbal conduct. The situations giving rise to the nonverbal conduct are such as virtually to eliminate questions of sincerity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">4 Stephen Saltzburg, Michael Martin, and Daniel Capra, <em>Federal Rules of Evidence Manual </em>(8th ed.), 801-14, unequivocally declares that the result of <em>Wright v. Tatham\u2019s </em>hypothetical case of the sea captain would be different under Federal Rule 801 (and Maryland Rule 5-801).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\"><em>The remit of the ship captain hypothetical changes under Rule 801. Conduct is not hearsay merely because it is offered to prove the truth of the belief that generated the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>conduct. </em>Rather, under Rule 801, <em>conduct can only be hearsay if the declarant intended by the conduct to communicate information. </em>The Trial Judge has to determine whether conduct was intended to assert something or not. The Advisory Committee\u2019s Note states that <em>\u201c[t]he rule is so worded as to place the burden upon the party claiming that the intention existedambiguous and doubtful cases will be resolved against him and in favor of admissibility.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Paul S. Milich, <em>Re-Examining Hearsay Under the Federal Rules: Some Method for the Madness, </em>39 <em>Kansas L.Rev. </em>893, 903, pronounces a similar obituary for the umbrella-opening example, as well as an obituary for the <em>Wright v. Tatham </em>approach generally.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\"><em>The text of Rule 801 itself does not support a Wright v. Tatham approach. Subsection (a)(2) rejects this approach in cases of nonverbal conduct. </em>For example, to prove that it was raining at the time, witnesses testify that they saw Mary opening her umbrella as she was walking out the door. <em>Under the Wright v. Tatham approach, this evidence is hearsay because Mary\u2019s conduct implies that she believed it was raining and her belief implies that it was, in fact, raining. But the language of Ride 801(a)(2) points to a result at odds with the Wright v. Tatham approach: </em>\u201cNonverbal conduct of a person\u201d qualifies as a potential hearsay statement only \u201cif it is intended by the person as an assertion.\u201d <em>Opening an umbrella normally is not intended to be an assertion about anything, </em>and, thus, <em>such nonverbal conduct does not fall within the federal definition of hearsay.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Rules of Evidence </em>(2d ed.2002), p. 183, was equally emphatic about the foreclosing effect of Maryland Rule 5-801 specifically. Non-assertive non-verbal conduct is not hearsay even if it can be characterized as an implied assertion. An observation about vocabulary is here in order. It is not that such conduct has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>exempted from the category of \u201cimplied assertion.\u201d It is rather that such implied assertions, notwithstanding their venerable label, have been exempted from the category of \u201chearsay.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">Rule 5-801 is consistent with the pre-Title 5 Maryland law, with one clear exception. Under the Rule, <em>a person\u2019s nonverbal, nonassertive conduct </em>(not obviously engaged in as a means to communicate particular, identifiable words) <em>can never be hearsay, even if it is offered as an implied assertion </em>by the out-of-court actor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">For example, suppose that a ship has been lost at sea. If evidence that the ship\u2019s captain inspected the ship, then boarded it with his family, and sailed away, is offered to prove that the ship was seaworthy at the time of sailing, it is offered as an implied assertion on the part of the captain of his apparent belief that \u201cthe ship is seaworthy.\u201d <em>This type of evidence was considered to be hearsay, </em>in dictum <em>in the famous English case, Wright v. Doe dem. Tatham, </em>7 Ad. &amp; E. 313, 112 Eng. Rep. 488 (1837), 5 Cl. &amp; F. 136 (H.L. 1838), because its probative value to show the ship\u2019s seaworthiness depended on the ship\u2019s captain\u2019s having had a particular belief (that the ship was seaworthy\u2014not, for example, that he knew it was not seaworthy, but decided to take his chances, so as to escape a greater danger on his heels) and on his having been accurate as to the fact he apparently believed. <em>Wright </em>was followed by the Maryland Court of Appeals in <em>Waters v. Waters, </em>35 Md. 531, (1872), although <em>Waters </em>involved, as did the facts of <em>Wright, </em>an implied assertion from personal letters (verbal, not nonverbal, conduct).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">\n<em>Under Rule 5-801, the Wright dictum can no longer be followed in Maryland courts, when the actor was engaging in nonverbal, nonassertive conduct.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Professor McLain further notes, at p. 187:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\"><em>By virtue of Rule 5-801 (a) (2), nonverbal, nonassertive conduct </em>(conduct that was neither in words nor obviously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>intended as a substitute for identifiable words, to convey a particular message) <em>can never be hearsay, because it is not a \u201cstatement.\u201d The Rule clearly rejects the reasoning of Wright v. Doe dem. Tatham, </em>7 Ad. &amp; E. 313, 112 Eng. Rep. 488 (1837), 5 Cl. &amp; F. 136 (H.L. 1838), to the extent that <em>Wright </em>stands for the proposition that even nonverbal, nonassertive conduct will be hearsay, if it is offered as an implied assertion, i.e., as evidence manifesting the out-of-court actor\u2019s belief, offered to prove the truth of the matter that the out-of-court actor apparently believed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">With respect to non-assertive non-verbal conduct, the rules, Maryland and federal, have spoken. Even if arbitrary (which we are not suggesting), and even if to the chagrin of some academic commentators, that\u2019s it! The debate is over. There is but to salute and advance on Balaklava Heights.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">2. Non-Assertive Verbal Utterances</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">In that sector of the implied assertion front once garrisoned by non-assertive verbal utterances, there has also been a complete pull-back of hearsay coverage. In this sector, however, a slight fog over the terrain makes the perception of the pull-back a little less clear-cut than in the case of non-assertive non-verbal conduct. To clear away the fog, we must first identify what is non-assertive.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The Committee Note to Maryland Rule 5-801, for instance, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">This Rule does not attempt to define \u201cassertion,\u201d a concept best left to development in the case law. The fact that proffered evidence is in the form of a question or something other than a narrative statement, however, does not <em>necessarily </em>preclude its being an assertion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">As the Committee Note points out, the fact that an utterance is in the form of a question \u201cdoes not <em>necessarily </em>preclude its being an assertion.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). Opportunistically, attorneys seize upon that last sentence as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>fog-generating device. In the overwhelming majority of cases, of course, a question will not be an assertion. There are, however, rare exceptions, and those exceptions may be better illustrated than they may be defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Professor McLain, at 183, offers the illustration that the question, \u201cDid you know Scott stole my car?\u201d is clearly an assertion that Scott stole the car. The \u201cDid you know\u2019s\u201d generally are a fruitful source of assertive questions, as are questions beginning with \u201cWhy.\u201d The sarcastic question can also be a bountiful source. Bacigal, \u201cImplied Hearsay,\u201d at 1139, offers the illustration of the declarant who, when asked, \u201cIs that pure heroin?\u201d sarcastically responds, \u201cDo cops wear blue?\u201d That clearly asserts that the substance being discussed is pure heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In <em>Carlton v. State, </em>111 Md.App. 436, 443, 681 A.2d 1181 (1996), Judge Salmon offered two additional examples of questions that could qualify as assertive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">Many questions asked by an out-of-court declarant can be implied assertions. For example, the question, \u201cDo you need change?\u201d impliedly asserts that the questioner has change. <em>State v. Saunders, </em>23 Ohio App.3d 69, 491 N.E.2d 313 (1984). The question, \u201cWhy did you stab me, Brutus?\u201d impliedly asserts that the questioner was stabbed by Brutus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">A question that necessarily assumes a condition will almost always be an assertion of that condition. \u201cDo you think it will stop raining within the hour?\u201d necessarily asserts that it is raining now. The presence of the word \u201cstop\u201d in a question, or in a command for that matter, is a tell-tale clue of an assertion. It signals the difference between a non-declarative utterance that demands an inference and one that merely suggests an inference. Such assertive questions are, however, rare and they are not hard to identify. The Committee Note does not open the floodgates to questions generally and must not be overread. Ordinarily, a question, as a simple request for information, will not be an assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>For an utterance to be assertive (and, therefore, to qualify as hearsay), the declarant must intend to assert something. The Advisory Committee Note to Federal Rule 801(a) could not be more clear.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">The effect of the definition of \u201cstatement\u201d is to exclude from the operation of the hearsay rule all evidence of conduct, verbal or nonverbal, not intended as an assertion. <em>The key to the definition is that nothing is an assertion unless intended to be one.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">(Emphasis supplied). The Advisory Committee Note was also very clear about the allocation of the burden to prove the intent to assert and about the resolution of \u201cambiguous and doubtful cases.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">The rule is so worded as to place the burden upon the party claiming that the intention existed; <em>ambiguous and doubtful cases will be resolved </em>against him and <em>in favor of admissibility.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\"><em>Carlton v. State, </em>111 Md.App. 436, 681 A.2d 1181 (1996), is a perfect case in point. Carlton was convicted of first-degree felony murder and armed robbery. Introduced into evidence against him was the testimony of a Ms. Shipley, who stated that an out-of-court declarant, Carlton\u2019s confederate, Ussel, asked her certain questions about 1) the alarm system at the store where the robbery later took place and 2) the time that the store owner normally left for the night. Carlton\u2019s objection was on hearsay grounds.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">Appellant does not contend that the questions asked by Ussel lacked relevance; instead <em>he argues that allowing the jury to hear the questions violated the rule against hearsay.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL\">111 Md.App. at 442, 681 A.2d 1181 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Judge Salmon held for this Court that those questions were not assertive and, therefore, were not hearsay.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\"><em>[MJany, if not most, questions make no assertion; the questioner simply seeks answers. Burgess v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 522, 537-38, 598 A.2d 830 (1991). <em>The questions Ussel asked Ms. Shipley </em>fall into this latter category. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>When Ussel asked, \u201cDoes Mr. Zinkhan have an alarm?\u201d or \u201cWhat time, if ever, will Mr. Zinkhan leave?\u201d he <em>made no explicit or implied assertion. </em>Ussel\u2019s questions could not possibly have been \u201coffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Therefore, <em>the hearsay rule was not violated when Ms. Shipley was allowed to repeat the questions Ussel asked her.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">111 Md.App. at 443, 681 A.2d 1181 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">David E.

Zenni, </em>492 F.Supp. 464 (E.D.Ky.1980), has become a classic illustration. While searching a premises for physical evidence of bookmaking, the police fielded several incoming telephone calls that directed the recipient of the call to place various bets on various sporting events. The prosecution introduced the contents of the calls 1) to prove that the callers believed the premises to be a bookmaking parlor and 2) to prove, in turn, that the premises were a bookmaking parlor.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">The defendant objected on the ground that the contents of the calls were implied assertions under <em>Wright v.

Assertive Utterances Offered to Prove Something Other Than the Thing Asserted</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">The pull-back from hearsay coverage in the case of 1) non-assertive non-verbal conduct and 2) non-assertive verbal utterances has been a complete one. It is in the third sector, that occupied by assertive utterances wherefrom the thing asserted is to be inferred rather than having been stated directly, that the extent of the pull-back is more problematic. This is the one sector wherein the term \u201cimplied assertion\u201d is not a misnomer.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>It is in this area that some implied assertions are still covered by the hearsay rule, although other implied assertions, even those produced by assertive utterances, are no longer covered. A distinction separating some implied assertions from others has been introduced by the new rules. It is an oversimplification, therefore, when commentators and opinion writers state that implied assertions are no longer covered by the hearsay rule. That is true, but it is only half true. Most of what were once called \u201cimplied assertions,\u201d to be sure, are no longer covered. A few, however, remain covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">An assertive utterance need not state directly the thing that the declarant intends to assert. It may imply it. It may be in the form of a question, a command, a bit of sarcasm, a statement of something else. The implied assertion may be just as assertive as is a direct assertion. Only the communicative style or rhetorical flourish is different. The thing directly inferred from the words spoken, the thing the declarant intended to communicate, is, by definition, the implied assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Now comes the modern distinction: If the proposition, for which the utterance is offered as proof, is the same as the immediate or direct inference itself, to wit, a first generation implied assertion, the utterance is covered, as it always was, by the hearsay rule. The implied assertion that 1) is itself the probative end product and 2) results from a simple one-step inferential process is covered by the hearsay rule. The limitation on hearsay coverage introduced by the new rules, a limitation that was not part of the doxology according to <em>Wright v. Tatham, </em>is on the application of the hearsay rule to the more attenuated or multi-step inferential process. If the first generation inference is not the thing ultimately to be proved but is only the predicate for yet another inference one step further removed, the hearsay ban no longer stretches that far.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Graham, \u201c \u2018Stickperson Hearsay,\u2019 \u201d 906, refers to utterances intended to trigger the more attenuated inferential process as \u201cstatements offered not for the truth of the matter asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>but rather as circumstantial evidence of a fact of consequence.\u201d He observes that the Note of the Advisory Committee to Federal Rule 801 equated the attenuated inference with non-assertive non-verbal conduct in terms of the sincerity risk which is the major concern of the hearsay rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\"><em>If a statement, although assertive in form, is offered as a basis for inferring something other than the truth of the matter directly asserted, </em>the Advisory Committee\u2019s note to rule 801(a) indicates that <em>the statement is \u201cexcluded from the definition of hearsay </em>by the language of subdivision (c).\u201d The Advisory Committee\u2019s claim rests on the assumption that such statements present a reduced sincerity risk similar to that associated with nonverbal conduct which is not intended as an assertion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The Advisory Committee Note itself, after considering at great length why non-assertive non-verbal conduct is no longer covered by the hearsay rule, adds that precisely the same considerations compel non-coverage in the case of assertive verbal utterances \u201coffered as a basis for inferring something other than the matter asserted.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\"><em>Similar considerations govern </em>nonassertive verbal conduct and <em>verbal conduct which is assertive but offered, as a basis for inferring something other than the matter asserted, also excluded from the definition of hearsay by the language of subdivision (c).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\"><em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>at 98, is equally emphatic that an utterance merely serving as a predicate for an attenuated or second generation inference is not covered.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">The rule\u2019s definition must be taken as meaning that <em>out-of-court conduct </em>that is not an assertion, or <em>that, even though assertive, is not offered to prove the truth of the mutter asserted, is not hearsay.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">McLain, <em>Maryland Rules of Evidence, </em>at 193, offers several examples of utterances that would have been inadmissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>implied assertions under <em>Wright v. Tatham </em>but would, in all likelihood, not be considered hearsay today. They would all be, even if implied assertions, assertions offered as a basis for inferring something other than the truth of the matter directly, albeit implicitly, asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Evidence Offered to Prove</p>\n<p id=\"AGP\">(2) Police officer testifies that when she answered the telephone in defendant\u2019s apartment, a man on the other end said, \u201cHave you still got the stuff?\u201d Defendant was a drug dealer (caller believed that fact; evidence offered to prove accuracy of fact caller apparently believed).</p>\n<p id=\"AGh\">(3) Police officer testifies that, when she answered the telephone in defendant\u2019s apartment, a man on the other end said, \u201c$10 on the nose on # 5 in the 1st at Pimlico.\u201d Defendant was a bookie.</p>\n<p id=\"AMn\">(4) Burglary victim identifies that, after she was blindfolded, she heard Bruce\u2019s co-defendant say, \u201cBruce, get in here.\u201d Bruce was one of the burglars.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Murphy, <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook, </em>at 231-32, goes so far as to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\"><em>An \u201cimplied assertion\u201d is not hearsay, </em>under either FRE 801 or the definition of a hearsay \u201cstatement\u201d used by Judge McAuliffe in <em>Ali v.

With respect to any lingering vitality in <em>Wright v. Tatham, </em>Federal Rule of Evidence 801 and Maryland Rule 5-801 effectively drove a stake to the heart. The <em>coup-de-grace </em>comes as a great loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>to no one except true aficionados of the history of the law of evidence. <em>Wright v. Tatham </em>was great fun while it lasted, and it lasted a long time. R.I.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u201cIs Erik Going to Get Me?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">An eighteen-month-old child\u2019s fearful question to her mother, \u201cIs Erik going to get me?,\u201d is clearly not hearsay under Maryland Rule 5-801 and Federal Rule of Evidence 801. It might once have been deemed an implied assertion under <em>Wright v. Tatham. </em>It does not qualify as hearsay today.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Applying the analytic tools developed to measure conduct and utterances against the new rules, it is, as hearsay, twice bereft. A little girl\u2019s fearful question to her mother was not intended by her to be a communicative assertion of any fact. It was, pure and simple, a frightened request for information. \u201cAm I safe?\u201d It was not assertive. For that reason alone, it was not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Even if the utterance could, <em>arguendo, </em>be deemed to be assertive, it still, moreover, was not offered as direct evidence of the ultimate issue. The arguably implicit assertion was not, \u201cI saw Erik attack Calen.\u201d It was, at most, \u201cI am afraid of Erik.\u201d That is not the proposition ultimately to be proved. The possibly implicit fear of Erik was only a circumstantial predicate for a more attenuated inference one or two steps farther down the inferential line. For this second reason alone, the utterance in question was not inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The case of <em>In re Penelope B., </em>104 Wash.2d 643, 709 P.2d 1185 (1985), has much in common with the case before us. The new Washington rule of evidence defining hearsay was identical with Federal Rule 801(a), (b), and (c) and with Maryland Rule 5-801. At issue in that case were observations of social workers reporting the actions and the utterances of a six-year-old sexual abuse victim. In rejecting a defense claim of hearsay, the Washington Supreme Court first stated the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number><em>The admissibility of nonassertive verbal or nonverbal conduct ais circumstantial evidence of a fact in issue is governed by principles of relevance, not by hearsay principles. </em>An assertion that is circumstantial evidence proves a fact indirectly, by implication; credibility of the declarant is not important because the relevance of the assertion does not depend on its truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">709 P.2d at 1191 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">It then applied that law to the out-of-court utterances in issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">In the case before us, <em>the child\u2019s utterances </em>showing precocious knowledge of explicit sexual matters and certain private names for male and female genitalia, as testified to by witnesses, <em>are examples of nonassertive utterances which are not hearsay and are admissible.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">709 P.2d at 1192 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">In <em>State v. Stevens, </em>58 Wash.App. 478, 794 P.2d 38 (1990), the defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree statutory rape. The respective foster mothers of the six-year-old and three-year-old victims testified that both girls had nightmares in which they would cry out such statements as, \u201cArne, stop. Arne, don\u2019t.\u201d In affirming the convictions, the Washington Court of Appeals held that \u201cthe trial judge was correct in analyzing the testimony as nonhearsay.\u201d 794 P.2d at 44. Although the nightmare utterances unquestionably gave rise to the inference that \u201cArnie did it,\u201d the Court of Appeals ruled that the utterances, because they were non-assertive, were not hearsay.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">The utterances made by C and D during their sleep are not conscious, intentional assertions of fact or opinion. <em>The nightmare statements are </em>involuntary verbal reactions, and, as such, are <em>nonassertive utterances and not hearsay. </em>Rather, <em>the utterances are circumstantial evidence that proves a fact indirectly </em>that both children had nightmares involving Stevens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">794 P.2d at 44 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">In <em>Church v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 208, 335 S.E.2d 823 (1985), the defendant was convicted of the rape of a seven-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>year-old girl. The girl\u2019s mother testified that, several weeks after the rape, she noticed changes in her daughter\u2019s behavior, including bed-wetting, nightmares, complaint of a vaginal itch, and fear of being left alone with her father or her brother. The mother then said that the child \u201chad an obsession with my husband\u2019s and my sex life. She would ask questions and when I\u2019d give her an answer, she\u2019d cry. She\u2019d tell me she didn\u2019t want me\u2014us to do that because it was dirty, nasty and it hurt.\u201d 335 S.E.2d at 825. The defendant objected on hearsay grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">In affirming the conviction, the Supreme Court of Virginia held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">The Commonwealth did not offer the child\u2019s statement to prove that sex is \u201cdirty, nasty and it hurt.\u201d Rather, it was offered to show the child\u2019s attitude toward sex, an attitude likely to have been created by a traumatic experience. Although the child made no prompt report of the crime, the Commonwealth was entitled to prove, by circumstantial evidence, that she had been a victim. Thus, <em>the child\u2019s out-of-court statement was not hearsay, but was admissible as circumstantial evidence tending to establish the probability of a fact in issue.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">335 S.E.2d at 825-26 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Judge Brown was correct in rejecting the hearsay challenge to Jennifer Pritchett\u2019s testimony concerning her daughter\u2019s question, \u201cIs Erik going to get me?.\u201d We agree that it was not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">A Subjunctive Appeal Of a Hypothetical Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The case on appeal must bear a reasonable resemblance to the case that was tried, and not to some other case that, in hindsight, might have been tried but was not. By way of a Parthian dart, the appellant alleges that the introduction into evidence of little Jasmine\u2019s question to her mother, quite aside from any hearsay considerations, violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers. Did he really want to cross-examine an eighteen-month-old? Would the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>threat of perjury have enhanced the infant\u2019s trustworthiness? At trial, however, the appellant made no mention of the confrontation clause. Indeed, the appellant\u2019s brief to this Court made no mention of the confrontation clause. It appears that the appellate strategy was significantly overhauled after the initial brief was filed, and the entire confrontation issue is but an afterthought in the reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The reply brief, to be sure, strives heroically to breathe life into the corpse. It points out that defense counsel, in challenging Jasmine\u2019s question to her mother, discredited the utterance\u2019s \u201creliability.\u201d It then points out that the confrontation clause case of <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990), spends a lot of time discussing \u201creliability.\u201d The very same word! Voila! The raising of a major constitutional issue, however, requires something more palpable than \u201ca haze on the far horizon.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The reply brief, in a last gasp, asks us to consider gratuitously the confrontation issue by way of noticing plain error. We have serious reservations about our authority to do so, notwithstanding the promiscuous overuse of that notion in recent years. It is unnecessary to decide the authority question, however, since we have no wish to take notice in any event. A consideration of the confrontation issue might well entail an analysis as lengthy as that which the hearsay rule has already engendered. Sir Walter Raleigh and Justice Scalia<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> will have to be saved for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Fatal Variance Between What Was Argued Then And What Is Being Argued Now</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Appellate advocates, like prom queens, should learn to heed the ancient wisdom, \u201cYou dance with the guy that brung ya.\u201d .The appellant, unheeding, is attempting to change doctrinal partners in the middle of the cotillion.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In his second contention, the appellant argues that Judge Brown, on three separate occasions, allowed witnesses to testify to the appellant\u2019s \u201creputation for violence as well as to numerous examples of prior acts of violence,\u201d in contravention of Maryland Rule 5-404(b) and the attendant procedures required by such cases as <em>Streater v. State, </em>352 Md. 800, 724 A.2d 111 (1999), and <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 552 A.2d 896 (1989). As with Ulysses shielding himself from the sirens, however, our ears are closed to this argument. With tunnel vision, we are focusing exclusively on the trial as it actually was and not on the trial as the appellant would now like it to have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The express nature of this contention is made indisputably clear by the very titling of the contention in the appellant\u2019s brief to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING EVIDENCE OF APPELLANT\u2019S CHARACTER AND REPUTATION FOR VIOLENCE AS WELL AS NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF PRIOR ACTS OF VIOLENCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The appellant is counterattacking where there has been no attack to counter. He argues this issue as if the State had attempted to introduce his character for violence into the trial as substantive evidence of his probable guilt. He plants his feet firmly in Rule 5-404(b) and unlimbers the elaborate body of caselaw circumscribing the State\u2019s use of a defendant\u2019s character. He sets out the three-stage inquiry mandated by such cases as <em>Streater </em>and <em>Faulkner </em>before a defendant\u2019s character may be used as substantive evidence of guilt. He points out how the State would have faltered at each of those stages, by failing 1) to establish any special relevance or purpose for the character evidence such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, common scheme, etc.; 2) to satisfy the trial judge by clear and convincing evidence that the prior bad acts actually occurred; and 3) to convince the court that the probative value of the character evidence outweighed its likely prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>All of that, however, concerns a phantom trial that never happened. The State never offered the appellant\u2019s character as substantive evidence of his guilt. Maryland Rule 5-404 was never mentioned and was not remotely an issue. Neither <em>Streater </em>nor <em>Faulkner </em>nor any of the \u201cother crimes\u201d or \u201cprior bad acts\u201d cases were so much as alluded to.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Evidence that three State\u2019s witnesses were afraid of the appellant and of why they were afraid of him came in pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-616, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">(c) <em>Rehabilitation.

On cross-examination, his credibility was impeached by a showing that he had earlier \u201clied to the police\u201d by telling them that he did not even know the appellant. By way of rehabilitation on redirect examination, he explained his earlier lack of candor to the police.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-12\">Q.

He has a history of being violent towards people.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">On this occasion, to be sure, the State jumped the gun by way of anticipating rehabilitation. At trial, however, the timing of the rehabilitation was not raised as an issue. Indeed, in the appellant\u2019s primary brief, that procedural stumble is not even mentioned. The brief argued all three instances together and only in the context of Rule 5-404(c), not in the context of Rule 5-616(c). Particularly in view of the wide discretion given to trial judges in making evidentiary rulings, we would hold that, even if the anticipatory timing of the rehabilitation were error, such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Cheryl Dieter, Calen\u2019s mother and the appellant\u2019s live-in girlfriend, gave a detailed written statement to the police, significantly inculpating the appellant. At trial, however, she almost totally recanted. In examining her, as an essentially hostile witness at that point, the State had Cheryl read some of her answers from her earlier statement to the police, in which she acknowledged that the appellant had threatened to hurt anyone who testified against him. She acknowledged her fear of the appellant because of earlier beatings. It was necessary for the State to show why a key witness was recanting on the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">It is unnecessary to go into an elaborate analysis about the latitude allowed to the State because the contention now argued by the appellant on appeal has essentially nothing to do with Rule 5-616 (which is not even mentioned by the appellant), with rehabilitation by way of explaining prior inconsistent statements, with impeachment by prior inconsistent statements, or by showing a reason for a witness\u2019s recantation on the stand. None of these purposes, which were the basis for the trial rulings, have anything to do with the use of the appellant\u2019s character for violence as evidence of guilt. None of the trial-related arguments or rulings had anything to do with Rule 5-404, which is essentially the only thing being argued before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>We are not going to discuss further the rulings that were actually made, because they are not the subject of what is basically being argued before us. We are not going to discuss what is being argued before us, moreover, because that argument involves 1) evidentiary purposes that were never proposed, 2) evidentiary objections that were never raised on the grounds now suggested, and 3) evidentiary rulings on objections that were never made.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-14\">.
