For the reasons that follow, we hold that William C. Bond (Mr. Bond), appellant, is entitled to a hearing on the issue of whether the circuit court should enter a protective order that would prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of financial records produced in a domestic relations case, and we remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. In No. 1042, we hold that the award of counsel fees to William H. Slavin (Mr. Slavin) and Bank of America (the Bank), appellees, must be vacated as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Appellant is currently married to Alyson Bond (Mrs. Bond), who was formerly married to Mr. Slavin. Mrs. Bond and Mr. Slavin have two minor children from their previous marriage and have been involved in support, custody, and other litigation for several years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The case at bar stems from Mr. Slavin\u2019s petition for change of custody and child support. A hearing on that petition was scheduled to be held on February 18, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">On January 24, 2003, Mr. Slavin\u2019s attorneys issued a subpoena duces tecum to the Bank, requiring that a custodian of records or a corporate designee appear at the February 18th hearing and produce certain of Mrs. Bond\u2019s financial records\u2014including Mr. and Mrs. Bond\u2019s joint accounts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A copy of the subpoena was mailed to Mrs. Bond\u2019s counsel. On or about January 27, 2003, Mr. Slavin\u2019s attorneys filed a Certificate of Service certifying that the lawyer for the account holder had been notified that the subpoena had been issued.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Mr. Slavin\u2019s counsel notified a representative of the Bank that no Bank employee would have to appear at the hearing if the records were forwarded directly to her. On February 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>2003, before it received any objection to disclosure of the records, the Bank delivered the subpoenaed records directly to Mr. Slavin\u2019s counsel. A snowstorm caused a postponement of the February 18, 2003 hearing, which was rescheduled to June 23, 2003.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant objected to the disclosure of any joint account records.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>On March 11, 2003, appellant filed Motions For a Protective Order and a Restraining Order,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requesting that (1) Mr. Slavin\u2019s counsel be ordered to place in the custody of the court all original copies and other copies of appellant\u2019s records obtained from the Bank, and make no direct or indirect use of those records or the information contained therein for any purpose unrelated to the litigation;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (2) the Bank be ordered to cease any further production of appellant\u2019s banking records.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellees responded by arguing that appellant\u2019s motions were incorrectly filed, frivolous, and without merit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, Mr. Slavin requested an award of counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">On April 2, 2003, after mistakenly entering an order granting appellant\u2019s motions and thereafter \u201cstriking\u201d that order, the circuit court entered orders that (1) denied appellant\u2019s motions and (2) provided that counsel for Mr. Slavin \u201cmay submit a petition for expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Md. Rule 1-341.\u201d The April 2, 2003 orders were docketed in the domestic violence case on April 7, 2003. On April 17, 2003, appellant filed a Notice of Appeal,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>pay the required filing fee until June 16, 2003.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The circuit court clerk did not docket the notice until June 11, 2003.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">On May 5, 2003, Mr. Slavin filed a Petition for Expenses. On June 12, 2003, the circuit court entered an order requiring appellant\u2019s lawyers to pay $6,024.94 in attorney\u2019s fees to Mr. Slavin\u2019s counsel. On June 19, 2003, appellant filed a Motion to Alter or Amend the sanction award and a request for a hearing on that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Appellant also filed Motions for Protective Order and for Restraining Order (renamed Motion for Injunctive Relief) in the child custody case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On June 23, 2003, the circuit court denied those motions, declaring them moot, and instructed appellees to submit additional petitions for attorney\u2019s fees. Through an order entered June 26, 2003, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s Motion to Alter or Amend the June 12, 2003 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">On July 29, 2003, the circuit court entered an order that (1) memorialized its June 23rd rulings, and (2) awarded additional attorney\u2019s fees to Mr. Slavin, in the amount of $1,714.04, and to the Bank, in the amount of $956.25. On July 30, 2003, appellant filed a third Notice of Appeal,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> this one in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the child custody case. Appellant\u2019s first Notice of Appeal has resulted in the case at bar, No. 203, September Term 2003. His third Notice of Appeal has resulted in Case No. 1042, September Term, 2003, in which we address issues involving orders entered subsequent to the date on which appellant filed his first appeal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\n<em>Appellee\u2019s Motions to Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Auv\">I. The Filing Fee Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The Orders at issue were signed on April 2, 2003 and entered on April 7, 2003. Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal was received by the Clerk of the Circuit Court on April 17, 2003, and was date-stamped at 12:29 p.m. Although the Notice was filed that day,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Clerk did not docket the Notice until June 11, 2003. According to appellees, because appellant did not pay the filing fee until June 16, 2003, Md. Rule 8-201 requires that his appeal be dismissed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We reject the argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>an appeal is not <em>actually filed </em>until the filing fee is paid.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">According to Md.Code, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 2-201(b) (2003), the clerk has no duty \u201cto record any paper <em>filed </em>with him [or her]\u201d until costs are paid.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We are persuaded that to \u201crecord\u201d means to \u201cdocket,\u201d rather than to \u201cfile.\u201d If an appellant fails to pay the filing fee, the clerk is not required to <em>docket </em>the Notice, but the clerk is required to <em>file </em>it.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201cThe only authority that a clerk has to refuse to accept and file a paper presented for filing is that contained in Md. Rule 1-323.\u201d <em>Director of Fin. v. Harris, </em>90 Md.App. 506, 511, 602 A.2d 191 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u201cThe date that a pleading or paper is \u2018filed\u2019 is the date that the clerk receives it....\u201d Paul V. Niemeyer &amp; Linda M. Schuett, Maryland Rules Commentary 47 (3d.ed.2003). \u201cA pleading or paper is filed by <em>actual delivery </em>to the clerk.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Rule 8-201 does not provide that failure to pay the filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>fee prohibits a Notice of Appeal from being \u201cfiled.\u201d We therefore hold that, except for notices of appeal that fail to comply with the certificate of service requirement of Md. Rule 1-323,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the notice of appeal is filed on the date that the clerk receives the notice, not the date on which the clerk receives the filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In the case at bar, (1) the circuit court did not strike the Notice, and (2) appellees did not move to have it stricken. Those actions are permitted under Rule 8\u2014203(a)(3). Furthermore, the clerk actually filed the Notice <em>before </em>receiving the fee. There is no evidence whatsoever that (1) appellees were prejudiced by the late payment of the fee, or that (2) the course of the appeal was delayed in any way.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> While we recognize that it is generally within our power to dismiss an appeal if the appeal was not properly taken pursuant to Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>8-201,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> it is the practice of this Court to decide appeals on the merits rather than on technicalities. We hold that appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal satisfied the requirements of Rule 8-201, and therefore deny appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground of appellant\u2019s tardy payment of the filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">II. Jurisdiction and Mootness Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Mr. Slavin argues that this Court does not have jurisdiction over the circuit court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order. We disagree. Under C.J. \u00a7 12\u2014303(3)(iii), a party may appeal from an order refusing to grant an injunction. Maryland Rule 15-501(c) defines a \u201ctemporary restraining order\u201d as an <em>\u201cinjunction </em>granted without opportunity for a full adversary hearing on the propriety of its issuance.\u201d (emphasis added). The circuit court\u2019s refusal to grant appellant\u2019s temporary restraining order is an appealable order, and this Court has jurisdiction to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The Bank argues that the issues presented in this case are moot because (1) the Bank has already disclosed appellant\u2019s financial records to Mr. Slavin\u2019s counsel, and (2) it is too late to provide a remedy. In <em>Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. v. CBS, Inc., </em>184 F.Supp.2d 1353 (N.D.Ga.2002), the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia held that the failure to file two depositions under seal did not render moot a subsequently filed motion to seal the depositions, even though (1) the unsealed depositions had been placed in the court\u2019s public file, and (2) the file had been transferred to a federal public storage facility. <em>Id. </em>at 1365-67. We agree with that analysis, and shall apply it in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\"> Appellees also argue that, because Mr. Slavin and Mrs. Bond have settled the custody and child support issues that prompted the request for financial records, this case has become moot.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Appellate courts generally do not decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>academic or moot questions. There are, however, \u201c \u2018rare instances,\u2019 \u201d in which \u201c \u2018the urgency of establishing a rule of future conduct in matters of important public concern is imperative and manifest [and requires] a departure from the general rule and practice of not deciding academic questions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mercy Hosp. v. Jackson, </em>306 Md. 556, 562-63, 510 A.2d 562 (1986) (quoting <em>Lloyd v. Supervisors of Elections, </em>206 Md. 36, 43, 111 A.2d 379 (1954)); <em>see also Ins. Comm\u2019r of the State of Maryland, et al. v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y of the United States, </em>339 Md. 596, 614, 664 A.2d 862 (1995). The circumstances under which and procedures by which confidential financial information can be protected from unauthorized disclosure are \u201cissues ... of important public concern.\u201d So is the issue of whether a bank (or any recipient of a subpoena that calls for the production of financial records) can provide financial records to the requesting party prior to the date and time specified on the subpoena.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The Necessity for a Remand</p>\n<p id=\"A1a\">I. Appellant\u2019s Right to a Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Appellant argues that the orders of April 2, 2003 should be vacated and this case remanded because the circuit court was required to hold a hearing on the motions. This argument is based upon Rule 2-311(f), which, in pertinent part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">Hearing\u2014Other motions. A party desiring a hearing on a motion, other than a motion filed pursuant to Rule 2-532, 2-533, or 2-534, shall request the hearing in the motion or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>response under the heading \u201cRequest for Hearing.\u201d Except when a rule expressly provides for a hearing, the court shall determine in each case whether a hearing will be held, but <em>the court may not render a decision that is dispositive of a claim or defense without a, hearing if one was requested as provided in this section.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">(Emphasis added). Appellees argue that a hearing is not required unless the court\u2019s ruling would be \u201cdispositive of a claim or defense.\u201d Md. Rule 2-311(f). In the case at bar, however, the denial of appellant\u2019s motions was \u201cdispositive\u201d of his request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Appellees also argue that, because it was Mr. Slavin who requested the hearing, the circuit court was not required to hold a hearing before denying the relief sought by appellant. There is no merit in that argument. In <em>Adams v. Offender Aid &amp; Restoration of Baltimore, Inc., </em>114 Md.App. 512, 515-16, 691 A.2d 248 (1997), this Court held that if any party requests a hearing, no other request is necessary to obtain a hearing. Because (1) the order denying appellant\u2019s motions was dispositive of appellant\u2019s claim, and (2) Mr. Slavin requested a hearing on the motions, the circuit court erred in denying the motions without holding a hearing. We therefore remand for the hearing to which the parties are entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Appellees also argue that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motions because appellant filed them in the \u201cwrong case.\u201d We do not know why the circuit court denied these motions, but we refuse to infer that the circuit court would impose such an extreme sanction simply because the wrong case number appears on the motions. It is for the circuit court to (1) hold the hearing to which the parties are entitled, and (2) provide an explanation for its rulings so that any aggrieved party will have an opportunity for meaningful appellate review.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>II. Appellant\u2019s Right to Protection of His Financial Records</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Appellant argues that his financial records were wrongfully disclosed when his wife\u2019s financial records were subpoenaed in the custody/support case. According to appellant, because his wife\u2019s records included their joint accounts, his financial records were also disclosed. Appellees argue that (1) the Bank did not violate the Maryland Confidential Financial Records Act when it disclosed appellant\u2019s financial records prior to the hearing date indicated on the subpoena, and (2) appellant, as a non-party, lacked standing to obtain any redress for alleged noncompliance with the subpoena. Whatever merit there might be in those arguments, the circuit court should not have addressed any of them without holding the hearing to which appellant is entitled, and at which the circuit court shall be guided by the following principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">No party has an absolute right to examine confidential records that have been subpoenaed to the courtroom. A bank depositor has a right to expect that the bank will, to the extent permitted by law, treat as confidential all information regarding the depositor\u2019s account and related transactions. <em>Suburban Trust Company v. Waller, </em>44 Md.App. 335, 344, 408 A.2d 758 (1979). The Maryland Financial Institutions Code prohibits the disclosure of financial records, except under certain circumstances.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">Except as otherwise expressly provided in this subtitle, a fiduciary institution, its officers, employees, agents, and directors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">(1) May not disclose to any person any financial record relating to a customer of the institution unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>(i) The customer has authorized the disclosure to that person....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Fin. Inst. \u00a7 1-302. Section 1\u2014304(b) describes the procedure by which a bank may disclose customer records when served with a subpoena.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">(b) <em>Disclosure or production </em>permitted.\u2014A fiduciary institution may disclose or produce financial records or information derived from financial records in compliance with a subpoena served on the fiduciary institution, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">(1) The subpoena contains a certification that a copy of the subpoena has been served on the person whose records are sought by the party seeking the disclosure or production of the records; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">(2) Contains a certification that service has been waived by the court for good cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Absent compulsion by law, a bank may not make any disclosure concerning a depositor\u2019s account without express or implied consent of the depositor. <em>Suburban Trust, </em>44 Md.App. at 344, 408 A.2d 758; <em>see also Taylor v. Nations-Bank, N.A., </em>365 Md. 166, 179-80, 776 A.2d 645 (2001). When served with a subpoena, so long as the bank follows correct procedure, it may disclose financial records of a customer. It is up to the customer to object to such disclosure. When the customer does not object, lor whatever reason, and the records are disclosed prior to the date on the subpoena, the customers are not thereby stripped of a property interest in those records. Courts could not function effectively if they lacked the power to limit the use parties could make of sensitive information obtained through the court\u2019s processes. <em>Bittaker v. Woodford, </em>331 F.3d 715, 726 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">The subpoena at issue was served on Bank of America and commanded a custodian of records to \u201c[personally appear and produce documents or objects: at Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Courthouse East, Family Division, Room 3, 1st Floor, 111 North Calvert Street, Balt., MD 21202 on Tuesday the 18th day of February, 2003 at 9:30 a.m.\u201d Instead, the Bank delivered the joint bank records of Mr. and Mrs. Bond to counsel for Mr. Slavin at a time prior to and place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>other than that specified in the subpoena. The Bank had no right to do so. When a court issues a subpoena duces tecum requiring a custodian of financial records to \u201cpersonally appear and produce [financial records]\u201d at a certain place on a certain date and time, the custodian cannot\u2014without obtaining the permission of the person(s) whose financial records have been subpoenaed\u2014produce those records at a different place on a different date. Such a subpoena \u201cdoes not ... signify a delivery of the papers into the hands of the party calling for their production or of his counsel, or a submission of them to his examination----\u201d <em>Banks v. Connecticut Railway &amp; Lighting Co., </em>79 Conn. 116, 118-19, 64 A. 14 (1906).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Bank was required to bring the records into court, where (1) any person whose records had been subpoenaed would be entitled to ask the court to resolve claims of relevancy, privilege, or confidentiality, and (2) the court would have the authority to issue an order protecting the records from improper use.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The Maryland Rules of Procedure, like the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> provide the courts with \u201ca grant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>power to impose conditions on discovery in order to prevent injury, harassment, or abuse of the court\u2019s processes.\u201d <em>Bridge C.A.T. Scan Associates v. Technicare Corp., </em>710 F.2d 940, 944-45 (C.A.N.Y.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Rule Md. 2-510(e), in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">Objections to subpoena for court proceedings. On motion of a person served with a subpoena to attend a court proceeding ... at or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, the court may enter any order that justice requires to protect the person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">(4) that documents or other tangible things designated in the subpoena be delivered to the court at or before the proceeding or before the time whey they are to offered in evidence, subject to further order of court to permit inspection of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">This rule does not prohibit appellant from requesting appropriate relief. Under federal law, a motion to quash or modify a subpoena duces tecum may be made by a party who was not served with the subpoena, if that party has a personal right or privilege with respect to the material requested in the subpoena. <em>Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc., </em>162 F.R.D. 683, 685 (D.Kan.1995)(citing F.R.Civ.P. 45(c)(3)(A)); <em>see also Transcor, Inc. v. Furney Charters, Inc., </em>212 F.R.D. 588, 591 (D.Kan.2003)(citing F.R.Civ.P. 45(c)(3)(A)) (as bank customer, defendant had a personal right with respect to its bank account records at banks which were subject of subpoenas duces tecum issued by plaintiff, and that right gave defendant standing to move to quash the subpoenas); <em>Broadcort Capital Corp. v. Flagler Securities, Inc., </em>149 F.R.D. 626, 628 (D.Colo. 1993) (citing F.R.Civ.P. 45) (nonparty and defendant in securi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ties action had standing to object to subpoena duces tecum of telephone company records based on claims that records were privileged, despite contention that only the served party could object).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u201c[A] trial court is duty-bound, where it orders production of documents in which there are strong policy reasons against public disclosure, to limit the availability and use of those documents and their contents by carefully drawn protective provisions.\u201d <em>Carr v. Monroe Mfg. Co., </em>431 F.2d 384, 390 (5th Cir.1970) (citing <em>Baim &amp; Blank, Inc. v. Bruno-New York, Inc., </em>17 F.R.D. 346 (S.D.N.Y.1955)).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In <em>Bush Development Corporation v. Harbour Place Associates, </em>632 F.Supp. 1359 (E.D.Va.1986), although the court found that bank customers had no standing to quash a subpoena filed in a civil action, the court issued the following protective order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">Plaintiffs counsel shall not disclose the contents to any other person or entity other than the agents of his client and the information contained shall be used solely for purposes of this law suit and the disclosure, if any, of the documents or any part thereof by plaintiffs counsel and his agents and employees or by the agents or employee of the plaintiff corporation for any other purpose is expressly forbidden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">When documents that should be presented to the court on a particular date have been presented in advance of that date to the party who issued the subpoena, the fact that harm resulting from the premature production <em>may </em>be irreversible does not render the court powerless to fashion some form of meaningful relief. See <em>Church of Scientology v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>United States, </em>506 U.S. 9, 12-13, 113 S.Ct. 447, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992),<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> which holds that (1) taxpayers have a possessory interest in their tax records, (2) \u201c[w]hen the Government has obtained such materials as a result of an unlawful summons, that interest is violated and a court can effectuate relief by ordering the Government to return the records,\u201d (3) when the Government\u2019s retention of copies of the records constitutes a continuing injury to the taxpayer\u2019s privacy, even though it is too late to prevent the initial invasion of privacy, \u201ca court does have power to effectuate a partial remedy by ordering the Government to destroy or return any and all copies it may have in its possession,\u201d and (4) the availability of this potential remedy was sufficient to prevent the case from being moot. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 113 S.Ct. 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The Bank argues that appellant lacked standing to obtain protection of his financial documents. There is, however, ample Maryland precedent for the proposition that non-parties have standing to obtain judicial relief from the unauthorized disclosure of statutorily protected records. In <em>Ashton v. Cherne Contracting Corporation, </em>102 Md.App. 87, 648 A.2d 1067 (1994), this Court held that, although the jointly-filed tax returns of a witness were subject to discovery,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> the witness was entitled to a protective order redacting those portions of the returns that were irrelevant. <em>Id. </em>at 98, 648 A.2d 1067. See also <em>Rolley v. Sanford, </em>126 Md.App. 124, 727 A.2d 444 (1999), in which this Court held that portions of joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>income tax returns could be redacted to prevent disclosure of irrelevant financial information about the spouse of a party to the litigation. In <em>Warner v. Lerner, </em>348 Md. 733, 705 A.2d 1169 (1998), the Court of Appeals held that the Confidentiality of Medical Records Act, Md.Code, Health-Gen. I \u00a7 4-301 through 4-309 (2003), permitted a lawsuit by a plaintiff who learned that his medical records had been used without his permission in a medical malpractice action to which he was not a party. <em>Id. </em>at 740-41, 705 A.2d 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">III.

William H. Slavin, </em>Case No. 24-D-95-249006 (Cir. Ct. Baltimore City) (hereinafter referred to as the \"child custody case\"). In September of 2001, Mrs. Bond filed a Petition for Relief from Abuse in which she requested that a Protective Order be entered against Mr. Slavin. <em>See Bond v. Slavin, </em>Civil Action No. 24-D-01-003359 (Cir. Ct. Baltimore City) (hereinafter referred to as the \"domestic violence case\u201d). Neither the appellant nor Bank of America were parties to this case. That case concluded in Mr. Slavin\u2019s favor on January 3, 2002, when the Circuit Court for Baltimore City voided a Protective Order that had been entered at an earlier point in time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\">. Although the subpoena was supposed to have been issued in the child custody case, the case number on the subpoena is 952490061/CE 201677. This number is close to the number of the child custody case, but the format is different. This mistake was the first of many that have resulted in the needless waste of time, energy, and judicial resources.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b368-10\">. This certification was filed pursuant to \u00a7 1-304 of Maryland\u2019s Financial Institutions Article. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Fin. Inst. \u00a7 1-304 (2003). Mrs. Bond claims that she was not notified by her attorney that a subpoena had been issued for her bank records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b369-5\">. Immediately prior to the June 23, 2003 hearing, Mrs. Bond and Mr. Slavin resolved their custody and support dispute. During the hearing, the parties put on no evidence other than that of the settlement agreement. The records at issue were not marked for identification or used in any way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b369-6\">. According to appellant, on Saturday February 15, 2003, Mrs. Bond received a letter from the Bank, postmarked February 13, 2003, advising her that a subpoena had been issued, and instructing her to notify the Bank immediately if she intended to file a motion objecting to the disclosure of her records. According to the Bonds, this was the first notice they received of the existence of this subpoena. By faxes and letters dated Sunday, February 16 and Monday, February 17, and by voice mail messages from appellant\u2019s counsel on February 20, the Bonds notified the Bank that they would not grant permission for disclosure, and that they intended to file motions to prevent the disclosure of their financial records.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">February 17, 2003 was President\u2019s Day and the weekend of a severe snowstorm that paralyzed the area. As a result, the courts were closed on February 18 and 19. Bank of America was also closed on February 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">On February 21, 2003, a representative of the Bank wrote to appellant\u2019s counsel, advising that the records had been produced within two business days prior to the scheduled hearing, and that the Bank intended to continue production of any additional records, absent a court order. That same day, the Bank sent Mrs. Bond a letter, advising her of the particular account information that had been provided to Mr. Slavin's counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">On February 21, 2003, appellant\u2019s attorney requested that no further production or release of banking records be made to Mr. Slavin\u2019s counsel. On February 24, February 27, and March 4, 2003, appellant's counsel wrote to Mr. Slavin's counsel, requesting that the records be returned either to the Bank or to appellant and/or that Mr. Slavin and his counsel agree not to make any direct or indirect use of the records or the information contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">On February 25, Mr. Slavin's counsel wrote to the Bank, requesting that the Bank continue its production of documents. On February 27, appellant's counsel demanded that the Bank obtain the return of the records. By letter dated March 3, 2003, Mr. Slavin's counsel declined to return the records and threatened to seek sanctions against appellant\u2019s counsel. By letter dated March 6, 2003, the Bank advised that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>would continue to produce records to Mr. Slavin\u2019s counsel until it received an order quashing the subpoena.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">. Unfortunately, these motions were erroneously filed in the domestic violence case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">. Although Mr. Slavin subpoenaed only Mrs. Bond's bank records, appellant sought to prevent the production of the records in which he was identified as a joint account holder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b370-9\">. The motions also requested that the court order the Bank to pay appellant $2000 in attorney\u2019s fees, and order such other relief justice may require.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b370-10\">. Appellant filed these motions in the domestic violence case, a case that had already been concluded and to which the motions had no relevance, instead of the child custody case in which the subpoena arguably had been issued. Appellees filed their papers in both the domestic violence case and the child custody case out of an abundance of caution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b370-11\">. This Notice of Appeal, filed in the domestic violence case, resulted in the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\">. Appellant also filed\u2014in the circuit court and in this Court\u2014Motions to Stay the Orders denying his motions pending appeal. Appellant erroneously filed the Motion to Stay in the domestic violence case rather than the child custody case. On May 1, 2003, this Court denied appellant\u2019s Motion to Stay \"without prejudice to again seek appropriate relief from this Court upon a showing that (1) appellant requested a protective order or other appropriate relief from the circuit court, and (2) the circuit court erred or abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s request.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\">. The court file includes a photocopy of the Notice of Appeal filed on April 17, 2003, and a cashier\u2019s date stamp indicating that the filing fee was paid on June 16, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b371-9\">. Those motions were filed on May 16, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b371-10\">. On June 30, 2003, appellant filed a second Notice of Appeal, apparently from the June 23rd and June 26th orders denying all three motions and authorizing Mr. Slavin and the bank to submit fee peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tions. Although docketed in the domestic violence case, there is no other record of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\">. Appellant was entitled to note an appeal from the April 2, 2003 order, because that order constituted a final and dispositive judgment that denied all of appellant\u2019s requests for relief. While it is true that the April 2nd order included a provision that authorized counsel for Mr. Slavin to \"submit a petition ... pursuant to Md. Rule 1-341,\u201d if appellant had no right to appeal until a Rule 1-341 order was actually entered, counsel for Mr. Slavin would be able to prevent appellate review by simply not filing the petition authorized by the order at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\">.
