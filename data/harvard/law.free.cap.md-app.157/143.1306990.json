That section authorizes a UM carrier to require that an insured \u201cexhaust\u201d the liability limits of a tortfeasor\u2019s insurance policy before applying for and receiving underinsured motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) benefits under the insured\u2019s policy. We are asked in this case to decide what is meant by the term \u201cexhaust.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we hold that the exhaustion requirement in \u00a7 19\u2014509(g) means that an insured must have been paid the full amount of the tortfeasor\u2019s limit of liability in order to seek UM benefits; payment of anything less than the full amount of that limit entitles the insured\u2019s UM carrier to deny the insured\u2019s claim for additional benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The background facts of this case are undisputed. It stems from a two-car accident that occurred on February 12, 1998, on Route 1 near Chadds Ford Township in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. A vehicle driven by Edgar Leroy Lewis, Jr., a Pennsylvania motorist, struck the rear of a vehicle driven by Mark Kurtz and owned by appellants, Mark and Theresa Kurtz (\u201cthe Kurtzes\u201d). Mr. Kurtz sustained bodily injuries in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The vehicle driven by Mr. Lewis was insured by Allstate Indemnity Company under a $25,000.00 single limit liability policy (\u201cthe Allstate policy\u201d). The Kurtzes\u2019 vehicle was insured by appellee, Erie Insurance Company (\u201cErie\u201d), under a policy with $100,000.00 per person and $300,000.00 per occurrence limits for both liability coverage and UM coverage (\u201cthe policy\u201d). The Kurtzes were the named insureds under the Erie policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">One month after the accident, appellant Mark Kurtz made a claim for benefits against Erie. Four months later, the Kurtzes informed Erie by letter that there might exist \u201ca possible underinsured motorist claim in light of Mr. [KurtzJ\u2019s serious injuries and economic losses.\u201d Erie eventually ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>knowledged receipt of this letter and, by return letter, requested that the Kurtzes inform Erie of the status of their underlying claim against Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In January 2001, the Kurtzes, by counsel, sent a letter to Erie confirming a conversation that counsel had with a claim adjuster for Erie. The letter includes a reference to Erie\u2019s having orally waived its rights to subrogation, and allowing the Kurtzes to sign a general release \u201cin the event we are able to settle with Allstate Insurance Company.\u201d The letter also explained the extent of Mr. Kurtz\u2019s injuries and made a demand, \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d of $100,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The Kurtzes thereafter negotiated a settlement with Allstate. Allstate agreed to pay the Kurtzes $23,500.00 in exchange for a release of all liability against the alleged tortfeasors (Laurie and Edgar Lewis and Edgar Leroy Lewis, Jr.).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The Kurtzes sent photocopies of the signed release and of the $23,500.00 check to Erie. Four months later, Erie declined by letter to pay the Kurtzes UM benefits, explaining that it did \u201cnot feel the value of [Mr. Kurtz\u2019s] case exceeds the limit of $25,000.00, which is the policy limit coverage with the underlying carrier, Allstate Insurance Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">This led the Kurtzes to file a two-count complaint in the Circuit Court for Harford County, alleging that Erie had breached the UM coverage provision of its policy (Count I), and that Erie interfered with the Kurtzes\u2019 marital relationship (Count II). They sought $125,000.00 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Erie answered, setting forth several affirmative defenses. Erie also filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the Kurtzes were not entitled to UM benefits because the Allstate policy had not been exhausted by payment of its limits, and Erie did not give written consent to the Kurtzes to settle their claim against Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The Kurtzes filed an opposition and the matter came on for a hearing. Following the hearing, the court issued an opinion and order granting summary judgment in favor of Erie.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>court concluded that \u201cErie Insurance Company[ ] has no obligation to pay the [Kurtzes] under either the terms of the policy of insurance issued to [them] or under the law of the [S]tate of Maryland because the [Kurtzes] failed to live up to the terms of the policy by not exhausting all other insurance coverage.\u201d The court did not rule on the effect, if any, of the Kurtzes\u2019 decision to settle with Allstate without receiving written consent from Erie.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Because this case is before us by way of a grant of summary judgment, we review the judgment <em>de novo. Tyma v. Montgomery County, </em>369 Md. 497, 504, 801 A.2d 148 (2002). Summary judgment is only appropriate when, upon review of the facts and inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact and the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Md. Rule 2-501(e); <em>Sadler v. Dimensions Healthcare Corp., </em>378 Md. 509, 515, 836 A.2d 655 (2003). Inasmuch as there is no dispute of material fact, the only issue is whether the court was legally correct in deciding that the Kurtzes were not entitled to UM benefits under the Erie policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Since 1973, Maryland \u201chas required every motor vehicle insurance carrier to offer certain minimum uninsured motorist coverage in every motor vehicle insurance policy issued\u201d in this State. <em>Waters v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>328 Md. 700, 710, 616 A.2d 884 (1992). Found at \u00a7 19-501 <em>et seq. </em>of the Insurance Article, the legislative scheme has the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>pose of \u201c \u2018assuring] financial compensation to the innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents who are unable to recover from financially irresponsible uninsured motorists.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crespo v. Topi </em>154 Md.App. 391, 394, 840 A.2d 156 (2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The legislative scheme, however, also authorizes UM carriers to impose certain exclusions, conditions, and limits on the required UM coverage. <em>Lewis v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>368 Md. 44, 48-49, 792 A.2d 272 (2002). One such authorized limit on UM coverage is set forth in \u00a7 19-509(g), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\"><em>Limit of insurer\u2019s </em>liability.\u2014The limit of liability for an insurer that provides uninsured motorist coverage under this section is the amount of that coverage less the amount paid to the insured, that exhausts any applicable liability insurance policies, bonds, and securities, on behalf of any person that may be held liable for the bodily injuries or death of the insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In this case, Erie denied the Kurtzes\u2019 claim for UM benefits by invoking the policy\u2019s provision that addressed the limit of Erie\u2019s UM liability. That provision declares, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">When the accident involves underinsured motor vehicles, <em>we will not pay until all other forms of insurance </em>under all bodily injury and property damage liability bonds and insurance policies and self-insurance plans applicable at the time of the accident <em>have been exhausted by payment of their limits.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Erie submits that this provision is consistent with \u00a7 19-509(g) and permitted Erie to deny the Kurtzes\u2019 claim because they had not exhausted the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy. We agree with Erie that this provision essentially mirrors the language of \u00a7 19-509(g), and the Kurtzes do not argue to the contrary. Neither do the Kurtzes suggest that the term \u201cexhaust\u201d has any different meaning in the policy than it does in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The parties\u2019 dispute focuses instead on the proper construction of the term \u201cexhaust,\u201d as it is employed in the statute (and therefore the policy). Erie asserts that the term should be given its ordinary dictionary meaning and, thus defined, required the Kurtzes to have been paid the $25,000.00 maximum coverage of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy. Because they settled for $23,500.00, they failed to exhaust the policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The Kurtzes urge a definition of exhaustion that is more favorable to them and is, in their view, more in keeping with the purpose of Maryland\u2019s comprehensive scheme of regulating uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. They argue that exhaustion must be construed simply as a \u201cthreshold\u201d to UM coverage, so that any payment received by the injured party on the underlying liability policy, even if less than its limits, would satisfy the exhaustion requirement. This construction would permit recovery under the injured party\u2019s UM coverage, the Kurtzes argue, so long as a credit is given to the UM carrier for the difference between the amount received under the underlying liability policy and the limit of its coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Unfortunately for the Kurtzes, Erie has the better part of the argument. As we discuss below, giving the word \u201cexhaust\u201d its plain and ordinary meaning, and reading that word in the context in which it is employed in \u00a7 19-509(g), the statute unambiguously requires the injured party to be paid the full amount available under the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy. This construction, moreover, is consistent with how exhaustion is understood in insurance parlance; is confirmed by resort to the legislative history of \u00a7 19\u2014509(g); and conforms to the construction given the word \u201cexhaust,\u201d or other similar terms, in states having similar exhaustion statutes. Finally, our reading of \u00a7 19-509(g) does not conflict with the overarching purpose of Maryland\u2019s scheme to provide UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Our analysis calls for us to employ principles of statutory construction, the most fundamental of which is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ascertain and give effect to the legislative intention. <em>Western Corr. Inst. v. Geiger, </em>371 Md. 125, 140, 807 A.2d 32 (2002). The starting point is the language of the statute itself. <em>Id. </em>at 141, 807 A.2d 32. \u201cIn fact, all statutory interpretation begins, and usually ends, with the statutory text itself, for the legislative intent of a statute primarily reveals itself through the statute\u2019s very words.\u201d <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221 (2003) (internal citations omitted). And we are cautioned not to \u201cadd [ ]or delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute,\u201d nor may we \u201cconstrue the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[I]f the words of a statute clearly and unambiguously delineate the legislative intent, ours is an ephemeral enterprise. We need investigate no further but simply apply the statute as it reads.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Neither the word \u201cexhaust,\u201d nor the statute in which it is used, is ambiguous. \u201cExhaust\u201d is defined as \u201cto use up the whole supply or store of: expend or consume entirely.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 796 (2002). Giving the word exhaust its ordinary meaning and reading it in context, the intent of \u00a7 19-509(g) is plain: it requires that the insured must have been paid the entire amount of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy to be entitled to additional benefits under the insured\u2019s UM policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Moreover, this construction of \u00a7 19-509(g) comports with how the concept of exhaustion is understood in insurance law. In insurance parlance, exhaustion contemplates the complete use of a primary liability policy before resort to any secondary or excess policy. As this Court has declared, \u201c[wjithin the meaning of an excess policy, \u2018exhaustion\u2019 does not occur until the limits of underlying insurance have been met.\u201d <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>145 Md.App. 256, 314, 802 A.2d 1070, <em>cert. granted, </em>371 Md. 613, 810 A.2d 961 (2002), <em>dismissed, </em>374 Md. 81, 821 A.2d 369 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">We conclude that \u00a7 19-509(g) unambiguously states that, in order to be entitled to UM benefits, the insured must use up, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>or consume entirely, the coverage provided by the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy; if the insured does not do so, \u00a7 19-509(g) authorizes the UM carrier to deny payment. Furthermore, as we discuss next, this construction of \u00a7 19-509(g) is confirmed by its legislative history. <em>See Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 131, 756 A.2d 987 (2000) (stating that, even where a statute is unambiguous, the construing court may look to the statute\u2019s legislative history as a \u201cconfirmatory process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Section 19-509(g) has undergone two iterations since its enactment in 1973. Originally, the limit of liability of a UM insurer was codified at Maryland Code Ann. (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(3). That statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\"><em>Limit of insurer\u2019s </em>liability.\u2014The limit of liability for an insurer providing uninsured motorist coverage under this subsection is the amount of that coverage less the sum of the limits under the liability insurance policies, bonds, and securities applicable to the bodily injury or death of the insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">This statute \u201cprovided for a strict limit-to-limit comparison [of the policies\u2019 coverage], without regard to the amount that the injured party actually <em>receives </em>from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance carrier.\u201d <em>General Accident Ins. Co. v. Scott, </em>107 Md. App. 603, 622-23, 669 A.2d 773, <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 115, 673 A.2d 707 (1996); <em>accord Fireman\u2019s Fund. Ins. Co. v. Bragg, </em>76 Md.App. 709, 715-16, 548 A.2d 151 (1988); <em>see also Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wendler, </em>796 F.Supp. 201, 204 (D.Md. 1992) (following our decision in <em>Bragg </em>to conclude that \u201c[b]oth the policy and the statute are straightforward and by their terms only require a comparison of the applicable coverage limits to determine if a motorist is underinsured\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Apparently because \u00a7 541(c)(3) led to harsh consequences for some victims of underinsured motorists, Senate Bill (\u201cSB\u201d) 251 was introduced in the 1995 session of the General Assem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>bly. 1995 Md. Laws ch. 515. As summarized, SB 251 provided</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">that a person with uninsured motorist insurance may recover the amount of the person\u2019s injuries up to the limit of the person\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage. The injured person first would recover from the injuring party\u2019s liability insurer before recovering from the injured person\u2019s uninsured motorist insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Floor Report of Senate Bill 251, at 1; <em>see also </em>Bill Analysis of Senate Bill 251, at 1. In effect, SB 251 altered</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdO\">the limit of liability of an uninsured motorist insurer to account for situations in which the limit of the injuring party\u2019s liability policy has been reduced, by payment of other claims arising from the same occurrence, to an amount less than the coverage under the injured person\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Floor Report of Senate Bill 251, at 1; <em>see also </em>Bill Analysis of Senate Bill 251, at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">As originally introduced, SB 251 read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">The limit of liability for an insurer providing uninsured motorist coverage under this subsection is the amount of that coverage less the [sum of the limits] AMOUNT PAID TO THE INSURED under [the] ANY APPLICABLE liability insurance policies, bonds, and securities ON BEHALF OF ANY PERSON WHO MAY BE HELD LIABLE FOR [applicable to] the bodily [injury] INJURIES or death of the insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Important to our analysis in the present case, the bill was subsequently amended to include the requirement that the insured exhaust the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance. As amended, the bill read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">The limit of liability for an insurer providing uninsured motorist coverage under this subsection is the amount of that coverage less the [sum of the limits] AMOUNT PAID TO THE INSURED under <em>THAT EXHAUSTS </em>[the] ANY APPLICABLE liability insurance policies, bonds, and securities, ON BEHALF OF ANY PERSON WHO MAY BE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>HELD LIABLE FOR [applicable to] the bodily [injury] INJURIES or death of the insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">This amended version was enacted into law. The bill file contains no evidence of the legislature\u2019s purpose in adding the exhaustion requirement to current \u00a7 19-509(g). Nevertheless, it is obvious that the legislature rejected an approach that would permit, in essence, partial exhaustion in favor of a statute that requires total exhaustion of the underlying liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The legislative history of \u00a7 19-509(g) thus refutes the Kurtzes\u2019 argument that the exhaustion requirement should be construed merely as a \u201cthreshold\u201d to the insured\u2019s obtaining benefits under the UM policy. As we have outlined, SB 251, in its original form, may well have permitted the construction the Kurtzes seek to impose upon the statute as enacted. But that version of SB 251 did not pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">We will not ignore the plain language of the statute, nor its legislative history in ascertaining the legislative purpose behind \u00a7 19-509(g). <em>See State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Insurance Comm\u2019r of the State of Maryland, </em>283 Md. 663, 672, 392 A.2d 1114 (1978) (rejecting Insurance Commissioner\u2019s proposed definition of word \u201crecover\u201d in insurance benefits statute because employing that definition \u201cwould be ignoring the plain language of the statute and \u2018resorting to subtle or forced interpretations for the purpose of ... limiting ... its operation\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Cases from our sister states having exhaustion statutes like Maryland\u2019s have consistently construed their exhaustion provisions as we have done here. Illustrative is <em>Curran v. Progressive Northwestern, Ins. Co., </em>29 P.3d 829 (Alaska 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">In that case, the Supreme Court of Alaska held that its statute requiring a UM insured to \u201cuse up\u201d all underlying liability coverage before recovering under a UM policy is an \u201cexhaustion statute\u201d and, like other such provisions around the country, authorizes a UM insurer to make UM coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>inapplicable until the liability coverage has been used up. <em>See id. </em>at 833, 833 n. 23 (citing statutes), <em>id </em>at. 834 n. 31 (citing cases). The court rejected the argument of the insured that a unilateral credit of liability coverage does not satisfy the statutory requirement to use up the liability coverage by payments, judgments or settlements before an insured may collect UM benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 835-36. And the court rejected the argument advanced by the insured that such a construction is inconsistent with public policy, \u201csince public policy can guide statutory construction but cannot override a clear and unequivocal statutory requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Other cases are to like effect. <em>See Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Hurley, </em>76 Cal.App.4th 797, 806, 90 Cal.Rptr.2d 697, 703 (1999) (statute required that full limits of tortfeasor\u2019s policy be exhausted, and that settlement for lesser amount did not satisfy requirements for UM benefits, even if insured agreed to credit UM insurer with difference between settlement amount and tortfeasor\u2019s liability limits), <em>review denied, </em>February 16, 2000; <em>The Continental Ins.

Erie Ins. Co., </em>441 Pa.Super. 103, 656 A.2d 941, <em>appeal denied, </em>542 Pa. 655, 668 A.2d 1120 (1995), and like cases, which declare void on public policy or other grounds policy provisions that require exhaustion of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability limits. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 109, 656 A.2d at 943-44; <em>Karasawa v. TIG Ins. Co., </em>88 Hawai\u2019i 77, 83-84, 961 P.2d 1171, 1177-78 (1998) (court stated that under motor vehicle insurance statutory scheme, no requirement existed that an injured party exhaust the liability policies of all joint tortfeasors before making a claim against insured\u2019s UM policy); <em>Brown v.

These decisions rest, however, on the absence of a statute authorizing UM insurers to include such exhaustion provisions in their policies, rendering them inapposite to Maryland\u2019s UM construct.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Finally, we reject the Kurtzes\u2019 argument that to read \u00a7 19-509(g) as we have done runs afoul of the remedial purpose of UM legislation in Maryland. It is certainly true that the law requiring UM coverage \u201cis remedial in nature and should be liberally construed in order to \u2018effectuate its purpose of assuring recovery for innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crespo, </em>154 Md.App. at 394, 840 A.2d 156 (citation omitted). And it is for this reason that, \u201c \u2018under Maryland\u2019s compulsory automobile insurance statute, contractual exclusions in automobile insurance policies that excuse or reduce benefits below the minimum statutorily required levels or types of coverage, and are not expressly authorized by the General Assembly, are invalid.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stearman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>381 Md. 436, 445 n. 5, 849 A.2d 539, 544 n. 5, (2004); <em>accord Salamon v. Progressive Classic Ins. Co., </em>379 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Md. 301, 311-12, 841 A.2d 858 (2004); <em>Lewis, </em>368 Md. at 48, 792 A.2d 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Yet, \u201c[d]espite the fact that the uninsured motorist statute is to be liberally construed in favor of assuring recovery for innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents, liberal construction does not permit a departure from the legislature\u2019s intended application of the section.\u201d <em>Matta v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>119 Md.App. 334, 344, 705 A.2d 29 (1998). Insurance companies providing underinsured motorist coverage are allowed to \u201climit their liability and to impose whatever condition they please in the policy so long as neither the limitation on liability nor the condition contravenes a statutory inhibition or the State\u2019s public policy.\u201d <em>Walther v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>83 Md.App. 405, 411, 575 A.2d 339, <em>cert. denied, </em>320 Md. 801, 580 A.2d 219 (1990). Thus, the Court of Appeals repeatedly has upheld policy terms \u201cthat excused or reduced an insurer\u2019s coverage below the statutory m\u00ednimums,\u201d because the General Assembly has authorized those exclusions or exemptions. <em>See Salamon, </em>379 Md. at 312-14, 841 A.2d 858 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">By enacting \u00a7 19-509(g), the General Assembly has made a judgment to permit UM insurers to limit their liability by requiring exhaustion of the underlying policy. We are bound to accept that expression of legislative will. <em>See Stearman, </em>op. at 454, 849 A.2d at 550 (stating that the Court \u201cwill not invade the province of the General Assembly and rewrite the law for them, no matter how just or fair we may think such a new law or public policy would be\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The circuit court concluded that \u00a7 19-509(g) permitted Erie to incorporate the exhaustion requirements into its UM endorsement, and because the Kurtzes failed to exhaust the limit of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage, Erie could properly deny their claim for UM benefits. For all the reasons we have discussed, the circuit court was correct in that conclusion. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>therefore affirm the court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of Erie.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-11\">. By order issued pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-602, we remanded the case to the circuit court for entry of a final judgment as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Maryland Rule 2--601(a). That order was duly entered on the circuit court docket, rendering the judgment final for this Court's review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
