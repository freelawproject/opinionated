Dr. Footer, an obstetrician, was a County employee when he delivered Luis. Accordingly, appellant filed suit pursuant to the Local Government Tort Claims Act (the \u201cLGTCA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d), Md.Code (1973, 2002 RepLVoL), \u00a7 5-301 et seq. of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Although Luis was born in 1991, appellant did not file the notice of claim required by C.J. \u00a7 5-304 until April 2001. Therefore, appellees moved to dismiss the suit. Upon finding that appellant lacked good cause in filing a belated notice of claim, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County dismissed the case. This appeal followed, in which appellant poses the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">I. Whether the trial court erred in finding that Appellant had not shown good cause for waiving the requirement of timely notice under Section 5-304(c) of the Local Government Tort Claims Act[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">II. Whether the 180-day notice requirement of Section 5-304(a) of the Local Government Tort Claims Act is unconstitutional as applied to minors[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-8\"><em>FACTUAL </em>SUMMARY<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Nelly Rios, a native of Bolivia, entered the United States in 1983. She subsequently returned to her native Bolivia, and then re-entered the United States in 1987 with her husband, Luis Rios.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. and Ms. Rios are the parents of Luis. They separated before Luis was two years old and are now divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">On June 17, 1991, a friend referred Ms. Rios to a clinic in Rockville to obtain prenatal care. Unknown to appellant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>clinic was operated by the Montgomery County Health Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">While at the clinic on June 17,1991, Ms. Rios signed a form, written in Spanish, titled <em>\u201cMaternity Programa De Maternidad Prueba De Domicilio.\u201d </em>The words \u201cMontgomery County Government\u201d appear in large letters at the top of the form, in English, along with the County seal. The words \u201cDepartment of Health, Division of Family Health Services\u201d appear in English at the bottom of the document, along with the address. The English version of the form, included in the record, is titled: \u201cMaternity Program Proof of Residency.\u201d According to the English version of the form, by signing the document, appellant represented that she was a resident of Montgomery County. The form also directs the \u201cperson requesting service\u201d to \u201creport all changes in ... residency (within 14 days) to the Montgomery County Health Department.\u201d In addition, Ms. Rios signed a document called a \u201cFace Sheet.\u201d It is written in English, with the words \u201cMontgomery County\u201d at the top.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In 1991, Dr. Footer worked part-time for Montgomery County through his participation in a program known as \u201cProject Delivery.\u201d On December 31, 1991, while appellant was in labor at Holy Cross Hospital of Silver Spring, Inc. (\u201cHoly Cross\u201d or the \u201cHospital\u201d), Dr. Footer was on call. Although Dr. Footer had never previously met Ms. Rios, and never provided prenatal care to her at the clinic, he delivered Luis on that date. Appellant paid the Hospital, not the County, for the costs associated with Luis\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Luis weighed ten pounds, five ounces at birth, and his size apparently was a complication in delivery. During labor, Luis\u2019s anterior shoulder became lodged. Consequently, Dr. Footer used forceps to deliver Luis, which resulted in a sulcar tear<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a fourth degree tear of the brachial plexus.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Luis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>now suffers with Erb\u2019s palsy,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a permanent injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Although it was known at birth that Luis was injured, Ms. Rios did not provide notice of her malpractice claim to the County until almost a decade later, on April 6, 2001. On May 11, 2001, Ms. Rios filed her claim with the Maryland Health Claims Arbitration Office. After arbitration was waived, appellant filed a negligence suit against Dr. Footer and the County on July 24, 2001, seeking to recover for Luis\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Ms. Rios was deposed through a Spanish interpreter on June 6, 2002. She testified that she spoke very little English in 1991, and did not know how to read English when she went to the clinic on June 17, 1991. However, she acknowledged that the \u201cnurses spoke Spanish\u201d and helped her to complete the forms and to communicate with the doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Ms. Rios estimated that she went to the clinic about twelve times, and paid $8 per visit. But, she claimed that she \u201cdid not know that it was a clinic run by the county.\u201d Ms. Rios stated: \u201cI thought it was just a public clinic....\u201d Nor did Ms. Rios know that Dr. Footer was a County employee. The following deposition testimony is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES][<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]: You indicated that a friend of yours told you to go to the clinic at 50 Monroe Street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: You indicated that she [i.e., appellant\u2019s friend] said that if you went there, they could help. What did they say they could do for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">[APPELLANT]: Because I was told to have a baby and to have\u2014to give childbirth in the hospital would cost about $5,000, and I did not have those resources, sufficient resources to pay that bill, so I was told there at the clinic that they could do that for me for $1,500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: And it was your understanding that this clinic was a clinic that was run by Montgomery County, Maryland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">[APPELLANT]: No. I just knew it was\u2014I was under the impression that it was a clinic that would help people, but I didn\u2019t know anything more about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: Did you know who ran the clinic?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: Did you know anything about the clinic other than you just go there and you get help?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">[APPELLANT]: Just that I would have to pay less, and that\u2019s why I want there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-14\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: Was it your understanding that the clinic was not run by Montgomery County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>[APPELLANT]: No. I did not know that it was a clinic run by the county. I thought it was just a public clinic, and that\u2019s why you pay the $1,500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: So it was your understanding that it was a public clinic; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADA\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, but one where you had to pay, but I did not know it was run by the county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: Did you understand that it was run by the government or a government?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmU\">[APPELLANT]: No, I never knew that. I would go once a month for my appointments. I would just sign in, have my appointment, and go back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: At any point in time did you ask any of the individuals there who they worked for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW3\">[APPELLANT]: No, never. I never would ask anything. I would just go in and come back out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: After your son was born did you ever ask any of the individuals at the clinic who they worked for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">[APPELLANT]: No, never. I never have asked anybody there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: You also understood when you signed up at the clinic that the clinic was going to provide\u2014was going to have someone deliver your baby; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">[APPELLANT]: Yes. I thought it would be the same doctor that would give me the checkups.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">Ms. Rios \u201cassume[d]\u201d that her doctor from the clinic would supervise her delivery. At the time of Luis\u2019s delivery, she thought she recognized Dr. Footer as the same doctor she had previously seen at the clinic. Appellant noted, however, that she was \u201cunder such strong pain\u201d during labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">Ms. Rios recalled that, by six months of age, Luis was still unable to move his hand, and her husband felt \u201chelpless,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u201cvery frustrated\u201d and \u201cdesperate.\u201d She acknowledged that, before Luis was a year old, her husband saw a lawyer to discuss the matter, but she had \u201cno idea who that lawyer would be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">At his deposition, Dr. Footer recalled that he learned of Luis\u2019s size \u201cat the time of delivery,\u201d and acknowledged that he was a bit \u201csurprised\u201d by the baby\u2019s size. He also recalled that, after the delivery, he discussed with Ms. Rios that \u201cthe baby had nerve damage\u201d that required further \u201cevaluation.\u201d Dr. Footer said he told Ms. Rios \u201cthat we would have to wait and see whether this resolved totally or not.\u201d He could not recall, however, whether he discussed with Ms. Rios the risks of a forceps delivery. Nor did Dr. Footer know whether Ms. Rios was aware that he was a County employee. The following excerpt is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: Do you recall ever telling Mrs. Rios that you were an employee of Montgomery County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">[DR. FOOTER]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: Do you know whether or not she knew that you were an employee of the county at the time of her delivery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">[DR. FOOTER]: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: Have you ever seen any papers or anything that could document an understanding by the patient that she was being delivered by a county employee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">[DR. FOOTER]: I honestly don\u2019t know whether that exists. I have never seen anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">On September 23, 2002, Ms. Rios filed a \u201cMotion to Waive Requirement of Timely Notice Under the Local Government Tort Claims Act and to Permit Action to Proceed\u201d (the \u201cMotion\u201d). She claimed that, \u201c[p]rior to consulting -with her current attorney, she did not know, and had no reason to know,\u201d that Dr. Footer was an employee of the County when he delivered Luis. Ms. Rios also asserted that the defendants would not be prejudiced if her Motion were granted, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>the Hospital records regarding Luis\u2019s birth are available, and Dr. Footer and Dr. David Solberg, the obstetrical resident who participated in the delivery, \u201care still available to testify.\u201d At the motion hearing on January 29, 2003, appellant urged the court to find good cause to justify her belated notice, based on the concept of \u201cexcusable neglect or mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">The court (Woodward, J.) determined that, even if Ms. Rios lacked actual knowledge that the clinic was a County facility and that Dr. Footer worked for the County, she had \u201can affirmative duty to inquire as to the legal identity of the Defendant.\u201d In its view, even a \u201cminimum inquiry\u201d would have led appellant to discover the employment status of Dr. Footer. In a thorough and well reasoned oral opinion, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">It seems to me that the only category that the facts in this case focus on is excusable neglect or mistake. The good cause or the excusable neglect or mistake in this case is the fact that the Plaintiff did not know that the defendant doctor was an employee of the County at the time that the delivery was performed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">I think the Defendant, for the purpose of this motion, has conceded that the Plaintiff did not know that; nobody told her that, the doctor didn\u2019t tell her that, the County didn\u2019t tell her that, she didn\u2019t have that actual knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">The Plaintiff further alleges that the Plaintiff did not have reason to know that the Defendant was an employee of the County. That fact is vigorously disputed by the County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">Insofar as whether the Plaintiffs lack of knowledge of the Defendant\u2019s employment status is good cause has been addressed in a different context in the <em>Gould </em>case, <em>Gould v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services </em>[905 F.2d 738 (4th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1025, 111 S.Ct. 673, 112 L.Ed.2d 666 (1991) ]. [Appellant] is correct, this is a different issue because it\u2019s the Federal Tort Claims Act, and it deals with the statute of limitations. But that case uses, however, a due diligence standard when discussing the conduct of the Plaintiff in that case....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Indeed, there was nothing to indicate in that case that the defendant doctor had any relationship to the federal government, because all the treatment was performed at a family health care corporation in Anne Arundel County, ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">But the court goes on to a lot of discussion about due diligence in investigating a claim. They indicated that as a part of due diligence, the Plaintiff had an affirmative duty to inquire as to the legal identity of the Defendant. The burden is on the Plaintiff to discover the employment status of the tort feasor and to bring a suit within the applicable limitations period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">They did indicate in this case that if there was a reasonable investigation and that information was undiscoverable, then that could be a reason in that case for tolling the statute of limitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">The standard, though, as I indicated was one of due diligence. And in that case, in the <em>Gould </em>case, too the plaintiff never investigated the employment status of the defendant until after the statute had run, or at least to put it the way the court stated, is there was no evidence that there was any investigation prior to the running of the statute of limitations....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">\n<em>The problem is that for a period of over eight and a half years, there\u2019s no evidence that the Plaintiff did anything to investigate or prosecute her claim. This was as [sic] situation where it was a patent injury, it was not a latent injury; she was aware of that injury, she was aware of the circumstances surrounding the occurrence of the injury. She was aware that her husband wanted to talk to a lawyer and may have talked to a lawyer about what had happened to their child.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">\n<em>So there was clear notice to her that there was a potential legal claim against the doctors for the injuries sustained by her child. Yet there\u2019s no evidence that anything was done.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>We don\u2019t know what an investigation would have revealed ... we simply don\u2019t know that because it was never accomplished; it was never done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The court also considered whether appellant \u201cwas on some kind of inquiry notice about whether the doctor was an employee of the County.\u201d It was satisfied that Ms. Rios had inquiry notice of the County\u2019s involvement. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah0\">She did go to a County health clinic for her prenatal care, she did sign a document that indicated that, a proof of residency form on a Montgomery County Health Department form; it was in Spanish, it did have the logo of Montgomery County on it, did have the Montgomery County Health Department listed on it. She did believe that the doctor that she\u2019d seen at the Health Department was the same doctor that delivered her child, albeit that that has turned out not to be true, but that was her belief, according to her testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">The clinic is run by the County, exclusively by the County, has the County logo on it, so there seems to me to be evidence here over and above the actual knowledge that would put a reasonable person on notice that somehow the County would be involved in this case, as the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">And she went to this clinic because she couldn\u2019t afford the delivery, the regular cost of delivery; and that was another indication that the County or some other entity was involved in the delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">So I think from the facts of this case, while she may not have actually known the employment status, she certainly had reasonable indication that the County was involved, and potentially responsible for what had happened in the course of the delivery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Concluding that appellant did not establish good cause, the court dismissed the case. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">I recognize that I have discretion in this case, and I have pondered long and hard over this. I have searched diligently for what the law requires me to find, and that\u2019s good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>cause. And if I could find it, I would find it. But I can\u2019t get past the fact that <em>there simply was no evidence of investigation, no evidence of prosecution of this claim for over eight and a half years after the injury occurred. </em>The requirement of the notice is 180 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">She had an obligation under the law to make that investigation. And if that investigation had not disclosed employment, if that investigation had been reasonably conducted and there was a delay in discovery of the employment status, then I think it would be a whole different picture. But that investigation simply was not done, and I think the standard for good cause requires me to find or determine whether there was a prosecution of the claim with the degree of diligence of an ordinary prudent person. <em>I think an ordinary prudent person would have done some investigation and none was done for over eight and a half years, according to the evidence in the record.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">I just simply cannot find good cause on the record in this case. And accordingly, and for these reasons and reluctantly, the Court will deny the motion to waive the requirement of timely notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Appellant filed a Motion for Reconsideration on February 28, 2003, in which she again asked the court to reconsider whether good cause' excused her failure to timely notify the County of the claim. In addition, she asserted, for the first time, that the notice requirement was unconstitutional as applied to minors. The court denied the motion on April 2, 2003, without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">The court dismissed the case based on appellant\u2019s failure to satisfy the notice requirement of the LGTCA. Therefore, before we address the parties\u2019 contentions, it is helpful to review the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Housing Auth. v. Bennett, </em>359 Md. 356, 358, 754 A.2d 367 (2000), \u201c[u]ntil the twentieth century, local governments generally had no immunity under Maryland common law in either tort or in contract actions.\u201d In the early twentieth century, however, the Court of Appeals recognized that local governments had \u201cimmunity in certain types of tort actions based on activity categorized as \u2018governmental\u2019 but had no immunity in tort actions based on activity categorized as \u2018private\u2019 or \u2018corporate\u2019 or \u2018proprietary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 754 A.2d 367. Thus, \u201cshaped largely by judicial decisions and by statutes dealing with specific agencies or specific matters,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 358, 754 A.2d 367, local governments enjoyed limited immunity from tort liability for \u201cnon-constitutional torts based on activity categorized as \u2018governmental.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361, 754 A.2d 367. <em>See DiPino v. Davis, </em>354 Md. 18, 47, 729 A.2d 354 (1999) (\u201cA local governmental entity is liable for its torts if the tortious conduct occurs while the entity is acting in a private or proprietary capacity, but, unless its immunity is legislatively waived, it is immune from liability for tortious conduct committed while the entity is acting in a governmental capacity.\u201d); <em>Baltimore Police Department v. Cherkes, </em>140 Md.App. 282, 314, 780 A.2d 410 (2001)(stating that \u201clocal governmental bodies have common law governmental immunity only for acts that are governmental, and not for private or proprietary acts, and they do not have immunity from liability for State constitutional torts.\u201d); <em>see also Harford County v. Town of Bel Air, </em>348 Md. 363, 373, 704 A.2d 421 (1998); <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 101, 660 A.2d 447 (1995). Although the governmental immunity enjoyed by counties and municipalities \u201cderived from the State\u2019s sovereign immunity,\u201d it was \u201cmuch narrower than the immunity of the State.\u201d <em>Board of Educ. v. Town of Riverdale, </em>320 Md. 384, 390, 578 A.2d 207 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The local government immunity landscape changed in 1987, with the enactment of the LGTCA, codified at C.J. \u00a7\u00a7 5-301 through 5-304. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1, Ch. 594 of the Acts of 1987. With the enactment of the LGTCA, the Legislature sought to provide \u201ca remedy for those injured by local government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>officers and employees, acting without malice in the scope of their employment, while ensuring that the financial burden of compensation is carried by the local government ultimately responsible for the public officials\u2019 acts.\u201d <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. at 108, 660 A.2d 447; <em>see Faulk v. Ewing, </em>371 Md. 284, 298, 808 A.2d 1262 (2002); <em>Moore v. Norouzi, </em>371 Md. 154, 165-66, 807 A.2d 632 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Nevertheless, \u201cthe LGTCA does not waive governmental immunity or otherwise authorize any [direct] actions directly against local governments.... \u201d <em>Williams v. Maynard, </em>359 Md. 379, 394, 754 A.2d 379 (2000); <em>see Cherkes, </em>140 Md.App. at 318, 780 A.2d 410; <em>Nam v. Montgomery County, </em>127 Md.App. 172, 183-84, 732 A.2d 356 (1999); <em>Williams v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>112 Md.App. 526, 552, 685 A.2d 884 (1996); <em>Khawaja v. City of Rockville, </em>89 Md.App. 314, 325, 598 A.2d 489 (1991). Pursuant to C.J. \u00a7 5-303, local governments are responsible for payment of any judgments. As Judge Eldridge explained for the Court in <em>Bennett, </em>359 Md. at 357-58, 754 A.2d 367, the Act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">makes all entities defined therein as \u201clocal governments\u201d responsible for the legal defense of their employees, and liable for judgments for compensatory damages rendered against their employees, in suits against the employees based on tortious acts committed in the scope of their governmental employment. In addition, the LGTCA prohibits local governments from asserting the defense of governmental immunity to avoid this responsibility and liability, and it establishes monetary caps per individual claim and occurrence on the recoverable damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\"><em>See also Cherkes, </em>140 Md.App. at 317, 780 A.2d 410 (summarizing the significant features of the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In order to pursue a claim for unliquidated damages pursuant to the LGTCA, the claimant must comply with the notice requirement set forth in C.J. \u00a7 5-304. It requires a potential plaintiff to notify potential local government defendants of impending claims within 180 days of the injury. Timeliness is only one feature of the provision. C.J. \u00a7 5-304 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\u00a7 5-304. Actions for unliquidated damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">(a) <em>Notice </em>Required.\u2014Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, an action for unliquidated damages may not be brought against a local government or its employees unless the notice of the claim required by this section is given within 180 days after the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">(b) <em>Manner of giving </em>notice.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">(3) The notice shall be in writing and shall state the time, place, and cause of the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">(c) <em>Waiver of notice </em>requirement.\u2014Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, unless the defendant can affirmatively show that its defense has been prejudiced by lack of required notice, upon motion and for good cause shown the court may entertain the suit even though the required notice was not given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">As the Court explained in <em>Moore v. Norouzi, </em>371 Md. at 167-68, 807 A.2d 632, the Act\u2019s notice requirement is designed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYO\">\u201cto protect the ... counties of the State from meretricious claimants and exaggerated claims by providing a mechanism whereby the ... county would be apprised of its possible liability at a time when it could conduct its own investigation, <em>i.e., </em>while the evidence was still fresh and the recollection of the witnesses was undiminished by time, \u2018sufficient to ascertain the character and extent of the injury and its responsibility in connection with it.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">(Citations omitted). Among other things, the notice provision enables a governmental defendant to budget properly, to set aside appropriate reserves, and to account for payment of claims under complex accounting rules and tax statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Interestingly, the notice requirement did not originate with the Act. When the General Assembly enacted the LGTCA, it repealed the version of the notice statute then codified in Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol., 1986 Supp.), C.J. \u00a7 5-306. The LGTCA merely recodified, with modifications, the notice requirement that previously \u201cexisted under the prior law which was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>pealed by Ch. 594.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>359 Md. at 363, 754 A.2d 367. The change was largely semantic. Instead of applying to actions \u201cbrought against a county or municipal corporation,\u201d the new notice requirement applies to actions \u201cbrought against a local government or its employees.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>359 Md. at 391, 754 A.2d 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">In <em>Bartens v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>293 Md. 620, 446 A.2d 1136 (1982), and later in <em>Williams v. Maynard, </em>359 Md. 379, 754 A.2d 379, the Court traced the history of the notice requirement that is now found in the LGTCA, and showed that the notice required by the Act is \u201c \u2018substantially unchanged through its various amendments\u2019 insofar as it \u2018require[d] the claimant to relate the time, place, and circumstances of the alleged injury....\u2019\u201d <em>Williams, </em>359 Md. at 389, 754 A.2d 379 (quoting <em>Bartens, </em>293 Md. at 626, 446 A.2d 1136). Over the years, the amendments to the notice requirement merely</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">involved such matters as \u201cthe number of municipalities and counties covered\u201d and \u201cthe length of notice required.\u201d <em>[Bartens,] </em>293 Md. at 625, 446 A.2d at 1138.... By Ch. 519 of the Acts of 1972, the General Assembly extended the notice statute to all counties and municipal corporations in the State and imposed a uniform time of 180 days within which notice had to be given. By the same Act, the General Assembly added the \u201cescape clause\u201d to the notice statute, whereby a plaintiff who did not comply with the notice requirement could nevertheless maintain his or her action, provided that the plaintiff could show good cause and that the defendant could not show that it had been prejudiced by the lack of notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\"><em>Williams, </em>359 Md. at 389, 754 A.2d 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Thus, the importance of timely and adequate notice long precedes the adoption of the Act; the decisional law cited above highlights that the notice requirement is a central feature of the LGTCA. As Judge Eldridge observed for the Court in <em>Williams, </em>359 Md. at 390, 754 A.2d 379, some sixteen years prior to the passage of the LGTCA, the \u201cCourt had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>applied the requirements of the notice statute to tort actions brought against counties and municipal corporations regardless of whether these local governments were liable under state common law or by virtue of a statutory waiver of governmental immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Courts must construe the LGTCA\u2019s notice requirement consistent with its plain meaning, and consistent -with its long history. The <em>Williams </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">The plain language of \u00a7 5-304 of the LGTCA indicates a legislative intent to make the notice requirement broadly applicable to tort actions brought directly against local governments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">Although the General Assembly made several substantive amendments to other sections of the proposed LGTCA before enacting the legislation in 1987, the Legislature made no substantive amendments to the notice section [proposed by the County Attorneys Strategy Workshop, which drafted the proposed Act in 1985], In addition, the bill files maintained by the Department of Legislative Services contain <em>m indication that the General Assembly intended \u00a7 5-SOU to mean other than what the legislation\u2019s sponsors proposed or the plain language of the enacted statute suggests. </em>Thus, what is today \u00a7 5-304 is substantively identical to the draft proposed by the LGTCA\u2019s sponsors in 1985. Moreover, while \u00a7 5-304 extends the scope of the notice requirement to actions brought against all entities deemed local governments under the LGTCA, and to the actions brought against local governmental employees for which the LGTCA makes local governments liable to provide a legal defense and to pay judgments for compensatory damages, it fully encompasses the scope of the former notice statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 391-92, 754 A.2d 379 (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Significantly, the Court has characterized the notice requirement as a \u201ccondition[] precedent\u201d to maintaining a subsequent legal action.\u201d <em>Faulk, </em>371 Md. at 304, 808 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>1262. Of import here, the notice requirement operates independent of the limitations period that applies generally to the filing of suit. Serving timely notice is essential to preserve a claimant\u2019s right to file suit at any time during the limitations period. In contrast to the tolling of limitations, nothing in the LGTCA expressly provides for tolling the notice period. <em>See Amer. Gen. Assur. Co. v. Pappano, </em>374 Md. 339, 351, 822 A.2d 1212 (2003); <em>Piselli v. 75th Street Medical, </em>371 Md. 188, 215, 808 A.2d 508 (2002); <em>Frederick Road Ltd. Ptshp. v.

Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, </em>187 Md. 67, 77, 48 A.2d 593 (1946), overruled on other grounds as stated in <em>Arnold v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>270 Md. 285, 311 A.2d 223 (1973), the notice requirement derives from the Legislature\u2019s authority to grant or deny an individual the right to pursue a legal action against a municipal corporation. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">When the Legislature creates a municipal corporation as part of the machinery of government of the State, it is within its province to adjust the relative rights of the corporation and the citizens. The Legislature has thus the power to enact a statute requiring that, before suit for damages shall be instituted against a municipal corporation, a written notice of the claim shall be presented to the municipal authorities within a specified period after injury or damage is sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-6\"><em>Neuenschwander, </em>187 Md. at 76, 48 A.2d 593 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">There are circumstances when a litigant is excused from strict compliance with the various aspects of the notice obligation. The Court of Appeals has recognized that \u201cthe purpose of the notice statute was fulfilled by substantial compliance with the statutory requirements.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>359 Md. at 390, 754 A.2d 379; <em>see Grubbs v.

In <em>Faulk, </em>371 Md. at 299, 808 A.2d 1262, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">Where the purpose of the notice requirements is fulfilled, but not necessarily in a manner technically compliant with all of the terms of the statute, this Court has found such substantial compliance to satisfy the statute. <em>Moore, </em>371 Md. at 171-72, 807 A.2d 632; <em>Maynard, </em>359 Md. at 389-90, 754 A.2d 379; <em>Jackson, </em>233 Md. at 167, 195 A.2d 693. Substantial compliance \u201crequires some effort to provide the requisite notice and, in fact, it must be provided, albeit not in strict compliance with the statutory provision.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>371 Md. [at] 171[, 807 A.2d 632]. <em>See also Williams v. Montgomery County, </em>123 Md.App. 119, 131, 716 A.2d 1100 (1998), <em>aff'd sub nom. Williams v.

Under C.J. \u00a7 5-304(c), the plaintiff has the burden to establish good cause to excuse the failure to comply with the notice requirement, <em>and </em>to show that the defendant will suffer no prejudice even if there is good cause. <em>Heron v.

Ms. Rios insists that she established good cause \u201cdue to excusable neglect or mistake,\u201d because she had no knowledge, or reason to know, that the Clinic was a County facility or that Dr. Footer worked for the County when he delivered Luis. According to appellant, she had no contact with Dr. Footer until the delivery at the Hospital, and \u201cwas not aware that [the County] had played any role in causing her son\u2019s injuries.\u201d Moreover, because appellant paid Holy Cross, a private institution, rather than the County, appellant maintains that she had no reason to suspect that Dr. Footer was a County employee. Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">[N]o medical record or document of any sort has been produced ... that describes \u201cProject Delivery\u201d or demonstrates that Appellant was given notice that her delivery was being performed by a physician employed by the County, as she did not receive prenatal care from Dr. Footer at the clinic in Rockville. Similarly, there is no documentation in any of the medical records that would place an attorney evaluating this case on notice, even inquiry notice, that Dr. Footer was employed by the County at the time he performed Luis\u2019 delivery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">In addition, appellant contends that she exercised the same \u201cdegree of diligence\u201d in prosecuting her claim that \u201can ordinarily prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.... \u201d She adds: \u201cAn ordinarily prudent person under these circumstances ... would not have suspected that Montgomery County, Maryland played a role in the delivery nor that, as a result, the County should be put on notice of a claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Furthermore, appellant considers it significant that, under C.J. \u00a7 5-109, the statute of limitations \u201cdoes not commence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>until Luis reaches the age of eighteen, or until December 31, 2009.\u201d Therefore, she asserts that it is \u201can unreasonable burden\u201d to expect someone in her situation to obtain counsel, conduct an investigation, and give notice within six months of the occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">While it is undisputed that appellant was unaware that the Clinic was a County facility or that Dr. Footer was a County employee when he delivered Luis, appellees maintain that appellant\u2019s delay in providing notice was unreasonable. They contend that appellant had a duty to investigate, and complain that she failed to act \u201cwith reasonable diligence in seeking to learn the doctor\u2019s identity and who he worked for\u201d; and she failed to show good cause to justify the delay. In support of their position, appellees assert that the diligence standard must be considered \u201cin light of the goal of the LGTCA\u2014to promote prompt investigations and evaluations of liability by local governments.\u201d Because Ms. Rios failed to exercise ordinary diligence \u201cto discern the doctor\u2019s employment,\u201d appellees insist that the court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying her request to waive the statutory requirement of timely notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Appellees also point out that Ms. Rios was alerted to the County\u2019s involvement because she signed a health form at the clinic, in Spanish, which contained the words \u201cMontgomery County Government\u201d in large letters at the top. Further, they note that the prenatal clinic was \u201cstaffed with Spanish interpreters\u201d and had other \u201cCounty markings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In addition, appellees insist that \u201cignorance of the doctor\u2019s employment does not establish good cause.\u201d They state: \u201cNot only did Ms. Rios have information from which she could have discerned the County\u2019s role in this case within the notice period, but she has provided no indication of having tried to determine who the doctor worked for within a reasonable time of delivering her child. Having undertaken no affirmative act to pursue her claim,\u201d appellees assert that \u201cMs. Rios did not show good cause for failing to comply with the notice requirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Several cases that have discussed the interrelated issues of substantial compliance and good cause inform our analysis. We turn to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In <em>Heron, </em>361 Md. at 260-61, 761 A.2d 56, the plaintiff brought suit against Prince George\u2019s County under the LGTCA, claiming malicious prosecution, false arrest, and false imprisonment. The case arose from the plaintiffs arrest on several charges on August 24, 1997; he was acquitted of all the charges on March 3, 1998. <em>Id. </em>at 261, 761 A.2d 56. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a notice of claim under the Act on April 30, 1998. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals held that the notice of claim was untimely as to the false arrest and false imprisonment claims, and that the plaintiff lacked good cause for the late filing. <em>Id. </em>But, it found that the notice was timely as to the malicious prosecution claim, <em>id., </em>because that cause of action did not accrue until the acquittal. <em>Id. </em>at 265, 761 A.2d 56. With regard to the belated notice, the Court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that \u201cthe pendency of a criminal case was not sufficient to constitute good cause for late filing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, 761 A.2d 56. The Court agreed with the trial judge that \u201can ordinarily prudent person, in Petitioner\u2019s circumstances, would have been able, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, to file such a Notice of Claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In its discussion of good cause, the Court considered the kinds of factors that have generally been found to constitute good cause for a belated notice. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">While courts generally consider a combination of factors, circumstances that have been found to constitute good cause fit into several broad categories: [1] excusable neglect or mistake (generally determined in reference to a reasonably prudent person standard), [2] serious physical or mental injury and/or location out-of-state, [3] the inability to retain counsel in cases involving complex litigation, and [4] ignorance of the statutory notice requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 272, 761 A.2d 56 (footnotes and internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">In a footnote in <em>Heron, </em>361 Md. at 272 n. 13, 761 A.2d 56, the <em>Heron </em>Court cited our decision in <em>Williams v. Montgomery County, </em>123 Md.App. 119, 716 A.2d 1100 (1998), for the proposition that this Court \u201chas specifically rejected ignorance of the law requiring notice as good cause.\u201d Thereafter, in <em>Hargrove, </em>146 Md.App. at 467, 807 A.2d 149, we discussed <em>Heron, </em>noting that the <em>Heron </em>Court \u201creaffirmed that Maryland has specifically rejected the ignorance of the law requirement as good cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In the consolidated case of <em>Moore v. Norouzi, </em>371 Md. at 159, 807 A.2d 632, the claimants were injured in motor vehicle accidents allegedly caused by employees of Montgomery County. Although they provided timely notice of their claims, the notices were not provided directly to the County, in the manner directed by the statute. <em>Id. See </em>LGTCA, \u00a7 5-304(b)(l)(iii). Instead, they sent notice to Trigon Administrators, Inc. (\u201cTrigon\u201d), a third-party administrator retained by the County pursuant to a contract. <em>Id. </em>The Court considered whether \u201cnotice to a third-party claims administrator, acting on behalf of a local government,\u201d constituted strict or substantial compliance with the notice requirements of LGTCA \u00a7 5-304. <em>Id. </em>at 158, 807 A.2d 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The Court concluded that, based on the nature of the County\u2019s system of claims administration, coupled with the control that the County exercised over Trigon\u2019s activities, the plaintiffs substantially complied with the statutory notice requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 177, 807 A.2d 632. In reaching that conclusion, the Court reasoned that \u201c[sjubstantial compliance turns on ensuring that the County [or local government] has sufficient actual notice to perform a proper and timely investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 807 A.2d 632.

In our view, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Westfarm </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Westfarm Associates Limited Partnership (\u201cWestfarm\u201d), a developer, owned land adjacent to a sewer owned by Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (\u201cWSSC\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 673. In 1991, when Westfarm was about to sell its land, it discovered the presence of a toxic chemical on its land. <em>Id. </em>As a result, Westfarm engaged in extensive testing to ascertain the source of the contamination, and concluded that it came from an adjacent landowner, the International Fabricare Institute (\u00abIFI\u201d), which had, until 1974, operated a commercial dry-cleaning facility. <em>Id. </em>at 674. In January 1992, Westfarm sued IFI for polluting its property. <em>Id. </em>In November 1992, IFI sought leave to file a third party complaint against WSSC, and WSSC was added as a party in January 1993. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, Westfarm amended its complaint to add WSSC as a defendant, based on common law and statutory causes of action. <em>Id. </em>During discovery in April 1993, a video camera was used to inspect WSSC\u2019s sewer system, constructed in 1968. <em>Id. </em>It revealed a variety of defects that caused leakage of the toxic chemicals onto Westfarm\u2019s property. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">WSSC moved to dismiss the complaint claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that, under the LGTCA, WSSC is treated as a local government and entity, and Westfarm failed to provide timely notice of its claims pursuant to the requirements of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 676. The federal district court waived the notice requirement on the ground that Westfarm had shown good cause for the delay and WSSC was not prejudiced. <em>Id. </em>Among other things, the jury later ruled against WSSC in regard to West-farm\u2019s negligence claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">On appeal, the Fourth Circuit ruled: \u201cUnder these circumstances, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>to have found that Westfarm exercised reasonable diligence, and thus had shown \u2018good cause\u2019 for waiving the LGTCA notice requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677. Pointing to Westfarm\u2019s prompt and vigorous efforts to determine the source of the contamination, the court reasoned: \u201cIn the instant case, the circumstances involved environmental contamination, the source and causation of which typically require lengthy investigation for even an extraordinarily diligent person to discern.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Although the medical malpractice case of <em>Gould v.

He was treated by two doctors who were federal employees, both of whom were assigned to work at the Health Center. <em>Id. </em>One was a civilian member of the United States Public Health Service, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), and the other was a commissioned officer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Gould died from the illness on September 4, 1980. <em>Id. </em>Three years later, the attorney for Gould\u2019s wife ascertained that the attending physicians were federal employees. <em>Id. </em>On September 2, 1983, \u201cwithin hours of the expiration of the claim under Maryland\u2019s three-year statute of limitations,\u201d <em>id., </em>Gould\u2019s wife, on behalf of herself and her children, filed claims against the doctors with the Health Claims Arbitration Board, claiming negligence in failing to diagnose the illness. <em>Id. </em>at 740-41. The claims were dismissed in December 1985, because the doctors were not subject to suit in a state forum. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In the meantime, in August 1985, because the doctors were employed with the United States Public Health Service, the plaintiffs filed an administrative tort claim with HHS, alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>negligence by the doctors \u201cin failing to expeditiously diagnose and treat\u201d Mr. Gould. <em>Id. </em>That claim was denied in August 1986, on the ground that it was barred by the statute of limitations applicable to claims prosecuted under the Federal Tort Claims Act (the \u201cFederal Act\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, in 1987, the plaintiffs instituted a malpractice suit in federal court in 1987 against HHS under the Federal Act, claiming a failure to diagnose. <em>Id. </em>The court granted the defense motion for summary judgment, on the ground that the suit was time barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">On appeal, appellants claimed that because they had no knowledge that the attending doctors were federal employees, limitations should be tolled until the time when they discovered that the physicians were federal employees. <em>Id. </em>They argued that \u201cthe exercise of due diligence would not have revealed this fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fourth Circuit disagreed. <em>Id. </em>It held that the statute of limitations began to run when Mr. Gould died because, at that time, Mrs. Gould was aware of the attending physicians\u2019 identities and could have investigated and discovered their employment status within the period of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In reaching its decision, the Fourth Circuit noted that Congress \u201cconditioned\u201d a \u201climited waiver of sovereign immunity\u201d on \u201cthe prompt presentation of tort claims against the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 742. Citing <em>United States v. Kubrick, </em>444 U.S. 111, 117, 100 S.Ct. 352, 62 L.Ed.2d 259 (1979), the Fourth Circuit said, 905 F.2d at 742: \u201cThe Supreme Court, in recognizing this balance, has instructed the judiciary to abstain from extending or narrowing \u00a7 2401(b) beyond that which Congress intended and thereby defeating its obvious purpose.\u201d The court continued, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">Applying these principles, federal courts with few exceptions have dismissed complaints where a plaintiff failed to file a claim with the appropriate federal agency within the two-year limitations period, even in cases where the plaintiffs failure to submit a claim in a timely manner was the result of the plaintiffs ignorance of the defendant\u2019s status as a federal employee. <em>Flickinger v. United States, </em>523 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>F.Supp. 1372, 1375 (W.D.Pa.1981). Courts have held that despite the harsh impact of this rule on plaintiffs, <em>Wilkinson v. United States, </em>677 F.2d 998, 1001 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 906, 103 S.Ct. 209, 74 L.Ed.2d 167 (1982), and \u201cstrong equitable considerations notwithstanding, the two-year limitation period of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b) cannot be tolled or waived.\u201d <em>Lien v. Beehner, </em>453 F.Supp. 604, 606 (N.D.N.Y.1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Significantly, the Fourth Circuit rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that \u201ca claim does not accrue until a plaintiff learns the legal identity of the alleged tort-feasor as a federal employee/ <em>Id. </em>at 743. The court held, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\"><em>IPJlaintiffs\u2019 claim accrued </em>... <em>on September b, 1980, upon the death of Gary Francis Gould. Plaintiffs at this time were aware of the existence of the injury and its cause, including the identity and conduct of attending physicians. This sufficiently armed plaintiffs with the \u201ccritical facts\u201d to investigate the claim and present it within the two-year statute of limitations.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Ms. Rios insists that <em>Gould </em>is not controlling, because it was based upon the statute of limitations under the Federal Act, rather than the notice requirement under the LGTCA. Although <em>Gould </em>is not precisely on point, we believe that the key facts are similar, and its rationale compels the conclusion that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that appellant did not establish good cause to excuse her long delay in providing the required statutory notice. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">At or about the time of Luis\u2019s birth, appellant certainly knew that Luis was injured. She was also aware of the doctor who delivered Luis, even though she did not know his name or employer. Because appellant was \u201con notice that there may have been an invasion of ... legal rights ...\u201d by the doctor, it was incumbent upon her to \u201cinvestigate....\u201d <em>Gould, </em>905 F.2d at 744. Even with a modest effort, Ms. Rios was armed with sufficient information to ascertain Dr. Footer\u2019s identity and the identity of his employer. The burden was on Ms. Rios \u201cto discover the employment status of the tort-feasor and to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>suit within the applicable limitations period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745. Yet, despite appellant\u2019s \u201caffirmative duty\u201d to investigate, she did not exercise due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Importantly, this case does not involve a claim that appellant\u2019s effort to ascertain the doctor\u2019s employment status was thwarted by the County, or that anyone sought \u201cto mislead or deceive\u201d or \u201chide\u201d the doctor\u2019s status as a County employee. <em>Id. </em>at 745. The <em>Gould </em>Court reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 745-76:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">It will not suffice for plaintiffs to assert baldly that \u201ceven due diligence would not have discovered the fact that the physicians\u201d were federal employees. The burden is on plaintiffs to show that due diligence was exercised and that critical information, reasonable investigation notwithstanding, was undiscoverable.[ ] No evidence was offered to support the assertion that \u201ccritical facts\u201d were undiscoverable.... No impediment, other than plaintiffs\u2019 inaction, shielded the physicians\u2019 legal identity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Accordingly, we agree with the circuit court that appellant\u2019s failure to make any inquiry whatsoever as to the doctor\u2019s identity or employment status does not comport with good cause. In stark contrast to <em>Westfarm, </em>in which the claimant immediately, diligently, and vigorously sought to investigate the source of pollution, years went by before appellant made any effort whatsoever to determine Dr. Footer\u2019s identity and employment status. Moreover, in this case, unlike in <em>West-farm, </em>it would not have required much effort to obtain the requisite information. Applying a reasonably prudent person standard, Ms. Rios did not demonstrate that she exercised a modicum of diligence. Were we to overlook appellant\u2019s failure to act for a period of almost ten years, it would be hard to conceive of any basis on which to ever uphold the notice requirement that is an integral part of the LGTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">In sum, we cannot improve upon what the <em>Gould </em>court said in rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 limitations argument; the same reasoning applies here with respect to the notice requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AME\">We are not unmindful that a strict adherence to the requirements of the statute of limitations provision under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the FTCA often works a substantial hardship on plaintiffs and may have a harsh impact on a party innocent of any impropriety. Statutes of limitations often make it impossible to enforce what are otherwise valid claims. Although we recognize the hardship resulting to the plaintiffs in this ease, we have no choice but to apply the law as written. To accept plaintiffs\u2019 arguments would be re-writing the FTCA to allow broad, open-ended exceptions to \u00a7\u00a7 2675(a) and 2401(b). <em>Flickinger, </em>523 F.Supp. at 1376-77. \u201cAlthough exceptions to the applicability of the limitations period might occasionally be desirable, we are not free to enlarge that consent to be sued which the Government, through Congress, has undertaken so carefully to limit.\u201d <em>Mann v. United States, </em>399 F.2d 672, 673 (9th Cir.1968). <em>See also Wollman [v. Gross </em>], 637 F.2d [544,] 549 [ (8th Cir.1980) ]. As the Supreme Court has instructed, it is clearly the prerogative of Congress, not the judiciary, to reform the terms and scope of waiver of sovereign immunity beyond that which Congress intended. <em>Kubrick, </em>444 U.S. at 117-19, 100 S.Ct. 352.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\">\u201cIt goes without saying,\u201d as the <em>Kubrick </em>Court observed, \u201cthat statutes of limitations often make it impossible to enforce what were otherwise perfectly valid claims.\u201d <em>Kubrick, </em>444 U.S. at 125, 100 S.Ct. 352. Yet, they serve important, well-established purposes affirmed throughout our jurisprudence. We are bound to give them effect until such time as the creator of such provisions, the legislative branch, exercises its prerogative to amend the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><em>Gould, </em>905 F.2d at 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Ms. Rios attempted to circumvent the court\u2019s ruling as to good cause by raising in her motion to reconsider, for the first time, the claim that the notice requirement of the LGTCA is unconstitutional as applied to minors. She theorized that the notice requirement \u201cunreasonably restricts a minor\u2019s remedy and access to the courts,\u201d in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and \u201cirrationally denies minors the equal protection of the laws,\u201d in violation of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The court denied the motion, without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">On appeal, appellant reiterates that the LGTCA denies minors the equal protection of the laws. She argues: \u201cThe Act creates a cause of action for both minors and adults but denies minors the ability to pursue this cause of action on their own due to impossibility.\u201d Noting that \u201ca child is disabled from bringing a tort action until he or she is 18 years old,\u201d appellant contends, in effect, that the child\u2019s right to do so becomes hollow in the context of a claim under the LGTCA, because an infant could never personally provide the requisite notice. Thus, she suggests that strict application of the notice requirement would defeat a child\u2019s lawful right to bring suit when the child reaches majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Appellant concedes that \u201cage is not a suspect classification, and the notice requirement of the Local Government Tort Claims Act is, therefore, subject to rational basis scrutiny. <em>See Gregory v. Ashcroft, </em>501 U.S. 452, 470, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991).\u201d But, she asserts that \u201cthere is no rational basis for requiring a minor to give notice of a claim under the Local Government Tort Claims Act before he/she reaches six months of age in order to pursue a cause of action created by the very same Act. The Act does not levy any such impossible requirements upon adults, and its application to minors is clearly irrational.\u201d Further, Ms. Rios states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8W\">\u201c \u2018It is well settled that when a person negligently injures a minor two separate causes of action arise; the minor child has a cause of action for injuries suffered by it, and the parent or parents of the minor child have a cause of action for loss of services and for medical expenses incurred by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>parent for treatment of the minor\u2019s injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garay v. Overholtzer, </em>332 Md. 339, 346, 631 A.2d 429 (1993). Additionally, it is well settled that \u201c \u2018a child is disabled from bringing a tort action until he or she is 18 years old.\u2019 \u201d <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 208, 808 A.2d 508. <em>The Local Government Tort Claims Act creates a cause of action against a local government entity provided that the claimant complies with its notice requirement. Common sense dictates that a six-month-old cannot give notice of his/her claim. The Act, therefore, forecloses a minor\u2019s ability to pursue the cause of action created by it after attaining the age of majority if his/her parent or parents were irwapabls of giving the required notice. </em>As applied to adults, however, the Act clearly does not foreclose their ability to pursue the cause of action created by it, as it is possible for them to comply with its terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In support of her claim that the notice requirement places \u201cunreasonable restrictions upon a minor\u2019s remedy and the minor\u2019s access to the courts,\u201d appellant relies on <em>Piselli v. 75th Street Medical, </em>371 Md. 188, 808 A.2d 508 (2002). In <em>P\u00fcelli, </em>the minor\u2019s father noticed that his son was walking in an unusual manner; the boy, who was almost eleven years of age, complained of pain in his hip. <em>Id. </em>at 194, 808 A.2d 508. On August 2, 1993, a doctor at the medical center diagnosed the son with a pulled hamstring muscle, prescribed ibuprofen and cold compresses, and instructed the father to return with his son if his condition did not improve in a few days. <em>Id. </em>at 195, 808 A.2d 508. Three days later, while at the beach, the boy was injured when a wave knocked him over. <em>Id. </em>He suffered extensive injuries, including damage to the growth plate in his leg. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">On July 24, 1998, the Pisellis filed suit in federal court against the medical center and the treating physician. <em>Id. </em>at 196, 808 A.2d 508. The defendants moved for summary judgment based on limitations, but the court denied the motion, finding a \u201cgenuine factual dispute\u201d as to when the injury should have been discovered. <em>Id. </em>The jury found for the</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>treating physician and against the medical center, but the court then ruled as a matter of law that the action was barred by limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 197, 808 A.2d 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">On appeal, the Fourth Circuit certified the following question of law to the Maryland Court of Appeals, <em>id. </em>at 198, 808 A.2d 508:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">\u201c[W]hether, when a claim is brought by parents on behalf of a child who was injured before reaching age eleven, the three-year statute of limitations of section 5-109(a)(2) [of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article] begins to accrue upon the discovery of the injury by the child or upon discovery of the injury by the parents.\u201d[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0J\">The Court of Appeals recognized that \u201c[s]everal restrictions upon traditional remedies or access to the courts have been upheld under Article 19 as reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 808 A.2d 508. Observing that \u201cthe application of several traditional immunities from suit has been upheld in the face of Article 19 challenges,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 207, 808 A.2d 508, the Court nevertheless held that the time limitation prescribed by C.J. \u00a7 5-109 violated Article 19 as applied to a minor\u2019s tort claim; it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>constituted an \u201cunreasonable burden\u201d upon a minor\u2019s remedy and the minor\u2019s access to the courts. <em>Id. </em>at 215, 808 A.2d 508. The Court reasoned: \u201cIn our view, mandating that the three and five-year limitations periods run against a minor\u2019s tort claim from the time the minor is 11 years old, or under a few circumstances 16 years old, is an unreasonable restriction upon a child\u2019s remedy and the child\u2019s access to the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court continued, <em>id. </em>at 215-16, 808 A.2d 508:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\">[A] child is disabled from bringing a tort action until he or she is 18 years old [, and] a child\u2019s action must be brought by the parents on the minor child\u2019s behalf. Thus, if the parents are dilatory and fail to sue on behalf of the child, the three and five-year periods applicable to most child medical malpractice claims will expire, at the latest, when the child is 16 years old-two years before the child is able to bring an action [on his own]. With regard to the very limited types of medical malpractice claims set forth in subsection (c), when the time periods run from the age of 16, the child could have only one year after majority to bring the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Referring to the case of <em>Johns Hopkins Hospital v. Pepper, </em>346 Md. 679, 697, 697 A.2d 1358 (1997),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the <em>Piselli </em>Court added, 371 Md. at 216, 808 A.2d 508:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>We emphasized in <em>Pepper </em>that, if the parents\u2019 failure to bring a claim before the expiration of limitations had the effect of barring the minor child\u2019s claim, \u201cthe child would be twice victimized\u2014once at the hands of the tortfeasor, and once by parents who, for whatever reason, failed to timely prosecute [the] claims.\u201d 346 Md. at 695, 697 A.2d 1358. The Court continued: \u201cWe cannot countenance a result that would leave the only innocent victim in such a transaction uncompensated for his or her injuries\u201d and that such a result was contrary to \u201c[p]ublic policy and justice,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>To this, we need only add that barring an injured child\u2019s medical malpractice claim before the child is able to bring an action is an unreasonable restriction upon the child\u2019s right to a remedy and access to the courts guaranteed by Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Appellant argues that the reasoning in <em>Piselli </em>applies here. She asserts that \u201cthe notice requirement of the Local Government Tort Claims Act should be found to be an \u2018unreasonable restriction upon a child\u2019s remedy and the child\u2019s access to the courts,\u2019 \u201d because the notice requirement of the Act, while not a statute of limitations, unreasonably \u201crestricts a child\u2019s access to the courts when the required notice has not been given.\u201d She adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">Similar to Section 5-109, the notice requirement bars a minor\u2019s claim against a local governmental entity before the minor is able to give the required notice, and it is also similarly unreasonable and unrealistic to rely upon the minor\u2019s parents to give the required notice in the minor\u2019s stead. ' In light of the recent finding by the Court of Appeals in <em>Piselli, </em>this Court should find that the notice requirement of the Local Government Tort Claims Act is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>unconstitutional under Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Appellees respond that \u201c[m]inors have the same access to the courts as any other claimant\u2014all claimants must serve notice on a local government to protect their ability to file suit within the applicable statute of limitations (which usually runs past the notice period).\u201d They also assert that the LGTCA notice provision is not unconstitutional, because C.J. \u00a7 5-304(b) permits a \u201crepresentative of the claimant\u201d to serve notice on the claimant\u2019s behalf, thus protecting the rights of the claimant. Appellees do not discuss <em>Piselli, </em>however, beyond the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Piselli v. 75th Street Medical, </em>371 Md. 188, 808 A.2d 508 (2002), is inapposite to this appeal, because the case focused only on the statute of limitations prescribed by Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5\u2014109\u2014it did not address the notice requirement [under the Act],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Instead, appellees contend that <em>Johnson v. Maryland State Police, </em>331 Md. 285, 628 A.2d 162 (1993), controls this case. In <em>Johnson, </em>two sixteen-year-old girls were injured when their vehicle collided with a State Police car responding to a call. <em>Id. </em>at 288, 628 A.2d 162. The teens filed claims against the State thirteen months after the accident, pursuant to the Maryland Tort Claims Act (\u201cMTCA\u201d). <em>Id. </em>The statute in effect at the time, Md.Code (1984, 1993 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-106(b)(1) of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d), had a notice requirement that provided that no tort action could be filed against the State unless \u201cthe claimant submits a written claim to the Treasurer or a designee of the Treasurer within 180 days after the injury to person or property that is the basis of the claim.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 288-89, 628 A.2d 162. Because the plaintiffs failed to file the requisite notice within the statutory period, the circuit court dismissed the case. <em>Id. </em>at 289, 628 A.2d 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>On appeal, the teens argued that, because of their minority status at the time of the accident, the MTCA\u2019s 180-day notice requirement violated their constitutional rights to equal protection under the law and unreasonably restricted their right of access to the courts. <em>Id. </em>at 292, 628 A.2d 162. The Court of Appeals rejected that contention. <em>Id. </em>at 298, 628 A.2d 162. It explained that the MTCA\u2019s \u201cadministrative claim requirement is not a statute of limitations. Instead, it is \u2018a condition precedent to the initiation of an action under the Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290, 628 A.2d 162 <em>(quoting Simpson v. Moore, </em>323 Md. 215, 219, 592 A.2d 1090 (1991)). The Court said, <em>id. </em>at 296, 628 A.2d 162:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">The 180-day administrative claim requirement allows the State to predict its potential tort liability more accurately, so that it may enact a more accurate annual budget. In addition, the claim requirement enables the State to make early decisions on the merits of particular claims, and allows the State to take remedial safety measures more quickly, thereby minimizing the cost of litigation for the taxpayers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Of equal note, the Court rejected the appellants\u2019 claim under Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights that a minor\u2019s access to the courts is impaired by the notice requirement of the MTCA. <em>Id. </em>at 297, 628 A.2d 162. In its view, the statutory notice constituted a reasonable restriction that did not give rise to a constitutional violation. <em>Id. </em>As in <em>Gould, </em>the Court of Appeals focused on the Legislature\u2019s right to condition a waiver of sovereign immunity on compliance with the notice requirement. It said, <em>id. </em>at 297-98, 628 A.2d 162:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANB\">Article 19 has never been interpreted to mean that the State must allow itself, as such, to be sued at all.[ ] Before the State waived its governmental immunity, a person injured by the negligence of a State employee would have had an action in tort against that State employee personally, but would have had no action whatsoever against the State. The statutory scheme under attack substitutes the State, with its financial resources, as the defendant. In exchange for this benefit to potential plaintiffs, the Legislature has determined that the State must have prompt notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>claims against it. Thus, the State\u2019s waiver of immunity, although conditioned upon filing a claim within 180 days of the injury, benefits a potential plaintiff by assuring that any judgment eventually obtained will be satisfied. We cannot say that the administrative claim condition imposed on potential plaintiffs in actions against the State is unreasonable in light of the benefit to potential plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Thus, the <em>Johnson </em>Court agreed \u201cwith those cases holding that administrative claim requirements, in statutes waiving state governmental tort immunity, do not violate equal protection principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296, 628 A.2d 162. It explained that \u201c[wjhether, and to what extent, there should be state governmental immunity from tort suits has long been regarded as the prerogative of the Maryland General Assembly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The Court said, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">By enacting the Maryland Tort Claims Act, the General Assembly chose to allow some tort suits against the State. As the full application of sovereign immunity does not violate the federal and state constitutions, this partial or conditional waiver of sovereign immunity, retaining the same classification between victims of public torts and victims of private torts, but with less onerous consequences, does not violate constitutional equal protection principles ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">We agree with appellees that the rationale of <em>Johnson, </em>not <em>Piselli, </em>applies here. Although <em>Johnson </em>involved the MTCA, not the LGTCA, that is a distinction without a difference with respect to the notice issue raised by Rios.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">In adopting the rationale of <em>Johnson, </em>a ease involving the MTCA, we are mindful that the Court of Appeals has previously interpreted the LGTCA by reference to the MTCA. To illustrate, in <em>Heron v. Strader, supra, </em>361 Md. at 263, 761 A.2d 56, which involved the LGTCA, the Court construed the term \u201cinjury\u201d under the LGTCA consistent with its interpretation of that term under the MTCA. Citing <em>Haupt v. State, </em>340 Md. 462, 667 A.2d 179 (1995), and <em>Lopez v. Maryland State Highway Admin., </em>327 Md. 486, 610 A.2d 778 (1992), the <em>Heron </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Court said, 361 Md. at 263-64, 761 A.2d 56: \u201cWe now adopt the same interpretation of the time of the injury for the purposes of the notice requirement of the LGTCA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Moreover, <em>Piselli </em>is factually distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice, </em>because it involved a tort action against a private party, not a governmental entity, and it turned on C.J. \u00a7 5-109, titled \u201cActions against health care providers.\u201d Thus, the <em>Piselli </em>Court discussed limitations in the context of a common law tort action against a medical provider; it did not address a legislatively created right of suit against a local governmental entity, for which the Legislature has waived immunity conditioned upon the provision of notice of the claim within the statutorily prescribed period. <em>Cf. Baltimore County v. RTKL Associates, Inc., </em>380 Md. 670, 674, 846 A.2d 433 (2004) (recognizing that the State enjoys sovereign immunity in regard to tort actions unless the Legislature waived immunity pursuant to a specific statute.) Therefore, for purposes of limitations in regard to a minor\u2019s claim against a private tortfeasor, the analysis of <em>Piselli </em>controls. But, in a suit under the LGTCA, <em>Piselli </em>does not excuse compliance with the statutory notice requirement, whether for adults or children.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Furthermore, Article 19 does not preclude all regulation of access to courts. Instead, \u201cstatutory restriction upon access to the courts violates Article 19 only if the restriction is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 365, 601 A.2d 102 (1992); <em>see Doe v. Doe, </em>358 Md. 113, 128, 747 A.2d 617 (2000); <em>Hill v. Fitzgerald, </em>304 Md. 689, 703, 501 A.2d 27 (1985); <em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Coupard, </em>304 Md. 340, 360, 499 A.2d 178 (1985). The Act waives the immunity of a local government, subject to the terms of the Act; timely notice is a prerequisite to suit. If the Court of Appeals in <em>Johnson </em>found no constitutional violation or interference with access to the courts with respect to the requisite notice in a case involving a minor under the MTCA, we discern no constitutional violation created by the effect of the notice requirement on a minor whose claim arises under the LGTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>As to both the MTCA and the LGTCA, the Legislature has consented to a waiver of sovereign immunity, but timely notice to the sovereign is a condition of waiver. To be sure, a child is dependent on an adult to comply with the Act by providing the requisite notice. Nevertheless, the General Assembly has the power to establish the terms under which it will permit a waiver of immunity, and was not required to exempt minors from the notice provision. Because it is the prerogative of the Legislature to create an exception to the notice period for minors, we may not rewrite or enlarge the statute by engrafting onto the notice provision an exception for minor claimants that the Legislature did not authorize. <em>See Graves v. State, </em>364 Md. 329, 351, 772 A.2d 1225 (2001); <em>Heartwood 88, Inc. v. Montgomery County, </em>156 Md.App. 333, 360, 846 A.2d 1096 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Numerous other jurisdictions have declined to toll the notice period in regard to claims of minors brought under a state tort claims act, absent an express provision in the applicable statute. <em>See, e.g., Martinez v. Val Verde County Hasp. Dist., </em>110 S.W.3d 480, 485 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2003)(concluding that the Texas Tort Claims Act (\u201cTTCA\u201d) waives sovereign immunity under certain circumstances, but requires notice to sovereign within six months of injury. \u201cThe TTCA does not, however, contain any provision tolling the notice period for minors. The Legislature could have provided for an extension or tolling of the notice requirement ... Unless and until the Legislature provides for such a provision in the TTCA, we decline to create the common-law rule requested by appellants. We, therefore, hold that the TTCA six-month notice requirement was not tolled for [child\u2019s] minority\u201d); <em>see Murray v. Milford, </em>380 F.2d 468 (2d Cir.1967)(stating that notice provision is a substantive precondition to suit against town, and court may not impliedly establish an exemption for minors, because that is a legislative function); <em>Birmingham v. Weston, </em>233 Ala. 563, 172 So. 643 (1937)(concluding that minority status did not excuse the timely filing of a notice of claim against a city; the notice of claim was an absolute precondition of suit against local government); <em>George v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>Saugus, </em>394 Mass. 40, 474 N.E.2d 169 (1985) (concluding that notice requirement is a precondition of maintaining a legal action against a government entity); <em>McNicholas v. Bickford, </em>612 A.2d 866 (Me.l992)(involving claim against a state agency and concluding that minority status, by itself, does not satisfy good cause exception to excuse belated filing of notice of claim). <em>See also </em>Isham, James L., <em>Local Government Tort Liability: Minority as Affecting Notice of Claim Requirement, </em>58 A.L.R.4th 402 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Were we to adopt appellant\u2019s position, we would usurp the legislative function; ignore well settled principles of statutory construction; and undermine the goal of notice as a mechanism to promote the ability of local governments to anticipate and to plan for potential liability. Merely because this case involves a minor, the statutory language of the LGTCA, the principles of statutory construction, and the well established purpose of the Act\u2019s notice provision do not permit us to toll the notice period. Although we are mindful of the harsh impact of our decision on Luis, who was completely unable to protect his own rights, we may not reform the Act by implementing the sweeping change in the law that appellant seeks here.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
