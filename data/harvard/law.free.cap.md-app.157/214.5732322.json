The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County concluded that the vehicle was not a temporary substitute and granted summary judgment in favor of MAIF on O\u2019Quinn\u2019s declaratory judgment action. We shall reverse that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">On August 8, 1998, while Thomas O\u2019Quinn was walking in a parking lot, he was struck by a 1996 Ford Escort driven by Mosele Kabila. O\u2019Quinn suffered severe leg injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Averaging 150 miles each weekday, Kabila was an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d for Washington Express, a courier service. In 1997, Kabila had purchased a high mileage 1988 Hyundai for $400, to use in this work. He was paid based solely on the number of routes he completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">At the time of the accident, there was a $20,000 MAIF liability policy in effect on the Hyundai. But Kabila was not driving the Hyundai on the day of the accident because that car had broken down for the fifth time. The vehicle had been smoking and would stall out, requiring towing services on two occasions. Kabila garaged the Hyundai, which was not operable, making no plans to repair it.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Kabila rented the Escort two weeks after the Hyundai broke down, on June 10, 1998.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He wanted to buy the Escort, but did not have the money or the credit necessary to make the purchase. In order to establish credit, Kabila made rental payments on the vehicle every two weeks. Once he made a number of timely payments he could qualify to buy the Escort. At the time of the August 8 accident, then, Kabila was still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>renting the Escort. Kabila did not inform MAIF that he had the Escort until he actually purchased the vehicle in October 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">O\u2019Quinn sued MAIF and Kabila in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. He sought, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaration that the MAIF policy covered the Escort because it was a \u201ctemporary substitute\u201d or \u201creplacement\u201d for the Hyundai described in the MAIF policy. MAIF denied coverage, citing Kabila\u2019s abandonment of the Hyundai and his use of the rented Escort for more than 30 days. Agreeing that there was no factual dispute regarding the \u201crent before the purchase\u201d circumstances at the time of the accident, O\u2019Quinn and MAIF filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the coverage issue. The court granted MAIF\u2019s motion and denied O\u2019Quinn\u2019s. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The MAIF liability policy defines as a \u201c[cjovered automobile\u201d either the vehicle described in the policy or any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">3. an automobile that you acquire during the policy period provided that it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">(a) replaces an automobile owned by you and described in the Declarations; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">(b) is in addition to the automobile(s) described in the Declarations but only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">(1) we insure all automobiles owned by you on the date the newly acquired automobile is delivered to you; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">(2) you notify us within thirty days following its delivery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">4. a temporary substitute automobile that you do not own, provided that you are using it with the permission of the owner as a substitute for an automobile described in the Declarations that has been withdrawn from normal use because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>5. any other automobile that you do not own, provided that it is being used by you with the permission of the owner and;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">(a) it is not furnished for your regular use; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">(b) it is not owned by or furnished for the regular use of a member of your household other than your private chauffeur or domestic employee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">(c) it is not rented to you for a period of more than thirty consecutive days. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Maryland applies the principle of objective contract construction to insurance contracts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">In construing contracts of insurance, Maryland follows the general contract rule that the agreement should be viewed as a whole to determine the intention of the parties to the contract and the purpose which they sought to accomplish. When the provisions are not ambiguous, a court should enforce them according to their plain meaning. If, however, the terms of the contract are ambiguous, the ambiguity shall be resolved against the drafter of the policy and in favor of the insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-10\"><em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>79 Md.App. 734, 737-38, 558 A.2d 1244 (1989). \u201cAlthough Maryland law does not construe insurance policies as a matter of course against the insurer, when a term in an insurance policy is found to be ambiguous, the court will construe that term against the drafter of the contract which is usually the insurer.\u201d <em>Mamsi Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Callaway, </em>375 Md. 261, 279-80, 825 A.2d 995 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">As grounds for their contradictory conclusions regarding the coverage afforded by the policy, O\u2019Quinn and MAIF both cite the undisputed inoperability of the Hyundai, its \u201cwithdrawal] from normal use as a result of its breakdown,\u201d Kabila\u2019s use of the Escort as a substitute for the Hyundai without notice to MAIF, his rental of the Escort for more than 30 days, and his purchase of the Escort as a permanent replacement after the accident. Each side agrees that the material facts are not in dispute; they disagree only about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>whether the policy provides coverage in these undisputed circumstances. Thus, their cross-motions and arguments reveal that summary judgment on the coverage question raised in this declaratory judgment action is a question of law for the court. When there is no genuine factual dispute, we review the grant of summary judgment in a declaratory judgment action concerning the scope of insurance coverage to determine whether the insurer was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>79 Md.App. at 737, 558 A.2d 1244; Lee R. Russ, <em>Couch on Insurance </em>\u00a7 117:68 (3d ed. database updated through Dec. <em>2003\")(\u201cCouch </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">O\u2019Quinn contends that the circuit court erred when it ruled that the Escort was not covered by the MAIF policy, either as a \u201ctemporary substitute\u201d under section 4 of the \u201ccovered automobile\u201d definition, or as a \u201creplacement\u201d vehicle under section 3(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MAIF counters that Kabila\u2019s rental of the Escort for more than 30 days, without notice to MAIF, excluded the Escort from coverage. More specifically, MAIF argues that subsection 3(a) does not apply because Kabila did not notify MAIF within 30 days that he was using the Escort and he did not own the Escort. Section 4 does not apply in MAIF\u2019s view, because Kabila rented the Escort for more than 30 days, planning to buy it, so that his use of it was not \u201ctemporary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We shall assume <em>arguendo </em>that the Escort is not a covered automobile within the meaning of subsection 3(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>We nevertheless conclude that the Escort was a \u201ctemporary substitute automobile\u201d within the coverage afforded by section 4.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">The so-called \u201csubstitution\u201d provision is concerned with the situation where the vehicle described in the policy becomes unavailable for use for any one of a number of specified reasons, and another vehicle, not owned by the insured, is temporarily used in its place. It is not necessary that the insured still own the original automobile at the time of the use of the temporary substitute taking the place of the \u201cdestroyed\u201d car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\"><em>Couch, supra, </em>\u00a7 117:61; <em>see, e.g., McKee v. Exchange Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>270 Ala. 518, 120 So.2d 690, 693 (1960)(substitute vehicle provision did not require insured to retain ownership of described vehicle). This type of \u201csubstitute coverage clause is for the benefit of the insured.\u201d <em>Couch, supra, </em>\u00a7 117:63. The MAIF policy language is identical to the current Insurance Services Office standard automobile policies for personal and business use. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 117:61.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">As a threshold matter, we note that there is no debate that the rented Escort qualified as a \u201csubstitute\u201d vehicle. We have held that, in the \u201ccovered automobile\u201d definition of a liability policy, \u201c[t]he term \u2018substitute\u2019 connotes the replacement of one thing for another.\u201d <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>79 Md.App. at 738-40, 558 A.2d 1244. And we have classified a rental car as a covered substitute under a substantively similar policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>In <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>Patricia Caldwell rented a car after the vehicle described in her policy was damaged in an accident. She initially rented from the dealer who was repairing her car, but later arranged for a less expensive rental from Snappy Car Rental. The Snappy car was delivered to Caldwell\u2019s home. Caldwell drove the dealer car back to the dealer, while her housemate followed in the Snappy car. En route, the housemate was involved in an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Snappy\u2019s insurer refused to provide a defense, claiming that the dealer rental car, rather than the Snappy car, was the only \u201ctemporary substitute\u201d for the insured vehicle at the time of the accident. We agreed, holding that \u201c[t]he problem in the instant case arose because at the time of the accident, Caldwell had rented two vehicles to replace the one vehicle covered by her insurance policy\u201d and \u201c[b]oth rental vehicles were on the road at the same time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740, 558 A.2d 1244. We explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">[w]hen Caldwell rented the car from [the dealer], it is clear that her insurance coverage ... extended to that vehicle. If Caldwell had returned the [dealer] car and thereafter rented another vehicle, that second vehicle would have been covered under her policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\"><em>Id. </em>Here, it is undisputed that Kabila substituted only the rented Escort for the broken down Hyundai, using it for precisely the same purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The controversy in this case centers instead on the duration of Kabila\u2019s use of the vehicle and his plan to purchase it. MAIF adopts a narrow construction of the undefined word \u201ctemporary\u201d in its substitute vehicle clause. It contends that Kabila\u2019s rental of the Escort for more than 30 days, with plans to eventually convert this rental into a purchase, prevented the Escort from being a \u201ctemporary\u201d substitute for the Hyundai. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">To the extent that MAIF\u2019s construction of its temporary substitute provision effectively defines \u201ctemporary\u201d as a period of less than 30 days, we reject that interpretation. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>effect, that reading of the policy would apply the same 30 day limit on rented vehicles that appears in section 5 to all temporary substitute rentals under section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">By its terms, however, section 5 provides coverage in circumstances \u201cother\u201d than those covered by the temporary substitute provisions of section 4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 4 affords liability coverage when, as in this case, the policy holder\u2019s described automobile is withdrawn from normal use due to breakdown. Significantly, only section 5 explicitly excludes from coverage vehicles rented for more than 30 days; the \u201ctemporary substitute\u201d coverage described in section 4 does not include any specific limit on the duration of such coverage, much less a 30 day deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In our view, the presence of clear language creating a 30 day rental limitation in section 5 underscores the conspicuous absence of similar language in section 4. Read in context and <em>in pari materia </em>with sections 3 and 5, the temporary substitute coverage in section 4 protects a policy holder whose covered vehicle has broken down, during the indefinite time that he is temporarily driving another vehicle that he does not own as a substitute for the described automobile.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We therefore agree with courts and scholars who have concluded that, in the absence of a contrary definition, \u201c[t]he word \u2018temporarily\u2019 ... does not place a time limit as to withdrawal of the insured vehicle.\u201d <em>Couch, supra, </em>\u00a7 117:81. Thus, \u201cthe duration of the use is not controlling in determining whether the use is temporary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 80. Rather, the word \u201ctemporary\u201d in this context has been treated with \u201celasticity\u201d as \u201can antonym for the word \u2018permanent.\u2019 \u201d <em>See id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u00a7 79-80 (collecting cases); <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Johnston, </em>9 Cal.3d 270, 107 Cal.Rptr. 149, 507 P.2d 1357, 1359 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We disagree with MAIF and the circuit court that Kabila\u2019s plan to purchase the Escort establishes that, at the time of the accident, his use of that vehicle was \u201cpermanent\u201d rather than \u201ctemporary.\u201d On the day of the accident, Kabila was still renting the vehicle in the hope of purchasing it, but he had no contractual right to purchase the car. Rather the record shows that Kabila was unable to do so due to lack of money and credit. Instead, he was renting the vehicle for two weeks at a time. Kabila had no contractual right to purchase the car. These facts are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In our view, Kabila\u2019s use of the Escort was temporary in the very real sense that he was driving this rented vehicle for an uncertain period of time, until he could secure a permanent replacement for the Hyundai. Whether that replacement turned out to be the Escort or another car is not material; the dispositive fact is that Kabila was still renting the Escort on a temporary basis at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Construing Kabila\u2019s use as a temporary substitute use is consistent with the policy objective underlying such coverage, which is to benefit the insured by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">affording] temporary coverage to the insured while he or she is using a borrowed [or rented] automobile until the automobile designated in the policy is restored to normal use. Evenhanded fulfillment of its purposes requires that the provision not be unreasonably extended to increase materially the risk contemplated by the insurer, nor should it be narrowly applied against the insured, because the clause is designed for the insured\u2019s protection.... \u201cThe purpose of the \u2018temporary substitute\u2019 clause in an automobile liability policy is to afford continuous coverage to an insured while limiting risk to one operating vehicle at a time for a single premium, and, therefore the insured vehicle for which the substitution is made must be withdrawn from use by some overt act which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>reasonably preclude the possibility of both vehicles being driven at the same time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\"><em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>79 Md.App. at 738-40, 558 A.2d 1244 (emphasis added and citations omitted). <em>See also Couch, supra, </em>\u00a7 117:84 (\u201cthe temporary substitute vehicle clause provides coverage for only one substitute vehicle at a time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">MAIF acknowledges that Kabila did not use or attempt to use both the Hyundai and the Escort simultaneously. Because the single premium paid by Kabila at all times covered only a single operating vehicle, and the Escort was being used in the same manner as the Hyundai, Kabila\u2019s use of the Escort did not increase the liability risk that MAIF assumed when it issued Kabila\u2019s policy. Indeed, MAIF\u2019s policy undisputedly would cover the Escort under section 3 as soon as Kabila purchased it as a replacement vehicle. Allowing MAIF to avoid liability coverage in these circumstances, then, would create an anomalous \u201cCatch-22,\u201d in which Kabila could not have coverage under the permanent replacement provision in section 3 due to his lack of ownership, yet he could not have coverage under the temporary substitute provision in section 4 due to his desire for ownership. Consequently, treating Kabila\u2019s \u201crent before purchase\u201d arrangement as a permanent use would result in MAIF retaining a premium for liability coverage that it did not provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Finally, we disagree with MAIF\u2019s contention that Kabila\u2019s intent not to repair the Hyundai bars coverage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> MAIF argues that the Escort cannot be a temporary substitute vehicle because, with this type of coverage, \u201cthe objective is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>afford temporary coverage until the automobile designated in the policy is restored to normal use.\u201d It contends that, because Kabila had no intent to repair the Hyundai, his use of the Escort was not temporary. The policy language, however, refutes that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The policy, in defining a \u201ctemporary substitute automobile,\u201d only requires that the insured use it \u201cas a substitute for an automobile described in the Declarations that has been withdrawn from normal use because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction____\u201d There is no requirement that the automobile described in the Declarations be repaired in order for the temporary substitute automobile to qualify for coverage. <em>See, e.g., Ambrosio v. Affordable Auto Rental Inc., </em>307 N.J.Super. 114, 704 A.2d 572, 576 (1998)(policy required only breakdown, not repair); <em>Couch, supra, </em>\u00a7 117:80 (\u201cThe temporary substitute provision does not require the replacement, or the intention to replace, the insured vehicle, but affords coverage during the remainder of the policy period where the breakdown and withdrawal of the insured vehicle is permanent in nature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">MAIF, in opposing O\u2019Quinn\u2019s motion for summary judgment, did not dispute O\u2019Quinn\u2019s assertion, supported by deposition testimony, that the Hyundai broke down, that Kabila did not use it after May, 1998, and that he kept the vehicle in his garage. These undisputed facts allow us to conclude as a matter of law that the Escort qualifies as a \u201csubstitute automobile\u201d under the policy language. The insurance company\u2019s risk was limited to one vehicle after the Hyundai broke down. Neither Kabila\u2019s plan to purchase nor his intent not to repair is material. Accordingly, there is no reason to deny summary judgment in favor of O\u2019Quinn.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">We therefore hold that the MAIF policy covered Kabila\u2019s use of the Escort, given that the Hyundai had been \u201cwithdrawn from normal use due to its breakdown,\u201d and the rented Escort was still being used as a \u201ctemporary substitute\u201d at the time of the accident. Although we found no precedent involving this type of \u201crent before purchase\u201d arrangement, we view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>our decision as a logical extension of those decisions recognizing that a rental vehicle may be a temporary substitute when used for the same purposes as a described vehicle that has broken down or is otherwise unavailable to the insured. <em>See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins., </em>79 Md.App. 734, 558 A.2d 1244; <em>see also Ambrosio v.

We note, however, that MAIF misreads the \"replacement vehicle\u201d provision in the policy when it contends that \u201cCoverage 3 requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>notification within thirty (30) days of its delivery[.]\u201d Aeb8. As drafted by MAIF, only the \u201cadditional vehicle\u201d provision in subsection 3(b) requires the policy holder to give MAIF notice within 30 days. The \"replacement vehicle\u201d provision in subsection 3(a) is followed by the disjunctive word \"or\u201d before the \"additional vehicle\u201d provision in subsection (b). The 30 day notice requirement appears only in subsection 3(b). Thus, a second vehicle can fall within the definition of \"covered automobile\u201d only if the policy holder notifies MAIF within 30 days of its acquisition. In contrast, a single vehicle that replaces a single described vehicle would be a covered automobile under paragraph 3(a) even if the policy holder did not give MAIF 30 days notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">. For example, section 5 would apply if a policy holder chose to rent or borrow a vehicle even though the automobile described in the policy remained operable and available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\">. We are also mindful that, to the extent the conflicting interpretations advanced by MAIF and O\u2019Quinn might be said to reveal an ambiguity in section 4, we must resolve that uncertainty in favor of coverage because MAIF was the drafter of the policy. <em>See GEICO, Inc. v.

Summary judgment in favor of O\u2019Quinn is appropriate here, however, because there is no dispute of material fact about intent. All agree that Kabila did not intend to repair the Hyundai and that he planned to buy the Escort as a replacement. The question is not \"what was Kabila\u2019s intent?\u201d but rather, \"did Kabila's intent bar coverage?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
