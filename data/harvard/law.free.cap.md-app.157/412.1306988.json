Mr. <em>\u201cA\u201d </em>and Ms. \u201cA\u201d appeal from a decision to terminate their parental rights in order to make Victor A eligible for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We shall vacate the judgment and remand to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, because it failed to make required factual findings or to explain why terminating the As\u2019 parental rights is in Victor\u2019s best interests. On remand, the court and the Prince George\u2019s Department of Social Services (DSS) must consider whether this is one of the rare cases in which a foster care permanency plan is in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"A8p\">Victor</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Victor A was born on March 26, 2000 to Ms. A and Mr. A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He tested positive for cocaine and amphetamines at birth and was diagnosed with severe mental and physical disabilities, including cerebral palsy. His diagnoses include Mental Retardation, Dysphagia, Myopia, Reflux, Global Developmental Impairment Microcephaly, Encephalopathy, and Failure to Thrive. Victor cannot speak or walk, nor is he expected to be able to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Victor is unable to control his head or any of his extremities, because he is severely spastic and cannot sit up unaided. He is given Valium to help this, as well as other medications to decrease muscle spasms, drug treatments through a nebulizer four times daily, and nose spray to help keep his lungs and breathing passages open. He has several contraptions, including a tumble form, a stander, and a straight sitter, which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>used to stretch his muscles while keeping him safe and upright.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Victor is unable to hold anything for very long. He uses a wheelchair, braces to keep his legs straight, and a wedge to lie on. He is nearsighted, despite \u201clazy eye\u201d surgery. He wears glasses but no one knows how much they really help his sight. Victor also requires medicines to help him void his bowels; he was not toilet trained at the time of these termination of parental rights (TPR) proceedings, needing to be changed every two or three hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In order to prevent deformities that can result from the contraction of muscles and to help improve motor skills, Victor receives physical and occupational therapy, as well as speech therapy. Through treatments, it is hoped that Victor will be able to grasp objects, sit up on his own, and possibly even learn to use a message board to communicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Because Victor has a swallowing disorder, he can be fed only through a gastronomy tube (G tube). His accompanying reflux disorder is managed daily by three different medications and gradual feeding using his G tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Over a 24 hour period, Victor gets medication every hour or two. He sleeps in a hospital crib with side rails and suffers from sleep apnea; therefore he has to be watched through the night. Victor sees numerous doctors including a physical medicine doctor, a pulmonologist, an ophthomologist, a neurologist, a gastrologist, a pediatrician, and an orthopedist as part of his care. Victor\u2019s foster mother, Jackie Plumley, said that Victor \u201cpretty much has a doctor for every system he has.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Since he began residing at Plumley\u2019s home in April 2001, Victor has gained weight and generally seems to be a happy, well-mannered child. Victor is aware of his surroundings and is able to communicate on some level. He shows his pleasure by smiling or giggling when he is happy or crying and grimacing when he is upset. He can select between two toys or show his like or dislike of a television program. He also no longer cries when his caretaker leaves him briefly, if she explains to him that she will return in a moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Victor responds to people he knows, including his parents and his foster mother. Both Mr. A and Ms. A have court-approved visitation with Victor. Victor recognizes each parent and expresses happiness when they arrive. He enjoys their visits. All agree that both parents love Victor and express that love in these visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Mr. A\u2019s History And Interactions With Victor</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Victor was discharged from the hospital in July 2000, to the care of Sonya Harris, one of Ms. A\u2019s sisters. Neither Ms. A nor Mr. A was able to take Victor because Ms. A was an active substance abuser and Mr. A was being assessed for substance abuse as well. Mr. A agreed to be tested in order to prove that he was not taking drugs. The results were negative. There has never been any indication of substance abuse by Mr. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In late October, however, Victor was moved into therapeutic foster care with Mary Guding because Ms. A alleged that Harris\u2019 f\u00edfteen-year-old son had sexually abused Victor. The DSS did not believe that Mr. and Ms. A were ready to assume custody and care of Victor. The abuse allegations were later ruled out and Harris was offered the opportunity to resume custody of Victor. She declined because she was angry with Ms. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">While Victor was in Guding\u2019s foster care, Mr. A had unsupervised visitation with Victor from Wednesday through Saturday or Sunday of every week. Mr. A was awarded full custody of Victor in January 2001. The court authorized only supervised visits for Ms. A, however, mostly due to concern about her mental health.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Mr. A\u2019s custody was rescinded three months later, because Victor\u2019s medical needs were not being met and the DSS suspected that Victor had been left in Ms. A\u2019s unsupervised care, in violation of the court order granting Mr. A custody. Mr. A had been relying on relatives of Ms. A for Victor\u2019s care during the day. These arrangements changed on a daily basis. Victor\u2019s therapists had great difficulty locating Victor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>for his treatments, frequently having to call several homes to find out where Victor was that day. As a result, Victor often did not receive necessary in-home services.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">When Victor was returned to therapeutic foster care in April, he was adjudicated a child in need of assistance (CINA). Victor was placed with Jackie Plumley, who continued to care for him through the time of the TPR proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Plumley described Victor\u2019s emaciated and feverish condition when he arrived:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">He was a mess. He was crying hysterically nonstop not only the first few hours but almost for the first week. His body itself was\u2014he was quite emaciated. He was very light in weight. He weighed 17 pounds, I believe, 17 something. His skin itself had a big rash on it around his neck from drooling, I\u2019m sure, because it was an eczema-type thing. He had a quarter size or larger ulceration on the inside of his lip, bottom lip where he was just biting, and I had never seen anything quite so bad, actually. It had to be very painful. He was in dire need of medical attention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Plumley re-enrolled Victor in the Rare and Expensive Medical Program (REM) to obtain the equipment he needed because those services had lapsed. She also had his prescriptions refilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">After Victor was returned to foster care, Mr. A resided in the basement of someone else\u2019s home, where he could not take Victor on a permanent basis. Mr. A agreed to find other housing and to arrange for appropriate daycare for Victor. Although he had the financial means to secure suitable housing, he was reluctant to undertake that expense until he could be sure that Victor would live with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Mr. A signed service agreements on June 6 and August 26, 2001, in which he promised to take parenting classes for parents of children with special needs. DSS caseworkers referred Mr. A to three programs and wrote to the one that he selected, advising of Victor\u2019s condition and Mr. A\u2019s need for training. Mr. A did attend some of Victor\u2019s medical appoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ments, as well as educational meetings concerning children with special needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Mr. A continued to visit Victor after he returned to foster care at the Plumleys. According to Plumley, Mr. A was satisfied with that arrangement. He initially told her that he did not think he could take care of Victor because, at least in his native Nigeria, \u201cthat\u2019s the mother\u2019s job.\u201d Plumley told him about the services that would be available to him and told him about a conference for children with cerebral palsy, which he attended. Nevertheless, Mr. A continued to observe that \u201c[i]t\u2019s my culture that the woman takes care of the children.\u201d Mr. A later disputed that he said caring for children is the woman\u2019s job.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Although Mr. A and Victor initially had unsupervised overnight visits away from the Plumleys, those were reduced to day visits because Mr. A did not give Victor the right amount of medication.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. A\u2019s visits were rescheduled from ten in the morning until six at night so that Victor would need no food or medication during that time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">According to Plumley, since Victor was placed in her care and been placed on a very regular regime of medication, therapy, and sustenance, he has become</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYt\">a delightful young man. His personality has blossomed. He\u2019s less irritable. Physically the things that were wrong are gone, the rashy skin. He\u2019s well hydrated now. The ulcerations that he had in his mouth healed up and they\u2019re not present. When Victor first came to me he was so irritable that I almost didn\u2019t keep him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Ms. A\u2019s History, Diagnoses, And Interaction With Victor</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">At the time of Victor\u2019s birth and hospital release, Ms. A was an active cocaine and alcohol abuser who was not undergoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>treatment. Ms. A was referred to the Treatment of Mothers of Addicted Newborns (TMAN) program<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> while Victor was still hospitalized following his birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">TMAN then referred Ms. A to the Children and Parents Program (CAP), which offers outpatient substance abuse and mental health therapies. Ms. A began treatment there on June 2, 2000. She was expected to submit to urinalyses and go to treatment sessions three days a week. Ms. A attended sessions on June 5 and 7, but did not come again until June 30. Her first urinalysis tested positive for cocaine and two other tests were positive for alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">TMAN referred Victor to the DSS because Ms. A had missed so many sessions. Ms. A claimed that she had been unable to attend the CAP sessions because she was visiting the hospital for instruction on Victor\u2019s care. The hospital denied that she received such instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Ms. A eventually returned to the CAP program, which she attended on a fairly regular basis, though she did lapse occasionally. Ms. A. was allowed supervised visits at first, and later unsupervised visits with Victor. By October 2000, Mr. A and Ms. A were allowed to have extended visits with Victor.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Kathleen Schooley, Victor\u2019s DSS caseworker, related her concerns about Ms. A\u2019s handling of Victor during her visits. She stated that Ms. A did not support his head, which he cannot support himself, letting it \u201cflop.\u201d She also \u201cscrunched up\u201d his legs, an action that exacerbates the constriction in his chest and stomach, and thus puts pressure on his abdominal area. Nurse Karole Ozkirbas reported that, although Ms. A had been taught the proper way to hold Victor, she often handled him in an unsafe manner. Jackie Plumley testified that Victor had vomited on occasion after visits with Ms. A, possibly due to her improper handling of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>In order to gain custody of Victor, Ms. A was required to have psychological, sociological, and psychiatric evaluations; to complete parenting skills classes for the parents of special needs children; to engage in mental health therapy; and to participate in substance abuse treatment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ms. A was discharged from the CAP program on May 2, 2001, because she moved to Washington, D.C. Her CAP therapist, however, felt she required further treatment. She referred Ms. A to another mental health treatment program in the District of Columbia. Ms. A did attend these programs as well as a United Cerebral Palsy parenting class.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Ms. A was examined by Jamal Lewis, Ph.D. over two sessions on August 19 and October 5, 2002. Athough the juvenile court had released Ms. A from court-ordered drug testing 30 days earlier, she reported to Lewis that she was living in a \u201ccrack\u201d house, had consumed alcohol in the preceding thirty days, and had tested positive for cocaine recently.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Dr. Lewis recommended substance abuse treatment and individual mental health counseling. A DSS caseworker tried to obtain medical assistance for Ms. A in the District of Columbia, where Ms. A was residing at the time, so that her therapy would be paid for without having to travel to Maryland for treatment. The caseworker was not able to ascertain a home address for Ms. A, and Ms. A did not provide one. For that reason, the caseworker could not secure medical assistance for Ms. A from October 2002, when Dr. Lewis made the recommendation, to January 2003, when Ms. A voluntarily entered Bethany Women\u2019s Center in N Street Village.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">From January 2003 until the TPR hearing, Ms. A was in the Bethany Women\u2019s Center program, residing at the Luther Place Night Shelter. At the shelter, she is not permitted to have any children living with her, though she had tried to obtain a placement in transitional housing, but found it would be possible only if Victor was in her custody. She had to remain on the campus of the shelter all the time for the first ninety days she was there, except when she had medical appointments or had to attend mandatory AA or NA meetings. She had random urinalyses approximately once a month. At the time of the TPR hearing, her results had all been negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Ms. A also received therapy from Community Connections, a psychiatric day program providing mental health services and therapeutic case management. Ms. A attends both group therapy and individual therapy sessions covering issues of mental health, substance abuse, and personal welfare in general, as well as anger management, problem solving, and coping.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Ms. A also was evaluated by David Paul Faygo, Ph.D. on May 28 and June 4, 2003, in accordance with a court order. Dr. Faygo testified at the TPR hearing that he reviewed a great deal of past information, previous medical records, court reports, and correspondence before the evaluation. After a two hour clinical interview and psychological testing, he concluded that she has an Axis 1 diagnosis of delusional disorder, which he thought was part of a Type II Bipolar Disorder, a major mood disorder characterized by states of high energy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>sleeplessness, delusions, and actions that reflect impaired judgment and decision-making. He also determined that she has an Axis 2 diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder with paranoid schizoidal and obsessive compulsive traits, which are common in persons with Type II Bipolar Disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Dr. Faygo recounted Ms. A\u2019s difficult history arising from her mother\u2019s mental illness, depression, and nervous breakdowns, and from sexual abuse she experienced as a child. He diagnosed her with polysubstance dependence in early partial remission, meaning that she was in a treatment program and had been substance-free from four to six months. He explained that, at this early stage of recovery, she was at risk of relapsing.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In Faygo\u2019s professional experience, a woman with Ms. A\u2019s diagnoses and in her situation could care for a child, but it would affect her ability to function well. He felt that, even though Ms. A was trying to be able to take care of her child and to comply with the service agreement requirements, Victor\u2019s enormous needs, both developmental and medical, are enough to overwhelm two parents, let alone one. He testified that he \u201ccould not see how [Ms. A] would ever be capable of providing for his care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Change In Permanency Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">On May 28, 2002, 13/\u00e9 months after Victor was placed in the Plumleys\u2019 care, the primary permanency plan for Victor was changed from reunification with Mr. A to adoption. On December 12, at a review and permanency planning hearing, the court granted the DSS limited guardianship; ordered Ms. A to continue drug testing and counseling for her substance abuse and mental health needs; and ordered Mr. A to attend training for parents of children with cerebral palsy, to secure housing suitable for Victor, and to obtain an attorney. It reduced both parents\u2019 visits to once a month. The day before, the DSS had petitioned the court for a termination of parental rights with the right to consent to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Joan Terry, Victor\u2019s caseworker at the time, testified that one reason for the change in the permanency plan was that she saw no movement on Mr. A\u2019s part. She only wanted to reunify Victor with his father, due to Ms. A\u2019s substance abuse, mental health problems, and housing situation. Terry asked for the change because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\">[i]t had been at least 15 months and reunification had not occurred, and that\u2019s one of the policies that all of us in foster care know about. Not only that, there was no movement on Mr. A\u2019s part and I could not sit on this case and just hold it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">When asked, \u201cdid you consider leaving Victor with Mrs. Plumley and just letting [the parents] visit?\u201d Terry explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">No.... There has to be some movement on these cases. That\u2019s part of policy. I mean, somebody has to do something. It has to move toward a goal of stabilization for the child, and if the child can be adopted by a family because their own family isn\u2019t doing anything and are not capable then that\u2019s the way it should be. So why would I just leave a kid in a foster home....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Terry also ruled out a permanent foster care placement because Plumley planned to retire in two to three years. Kathleen Schooley, the caseworker who succeeded Terry, confirmed that a plan to leave Victor in long-term foster care while allowing the A\u2019s to continue visits \u201cwas ruled out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">At the end of the TPR hearing, the circuit court found that \u201cVictor ... has an awareness that his parents are special people, and he reacts to them as well as his foster parents, whom he reacts to as special people.\u201d Given Ms. A\u2019s history of mental illness and substance abuse, however, \u201cthe return of Victor, Jr., to his mom does pose an unacceptable risk to [his] future safety[.]\u201d In contrast, the court stated that it could not make a similar finding with respect to Mr. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Although the court was satisfied with Mr. A\u2019s parent training efforts, it found Mr. A\u2019s failure to find housing appropriate for Victor troubling. The court discounted Mr. A\u2019s assurances that, if Victor were to be returned to his care, he would secure suitable housing, finding that \u201cMr. A has not really put himself in a better position to deal with Victor, Junior\u2019s problems, that there is little likelihood that those conditions will be remedied at an early date so the child can indeed return to the natural parent in the immediate future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The court determined that Victor was receiving better care through the foster care placement arranged by the DSS than his father could give him. At the end of the August 14 hearing, however, it reserved decision on \u201cwhether it is in the best interests to terminate his parents\u2019 rights[.]\u201d In a September 29, 2003 written order, the court \u201cconclude[d] that it is in the best interests of Victor [A] for termination of his natural parents rights[.]\u201d It granted the DSS\u2019s petition for guardianship with the right to consent to adoption and/or long term care, but also</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">[found] that until such time as the \u201cDepartment\u201d identifies such adoptive or long-term resource, that it is in the best interests of Victor [A] to continue visitation with [Ms. A] and [Mr. A] under the supervision of the \u201cDepartment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">Ms. A and Mr. A filed this timely appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Termination Of Parental Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The proper starting point for legal analysis when the State involves itself in family relations is the fundamental constitutional rights of a parent. Certain fundamental rights are protected under the U.S. Constitution, and among those rights are a parent\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment liberty interest in raising his or her children as he or she sees fit, without undue interference by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\"><em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 565, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003). The right to rear one\u2019s own child is a basic civil right that cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>be taken away without clear justification, under both federal and Maryland law. <em>See id. </em>at 566-67, 819 A.2d 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">But \u201c[t]he rights of a parent in the raising of his or her children ... are not absolute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568, 819 A.2d 1030. In some circumstances, \u201capplication of an absolute right of the parent would fail to produce a just result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Wjhen clear and convincing evidence exists that the child\u2019s best interests are served by termination[,] a parent\u2019s constitutional right to parent his child [may] be permanently foreclosed.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos. J9610436 and J9711031, </em>368 Md. 666, 692-93, 796 A.2d 778 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"> A court considering whether to terminate parental rights must give \u201cprimary consideration to the safety and health of the child[.]\u201d Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2003 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 5\u2014313(c)(1) of the Family Law Article (FL). \u201c[I]n almost all cases, it is in the best interests of the child to have reasonable maximum opportunity to develop a close and loving relationship with each parent.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship J9610436, </em>368 Md. at 670, 796 A.2d 778. For that reason,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">[t]he best interests of the child standard embraces a strong presumption that the child\u2019s best interests are served by maintaining parental rights. If it were otherwise, the most disadvantaged of our adult citizens always would be at greater risk of losing custody of their children than those more fortunate. Those of our citizens coping with emotional or mental difficulties could be faced with such discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-7\"><em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 571, 819 A.2d 1030 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">For children in foster care, both the local social services department and the court must consider whether the individual child\u2019s health and safety is being compromised by the long term effects of foster care. Federal and state governments have recognized that long periods of foster care may harm the very children whom the foster care system is designed to protect. They have undertaken reasonable steps to prevent childhoods spent in \u201cfoster care drift\u201d\u2014the legal, emotional, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>and physical limbo of temporary housing -with temporary care givers. The federal \u201cAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980,\u201d <em>codified at </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 670-79, was enacted to redress the growing problem of children spending substantial amounts of their childhood in foster homes. <em>See id. </em>at 572, 819 A.2d 1030; <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 104, 642 A.2d 201 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">To comply with federal mandates in that act, the Maryland General Assembly ... enacted legislation .... for those children committed to a local department of social services ... requiring] [the department] to develop and implement a permanency plan that is in the best interests of the child. F.L. \u00a7 5-525.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In developing the permanency plan, the department is required to consider a statutory hierarchy of placement options in descending order of priority. F.L. \u00a7 5-525(c). First and foremost, the department must consider returning the child to the child\u2019s natural parents or guardians. F.L. \u00a7 5-525(c)(l). If reunification with the biological parents is not possible, the department must consider placing the child with relatives to whom adoption, guardianship, or care and custody, in descending order of priority, are planned to be granted. F.L. \u00a7 5-525(c)(2). If placement with relatives is not possible, then the department must consider adoption by a current foster parent or other approved adoptive family.

The valid premise is that it is in a child\u2019s best interest to be placed in a permanent home and to spend as little time as possible in foster care. Thus, Title 5 of the Family Law Article seeks to prevent the need for removal of a child from its home, to return a child to its home when possible, and where returning home is not possible, to place the child in another permanent placement that has legal status.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\"><em>In re Adoption/Guardianship 10941, </em>335 Md. at 105-06, 642 A.2d 201 (emphasis added); <em>see In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 575-76, 819 A.2d 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Foster Children With Special Needs</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Together, sections 5-313, 5-525, and 5-525.1 of the Family Law Article, along with Md.Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2003 Cum.Supp.), section 3-283 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ), comprehensively govern termination of the rights of parents whose children are in foster care.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 5-525(b) requires the DSS to \u201cdevelop and implement a permanency plan that is in the best interests of the child\u201d at the same time that it is \u201cprovid[ing] time-limited family reunification services to a child placed in an out-of-home placement and to the parents ... of the child, in order to facilitate the child\u2019s safe and appropriate reunification within a timely manner[.]\u201d The DSS may make \u201c[r]easonable efforts to place a child for adoption or with a legal guardian ... concurrently with ... reasonable efforts\u201d to reunify and preserve the family.

For example, to ensure that families are not separated solely as a result of the financial burdens arising from a child\u2019s special needs, the General Assembly directed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\">[a] child may not be committed to the custody or guardianship of a local department and placed in an out-of-home placement solely because the child\u2019s parent or guardian lacks shelter or solely because the child\u2019s parents are financially unable to provide treatment or care for a child with a developmental disability or mental illness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">FL \u00a7 5-525(c)(2)(i).

There are a host of legislatively mandated deadlines designed to reduce the amount of time that a child spends in foster care.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And the declared legislative policy is that \u201c[e]very reasonable effort shall be made to effectuate a permanent placement for the child within 24 months after the date of initial placement.\u201d C J \u00a7 3-823(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In most cases, if the DSS concludes that adoption is in the best interest of a child who has been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months, termination of parental rights proceedings must be initiated within 120 days. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 5-525.1(a)-(b). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Concurrent with the termination proceedings, \u201cthe local department shall identify, recruit, process, and seek to approve a qualified family for adoption, guardianship, or other permanent placement.\u201d FL \u00a7 5-525.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">But the General Assembly also recognized that the need for permanency reflected in these time frames may be different for foster children with special developmental, physical, or mental health needs. It explicitly provided that a child</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWq\">may remain in an out-of-home placement under a voluntary placement agreement for more than 180 days if the child\u2019s disability necessitates care or treatment in the out-of-home placement and a juvenile court makes a finding that continuation of the placement is in the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anr\">FL \u00a7 5-525(a)(2)(ii).

First,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-20\">[w]hen the appellate court scrutinizes factual findings, the clearly erroneous standard of Rule [8-131(c) ] applies. [Second,] if it appears that the [court] erred as to matters of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>law, further proceedings in the trial court will ordinarily be required unless the error is determined to be harmless. Finally, when the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the [court] founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the [court\u2019s] decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><em>Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 126, 372 A.2d 231, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 939, 98 S.Ct. 430, 54 L.Ed.2d 299 (1977); <em>see In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 586, 819 A.2d 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In this appeal, the As ask us to hold that the DSS and the circuit court failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that termination of their parental rights was in Victor\u2019s best interest. Observing that \u201cVictor is no ordinary child,\u201d Mr. A and Ms. A argue that \u201cit would be in Victor\u2019s best interest to leave him in foster care with visitations with his parents.\u201d In their view, Victor has less need for quick resolution of his permanent legal status because \u201c[h]is intelligence and awareness quotient [is] much, much less than the average child.\u201d Moreover, as the circuit court acknowledged, Victor benefits from \u201c[continued contact with ... natural parents who love him,\u201d while he is in therapeutic foster care. Instead of terminating their parental rights, they contend, Victor is best served by a permanent or long term foster care arrangement. This arrangement is preferable to adoption and termination because it satisfies Victor\u2019s needs for stability and a loving relationship with his parents without depriving them of their constitutionally protected rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Both parents also challenge the court\u2019s conclusion that neither will be able to care for Victor at their own home within a reasonable period of time. Mr. A contends that \u201c[i]t was never shown that [he] could not care for Victor if he had been given the resources afforded to the Plumleys.\u201d Only after Mr. A is given the 16 hour a day nursing care and REM subsidies that Victor receives at the Plumleys can it be fairly determined that Victor could not returned to Mr. A\u2019s care. In his view, the court\u2019s reliance on Mr. A\u2019s failure to secure housing that would be suitable for Victor \u201cin the hopes that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>would award him custody\u201d was an improper penalty for his understandable reluctance to undertake housing expenses that he will need only if the court agrees to let Victor live with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">As for Ms. A, she asserts that termination was not warranted given her great love for Victor, her progress in overcoming her drug abuse and managing her bipolar disorder, and her efforts to prepare herself to remain an integral part of Victor\u2019s life. She argues that the circuit court \u201cwas simply -wrong when it found that her mental status and past drug abuse posed an \u2018unacceptable risk\u2019 to Victor\u2019s future safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The DSS and counsel for Victor disagree that a permanent or long term foster care plan would adequately serve Victor. The DSS argues that such an arrangement</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASY\">would fly in the face of clearly articulated public policy based soundly on the real needs of children. The guardianship and adoption laws are based on the General Assembly\u2019s recognition of the reality that children need stable, permanent homes and that all foster care is inherently unstable____ Like any other child\u2014and perhaps more than some\u2014Victor needs the security that only a truly permanent home can give.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">Victor\u2019s current placement does not offer him that security and permanency. His foster mother plans to retire in two or three years, which will necessitate Victor\u2019s removal from her care. Thus, as for any child, only adoption provides the assurance that Victor will be in a stable home and will not have to readjust to a new environment, possibly several times. Only termination of parental rights offers Victor the opportunity that any child in foster care should have when his parents cannot care for him\u2014the opportunity to find a permanent, stable home through adoption. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">In DSS\u2019s view, the trial court correctly \u201cdetermined ... that Mr. A has failed to make even the basic adjustment in his circumstances of finding a suitable home for himself and Victor and that his failure arose from nothing but a lack of initiative.\u201d They point also to Ms. A\u2019s active history of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>substance abuse and mental illness, and her therapist\u2019s conclusion that, even with sobriety, medication, and therapy, she is not likely to ever be able to successfully manage Victor\u2019s demanding health needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">We agree with Mr. A and Ms. A that neither the circuit court nor the DSS adequately explained why it is in Victor\u2019s best interest to terminate their parental rights. We decline, however, the As\u2019 invitation to substitute our judgment for that of the circuit court on the ultimate issue of whether to terminate their parental rights. Instead, we shall vacate the termination order and remand for the court to make necessary factual findings and to articulate the reasons that termination is in Victor\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Factors To Be Considered In Deciding Whether To Terminate Parental Rights Of Child In Foster Care</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Before deciding to seek adoption with its accompanying termination of parental rights, the DSS must consider the following factors enumerated in FL subsection 5-525(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">(i) the child\u2019s ability to be safe and healthy in the home of the child\u2019s parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">(ii) the child\u2019s attachment and emotional ties to the child\u2019s natural parents and siblings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">(iii) the child\u2019s emotional attachment to the child\u2019s current caregiver and the caregiver\u2019s family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">(iv) the length of time the child has resided with the current caregiver;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">(v) the potential emotional, developmental, and educational harm to the child if moved from the child\u2019s current placement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\">(vi) the potential harm to the child by remaining in State custody for an excessive period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">In addition to prescribing procedures for reviewing the welfare of children in foster care, the General Assembly also listed, in FL section 5\u2014313(c)(2), these similar factors that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>courts must consider in determining whether to terminate parental rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">(i) the timeliness, nature, and extent of the services offered by the child placement agency to facilitate reunion of the child with the natural parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">(ii) any social service agreement between the natural parent and the child placement agency, and the extent to which all parties have fulfilled their obligations under the agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">(iii) the child\u2019s feelings toward and emotional ties with the child\u2019s natural parents ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">(iv) the child\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">(v) the result of the effort the natural parent has made to adjust the natural parent\u2019s circumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it in the best interest of the child to be returned to the natural parent\u2019s home, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">1. the extent to which the natural parent has maintained regular contact with the child under a plan to reunite the child with the natural parent ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">2. if the natural parent is financially able, the payment of a reasonable part of the child\u2019s substitute physical care and maintenance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-11\">3. the maintenance of regular communication by the natural parent with the custodian of the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-12\">4. whether additional services would be likely to bring about a lasting parental adjustment so that the child could be returned to the natural parent within an ascertainable time, not exceeding 18 months from the time of placement, but the court may not consider whether the maintenance of the parent-child relationship may serve as an inducement for the natural parent\u2019s rehabilitation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-13\">(vi) all services offered to the natural parent before the placement of the child, whether offered by the agency to which the child is committed or by other agencies or professionals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">For children who have been adjudicated CI\u00d1A, FL subsection 5\u2014313(d) requires the court also to consider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>whether any of the following continuing or serious conditions or acts exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">(i) the natural parent has a disability that renders the natural parent consistently unable to care for the immediate and ongoing physical or psychological needs of the child for long periods of time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">(ii) the natural parent has committed acts of abuse or neglect toward any child in the family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">(iii) the natural parent has failed repeatedly to give the child adequate food, clothing, shelter, and education or any other care or control necessary for the child\u2019s physical, mental, or emotional health, even though the natural parent is physically and financially able;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">(iv) 1. A. the child was born exposed to cocaine, heroin, or a derivative thereof as evidenced by any appropriate tests of the mother or child; ... and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">2. the natural parent refuses the recommended level of drug treatment, or fails to fully participate in the recommended level of drug treatment^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">There is good reason to require courts to consider these factors and then explain on the record a decision to terminate parental rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">A mistake in the process would irrevocably deprive the parent of a fundamental constitutional right. It is for this reason that every procedural safeguard must be carefully followed. Thus, the applicable statute has been construed to require express findings of fact with regard to each statutory factor, before a decision granting a petition to terminate parental rights may be sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-11\"><em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 95195062, </em>116 Md.App. 443, 460-61, 696 A.2d 1102 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">The Decision To Terminate The As\u2019 Parental Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">In this instance, the court fulfilled its threshold obligation to consider the specific factors and conditions enumerated in FL subsections 5-313(c) and 5-313(d). Among those circumstances that applied to Victor, the court found with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>respect to Mr. A., that he paid child support; maintained regular contact with Victor and regular communications with Mrs. Plumley; did not \u201ccommit[ ] an act of negligence towards [Victor]\u201d; and did not repeatedly fail to give Victor adequate food, clothing, shelter, and education or any other care or control necessary for [his] physical, mental or emotional health[.]\u201d Unlike Ms. A, whose substance abuse and bipolar II disorder rose to the level of \u201ca disability that rendered her] consistently unable to care for the immediate and ongoing physical or psychological needs of [Victor] for long periods of time,\u201d the court found that \u201cMr. A did not suffer from any such type of disability.\u201d Mr. A \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with his agreement to participate in parenting classes. With respect to the critical factor of whether returning Victor to Mr. A would pose an unacceptable risk to Victor\u2019s future safety, the court stated that it \u201ccannot make such a finding[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Thus, the court determined that most of the relevant factors and conditions identified in sections 5-313 and 5-525 did not justify terminating Mr. A\u2019s parental rights. Rather, the court concluded only that Mr. A did not fulfill his agreement to \u201cobtain adequate housing[.]\u201d The court treated Mr. A\u2019s failure to arrange for appropriate housing as a failure to \u201cput himself in a position to make it in the best interests based on the conditions as they exist today to return [Victor] to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The circuit court then turned to the ultimate issue of whether to terminate the As\u2019 parental rights. It explicitly framed its decision in terms of the requirements of FL subsection 5-313(a)(3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That subsection allows a court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>terminate parental rights and to grant the DSS guardianship with the right to consent to adoption \u201cif the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interest of the child\u201d to do so and determines that</p>\n<p id=\"Aen\">the following set of circumstances exists:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">(i) the child has been continuously out of the custody of the natural parent and in the custody of a child placement agency for at least 1 year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">(ii) the conditions that led to the separation from the natural parent still exist or similar conditions of a potentially harmful nature still exist;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">(iii) there is little likelihood that those conditions will be remedied at an early date so that the child can be returned to the natural parent in the immediate future; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">(iv) a continuation of the relationship between the natural parent and the child would diminish greatly the child\u2019s prospects for early integration into a stable and permanent family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">FL \u00a7 5-313(a)(3)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">The court easily concluded that the first two circumstances were present. With respect to the third circumstance, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>court found that neither parent was likely to become able to care for Victor in the immediate future. \u201cMrs. A ... is still in a position of dealing with her own personal problems, and Mr. A has really not put himself in a better position to deal with Victor, Junior\u2019s problems[,]\u201d having \u201cchose[n] to wait for the [cjourt to act before acting\u201d to remedy his housing inadequacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The court then considered the fourth and last circumstance. It acknowledged that there is a factual dispute about whether continuing the parent-child relationship would significantly reduce Victor\u2019s chances for adoption or for successful early integration into an adoptive family.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">The Department says that it would. The counsel on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. A argue that it wouldn\u2019t. The [cjourt finds that from the child\u2019s perspective that, in essence, the dynamics of this particular case is that the County, the Department, has, in fact, offered services. And that the different terms of view with respect to what is in the best interests of the child, in terms of the County, is apparent. We just take the position against the natural parents\u2019 beliefs that the conflict is going to exist. And that the unfortunate situation for the [cjourt is that, at least as the case is postured today, is the [cjourt is going to have to choose between one of the parents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The court proceeded to address the ultimate matter of whether termination is in Victor\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">So now we get to the question as to whether the [cjourt finds by clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interests of the child to terminate the natural parent\u2019s rights. And that is what it all comes down to. And this is the hard part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">The [cjourt is clearly convinced that the [cjounty is a better parent and that it is in the better interests of the child. But whether it is in the best interests to terminate his parents\u2019 rights I am not sure. I am not going to say at 5:08 [p.m.j whether it is. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">After suggesting mediation, the court took the DSS\u2019s petition under advisement. Six weeks later, on September 29, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>issued a written order granting the petition. In pertinent part, the order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">[T]his [cjourt concludes that it is in the best interests of Victor [A] for termination of his natural parents rights; and....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">[T]he [c]ourt also finds that until such time as the \u201cDepartment\u201d identifies such adoptive or long-term resource, that it is in the best interests of Victor ... to continue visitation with [Ms. A. and Mr. A] under the supervision of the \u201cDepartment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We find the court\u2019s decision to terminate the As\u2019 parental rights inadequate in two respects. First, the court did not make an essential factual finding. The Court of Appeals has \u201cmade clear that required findings of fact in a termination of parental rights case are essential, so that an appellate court can effectively review this \u2018drastic measure.\u2019\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship 95195062, </em>116 Md.App. at 461, 696 A.2d 1102 (citing <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 87A262, </em>323 Md. 12, 20, 590 A.2d 165 (1991)). The task of determining whether continuing either one of the As\u2019 parent-child relationships is likely to \u201cgreatly diminish\u201d Victor\u2019s prospects of finding and integrating into an adoptive home\u2014the finding required by section 5-313(a)(3)(iv)\u2014belonged to the circuit court sitting as a fact-finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The court never decided whether or how continuation of the As\u2019 parental rights would harm Victor\u2019s prospects for adoption, or otherwise diminish his ability to integrate early into an adoptive home. Neither the bench colloquy nor the written order clearly resolved that issue with respect to either parent. To the contrary, the court\u2019s decision that it is in Victor\u2019s best interest to continue parental visits \u201cuntil such time as the [DSS] identifies such adoptive or long-term resource\u201d suggests the court was not persuaded that allowing the As to continue their relationship with Victor would hurt those prospects. We hold that it was error to terminate the As\u2019 parental rights under section 5-313(a)(3) without determining that continua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>tion would diminish Victor\u2019s opportunity to find a suitable adoptive home.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">But that was not the only inadequacy. The court\u2019s second error was that it did not explain its mixed conclusion of fact and law that termination of the As\u2019 parental rights is in Victor\u2019s best interest. Given the court\u2019s many favorable factual findings on the section 5-313(c) and (d) factors (at least with respect to Mr. A), the uncertainties about the value of termination to Victor as expressed by the court at the end of the August 14 hearing, the court\u2019s failure to find that continuing the As\u2019 relationship with Victor greatly diminished his prospects for early integration into a stable and permanent family, and its decision to continue the As\u2019 visiting relationship with Victor, we decline the DSS\u2019s invitation to rubber stamp the court\u2019s unexplained statement that termination is in Victor\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">A finding that terminating parental rights is in a child\u2019s best interest is a judicial determination with extreme constitutional and emotional consequence. For that reason, we cannot approve boilerplate statements that merely repeat the best interest standard. The specific reasons for the court\u2019s best interest determination must be explained on the record, in a manner that permits appellate review. Here, the circuit court erred in failing to articulate why it concluded that termination is in Victor\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Both omissions tainted the decision to terminate the As\u2019 parental rights. Subsection 5-313(a)(3) authorizes the court to exercise its power to terminate only if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that termination is in Victor\u2019s best interests and that it is necessary to ensure Victor\u2019s prospects for early integration into a permanent home. We are not permitted to delve into the record to make necessary factual findings or to concoct a <em>post hoc </em>explanation for the circuit court\u2019s termination decision. <em>See In re Adoption/Guardianship 95195062, </em>116 Md.App. at 460, 696 A.2d 1102. Consequently, the circuit court\u2019s failures to make the requisite \u201cdiminished prospects\u201d finding and to explain why termination of each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>parent\u2019s rights is in Victor\u2019s best interest require us to vacate the order and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The DSS\u2019s Reasons For Seeking Termination</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Because the remand court may be asked to consider them, we shall address two of the primary arguments offered by the DSS in support of its decision to seek adoption and termination. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131 (a). The DSS asserts that \u201c[o]nly termination of parental rights offers Victor ... the opportunity to find a permanent, stable home through adoption\u201d and that \u201call foster care is inherently unstable.\u201d Victor\u2019s caseworkers testified that they did not consider, as an alternative to adoption with termination of parental rights, leaving Victor with Plumley (or another therapeutic foster parent) and letting the A\u2019s exercise their parental rights through visitation, because \u201c[t]here has to be some movement on these cases. That\u2019s part of the policy.\u201d When asked specifically why the DSS ruled out long term foster care for Victor, they pointed to the statutory priority favoring adoption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">Long-term foster care is pretty far down on the list. It\u2019s ... the last resort for a child. It leaves the child in limbo[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">In this appeal, the DSS and counsel for Victor continue to argue that \u201c[t]he law frowns on [the As\u2019] solution of long-term foster care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The DSS\u2019s rather shallow explanations for its decision to seek termination raise concern that the DSS considers termination of the As\u2019 parental rights to be justified by either its need to explore adoption prospects for Victor or a presumption that adoption is \u201cinherently\u201d or \u201calways\u201d better than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>foster care. A decision to seek termination of parental rights may not be premised solely on these reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">As a threshold matter, we emphasize that there is nothing in the statutory scheme governing termination of parental rights mandating that termination must occur before the DSS can begin to investigate and work toward adoption. To the contrary, the General Assembly explicitly authorized local departments to undertake \u201c[reasonable efforts to place a child for adoption or with a legal guardian ... concurrently with [other] reasonable efforts,\u201d such as reunification. <em>See FL </em>\u00a7 5\u2014525(d)(3). Thus, we see no impediment to the DSS investigating the adoption prospects for a particular child before it then decides to seek termination. Consequently, we do not agree with the DSS that \u201conly termination offers Victor\u201d the \u201copportunity to find a permanent stable home through adoption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Nor can we agree that the statutory priority given to adoption should be treated as a generic instruction to seek adoption and termination in all cases. To be sure, there is a clearly articulated public policy favoring adoption over foster care. In FL sections 5-525(e) and 5-525.1(c), and CJ section 3-823(f), the General Assembly expressed its preference for reunification, adoption, and kinship care over continued foster care. But these provisions do not create a conclusive, unrebuttable presumption that adoption and termination are always preferable in every case. The best interest standard \u201cdoes not require simply that a determination be made that one environment or set of circumstances is superior to another. If that were the ease, child custody matters would involve rather simple choices.\u201d <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 565, 819 A.2d 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Instead, as the statutory priority implicitly recognizes, there may be some cases in which a foster care permanency plan is more desirable than an adoption permanency plan. In particular, the provisions of section 5-525 concerning foster care of children with physical and mental disabilities reveal the General Assembly\u2019s explicit recognition that the most common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>solutions of reunification and adoption may not be appropriate for some special needs children.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">When, as in this case, the primary reason for a foster care placement is to ensure appropriate care for the child\u2019s physical and mental disabilities, there is an even stronger need for case-specific consideration of whether terminating parental rights is in the child\u2019s best interest. In deciding to seek termination, a local department is not compelled to adhere to the usual statutory time lines. Nor may it rely solely on the statutory priority to define the child\u2019s best interest, or conclusively presume that the child\u2019s best interest will be advanced by terminating his natural parents\u2019 rights in the speculative hope that the local department eventually will identify and recruit an adoptive family who can meet the child\u2019s special needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Whether Victor is that rare child whose best interests are served by a foster care permanency plan that does not require termination of parental rights, at least for now, is what the DSS and the circuit court were obligated to decide. That determination required more than rote adherence to an \u201cadoption for all\u201d policy and practice. It required a detailed examination of Victor\u2019s individual needs, his specific prospects for finding a suitable adoptive or permanent foster care home, and the relative advantages and disadvantages of the proposed adoptive home over any permanent or long term foster care alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">We cannot discern from this record whether Victor received this type of individualized consideration. Although there was evidence that, after deciding to change the permanency plan to adoption, the DSS used a national database to locate potentially \u201clicensed and available and interested\u201d adoptive homes in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, the court\u2019s order shows that it did not find any of those prospects to be sufficiently \u201cidentified\u201d or viable that they warranted cutting off Victor\u2019s visits with his parents. Together, the testimony of the DSS caseworkers and the DSS\u2019s reliance on generic reasons for terminating the As\u2019 parental rights suggest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the DSS may have rejected the less drastic alternative of finding Victor a permanent foster home that would allow the As\u2019 to maintain their parental rights because it treated the statutory priority for adoption as a conclusive presumption that adoption is always better than foster care for every child.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Whether the prospect of future adoption justifies terminating the rights of parents whose young child\u2019s physical and mental health limitations demand that he live \u201cin the here and now\u201d is something that the DSS and the circuit court must also consider. There is substantial evidence in this record to support the circuit court\u2019s finding that it is in Victor\u2019s best interest to continue a relationship with his parents while the DSS searches for a suitable permanent home. As reflected in the visitation order, the court was not convinced that Victor would benefit from ending his relationship with his parents at a time when the court felt there was no specifically identified prospect for adoption. The search for a suitable adoptive family may prove to be difficult and long. We see no evidence that continuing the As\u2019 parental rights along with their visitation is likely to impair Victor\u2019s adoption prospects.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Before deciding to pursue the more drastic course of adoption and termination of parental rights, the DSS and court should carefully consider whether continuing Victor\u2019s current long term foster care placement with Mrs. Plumley (or another suitable caregiver), while allowing Mr. A and/or Ms. A to retain their parental rights and the DSS to continue its search for a permanent home, satisfies Victor\u2019s best interest while preserving the As\u2019 constitutional rights. There are a number of factors relevant to that determination, many of which are not answered by the record before us. These include how long a search might take, whether termination of the As\u2019 parental rights would help Victor during that search, whether there is a suitable permanent foster home that allows continuation of the As\u2019 parental rights, and what advantages Victor might enjoy at a particular home.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">What is in the best interest of Victor is a task first for the DSS and ultimately for the circuit court, after careful review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>of Victor\u2019s current circumstances. <em>See In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 625, 819 A.2d 1030. On remand, the DSS and the circuit court must assess Victor\u2019s best interests without presuming that an adoptive family can be found for Victor only if his parents\u2019 rights are terminated, or that adoption with termination of parental rights is \u201cinherently\u201d or \u201calways\u201d better than foster care and preservation of parental rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">JUDGMENT VACATED. CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-9\">. Ms. A and Mr. A divorced after Victor's birth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-10\">. Plumley explained that, for three weeks, she had measured out the exact dosage of the medication that needed to be administered during an overnight visit and gave it to Mr. A. The first week no medication was gone, the second week too much was gone from one bottle and too little from the other, and the final week Victor's medications again were not administered properly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b443-8\">. TMAN was created by the DSS and the Prince George's County Health Department to help babies born affected by heroin or cocaine and their mothers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\">. Ms. A was presented with a series of service agreements from the time Victor was born. On August 17, 2000, Ms. A signed a service agreement promising to continue her participation in the CAP program and to attend parenting training. She did so. When Victor was placed with Jackie Plumley in April 2001, Ms. A was presented another service agreement, asking her to undergo a psychological evaluation, participate in substance abuse treatment and urinalyses testing, and take parenting classes for Victor\u2019s special needs. She returned the agreement unsigned, explaining that she disliked the caseworker's statement that Victor was mentally retarded in addition to having cerebral palsy. Ms. A received a substantially similar service agreement on June 29, 2001. She again refused to sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">After the DSS changed the permanency plan to adoption, on June 14, 2002, Ms. A executed a service agreement, agreeing to another psychological evaluation, random drug testing, substance abuse treatment, and parenting courses specifically designed for the parents of children with special needs. Ms. A complied with those requirements and moved into the Shepherd's Cove shelter, which required drug testing for its residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Ms. A received another draft service agreement on August 9, 2002, but stated that she wished to review it with her counsel before signing. The caseworker never received a response from Ms. A. On September 20, the caseworker mailed another draft agreement, this time to both Ms. A and her counsel. But she never heard back from either of them. Ms. A similarly failed to respond to draft service agreements given to her on December 12, 2002 and June 12, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\">. Foster care placements may be made on a short term basis, generally for 180 days or less, under a voluntary placement agreement. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 5\u2014525(a)(1). Alternatively, a child may be placed into foster care by a juvenile court that determines he or she has been \u201cabused, abandoned, neglected, or dependent\u201d and in need of an out-of-home placement. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\">. For example, voluntary foster care placements are intended to last \"no more than 180 days.\u201d <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 5-525(a)(l)(i). For children who have been declared CI\u00d1A, a permanency plan hearing must be held within 11 months of when a child entered foster care. <em>See </em>CJ 3-823(b)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b460-6\">. The court did not rest its decision solely on Victor's prior adjudication as a child in need of assistance, which is identified as an independent ground for termination in FL section 5-313(a)(2)(court may terminate parental rights if that is in child's best interest and child has previously been adjudicated a child in need of assistance). We assume that was deliberate rather than inadvertent, <em>see Perry v. State, </em>381 Md. 138, 154 n. 8, 848 A.2d 631 (2004), particularly since there was good reason to rely on subsection 5-313(a)(3) instead of subsection (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The circuit court apparently wished to avoid terminating the As\u2019 parental rights based only on the special needs that led to Victor\u2019s CINA proceedings. As the court found, Victor\u2019s CINA adjudication stemmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>from Mr. A's inability to provide the \u201cherculean\u201d care necessary to meet infant Victor's special needs, not from abuse or consistent neglect. In these circumstances, we infer the court determined that tying its decision to the CINA adjudication would unreasonably and inappropriately \"piggyback\u201d the termination of parental rights onto Victor\u2019s special needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">When, as in this case, a parent\u2019s inability to meet his child\u2019s severe physical and mental health needs at home results in a CINA adjudication, and the child continues to need specialized care that the parent cannot give at home, reliance on the CINA adjudication as grounds for termination effectively would place such profoundly disabled children and their parents at high risk of losing their opportunity to enjoy whatever parent-child relationship they might be able to develop, notwithstanding the child\u2019s physical or developmental limitations. In effect, the most disadvantaged of our children always would be at greater risk of losing their relationship with their parents than those children who are more fortunate. <em>Cf. In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 571, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003)(presumption that child\u2019s best interests are served by maintaining parental rights arises from child's need for opportunity to develop close and loving relationship with parents, even when parents are among the \"most disadvantaged of our adult citizens\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b465-10\">. Given our disposition on other grounds, we shall not address the As' challenges to the court\u2019s conclusion that neither of them will be able to care for Victor within a reasonable period of time. Although there is substantial evidence in this record to support the court's factual findings, including its finding that returning Victor to Ms. A would pose an unacceptable threat to his safety, the remand court \"may give fresh consideration to the entire situation,\u201d including consideration of how the special services provided to the foster parent might aid in caring for Victor at home. <em>See In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 625, 819 A.2d 1030.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b469-15\">. If (he DSS has been making efforts during this appeal to locate an adoptive family for Victor, the results of that search may indicate whether there are any viable prospects for adoption that might justify termination of the As' parental rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
