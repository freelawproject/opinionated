In decid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>ing the case, we have the opportunity to discuss the procedures set forth in Maryland Code (1974, 1996 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 14-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the Real Property Article (\u201cRP\u201d), which prescribe both how a broker establishes a lien and, more particular to this case, how the owner responds to that effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">All of the individuals involved in the controversy are the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the late David W. and Annie Chertkof. As a result of the dispute, appellant, Howard L. Chertkof &amp; Co., Inc., filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County a petition to establish a broker\u2019s lien (\u201cthe petition\u201d), pursuant to RP \u00a7 14-304. Howard Chertkof was the president and principal of appellant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Appellant lodged the petition against Howard Chertkofs cousins, Joseph Gimbel, Helene Miller, Stephanie Prince, Jeffrey Clayten, Donald Brown, and Martha Lee Fendler, appellees. The petition related to the property located at 439-51 Eastern Avenue in Essex (\u201cthe Property\u201d), which is now leased to the State of Maryland. Initially, appellant sought a lien of $54,862.50, but later amended the claim to $67,237.50. Appellant\u2019s claim is predicated largely on a Management Agreement executed in April 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Following the sale of the Property to appellees, appellant filed a petition for a broker\u2019s lien. The circuit court issued an order directing appellees to show cause why the lien should not issue. Appellees duly responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The court, finding probable cause to believe that appellant was entitled to a lien, by memorandum and order established an interlocutory lien and identified four issues to be decided at trial. Following a bench trial, another member of the court ruled in a written opinion that appellant was not entitled to a broker\u2019s lien and entered judgment terminating the interlocutory lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Appellant presents the following questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>I. Did the trial court err in denying the petition for broker\u2019s lien: (a) based on issues that were not alleged by appellees in their response to the petition; (b) in the face of statute and case law providing that any matters not so raised were waived; (c) on issues which were not identified as issues for trial in the July 3, 2000, order imposing an interlocutory lien; (d) on ' issues on which appellees had the burden of pleading and proof, and (e) on issues which appellant had no notice were to be considered by the trial court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">II. Did the trial court err in ruling that appellees were bona fide purchasers for value of the Property, where appellees were owners of the Property before and after the lease with the State was signed, were fully aware of appellant\u2019s claim, and where appellees contractually agreed to pay the lease commission under the Management Agreement with appellant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">III. Did the court below err in ruling that appellant was not entitled to a broker\u2019s lien based upon \u00b6 15.2 of the Management Agreement, in the absence of any evidence related to that provision, and where that provision addresses the internal allocation of certain expenses, as between and among the owners, and does not address the commissions for new leases owed to third parties such as appellant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">For the reasons that follow, we vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The relevant underlying facts are contained in the unpublished opinion of this Court authored by the Honorable Ellen L. Hollander, <em>Howard L. Chertkof &amp; Co., Inc. v. Joseph Gimbel, et al., </em>No. 969, September Term, 2001 (filed June 25, 2002) <em>(\u201cChertkof I </em>\u201d). We repeat that factual summary here:</p>\n<p id=\"AXo\">On or about February 9,1968, the late David W. Chertkof and his wife, Annie, executed a Revocable Trust Agreement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>by which they created the \u201cDWC Trust.\u201d Its assets consisted of approximately twenty commercial properties, including the Property that is at the center of this controversy. The DWC Trust created a life interest in its assets for the benefit of the Chertkofs\u2019 four children: Jack Chertkof (who died in 1982), Ethel Posnick (who died in January 1995), Ben Clayten (who died in October 1995), and Helen Gimbel (who died in 1997). After the DWC Trust was created, it was divided into four separate \u201cfamily branch trusts,\u201d one for each of the Chertkofs\u2019 four children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon the death of the last of the Chertkofs\u2019 four children, the trust assets were to be distributed. The DWC Trust Holding Company (the \u201cHolding Company\u201d), a Maryland corporation, was created after the death of Jack Chertkof in 1982. As a nominee corporation, it held bare legal title to the trust properties, for the benefit of the heirs under the DWC Trust.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The individuals involved in this case had remainder or beneficial interests in the DWC Trust assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Following the death of Jack Chertkof, both Helen Gimbel and Ethel Posnick, the sisters of Jack Chertkof, became trustees of the DWC Trust. They entered into a management agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with appellant, dated April 28, 1988, as to the trust properties. Ms. Posnick signed the Agreement on behalf of the trustees. According to appellant, even after the deaths of Posnick and Gimbel, and continuing until September 22, 1999, appellant provided all of the services required under the Agreement to the eleven \u201ctenants-in-common,\u201d including appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Paragraph 13 of the Agreement provides: \u201cAll covenants and agreements herein contained shall bind and inure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Under the Agreement, appellant became the \u201csole and exclusive\u201d management agent for the rental properties that were in the trust, and the \u201csole and exclusive agent for lease of any of the Properties.... \u201d Under \u00b6 6 of the Agreement, appellant had \u201cthe right and the duty to conduct lease negotiations\u201d for the various properties. Further, the manner in which lease commissions for new leases were to be calculated is set forth in \u00b6 14.1.1 of the Agreement. With respect to appellant\u2019s eligibility for a lease commission, the Agreement states in \u00b6 14.1.2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">14.1.2 It is understood and agreed that Agent shall be the sole and exclusive agent for lease of the Properties and shall be entitled to a commission for lease of any of the Properties for which it (alone or working with another agent or broker) procures a tenant, as provided above----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The term of the Agreement was for one year, commencing on May 1, 1988, after which it was to continue on a month-to-month basis. The Agreement was to terminate 60 days after service of a written notice to that effect by either party. <em>See </em>\u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Paragraph 14.4 of the Agreement is relevant. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">14.4 Upon expiration of this Agreement, Agent shall furnish Owners with a list of prospects who have inspected or made inquiries respecting any of the Properties and if within six months after the termination of this Agreement, any of the Properties is sold or leased to any prospect on such list, Agent shall be entitled to receive from Owners an amount equal to the commission provided for above, as if the transaction had occurred prior to the expiration of the terms of this Agreement. However, Agent shall not be entitled to any commission if any of the Properties is sold or leased to any other person at any time after termination of this Agreement or to any pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>pect <em>more, than six months after the termination of this Agreement</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Paragraph 15.2 of the Agreement is also noteworthy. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">15.2 If during the term of this Agreement, Owners sell a Property (or more than one Property) that is subject to management hereunder, that Property shall be withdrawn from the legal operation and affect [sic] of this Agreement from and after closing for the sale of that Property, and Agent shall no longer be entitled to management fees for any such Property after such closing, but Agent shall be entitled to any Lease Commission for such Property to which agent may be entitled under section Fourteen above for the remainder of the then current term of the Lease for such Property.... This provision shall include and apply to a sale or transfer to another person (or persons) and/or entity (or entities) <em>who may already be one of the Owners hereunder, </em>so that such person (or persons) and/or entity (or entities) shall then hold full title to the Property so sold or transferred and the other then Owners of such Property hereunder shall divest themselves entirely of any title or interest in such Property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Helen Gimbel, the last surviving child of David and Annie Chertkof, died in 1997. According to appellant, upon the death of Ms. Gimbel, the beneficial or remainder interests in the remaining trust properties passed to the eleven grandchildren or great-grandchildren of David and Annie Chertkof, as tenants in common.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They are: Howard L. Chertkof and E. Robert Chertkof, the sons of Jack Chertkof; Joseph Gimbel and Stephanie Prince, the children of Helen Gimbel; Martha Lee Fendler and Jeffrey Clayten, the children of Ben Clayten; Helene Miller and Phyllis Hayman, two of the three daughters of Ethel Posnick, and Sharon Silveria, Diane Kelty, and Donald Brown, the grandchildren of Ethel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Posnick and the children of Ethel Posnick\u2019s late daughter, Ms. Brown, who predeceased Ethel Posnick.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In August 1997, E. Robert and Howard Chertkof filed an action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for sale in lieu of partition, seeking to separate the interests of the eleven beneficial owners of the trust properties, including the Property at issue here. R. Taylor McLean, Esquire was appointed as trustee to sell the properties, pursuant to a Consent Order of October 26, 1998. Appellees filed counterclaims as well as \u201cthird party\u201d claims against appellant, alleging breaches of various obligations under the Agreement. Those claims were dismissed voluntarily, without prejudice, on November 9,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">All of the trust properties were sold by the trustee, either to third parties or to the appellees. In particular, the Property was sold by the Trustee to the appellees, pursuant to a Contract of Sale dated April 19, 1999 (the \u201cContract\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">Paragraph 9 of the Contract states, in part: \u201cBuyer, who is now a beneficial owner of the Property, has agreed to purchase from Seller, who is the remaining beneficial owner of the property, all of Seller\u2019s interest in the property for the amounts shown in Exhibit B____\u201d As to the subject Property, appellees acquired the Seller\u2019s interest of 64.444%. Therefore, prior to the settlement on September 22, 1999, [together, appellees were] the beneficial owner of 35.55% of the subject Property. The Contract provides that the purchase of the Seller\u2019s interest was \u201cintended to be the entire tenant in common interests in the Property of Seller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The Property was the last remaining property under the Agreement. Therefore, following the settlement on the Contract on September 22, 1999, all of the properties managed by appellant under the Agreement had been disposed of. Accordingly, pursuant to the terms of \u00b6 2 of the Agreement, by letter dated August 31, 1999, appellant tendered a 60 day notice of its intent to terminate the Agreement. In accordance with \u00b6 14.4 of the Agreement, appellant identified the State of Maryland as a prospective lessee of the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Effective December 15, 1999, and within six months of the termination of the Agreement, the State entered into a lease with appellees with respect to the Property. The lease generates annual gross income of $220,000.00 and carries a ten-year term. It is that lease that has spawned the underlying controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Appellant claims that, prior to execution of the contract, and before settlement, \u201cthe broker had engaged in substantial lease negotiations, as per the exclusive listing agency provided in Management Agreement, with the State of Maryland, Department of Human Resources (\u2018DHR\u2019), for commercial space in the Property, services of which appellees w[ere] aware and accepted.\u201d In particular, appellant contends that the \u201cappellant spent hundreds of hours obtaining the DHR as a tenant, negotiating the terms of the lease, and proposing tenant improvements and providing cost estimates for that tenancy.\u201d Moreover, by letter of May 15, 1997, appellant maintains that appellees were fully informed of the proposal. Appellant also contends that the lease executed in December 1999 \u201ctracks the 1997 proposal of appellant in material respects.\u201d Alternatively, even if appellant were not the procuring cause of the lease, appellant asserts that, under the Agreement, it is entitled to a commission because it was the exclusive agent for the Property. Because no commission was paid, appellant sought to enforce its rights under the Agreement by filing the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Appellees counter that they did not execute a management agreement with appellant and are not bound by one. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Asserting that appellant had ceased negotiations with the State in 1997, appellees also contend that the lease between them and the State was negotiated by appellee Joseph Gimbel and a broker other than appellant, and that Joseph Gimbel devoted considerable effort to the negotiations. Further, appellees assert that the Contract was entered by [them] in April 1999, without notice of appellant\u2019s claim to a commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Upon the filing of the Petition, the circuit court issued a show cause order on April 11, 2000. On May 5, 2000, appellees filed an \u201cAnswer Showing Cause Why A Broker\u2019s Lien Should Not Issue,\u201d along with an affidavit of Joseph Gimbel. The show cause hearing took place on May 24, 2000. Thereafter, on July 3, 2000, the court issued an Order finding probable cause to believe that appellant was entitled to a broker\u2019s lien; the court established an interlocutory lien on the Property, in the amount of $54,862.50. Moreover, the Order provided for a trial limited to the following four issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">(1) Whether the defendants appellees are parties or successors to the Management Agreement in which the rights to a commission are contained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">(2) Whether the Management Agreement was terminated by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County by Consent Order of October 26, 1998;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">(3) Whether and to what extent any commission payable to Howard L. Chertkof &amp; Co., Inc. due pursuant to paragraph 14.4 of the Management Agreement must be earned pursuant to paragraph 14.1.2 of the Management Agreement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">(4) Whether and to what extent any commission payable to Howard L. Chertkof &amp; Co., Inc. would have to be reduced by the commission paid to Michael Glick for his efforts in procuring the lease [for the subject Property].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aah\">A bench trial was held on May 14, 2001. At the conclusion of trial, the court asked the parties for post-trial submissions on the issue of whether appellees were \u201cbona <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>fide purchasers for value\u201d of the Property, an issue that was apparently first raised by appellees at trial. Thereafter, by letter dated May 18, 2001, the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>raised the issue of whether \u00b6 15.2 of the Management Agreement applied to the matters before the court, and asked the parties to address that issue in their post-trial memoranda.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In an Opinion dated June 6, 2001, the circuit court concluded that appellant was not entitled to a broker\u2019s lien. Consequently, the court struck the interlocutory broker\u2019s lien and denied the Petition. In reaching its conclusion, the court relied on \u00b6 15.2 of the Agreement and determined that appellees were bona fide purchasers for value of the Property-</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><em>Chertkof I, </em>op. at 2-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Appellant appealed the circuit court\u2019s ruling. In <em>Chertkof I </em>we dismissed the appeal for lack of a final judgment. We remanded the case to the circuit court, directing that court to place a separate document in the record reflecting that a final judgment was entered for or against any of the parties. Following entry of an order granting judgment in favor of appellees, appellant timely filed the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">The circuit court ruled that, for two reasons, \u201cno commissions are due and owing to\u201d appellant. The court concluded, first, that the terms of the Agreement, in particular \u00b6 15.2, prohibited appellant\u2019s claim for a commission. In construing that paragraph, the court determined that the sale of the Property to appellees resulted in the Property having been \u201cwithdraw[n] from the legal operation and effect of the Agreement,\u201d and, thus, appellees did not owe appellant a commission relating to the subsequent lease of the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">The court concluded, second, that, \u201c[e]ven if the Management Agreement itself did not preclude the claim for a commission, the broker\u2019s lien statute,\u201d codified at RP \u00a7 14-301 <em>et </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>seq., </em>barred appellant\u2019s claim for a commission. The court based this conclusion on its preliminary finding that appellees were bona fide purchasers of the Property for value and, consequently, pursuant to RP \u00a7 14-302(b)(2)(i), a broker\u2019s lien could not be established against the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The court, however, could not properly rely upon either basis to support its ultimate decision that appellant was not entitled to a broker\u2019s lien. As we shall discuss, by not adhering to the applicable statutory procedures, appellees waived the argument that, by operation of \u00b6 15.2 of the Agreement, the Property was withdrawn from the purview of the Agreement and, as a result, was no longer subject to a broker\u2019s lien. In the absence of notice to appellant that appellees would be litigating their entitlement to a lien as against the \u00b6 15.2 defense, it was fundamentally unfair to appellant and thus error for the court to have ruled, on this basis, that appellant was not entitled to the requested lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">It was equally unfair to appellant that the court found appellees to have been bona fide purchasers of the Property for value, even though appellees had not raised this defense before trial. It was thus error for the court to have ruled, as a consequence of that finding, that appellant was not entitled for this reason as well to a broker\u2019s lien on the Property. Finally, although our disposition of the case does not require that we address the merits of the court\u2019s ruling that appellees were bona fide purchasers, we shall comment on the issue for future guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">With regard to \u00b6 15.2 of the Agreement, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">Chertkof &amp; Co. provided notice of its intent to terminate the Management Agreement on August 31, 1999. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Agreement itself terminated sixty days after service of that notice. Thus the Agreement actually terminated, at the latest, on October 30, 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The contract for the sale of the [ ] [Property was entered on April 19,1999, and the closing occurred on September 22, 1999. Thus a sale of one of the properties that was subject to the Management Agreement occurred during the term of the Agreement. In accordance with \u00b6 15.2, that property is considered to have been withdrawn from the legal operation and effect of the Agreement from and after the date of closing, which was September 22, 1999. As specifically stated in \u00b6 15.2, \u201cagents shall be entitled to any lease commissions for such property to which agent may be entitled under \u00b6 14 above for the remainder of the then-current term of the lease of such property.\u201d Thus, i[n] accordance with the express language of \u00b6 15.2, the only lease commissions that Chertkof &amp; Co. can seek under f 14 are those for the balance of [the] then-current lease. Otherwise, the property is considered to be withdrawn from the legal operation and effect of the Management Agreement. Accordingly, no commissions are due and owing to Chertkof &amp; Co. on the lease with the State of Maryland that was entered after the termination of the Management Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">(Footnotes and record citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Appellant contends, first, that the court erred in deciding appellant\u2019s entitlement to a broker\u2019s lien by resort to \u00b6 15.2, because appellees had waived the defense of the arguably foreclosing effect of \u00b6 15.2 upon this case. Appellant specifies that appellees did not include any reference to \u00b6 15.2 in either their answer to the show cause order or the affidavit of Joseph Gimbel that accompanied the answer; nor did they make any effort to have \u00b6 15.2 included among the issues to be resolved at trial. Appellant further argues that, in any event, the circuit court \u201cerred in interpreting \u00b6 15.2, without any extrinsic evidence, to provide that, upon the sale of any Property covered by the Agreement, the <em>only </em>lease commission that would be payable to appellant, under any circumstances, would be a commission for a lease already in place at the time of the sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Appellees, in addition to maintaining that the circuit court properly interpreted \u00b6 15.2, respond that they did not waive consideration of the \u00b6 15.2 issue. Appellees state that, throughout the litigation, they made clear that they were not bound by the Agreement at all, because there was no contractual privity between them and the parties to the Agreement. They insist that subsumed within this argument is the argument that appellant was foreclosed by \u00b6 15.2 of the Agreement from seeking a commission on the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We agree with appellant\u2019s first argument that appellees did not argue the implications of \u00b6 15.2 until invited to do so by the trial court, after the trial, in the post-trial submissions. We also agree that, because appellees did not take the steps necessary to have this question specified for trial, it was waived. The court therefore was precluded from deciding, on this ground, the merits of appellant\u2019s petition for a broker\u2019s hen.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">We come to this conclusion by resort to the broker\u2019s lien statute itself. This statute is modeled to a large extent upon the mechanic\u2019s lien statute and, like that statute, \u201cis remedial and shall be so construed to give effect to its purpose.\u201d RP \u00a7 14-310(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Just as does the mechanic\u2019s lien statute, the broker\u2019s hen statute prescribes in detail the procedure for obtaining a broker\u2019s hen on commercial property. Because of its relevance to our decision, we outline that procedure here.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Upon the filing of a petition and affidavit(s), RP \u00a7 14-304(a), the circuit court must determine if, on their face, a hen appears warranted, RP \u00a7 14-305(a)(l). If so, the court issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>a show cause order, directing the property owner to show cause why the lien should not attach. RP \u00a7 14\u2014305(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Section 14-305(a)(3) lays out what must be contained in the property owner\u2019s response to the show cause order, and describes the consequences of the owner\u2019s failure to comply with the statute\u2019s provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">(1) If the owner desires to controvert any statement of fact contained in the affidavit supporting the petitioner\u2019s claim, the owner shall file an affidavit in support of the owner\u2019s answer showing cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">(ii) The failure of the owner to file an opposing affidavit shall constitute an admission for the purposes of the proceedings of all statements of facts in the affidavit supporting the petitioner\u2019s claim, but shall not constitute an admission that a broker\u2019s petition or affidavit in support of the broker\u2019s petition is legally sufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">This provision is, in material respect, identical to RP \u00a7 9-106(a)(2) of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute. We have interpreted RP \u00a7 9-106(a)(2) to mean that an owner\u2019s failure to file an answer asserting the defense of waiver by the subcontractor of the right to seek a lien, is a waiver by the owner of the right to raise this defense by the subcontractor. <em>Ocean Plaza Joint Venture v.

Kalkreuth Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal, Inc., </em>109 Md.App. 569, 578-79, 675 A.2d 571 (stating that an owner\u2019s failure to file an answer amounted to, <em>inter alia, </em>a waiver of the right to assert affirmative defenses that the Maryland Rules deem waived unless specifically pled), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 Md. 564, 683 A.2d 177 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">By parity of reasoning, RP \u00a7 14-305, like its counterpart provision in the mechanic\u2019s lien statute, forecloses from consideration any defense not raised by an owner in an answer to a show cause order.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Appellees argue that the waiver rule discussed in <em>Ocean Plaza </em>applies only to the affirmative defenses listed in Maryland Rule 2-323(g), which must be raised in an answer or they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>are waived. Even if we were to agree with appellees that the \u00b6 15.2 defense is not waived just because they did not include it in their answer, we cannot agree with them that the trial court was entitled on its own to raise \u00b6 15.2 and then decide the case based on it. Indeed, such a conclusion would contravene the overall scheme of the broker\u2019s lien statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Under that statutory scheme, the show cause hearing is to be set \u201cat the earliest possible time.\u201d RP \u00a7 14-305(a)(4). The hearing is the equivalent of a hearing on a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Ocean Plaza, </em>62 Md.App. at 446, 490 A.2d 252. At the show cause hearing, if, based upon pleadings, affidavits, admissions, and evidence then before the court, there is no dispute of material fact on any issue, the court shall either enter or deny the lien as a matter of law. RP \u00a7 14-305(b)(l), (2). If the court determines that the lien cannot attach as a matter of law, but that there is probable cause to believe that a lien should attach, then the court, as is required by the comparable mechanic\u2019s lien provision, RP \u00a7 9-106(b)(3)(vi), \u201cshould [pass] an interlocutory order setting out the perimeters of the lien and setting the matter for the trial of all issues necessary to final adjudication.\u201d <em>Ocean Plaza, </em>62 Md.App. at 446-47, 490 A.2d 252; <em>see also Tyson v. Masten Lumber &amp; Supply, Inc., </em>44 Md.App. 293, 303-04, 408 A.2d 1051, <em>cert. denied, </em>287 Md. 758 (1980). This is because the court, at the show cause stage, is not the final arbiter of the disputed facts; instead, resolution of the disputed facts must await trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In <em>Tyson, </em>we were faced with a trial court\u2019s having entered final judgment at the show cause stage notwithstanding that there were disputed issues of material fact. We said, in this regard,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">[f]or that reason alone, the judge should not have entered a final order, but instead should have followed the clear direction of \u00a7 9-106(b)(3) and Md. Rule BG 73 d 2 [now Maryland Rule 12-304(e)(2)] and should have passed an interlocutory order setting out the perimeters of the lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>and setting the matter for trial <em>of all issues necessary to final adjudication.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 303, 408 A.2d 1051 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Of relevance to the instant case, we went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">There is yet another reason in the case now before us as to why the \u201cfinal order\u201d should not have been entered. Patently, the appellants appeared in court in answer to the show cause order. They made unmistakable the limited purpose of their visitation. Furthermore, they were not supplied, until literally the twelfth hour, with the answers to the interrogatories they had propounded to the petitioner, and they were in no position then to evaluate the answers and decide what other, if any, discovery they would employ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2R\"><em>Id. </em>at 303-04, 408 A.2d 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">It follows from <em>Tyson </em>that the mechanic\u2019s lien\u2019s statutory scheme requires that, when it has been determined that there exist factual or legal issues that must be resolved at a trial, trial must be limited to resolution of those issues as have been identified by the court in its interlocutory order (unless, of course, the order is later modified or dissolved).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Furthermore, failure to adhere to this procedure can work a fundamental unfairness to one or both parties. The fairness issues that undergird the mechanic\u2019s lien procedural scheme also inhere in the broker\u2019s lien scheme. Indeed, and as we have noted, the mechanic\u2019s lien statute is the model for the broker\u2019s lien statute, in part because the former has a judicial gloss that informs construction of the latter. <em>See supra </em>note 3. We see no reason to depart from the rationale of either <em>Tyson </em>or <em>Ocean Plaza </em>as we decide the waiver issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">In the present case, the court itself raised the applicability of \u00b6 15.2 of the Agreement, and decided that this provision of the Agreement foreclosed appellant from a broker\u2019s lien. Yet \u00b6 15.2 had not been cited by appellees in their answer to the show cause order, and it was not included among the questions identified in the interlocutory order as those that must be decided at trial. Neither did appellees seek to dissolve the order or modify it to add the \u00b6 15.2 issue, which they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>entitled to do. <em>See </em>RP \u00a7 14-805(b)(4) (stating that \u201c[t]he owner or any other person interested in the lien property may move to have the broker\u2019s lien established by the interlocutory order modified or dissolved at any time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The circuit court apparently equated appellees\u2019 asserted defense that they were not bound by the Agreement because they were not parties or successors to parties to the Agreement, with a defense that appellant was not entitled to a lien on the Property because, by application of \u00b6 15.2 of the Agreement, the Property had been withdrawn from the Agreement\u2019s purview. The circuit court decided that the \u201clack of contractual privity\u201d defense to application of the Agreement \u201cfairly raises the argument that appellees are not bound by the operation of provisions within the Management Agreement, including \u00b6 15.2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We do not agree. We have scrutinized appellees\u2019 answer to the show cause order. As we see it, the arguments presented there cannot be read to include an argument under \u00b6 15.2 that the sale of the Property withdrew it from operation of the Agreement. Because appellees did not raise the issue at any time before trial and did not seek to have it included among the triable issues, they waived it.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">We recognize that the court gave the parties the opportunity to submit post-trial memoranda on the applicability of \u00b6 15.2 to appellant\u2019s entitlement to a hen. Putting aside the significant facts that appellees had not argued the relevance of \u00b6 15.2 in their answer to the show cause order, and had not sought the issue\u2019s inclusion among those specified for trial, the court\u2019s decision to allow the parties to brief the issue for the first time post-trial fell far short of affording appellant a fair hearing on what turned out to be a dispositive issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">All of this left appellant who, after all, had the overall burden to establish the entitlement to a broker\u2019s lien, <em>see Winkler Constr. Co, Inc. v. Jerome, </em>355 Md. 231, 254, 734 A.2d 212 (1999), with an adverse decision based on a theory appellees did not raise, and upon which appellant had no opportunity to defend at trial by the offer of any evidence relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the question. We find instructive on this point the Court of Appeals\u2019 <em>Winkler </em>opinion. There, the Court held that an owner, against whose property a mechanic\u2019s lien has been claimed, has an obligation to bring to the court\u2019s attention information that \u201cis peculiarly within the knowledge of the owner\u201d and would defeat the lien claim. <em>Id. </em>at 255, 734 A.2d 212. If, in that situation, the owner does not avail itself of the opportunity to raise the issue and present relevant evidence on it, the mechanic\u2019s lien procedure permits the lien to be established, so long as the claimant has satisfied the conditions for it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">It would seem to follow from <em>Winkler </em>that when, as here, the owner has not presented the issue to the attention of the lien claimant and the court, either by response to the show cause order, or by seeking to have the issue specified for trial, the issue is not a proper one for decision by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Altogether, what occurred in this case concerning the \u00b6 15.2 issue significantly, and unfairly, disadvantaged appellant. <em>See Ocean Plaza, </em>62 Md.App. at 448, 490 A.2d 252; <em>Tyson, </em>44 Md.App. at 303-04, 408 A.2d 1051. The court should not have decided the merits of appellant\u2019s cause by reliance on \u00b6 15.2 of the Agreement, which was an issue upon which appellant, who must shoulder the burden of proving the right to a broker\u2019s lien, had no meaningful opportunity to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Appellant also challenges, on both procedural and substantive grounds, the court\u2019s additional ruling that appellees were bona fide purchasers for value and, as such, were entitled to the protection afforded by RP \u00a7 14\u2014302(b)(2)(i) of the broker\u2019s lien statute. This section provides: \u201cA commercial property may not be subjected to a broker\u2019s lien under this subtitle if, prior to the establishment of the broker\u2019s lien, legal title has been granted to a bona fide purchaser for value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">In an argument virtually identical to that which we addressed in Part I, appellant contends that the court errone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>ously relied on the operability of RP \u00a7 14-302(b)(2)(i) because appellees, having neither asserted this defense in their answer to the show cause order nor included it among the issues set for trial, waived their right to have the defense considered. Appellant further argues that, even if not waived by appellees, the court wrongly concluded that appellees were bona fide purchasers of the Property. Appellant asserts on this point: \u201cThere are two conditions which defeat a claim of bona fide purchaser for value: (1) where the purchaser has actual knowledge of lien-holder\u2019s claims before the purchase, and (2) where the purchasers are in contractual privity with the lien-holder.\u201d Appellant goes on to say: \u201cHere, both conditions exist[ ], thus defeating appellees\u2019 effort to be classified as bona fide purchasers for value of the Property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Appellees respond to appellant\u2019s waiver argument by directing us to footnote 6 of their answer to the show cause order. Appellees maintain that this footnote raised the bona fide purchaser for value issue. Appellees also point out that, at argument on appellees\u2019 motion for judgment, the court heard from counsel for both parties regarding the bona fide purchaser for value claim, and the court also asked the parties to submit post-trial memoranda on this issue. On the merits of appellant\u2019s assertion that appellees were not bona fide purchasers for value, appellees respond that, because legal and equitable title to the Property passed before establishment of the lien, the Property is not subject to a broker\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We agree with appellant that the court erred in ruling that appellant was not entitled to a broker\u2019s lien on the ground that appellees were bona fide purchasers for value. As was the case with the \u00b6 15.2 defense, the bona fide purchaser for value defense was not raised by appellees in their answer to the show cause order, and, moreover, was not among the issues identified for trial. This defense, like the \u00b6 15.2 defense, was waived by appellees and should not have been considered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We disagree with appellees that inclusion in their answer of a footnote citation to RP \u00a7 14\u2014302(b)(2)(i), without more, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>constituted an assertion of the bona fide purchaser for value defense. The footnote merely sets forth the text of RP \u00a7 14-302(b)(2)(i). Furthermore, in the text of the answer from which the footnote was dropped, appellees did not discuss the exemption for bona fide purchasers for value, nor did they assert anywhere in their answer that they held that status.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Moreover, as we have discussed in Part I, the court at the show cause stage is obliged to specify all issues for final adjudication so that the parties can have the opportunity to move to amend the interlocutory order to add issues for trial. And we have noted that the broker\u2019s lien statute provides a mechanism for modification of the triable issues that have been identified by the court. RP \u00a7 14-305(b)(4). Appellees took no steps to expand the triable issues to include bona fide purchaser for value.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The facts that the bona fide purchaser issue was discussed (for the first time and over appellant\u2019s objection) at appellees\u2019 motion for judgment at the close of appellant\u2019s case, and that the court allowed the parties to submit post-trial memoranda on the issue, do not erase appellees\u2019 procedural dereliction. More important, we cannot say that appellant was provided a full opportunity to litigate the issue. It cannot be gainsaid that, had the issue been raised before trial, appellant would have had the chance for discovery on the issue and been prepared to present evidence on it at trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We therefore hold that, in the absence of an assertion by appellees at any time before trial that as bona fide purchasers for value they were not subject to a broker\u2019s lien, that issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>like the \u00b6 15.2 issue, should not have been considered by the circuit court in ruling on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Our holding, above, disposes of the merits of the bona fide purchaser defense. We shall nonetheless comment upon it for any guidance it might have for future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">It is well settled that one who purchases real property without notice of prior equities is protected as a bona fide purchaser for value. <em>See, e.g., Lewis v. Rippons, </em>282 Md. 155, 161-62, 383 A.2d 676 (1978); <em>Grayson v. Buffington, </em>233 Md. 340, 343, 196 A.2d 893 (1964). We recently set forth the rule for determining whether a purchaser had notice of any prior equities or unrecorded interests that would preclude him from being entitled to protection as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser. <em>Beins v. Oden, </em>155 Md.App. 237, 244, 843 A.2d 147 (2004). We said that if the purchaser \u201c \u2018had knowledge of circumstances which ought to have put a person of ordinary prudence on inquiry, he will be presumed to have made such inquiry and will be charged with notice of all facts which such an investigation would in all probability have disclosed if it had been properly pursued.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">In the present case, the circuit court stated on the issue of bona fide purchaser:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">The only issue is whether these appellees are \u201cbona fide\u201d purchasers, in that appellant argues that they were on notice of the potential existence of a claim for a commission at the time the sale was consummated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">In the peculiar factual context of this case, the court does not find that argument convincing. The continued applicability of the commission provisions of the Management Agreement was debatable after the entry of [the] Consent Order.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] At the time of the contract for purchase of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>property, and at the time of the actual closing, no lease had been consummated. The sale was a legitimate, arms-length transaction, as it was done under Court supervision by a Court-appointed trustee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\">This was not a sale that, in any way, was intended to shelter or avoid a claim. It was also one in which the potential for a future claim was, at best, debatable at the time of the sale. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that these appellees were bona fide purchasers for value, against whom a lien cannot be asserted pursuant to RP \u00a7 14\u201430[2(b) ](2)(i).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The problem with the court\u2019s reasoning is that it seems to ignore the evidence that appellees knew of the Agreement and, as beneficial owners of the Property, benefitted from the services rendered by appellant under the Agreement. Moreover, there was undisputed evidence that appellant notified appellees, at least prior to settlement, of its intention to enforce the terms of the Agreement. And the record before us indicates that appellees apparently asserted, in prior litigation, that they were parties to the Agreement and were entitled to enforce it against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The court made no findings concerning any of this evidence. In particular, the court made no finding whether appellees knew of appellant\u2019s claim and, if so, when they knew; nor did the court determine whether appellees were parties to the Agreement. A finding that appellees knew of the claim before the transfer of title would certainly seem to negate their status as bona fide purchasers. <em>See Beins, </em>155 Md.App. at 244, 843 A.2d 147; <em>The Talbott Lumber Co. v. Tymann, </em>48 Md.App. 647, 654, 428 A.2d 1229 (stating, in a mechanic\u2019s lien case, that a buyer is not a bona fide purchaser for value if, at the time legal title was transferred, the purchaser \u201chad any notice ... of appellant\u2019s claim or potential claim, or any reasonable cause to make inquiry\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>290 Md. 723 (1981). A finding that appellees were parties to the Agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>ment (incidentally, one of the questions identified by the judge who issued the interlocutory order as having to be decided at trial) would similarly seem to negate bona fide purchaser status. <em>See York Roofing, Inc. v. Adcock, </em>333 Md. 158, 169, 634 A.2d 39 (1993) (observing that the transfer of legal title will not confer bona fide purchaser for value status if the \u201cnew\u201d legal owner is in contractual privity with the lien claimant on the underlying obligation). The circuit court erred in deciding that appellees were bona fide purchasers of the Property without first deciding either of these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">We have explained why the court should not have relied on either the \u00b6 15.2 rationale or the bona, fide purchaser rationale in ruling that appellant is not entitled to a broker\u2019s lien on the Property. In ruling as it did, the court did not decide (at least not expressly so) any of the four questions identified in the show cause order. We therefore vacate the judgment and remand this case to the circuit court for such further proceedings as the court deems necessary to resolve those as-yet-unanswered questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">JUDGMENT VACATED.

The legislative history of the broker\u2019s lien statute reveals two reasons why it was modeled after the mechanic\u2019s lien statute: the mechanic's lien law had survived testing for constitutionality; and litigants, lawyers, and courts could look to the case law interpreting comparable provisions of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute when construing provisions of the broker\u2019s lien law. <em>Hearing on SB 749 Before the Senate Comm, on Judicial Proceedings, </em>1994 Leg., 408th Sess.
