The plaintiff appealed to the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Court from the assessment of damages in the amount of $415,500 by the defendant for the taking of its property in Bridgeport for the relocation of route 25, Bridgeport-Newtown Road. That sum of money was deposited with the court in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 48-11 and was withdrawn by the plaintiff pursuant to that statute. The appeal from that assessment was referred to a state referee, who reassessed damages in the amount of $643,700. The court accepted the report of the referee and, inter alia, ordered interest to the date of rendition of judgment on the additional amount found by the referee to be due which had not been deposited with the clerk of the Superior Court for the use of the plaintiff at the time of taking. The plaintiff filed its motion for an award of additional interest on the increased amount computed from the date of the judgment to the date of payment of that amount.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The questions reserved for the advice of this court are three in number and are set forth in the footnote.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the view which we take of the case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the answer to the first question is dispositive of the reservation, and it becomes unnecessary for us to answer questions two and three as propounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Basically, it is the position of the defendant that payment of the judgment within a reasonable time after it has been rendered fulfils the constitutional requirement for payment of just compensation because otherwise \u201c[i]t is impossible to conceive the ability of the . . . State ... to make payment to the owner simultaneously with the instant of taking of the property or at the time of judgment being entered by the court\u201d and that \u201c[statutory requirements for making payment as well as the bureaucratic process preclude such simultaneous exchange of interests and values at the time of entering judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The issue in this case of a failure to award additional interest from the time of judgment to the date of payment is one of constitutional dimension.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A statutory rule for compensation cannot he pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>vided by the legislature which is less favorable than that required by constitutional mandate. The right to just compensation cannot be taken away by statute or be qualified by the omission of a provision for interest. Article first, \u00a7 11, of the constitution of Connecticut and the fifth amendment to the constitution of the United States provide that private property shall not be taken for public use without just, compensation, and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment guarantees the landowner the protection of the portion of the fifth amendment which requires the states to pay just compensation for private property taken for public use. <em>Chicago, B. &amp; Q.R. Co. </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>166 U.S. 226, 241, 17 S. Ct. 581, 41 L. Ed. 979; see <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 4, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Just compensation means the full, perfect and exact equivalent, in money, for the property taken. <em>Monongahela Navigation Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>148 U.S. 312, 326, 13 S. Ct. 622, 37 L. Ed. 463; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>317 U.S. 369, 63 S. Ct. 276, 87 L. Ed. 336, rehearing denied, 318 U.S. 798, 63 S. Ct. 557, 87 L. Ed. 1162; 27 Am. Jur. 2d 53, Eminent Domain, \u00a7 266. The United States Supreme Court to avoid use of the term \u201cinterest\u201d has stated that where property is taken before payment is made just compensation includes an additional sum which is \u201can amount sufficient to produce the full equivalent of that value paid contemporaneously with the taking.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Klamath &amp; Moadoc Tribes of Indians, </em>304 U.S. 119, 123, 58 S.
