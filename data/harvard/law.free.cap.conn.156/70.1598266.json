General Statutes \u00a7 13a-76. After a hearing, the referee, to whom the case was referred, filed his report, finding that the value of the entire property before the taking was $30,000, that the value of the portion remaining after the taking was $5600 and that the plaintiffs therefore sustained damages of $24,400. After the report had been filed, counsel other than the one who had represented the plaintiffs at the hearing filed a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>correct the report, which motion the referee denied. Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed in court a motion to open the hearing for the purpose of introducing evidence pertaining to the zoning of the property remaining after the taking. This motion was denied by the court, the plaintiffs\u2019 objections to the report were overruled, and judgment was rendered on the basis of the referee\u2019s award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From this judgment the plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">As stated in their brief, \u201c[t]he plaintiffs\u2019 basic argument is that an inadequate presentation of their case was made to the State Referee with respect to the value of the property before taking and the value of the property after the taking, particularly in view of the fact that the entire property was previously non-conforming under the Greenwich zoning regulations before the taking and obviously remained non-conforming under the regulations after the taking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The assignment of error based on the refusal of the court to order the case opened so that the plaintiffs might offer further evidence is without merit. \u201cThe granting or denial of such a motion rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, reviewable only in the case of abuse, and the situation presented is like that where a petition is made for a new trial for newly-discovered evidence under \u00a7 5701 [now \u00a7 52-270] of the General Statutes, and the same conditions are applicable. See <em>Meriden </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>v. <em>Rogers, </em>111 Conn. 115, 149 Atl. 406.\u201d <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>118 Conn. 291, 294, 172 A. 84. As stated in <em>Meriden </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>supra, 118, one of the essential conditions for the granting of such a motion is that the evidence which the party seeks to offer could not have been known and with reasonable diligence produced at the trial. See also <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Carone, </em>138 Conn. 405, 407, 85 A.2d 489; <em>McPartland </em>v. <em>Beaumart, Inc., </em>124 Conn. 539, 542, 200 A. 1018. The record does not disclose compliance with this indispensable requisite of prior due diligence. \u201cIf a party upon the filing of a decision unfavorable to him upon an issue which has been litigated at the trial has a right to have the judgment reopened to enable him to offer further testimony upon that issue, which might equally well have been offered at the trial, litigation would be prolonged beyond the requirements of a sound public policy.\u201d <em>Zuboff </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>120 Conn. 693, 694, 180 A. 295. This court has said that the maxim \u201cinterest reipublieae ut sit finis litium\u201d is one of the \u201cembodiments of wisdom and justice.\u201d <em>Burritt </em>v. <em>Belfy, </em>47 Conn. 323, 329; <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>R. Wallace &amp; Sons Mfg. Co., </em>100 Conn. 180, 187, 123 A. 9. The denial of the motion to open the hearing was not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"AE8\">The remaining assignments of error relate to the decision of the court overruling the plaintiffs\u2019 objections to the acceptance of the referee\u2019s report and the rendering of judgment thereon after the referee denied their motion to correct the report. In essence this is an attack on the finding of the referee as made \u201cwithout evidence or without complete evidence\u201d necessary to determine the value of the remaining property taking into consideration the zoning regulations. The appendices to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>briefs properly summarize the relevant evidence presented at the hearing. Practice Book \u00a7 716. They disclose that the taking consisted of 0.31 acres from a 1.15-aere tract, that the applicable zoning regulations were introduced in evidence, that both appraisers were familiar with the zoning laws and regulations of the town, and that the defendant\u2019s appraiser valued the entire property before the taking at $24,700 and the value of the remainder after the taking at $5600. The plaintiffs\u2019 appraiser valued the entire parcel at $35,000. He first stated that in his opinion it was not possible to determine the value of the property remaining after the taking because it would be a nonconforming parcel \u201cand the value would be based upon any variances that would be granted by the Board of Appeals in the future.\u201d If a variance was necessary, he believed that the property might even have a \u201cnegative value,\u201d but, if a variance was not necessary to use the parcel for a building site, he believed that it would have a value of $7500. In addition to taking evidence, the referee viewed the premises. On this record there was ample evidence to support the referee\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 damages amounted to $24,000. As he was justified in doing, the referee concluded that the value of the remaining parcel was $5600, the precise value testified to by the defendant\u2019s appraiser. If any more \u201ccomplete evidence\u201d or more \u201cadequate\u201d presentation of their case would have supported the plaintiffs\u2019 claim to a different valuation or to the effect of the zoning regulations, it was incumbent upon them to present it at the hearing or at least to request a postponement for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b90-8\"> Proper procedure dictates that in the usual ease a motion to open which is designed to secure the addition of further facts to the referee\u2019s report should be filed with the court, which should then return the file to the referee for consideration of the motion. See Practice Book \u00a7 358. The plaintiffs, however, raised no objection to the procedure which the court followed in the present ease in itself deciding the merits of the motion without referring it to the referee for consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
