After issue joined he moved for a change of venue to Washington county upon affidavits setting forth that the convenience of witnesses would be promoted thereby. The court denied the plaintiff\u2019s right to make the motion, and refused upon that- ground to entertain it. An order was accordingly entered as follows, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-9\">\u201c On hearing, &amp;c., it- is ordered that the motion be denied with ten dollars costs, on the ground that the plaintiff has no right to make such a motion, and without deciding on the convenience of witnesses.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-10\"><em>William P.

Co. </em>(11 id., 153); <em>Budge </em>v. <em>Northam, </em>(20 id., 248). To show that the former practice allowed the plaintiff to lay his venue in actions of this character where he pleased, he cited 2 R. S., 409, \u00a7 2; Grah. Pr., pp.,.561,194; <em>Root </em>v. <em>King </em>(4 Cow., 405), and he contended that as section 125 of the Code required the plaintiff to lay his venue where the parties resided, that there was no force in the suggestion that before the Code such a motion as this on the part of the plaintiff was unknown.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>Amasa J.
