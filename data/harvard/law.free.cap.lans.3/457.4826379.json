And provided, also, that the said James Wolstenholme or his legal representatives shall in no case receive any increase of stock from this process in any one year wherein the net earnings of said company shall fail to equal twenty-five per centum on the capital stock at the time paid in; but in such contingency the company may use said earnings for dividend on the capital stock then existing.

It also appeared that the plaintiff\u2019s salary, which had been fixed at $2,000, had been paid in full to the time of his discharge, but unpaid otherwise, and that there were no net earnings of the company during the first year, and not sufficient the ensuing year to amount to seventeen and one-half per cent on the capital stock of the defendant actually paid in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-7\">The plaintiff claimed to have faithfully devoted his time and experience to the service of the defendants, and to have been dismissed without just cause. These allegations the defendant denied and disputed, and averred that the plaintiff was unfit to superintend its manufactory, and entirely incompetent to manage its operations and to conduct the business economically or successfully; that he was visionary, wasteful and extravagant, and failed in judgment and in qualifications for business, &amp;c., &amp;c. Evidence was given upon these issues, and also going to show that the plaintiff was extravagant and visionary in certain plans adopted by him in reference to improvements in the manufactory; that he was irascible, and had difficulties \"with the men, that he failed to control them, and that there was difficulty in obtaining employes in conse-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>quence; also that he put up imperfect files, and sent them out from the factory as perfect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-4\">The referee found that \u201ctheplaintiff erred in judgment as to some of his calculationsthat he was hot-tempered and imperious, and had frequent disturbances with the defendant\u2019s employes from about the time he commenced manufacturing during the first year, and occasionally afterward, until about the time he was discharged by the defendant, and that these disturbances were somewhat aggravated by his irascible and imperious temper; that the principal part of these disturbances occurred during the first year, and that when the modified contract was entered into, the plaintiff\u2019s peculiarities of temper and method of treating the employes, and his qualities and capabilities as superintendent were known by the defendant. And he decided, as matter of law, \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s failure of judgment and his imperious and irascible temper were not justifiable cause of discharge; that in these respects \u201cthe defendant\u2019s duty was to inform, itself before hiring;\u201d that it did not appear that the plaintiff was discharged either because of any failure in judgment, \u25a0 or infirmities of temper, or of any disorganization and trouble in the shop growing out of the manner in which the plaintiff treated the workmen; that occasional complaints were made by customers that soft files were found in packages which had been sold as perfect, and the packages were returned for that reason; that about the time of plaintiff\u2019s discharge, Fletcher, one of the employes of defendant, whom the plaintiff had employed as a prover of files before they were wrapped up, claimed that the plaintiff was directing files to be passed as perfect which in fact were soft, and therefore not perfect; that this claim was brought to the attention of Mr. Truscott, the president of defendant,- and he had one or more interviews upon the subject with the plaintiff, who denied that he had directed any soft files to be passed as perfect, or to be included in the packages of perfect files, and it was not proved in the ease that the plaintiff had so directed, or that he proposed to pass such or any soft \"files as perfect, or to -have any of them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>included in the packages of perfect files; that within a few days after the talk with Mr. Truscott, the plaintiff was discharged, and notified by writing of such discharge, but no cause for such discharge was assigned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-4\">The referee decided, as matter of law, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendant his salary at the rate of $2,000 a year after his discharge, from the date of his discharge to the commencement of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-5\">The referee further decided, as matter of law, that the plaintiff\u2019s failure of judgment and his imperious and irascible temper were not a justifiable cause of discharge; that in these respects the defendant\u2019s duty was to inform itself before hiring. But he also decided that even if such was not the duty of the defendant, the evidence did not disclose an unfitness in the plaintiff for his position, either because of failure in judgment or imperiousness and irascibility of temper which warranted his discharge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-6\">The referee further decided, as matter of law, that the defendant having entered into the modified contract with the plaintiff, after it had discovered the alleged unfitness of the plaintiff to be superintendent, because of failure in judgment and imperiousness and irascibility, was thereby precluded from thereafter discharging the plaintiff therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-7\">The referee further decided, as matter of law, that the defendant had failed to establish a justification for discharging the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-8\">And he directed judgment in favor of the plaintiff in accordance with his finding, and judgment was entered accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-9\">The defendant duly excepted to the several rulings of law and fact of the referee, and to his direction for entry of judgment, and appealed, making a case \u2019 containing the evidence and exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b484-10\"><em>John </em>Ganson, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b484-11\"><em>Benjamin H. </em>Austin, for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Present \u2014 Mullin, P.

Under this contract the plaintiff commenced superintending and manufacturing for the defendant some time in May, 1865, and continued for about one year, when, on the 15 th of May, 1866, a new contract was entered into between the same parties, modifying and changing in some respects the first contract, in respect to the plaintiff\u2019s compensation, but not materially in other respects. Under this last contract the plaintiff continued his services until the 2-2d of October, 1866, when he was discharged by the defendant\u2019s officers and stockholders, and dismissed from defendant\u2019s service. Ho cause was assigned in the notice of dismissal. But it was not necessary that any cause should be assigned. If a good and sufficient cause in fact existed, the defendant was justifiable in dismissing the plaintiff, without assigning any reason therefor. The rights of the respective parties rested in the contract which they had deliberately and carefully drawn out and entered into. The plaintiff was something more than the mere servant of the defendant. He was the defendant\u2019s chosen foreman and superintendent, and by the terms of the contract'was to \u201c have the entire and full control of the manufacturing,\u201d <em>\u201c </em>including all the employes connected therewith, as general superintendent of the manufactory.\u201d This general power was also by the terms of the same contract coupled with an interest in the profits of the business, by way of further compensation, in certain specified contingencies. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>was a party to an. express contract, and whatever may have been his strict legal relation to the defendant, it is clear, I think, that he conld not be dismissed and discharged from the service which he had undertaken to perform, with impunity, unless he had been guilty of some substantial violation of the express or implied provisions of that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">But, even if he was nothing more than a \"mere servant, acting under the general implied obligation of such a relation, upon the finding of the referee he was improperly discharged. It is clear enough that the defendant could not go back of the date of the last contract to find a cause for his dismissal. All previous causes for dismissal, if any existed, were merged in and canceled by the new contract. The referee has found, and as I think properly, that the infirmities and outbreaks of temper and abuse of the hands by the plaintiff, now complained of, mostly occurred before the last contract was entered into, and that since that time he has not been guilty of any such conduct in that regard as would justify the defendant in dismissing him and depriving him of all the benefits and advantages secured to him by his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Indeed the defendant did not dismiss him upon any such ground or for any such cause as the referee has found, and as plainly appears from the evidence, but for a reason wholly different.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The new contract certainly did not give to the plaintiff any right to pursue an improper course of conduct, even if he had been guilty of it before under the other contract, or because he had been guilty of it formerly.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">It did not operate as a license on the part of the defendant to the plaintiff, to violate his duty under the contract to his employer. And I do not understand the referee as holding any such principle. But the fact that the defendant entered into a second contract with the plaintiff for the same service after the first year, coupled with the fact, that he was dismissed for another and different cause, may be properly referred to as strong and convincing evidence that this conduct was not regarded by the defendant in the same light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>then, that it is claimed to be now. It suggests very strongly, the probabilities of interested after-thought, exaggerating eccentricities of conduct into improprieties and errors of undue magnitude and proportions. The other ground on which it is claimed the defendant had the right to discharge, and upon which they did, in fact, dismiss and discharge the plaintiff, that of packing and sending out imperfect files to the injury of tire business, the referee has found did not exist in fact. The evidence upon this subject was quite conflicting ; but the referee had the right to give credence to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony on the subject. He was certainly, according to all the testimony, the most competent judge, and had no interest in injuring the business while he remained there. His testimony, if credible, is entirely satisfactory on that question. He was before the referee who had tire best opportunity of judging of his competency and honesty. Under such circumstances, this court will not interfere to set aside the finding of a referee on a question of fact, unless the error is quite apparent. But I am wholly unable to see how the ruling of the referee receiving the letters written by third persons to the witness Dorsheimer and to the plaintiff, in evidence in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, can be justified. They were letters, generally commendatory, of the plaintiff\u2019s skill as a manufacturer of files; of the excellence of the articles formerly manufactured by him, and of plaintiff\u2019s character for integrity..</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Dorsheimer was; as it appears, one of the defendant\u2019s principal stockholders, and the plaintiff had given him a reference to some of these persons who had written a portion of these letters in answer to inquiries' from Dorsheimer, respecting the defendant\u2019s skill, the character of his work, &amp;c. The other letters were written to the plaintiff himself. The fact that these references had been given by the plaintiff and answers received to the inquiries was drawn out by the plaintiff on the cross-examination of Dorsheimer. The plaintiff then offered the letters received by Dorsheimer in answer to his inquiries, and also those received by himself as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>evidence, and they were received against the defendant\u2019s objection. I am not aware of any rule of evidence upon which this ruling can stand. These letters were the mere expressions of opinions of third persons, on the subject of the reputation of the plaintiff as a manufacturer, and of his previous work. It is claimed by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that it was competent, and was within the issue made by the defendant\u2019s answer. The defendant had set up in the answer by way of defence, amongst other things, that the plaintiff was unfit to superintend the business of manufacturing files, and was entirely incompetent to manage the operatives, and to conduct the business economically, or successfully-; that he was visionary wasteful and extravagant, and failed in judgment and business qualifications. The questions raised by this part of the answer, were in respect to the plaintiff\u2019s fitness and competency in point of fact, and not in respect to his reputation for skill or fitness to manage and carry on business successfully as in respect to his skill as a manufacturer. This evidence was entirely incompetent on those questions. It was the mere declarations of third persons, and nothing more than hearsay. As the referee held it competent evidence against the defendant\u2019s objection, it is impossible to say that he was not, and could not have been influenced by it. The presumption is, that it had its legitimate influence, as pertinent, and competent evidence. It is quite apparent, that as material and competent evidence, it bore directly upon the question whether the defendant had good and sufficient cause for discharging the plaintiff. For, although the plaintiff had a contingent interest in the earnings and profits of the enterprise, still he was not a partner with the defendant, and the business was not his business. He was, in fact, an employe, and his interest in the business was by way of compensation only. It was clearly an implied part of his contract and undertaking, that he possessed the requisite skill and fitness for the superior position and authority, which was secured to him by such contract. In all other respects, I am of the opinion that the rulings and decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>of the referee were correct. Bat for this error the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Judgment reversed, new trial granted, costs to abide event. Hr. Justice Talcott, having been engaged as counsel on the trial, did not sit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
