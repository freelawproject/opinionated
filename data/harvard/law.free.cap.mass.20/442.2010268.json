B. by C. D. his <em>attorney.\u201d\u2014Held, </em>that the attorney had thereby made himself responsible for the costs which the defendant should recover, and consequently had disqualified himself to be a witness on the part of the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-11\">Assumpsit. On the trial, Mr. Peabody being offered as a witness on the part of the plaintiff, the defendant objected to his competency, on the ground that he was the indorser cf the writ, and so responsible for the costs in case the defendant should prevail. The writ was indorsed, \u201c <em>Ebenezer </em>Chadwick, <em>by A. Peabody his JltVy.\u20191\u2019\u2019 </em>The judge overruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the objection, and admitted the witness ; and a verdict being found for the plaintiff, the defendant moved for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-8\"><em>Blair </em>and <em>Bliss, </em>in support of the motion,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN0\">cited <em>St. </em>1784, c. 28, \u00a7 11; <em>Middlesex Turnp. Corp. </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>8 Mass. R. 266; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Nantucket Bank., </em>5 Mass. R. 97; <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Lovett, </em>13 Mass. R. 422; <em>Ely </em>v. <em>Forward, </em>7 Mass. R. 27. In this last case it is said, \u201c every original writ must be indorsed, either by the plaintiff or bis attorney.\u201d This writ was not, in fact, indorsed by the plaintiff; it must therefore be considered as indorsed by his attorney.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-9\"><em>Peabody, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdPF\">Where the attorney indorses the writ himself, the defendant has a cumulative remedy, the attorney, as well as the plaintiff, being responsible for costs. But the statute does not intend, that where he puts his name on the writ, as in this instance, evidently meaning to bind the plaintiff alone, he shall be liable himself, when in signing a promissory note in a similar manner he would not be responsible. It may be objected, that the attorney might thus indorse the writ when the plaintiff is out of the State ; but the answer is, that then, according to the statute, the indorsement would be insufficient. In <em>Middlesex Turnp. Corp. </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>the plaintiffs being a corporation, the statute could not be complied with except by an indorsement by an agent. Suppose that the attorney, by the plaintiff\u2019s direction, had written the plaintiff\u2019s name alone on the back of the writ, would not that have been the plaintiff\u2019s indorsement ?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b478-10\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao4\">said, in substance, that the Court were of opinion that Mr. Peabody must be considered as the indorser, and so not a competent witness. The statute says, that the plaintiff\u2019s agent or attorney, who shall indorse his name upon an original writ, shall be liable in case of the avoidance or inability of the plaintiff to pay the defendant such costs as he shall recover <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and as agent or attorney, we think Mr. Peabody would be liable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It would be an induce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ment to commence actions, if when the plaintiff was out of the commonwealth, the attorney might put the plaintiff\u2019s name on the writ, and be free himself from responsibility for costs. An ingenious argument might be made on either side, but we think convenience preponderates in favor of holding the attorney liable ; although, for the sake of justice, this might likewise be considered as the indorsement of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\">JVeio <em>trial granted.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-11\"> See the provisions made concerning the indorsement of write, in Revised Stat, <em>c, </em>90, \u00a7 10 to 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-12\"> See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>M'Arthur, </em>3 Greenl. 27; <em>How </em>v.
