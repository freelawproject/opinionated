On the back he had written, \u2014\u25a0 \u201c P. S. I appoint my father J. V. executor of the within. The situation of my property is as follows, viz.\u201d &amp;c., enumerating promissory notes and cash on hand. He was possessed of no real estate, and of no other personal estate than that mentioned in the \u201cpostscript,\u201d except his household furniture and goods.

The word <em>property </em>is equivocal, and <em>may </em>mean real as well as personal estate, but does not necessarily. We think the enumeration of property, all of which is personal, is to have an influence. It is the same thing as if the testator had said, \u201c whatsoever property I have, viz. sundry notes, &amp;c., I give, &amp;c.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-13\"> The same formalities are now required to a will, whether it be for real or for personal estate.
