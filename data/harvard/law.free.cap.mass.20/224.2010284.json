Andr\u00e9 was at that time resident in Boston, but was a subject of the king of France and alien to the commonwealth, and was never naturalized therein. The purchase was made for the benefit of Jean Francois Billon, likewise a subject of the king of France, and resident at Marseilles. Andr\u00e9 and Billon both died in 1810, intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\">In February 1820, the attorney-general, pursuant to a resolve of the legislature of the 31st of January preceding, filed an information to recover seisin and possession of the land in question, alleging that it ought to escheat to the commonwealth for defect of title in any person who could by law hold the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-7\">The children of Andr\u00e9, being his heirs and subjects of the king of Franee, and the children of Billon, being his heirs and subjects of the same king, appeared and answered to the information, alleging respectively that the title to the land had descended to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-8\">The cause was argued in writing.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-9\"><em>Morton </em>(Attorney-General) and <em>Danis </em>(Solicitor-General) for the commonwealth,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4VW\">cited 1 Bl.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyRx\">It having been determined by the verdict of the jury, that the persons claiming to be the heirs of Pierre Matthieu Andr\u00e9, and those claiming to be the heirs of Jean Frangois Billon, are such, according to the laws of descent in France and in this country, the only question is, whether on account of their alienage, or that of their several fathers, they are prevented from inheriting the land which was purchased by Andr\u00e9 of the commonwealth, which prosecutes this suit. Without undertaking to decide what would be the effect of the alienage of these heirs under the several treaties which have been cited, we decide the cause upon the ground that the commonwealth, having conveyed the land to Andr\u00e9, then a French subject, and received the full consideration therefor, cannot reclaim the land from him or his heirs for the cause of alienage in him or them. The deed was made by a committee fully authorized thereto by a resolve of the legislature, and by the deed the commonwealth has covenanted to warrant and defend Andr\u00e9, his heirs and assigns, against the lawful claims of all persons whatsoever. This deed must operate as a rebutter, as it would if an individual were the grantor ; and with more reason, because the commonwealth is not liable to an action. The commonwealth, if the land were recovered, would feel itself bound to repay the consideration money, with interest. This would be a claim which could not be resisted without degrading the country. But there is no need of resorting to this remedy ; for the deed of the commonwealth to the very persons now defending as heirs to Andr\u00e9, to whom and to whose neirs the grant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>made, is, we think, an estoppel against setting up the alienage of those persons as the ground of recovery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The judgment of the Court therefore is, that the commonwealth take nothing by their inquest.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-13\"> See per <em>Story </em>J., <em>Carver </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>4 Peters\u2019s Sup.
