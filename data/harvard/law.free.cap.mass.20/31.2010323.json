On the 16th of February, 1822, the officer extended it on certain real estate which was in the occupation of Winslow as a tenant at will under one Russell, and delivered peaceable seisin and possession of it to Bigelow. A process of forcible entry and detainer was thereupon sued out against Bigelow on behalf of Russell, before two justices of the peace, pursuant to <em>St. </em>1784, <em>c. </em>8, and a writ of res'\"\u2018ution was awarded, by virtue of which Russell was put into possession of the real estate in question. At March term 1824, Bigelow presented a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to the two justices, to whose proceedings several exceptions were taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-7\"><em>K Whitman </em>and <em>Rand, </em>for the respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APrg\">insisted that the process of forcible entry and detainer was not a proper remedy against one claiming title under an extent of an execution ; but that if there was any forcible entry and detainer in the case, it was against Winslow, the tenant, and not against Russell, who was not in possession nor entitled to the immediate profits of the land.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-8\"><em>Prescott </em>and <em>W. Phillips, contra,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aad9\">contended that if a man finds another out of his house and thereupon enters and prevents the other from returning, it is a forcible entry. 1 Hawk. P. C. c. 64, \u00a7 26, 27. Under our statute, either Russell, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>the tenant, or any person who is injured, may make the complaint. The possession of Bigelow as tenant at will was the possession of Russell, so far as it respects this process ; which is not given for damages for personal wrongs, but for a restitution to the real estate. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dudley, </em>10 Mass. R. 403 ; 2 Bl. Comm. 290 ; 2 Rol. Abr. 80, <em>Indictment, M. </em>Bigelow by his levy could take only what belonged to his debtor; as against Russell the levy was wholly inoperative. <em>Gore </em>v. <em>Brazier, </em>3 Mass.

R. 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">At a subsequent day a writ of re-restitution was awarded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\"> Forcible entry lies only for one, who has had actual possession. <em>Childress v.
