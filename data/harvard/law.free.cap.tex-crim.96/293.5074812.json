As a general rule, a misdemeanor case tried in the Corporation Court in which the fine does not exceed one hundred dollars, the judgment, on appeal to the County Court, is final. See Neubauer v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep. 513, and other cases collated in Vernon\u2019s Tex. Crim. Stat., Vol. 2, p. 47. It is said in Article 86 of the C. C. P., that the Court of Criminal Appeals has appellate jurisdiction of all criminal cases. In Article 87, however, it is expressly stated that the jurisdiction mentioned in Article 86, supra, does not embrace cases appealed from justices, \u2019 mayors or other inferior courts, to the County Court,, in which the judgment rendered and the fine imposed shall not exceed one hundred dollars. Based upon these statutes and their construction, the State\u2019s Attorney has objected to the consideration of the appeal in the present ease upon the ground that this court is without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">No- peculiarity in the ease or in the jurisdiction of the Corporation Court in the town of Mineral Wells is pointed out as differentiating the present case from the general rule, or upon which this court would be authorized to entertain jurisdiction of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
