Scott\u2019s barn was entered and a quantity of the corn in sacks removed, and a trail of corn and tracks led down to where an automobile had stood. At one place there were evidences that a sack of corn had come open and some of its contents which had escaped were scraped up. Shortly after the loss of the corn upon information received Mr. Scott obtained a search warrant and went with officers to appellant\u2019s barn and there found five full sacks and one partially filled, the contents being the corn belonging to Mr. Scott which had been taken from his barn, same being identified by Mr. Scott, his partner, Mr. Wrather and Mr. Hunter. One sack had in it clods and dirt similar to that at Scott\u2019s place. Their description of the corn appears so complete and convincing that but little, if any, doubt could remain as to its ideneity. It was mixed corn, about one-fourth being red and the remainder yellow and white.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">While the State was making out its case in chief and before any evidence on behalf of appellant had been introduced, a question was asked State witness Scott by the district attorney which to the learned trial judge seemed to call for testimony believed by him inadmissible because the accused was under arrest. A colloquy arose in which the court stated that the evidence was inadmissible because \u201cthey had already found the corn.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the court saying they had found \u201chis corn.\u201d The court replied, \u201cWell, they found these five sacks of corn that he brought in.\u201d To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>this counsel also objected and in reply of the court to this, reference was made to the corn as \u201chis corn . . . these sacks of corn that they brought in.\u201d It was stated by the trial court that this was not a comment on the weight of the evidence and not intended to be. To this remark also an exception was taken as being a comment on the weight of the evidence. No charge was asked on behalf of appellant in reference to the matter. While we regard the remark of the court as referring to Mr. Scott\u2019s corn, still we are not able to conclude that it was such comm\u00e9nt when made at the time and under the circumstances as should cause a reversal of this case. As stated above, appellant had introduced no evidence in support of any claim of ownership on his part, of the said corn.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">We are also of opinion from the whole record that it appears to be so clearly established that the corn was the corn of Scott and taken in said burglary, that the remark made by the court,'if open to appellant\u2019s objection, would not be sufficient to call for reversal. Rodriguez v. State, 23 Texas Crim. App., 503; Young v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 24; Newman v. State, 64 S. W. Rep., 259; Pilgrim v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 231; Renn v. State, 64 Texas Crim. Rep., 639; Williams v. State, 67 Texas Crim. Rep., 287, 148 S. W. Rep., 763; Wilson v. State, 70 Texas Crim. Rep., 627; Echols v. State, 75 Texas Crim. Rep., 369, 170 S. W. Rep., 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The only other bill was taken to a question to witness Scott as follows : \u201cWhere did you mean that you didn\u2019t see any red corn?\u201d to which he replied, \u201cWell, he was asked to show some red corn where he stated he shelled this corn in the old house.\u201d This seems to set out an answer of the witness to the question objected to which does not contain any statement of appellant and therefore presents no support to the objection made that the accused was under arrest at the time. We do not think this presents any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Appellant appearing to have had a fair trial, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
