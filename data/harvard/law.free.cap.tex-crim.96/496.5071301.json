It is provided in Article 856, C. C. P., that in all eases of felony, except where the death penalty may be inflicted, sentence shall be pronounced before an appeal is taken. It is the final judgment and without it no jurisdiction is conferred upon this court by an attempted appeal. See many cases collated in the notes under said article in the second volume of Vernon\u2019s Criminal Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-17\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-18\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
