Objection was urged to the receipt of this testimony. This action of the lawyer was susceptible of appropriation by the jury as an admission by the appellant that he was connected' with the forgery. His identity as the person who passed the alleged forged check was a sharply controverted issue. The witness who identified the appellant had previously identified another person. There was no comparison of the handwriting identifying the indorsement of the check as that of the appellant. The rush of business in which the check was presented and paid gives room for mistake. In the argument of the case, the prosecution stressed the importance of the return of the money by the appellant\u2019s attorney as an .item of identification. A request was made that the court instruct the jury to disregard this argument. In receiving the evidence and in refusing to instruct the jury to disregard the argument mentioned, it is believed that the learned trial judge fell into error. The acts of third parties are not chargeable to the accused on trial unless it appear that they were done under express or implied authority from the accused. The act in question, that of reimbursing the bank, would not, by implication, come within the scope of the authority of an attorney employed to secure the rights of the accused in a criminal case, and no proof of express authority was made or attempted. Branch\u2019s Crim. Law., Sec., 862, and cases listed; also Sorell v. State, 74 Texas Crim. Rep., 100, 167 S. W. Rep., 359; Nader v. State, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The action of the appellant\u2019s attorney in making inquiry on cross-examination of the witness Donahue if he had lost anything by the transaction and the reply of Donahue that he had been reimbursed would not give license to the State to pursue the inquiry and show that his reimbursement had been through the payment of the money by the appellant\u2019s attorney. Whether there\u201d had been reimbursement was an immaterial inquiry unless shown to have been done by the appellant through his agent. It was not necessary to show that the bank was injured by the forgery. All that the law required was that the forgery he proved and that there be an intent to injure. If objection had been made by State\u2019s counsel to the appellant\u2019s inquiry of Donahue mentioned or his reply, it would have doubtless been excluded, because it related to an immaterial issue. By his silent consent to the proof of an immaterial fact. State\u2019s counsel did not acquire the right to introduce additional testimony of the same nature. See Wigmore on Evidence, Vol. 2, sec. 1007; Brent v. State, 95 Texas Crim. Rep., 14, 252 S. W. Rep. 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The other questions raised are not likely to occur upon another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Because of the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
