The case of Robert v. State, 90 Texas Crim. Rep., 133, is relied upon by the State. In that case the charge was somewhat like the present one. The matter then before the court, however, was not the form of the charge but the interpretation of the statute defining the offense. The definition of the offense embraced the declaration that it was unlawful to transport intoxicating liquors <em>except for medicinal, mechanical, scientific or sacramental purposes. </em>It was held necessary that the indictment negative the exceptions. The question for decision was whether the State was also called upon to prove and negative the exceptions averred. It was held that such burden was not upon the State, and such is declared to be the correct rule. It does not \"follow, however, that the charge given in the present case is to be sanctioned. In a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ease, an acquittal is not to be conditioned upon the belief by the jury that the accused is innocent, but upon the belief by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty. Smith v. State, 9 Texas Crim. App. 150; Vernon\u2019s Texas Crim. Stat., Vol. 2, p. 638. The statute under consideration is not an exception to this general rule. If the jury in the present case had believed beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had transported intoxicating liquors, a conviction was authorized unless there arose from the evidence a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury whether such transportation was for one of the permitted purposes. If there had been no evidence from any source that the liquor was transported for one of the excepted purposes, there would have been no necessity for mentioning the exceptions in the charge. The statute has been amended since the Robert case, supra, was decided, and does not embrace the exceptions mentioned in the definition, but states them in a separate paragraph of the law. See Acts of 37th Leg., 1st Called Session, Chap. 61; Vernon\u2019s Texas Crim. Stat., (1922 Sup.) Vol. 2, Arts. 588 1/4 and 588 1/4 al.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\">That the liquor was transported for one of the lawful purposes named is in the nature of an affirmative defense. When, as in the present case, the evidence raises an issue touching such defense, the charge should be so framed that it will require an acquittal if, from the evidence, the jury believed.that the appellant's transportation of the intoxcating liquor was for medicinal purposes or if they had a reasonable doubt whether that was his purpose. Clevenger v. State, 96 Texas Crim. Rep. 23, 255 S. W. Rep. 642; Simpson v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep. 303, 247 S. W. Rep., 548; Johnson v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App., 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Because of the reason stated, a reversal of the judgment is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
