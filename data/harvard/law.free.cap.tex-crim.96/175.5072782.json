The indictment charged burglary of a private residence and the charge of the learned trial court seems in all things to conform to the law. The only thing in the record in the shape of a motion for new trial appears to be a document addressed to the trial judge and signed by appellant asking that he be brought down before him to make a motion for an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">Finding no error in the record, an affirmance will be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
