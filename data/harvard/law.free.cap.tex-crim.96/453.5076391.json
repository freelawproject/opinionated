The motion avers that this omission was purposely done and not through inadvertence on the part of the State. No bill of exceptions is found complaining of the action of the court in overruling this motion. In fact, the minutes of the court do not reveal any action upon the motion to quash the venire. There is brought here, however, a certified copy of' .the \u00a1trial judge\u2019s docket, showing the\"entries thereon, one of them being \"'defendant\u2019s motion to quash the jury list overruled\u201d -to which defendant excepts. The motion presents a question of fact, -but in the \u2019absence of something authenticated by the trial judge bringing to the knowledge of this court facts which he found to be true or up on which the presumption in favor of the correctness of his ruling apparently would prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The legal question which the appellant seeks- to have reviewed has this day been decided adverse to his contention in the case of Bennett v. State, No. 7493, 254 S. W. Rep., 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The judgment is affirmed. .</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b480-11\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">January 30, 1924.</p>\n<author id=\"b480-13\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AKCQ\">The indictment consisting of a single count charges the offense of unlawfully \"transporting intoxicating liquor. That issue was submitted to the jury in the court\u2019s charge, the verdict found appellant guilty of that -offense, and of that offense the court, in receiving and recording the verdict, expressly declared him guilty. On this motion it is shown that appellant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>condemned to the penitentiary for the offense of <em>selling intoxicating liquor. </em>In Article 938, C. C. P., it is declared that \u201cthe Court of Criminal Appeals may reform and correct as the law and the nature of the case may require.\u201d When the data necessary to enable the court to correct an improperly entered judgment is revealed by the record, this court has reformed the sentence on many occasions. In Small\u2019s case, 38 S. W. Rep., 798, the majority opinion held to the contrary. That ruling was expressly rejected in Burk\u2019s case, 55 S. ,W. Rep., 826. The latter view is in accord with the opinion of this court in River\u2019s case, 10 Texas Crim. App., 177; Robinson v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 550, and many other cases collated in Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., Sec. 668, and in Vernon\u2019s Tex. Crim. Stat., Vol. 2, p. 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The sentence is reformed to agree with the indictment, verdict and judgment sentencing the appellant to confinement in the penitentiary for a period of one year for the offense of unlawfully transporting liquor. In other respects, the motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
