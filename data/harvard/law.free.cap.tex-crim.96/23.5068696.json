He declared in his testimony that he was taking the whisky to his home for medicinal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>purposes. This issue, thus raised, was submitted to the jury, and they were instructed that if he was carrying the whisky to his home for medicinal purposes, an acquittal should result.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\">There is a bill complaining of the statement of the prosecuting attorney in argument to the effect that appellant had told a different story to the officers when he was caught. We find nothing in the bill which negatives the fact that the argument related to part of the evidence in the case. The bill, therefore, reveals no error</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b50-5\">ON REHEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">November 14, 1923.</p>\n<author id=\"b50-7\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao3\">\u2014 Appellant testified that he purchased two quarts of whisky which he had in his possession for the purpose of using it for medicine; that he had been advised to put bitter apple in whisky as a remedy for chills and fever; that during the past two years some of the members of his family had been ailing with that malady most of the. time and he had been advised that if it continued it might produce black jaundice; that the only reason for having the whisky in question was to take it to his home and fixing it for medicine and using it for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The jury was instructed to acquit if they <em>believed </em>that the purpose of appellant in transporting the intoxicants was to use it for medicine. The court was requested to instruct the jury to acquit if they believed he transported the liquor for medicine <em>or had a reasonable doubt </em>as to whether that was his purpose in transporting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">That the appellant had in his possession two quarts of whisky and was carrying it with him is shown without dispute. He interposes as an affirmative defense the facts stated above, going to show that his transportation of the whisky was to his home for medicinal purposes. The paragraph of the main charge of the court required the jury <em>to believe this affirmative defense to be true as a predicate for an acquittal. </em>The appellant\u2019s innocence depended upon the defensive theory. The law did not impose upon him the duty of proving its truth, but it required alone that the evidence be such as to establish such facts as would leave in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt as to its truth. The special charge would have complied with this rule. The following cases are in point; Sparlin v. State, 75 Texas Crim. Rep., 102, 170 S. W. Rep., 307; Earnest v. State, 83 Texas Crim. Rep., 41, 201 S. W. Rep., 175; James v. State, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 107, 215 S. W. Rep., 459; Goforth v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 200, 241 S. W. Rep., 1027; Savage v. State, 92 Texas Crim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Rep., 520, 244 S. W. Rep., 1002; Richardson v. State, 91 Texas Crim. Rep., 318. The authorities are reviewed at some length in Goforth\u2019s case, <em>supra, </em>and for a further review of them that case is referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\">For the reasons stated the motion for rehearing is granted, the affirmance set aside, the judgment of the trial court reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
