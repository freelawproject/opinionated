If considered no error would appear.. The-facts stated seem to establish beyond question that the appellant is guilty of the offense charged. The complaint sufficiently charged the offense, and no error appearing an affirmance will be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\">on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">January 30, 1924.</p>\n<author id=\"b482-9\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AqG\">Out of deference to appellant\u2019s insistence that the facts do not show him .to have driven a car on a public street while drunk, we state briefly such of the facts as might be deemed sufficient. M^. Garrett drove his ear to a point' on a public street\u00bb, in the city of Dallas and there parked it in front of a house. He . went into the house. Presently he heard a crash outside and went at once out the front door. Appellant was sitting in a Ford roadster which had been driven into Mr. Garrett\u2019s car. The windshield of appellant \u2019s car was broken and his head cut and bleeding. He was too drunk to talk. The.se facts are not disputed.- They show his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
