There is a short brief complaining of the refusal of a continuance. This court uniformly holds that in order to render availing an objection to the refusal of a continuance, a bill of exceptions must be taken, else we conclude that overruling of such application is acceptable to the accused. No bill of exceptions having been reserved to the court\u2019s action in this \"particular, the complaint is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">The statement of facts amply shows the guilt of the accused. Stills and large quantities of liquor were found upon his place by a searching party. He testified in an attempt to ascribe the manufacture to his brother, but in their province the jury have seen fit to decline to accept his statement and we see no reason to doubt the sufficiency of the testimony to support the conclusion of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
