C. W. Robinson, Judge of the Criminal District Court of Harris County, remanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>him to custody for extradition to the State of Missouri relator brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In reply to an order to show by what authority he was holding relator, the Chief of Police of the City of Houston answered that he held him in the beginning by virtue of a warrant of arrest from a justice of the peace of Harris County upon a charge that relator was a fugitive from justice, but that at the time of the hearing he was holding him on an extradition warrant issued by the Governor of Texas upon a requisition from the Governor of Missouri. The extradition warrant reads thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\"IN THE NAME AND BY AUTHORITY OP THE STATE OP TEXAS EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">\"To All and Singular the Sheriffs, Constables, and Other Civil Officers of said State:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\"Whereas, It has been made known to me by the Governor of the State of Missouri that Leo Gotch Alias George Randall stands charged by information before the proper authorities, with the crime of Burglary and Larceny committed in said State, and that the said defendant has taken refuge in the State of Texas, and Whereas, the said Governor, in pursuance of the Constitution and Laws of the United States, has demanded of me that I cause the said fugitive to be arrested and delivered to 0\u201e J. Wilson who is as is satisfactorily shown, duly authorized to receive him into custody and convey him back to said State, and Whereas, said demand is accompanied by copy of said information duly certified as authentic by the Governor of said State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">\"Now, Therefore, I Pat M. Neff, Governor of Texas, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws of this State, and the United States, do issue this my Warrant, commanding all Sheriffs, Constables, and other Civil Officers of this State, to arrest and aid and assist in arresting said fugitive and to deliver him when. arrested to the said agent in order that he may be taken back to said State to be dealt with for said crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">\"In Testimony Whereof, I have hereunto signed my name and have caused the Seal of State to be hereon impressed, at Austin, Texas, this 30th day of November, A. D. 1923.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">(Signed) PAT M. NEPP,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">Governor By the Governor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">(Signed) - S. L. Staples,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-14\">Secretary of State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Relator averred that an effort was being made to have him returned to State of Missouri for an alleged violation of a parole. Exception was sustained to this* feature of relator\u2019s pleading. It is not necessary, in the disposition of the case, to determine whether the court was' right or wrong in this particular. The point is made that the executive warrant issued by the Governor of this State shows that relator is charged with crime in the demanding state by \u201cinformation,\u201d and that a charge made by \u201cinformation\u201d is not of such character as would authorize the Governor to base thereon his extradition warrant. This contention must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\">It will be found upon examination that the executive warrant now under consideration is in all respects the same as\" the one discussed in Ex Parte Holt, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 614, 244 S. W. Rep..1016. So far as the legal principle is -involved that case cannot be distinguished from this one. In that ease the facts showed the character of pharge pending against relator upon which the requisition demand was based. In the present case, neither the requisition nor any papers connected therewith were in evidence. We must rely alone upon the recitals in the executive warrant to ascrtain upon what it was based. Therein the Governor of this State says it has been made known to him by the Governor of Missouri that relator \u201cstands charged by <em>information </em>etc.\u201d, and further, that the demand for requisition \u201cis accompanied by copy of said information.\u201d Ex Parte Lewis, 75 Texas Crim. Rep., 320, 170 S. W. Rep., 1098, reviews and cites many authorities holding that a charge lodged by \u201cinformation\u201d in the demanding state will not authorize an extradition warrant from the Governor of the fugitive state, and Ex Parte Holt (supra) cites with approval and follows in this respect the Lewis case.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Under the law as we understand it the judgment must be reversed, and the relator ordered discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\n<em>Relator discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
