(\u201cNext Century\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal in favor of defendant U. Bertram Ellis, Jr. (\u201cEllis\u201d) on its Georgia state law claims sounding in fraud and negligent misrepresentation. On appeal, Next Century contends that viewed in the light most favorable to it, its complaint states claims on which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>See Harris v. Ivax Corp., </em>182 F.3d 799, 802 (11th Cir.1999). The plaintiffs factual allegations are accepted as true. <em>South Florida Water Mgm\u2019t Dist. v. Montalvo, </em>84 F.3d 402, 406 (11th Cir.1996). Dismissal is not appropriate unless it is plain that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would support the claims in the complaint. <em>See id. </em>However, conclusory allegations, unwarranted factual deductions or legal conclusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-16\">Upon thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find' no reversible error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-17\">This case arises from the precipitous decline in the value of the common stock of iXL Enterprises, Inc. and the resultant pecuniary loss to Next Century. iXL was a publicly traded corporation engaged in the business of providing strategic consulting, including Internet-based solutions, to corporate users of information technology. Net Response, LLC (\u201cNet Response\u201d), which was wholly owned by appellant, developed Internet sites and provided Internet-related services, such as website design and maintenance. On September 22, 1998, Net Response was merged into iXL-DC, a wholly owned subsidiary of iXL. As a consequence of this merger, Next Century received 701,375 shares of Class B common stock in iXL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>On November 19, 1999, seven million shares of iXL stock were offered for sale to the public. In connection with this offering a \u201clock up\u201d agreement was executed, pursuant to which numerous existing iXL shareholders, including Next Century, consented not to sell their shares during the ensuing 90 days, or until February 17, 2000. On February 13, 2000, as this deadline approached, Ellis, the chairman and CEO of iXL, sent to the shareholders who were parties to the lock up agreement a memorandum that may fairly be characterized as a plea that its recipients not sell their shares immediately upon the expiration of the 90 day period. In this correspondence Ellis expressed his concern that in the event of a massive selloff \u201cour stock could plummet.\u201d In an effort to induce shareholders to retain their stake in iXL, he continued: \u201cI think our share price will start to stabilize and then rise as our Company\u2019s strong performance continues.\u201d Ellis also indicated that he personally did not intend to sell any shares on or soon after February 17, 2000, and that he hoped the memorandum\u2019s recipients would follow suit. Despite these pleas, appellee clarified that \u201cI am not telling you cannot sell any of your shares, [sic.] Instead, I am telling you that I personally think that you would be mistaken to sell any of your shares now.... If we all wait at least one more month, we could turn this downdraft around.\u201d Ellis also provided instructions for those who wished to sell despite his contrary pleas, and concluded by reiterating that \u201cI can only ask for your individual cooperation. I cannot dictate what you can or cannot do.\u201d Next Century avers that Ellis repeated his representation regarding iXL\u2019s \u201cstrong performance\u201d during a subsequent telephone conversation with Jon Rubin, one of appellant\u2019s officers and directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Next Century says that based on these representations it decided not to sell its iXL shares on or around February 17, 2000, when those shares each were valued at $40. Instead, it waited to sell until November 7, 2000, when iXL merged with Scient Corporation, at which time the same shares were each valued at $.29, representing a loss of $39.71 per share, or a total loss of $27,851,601.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">On March 23, 2001, based on this pattern of dealing, Next Century filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, in which it asserted claims sounding in fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty. Appellant argued that despite Ellis\u2019s representation regarding iXL\u2019s \u201cstrong performance,\u201d appellee knew that the company actually had been plagued by an inability to complete projects, numerous resultant customer disputes and overstated accounts receivable, revenues, assets and earnings. Moreover, Next Century alleged that Ellis was aware that iXL\u2019s share price of $40 had been intentionally and artificially inflated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">However, on October 17, 2001 the district court dismissed each of appellant\u2019s claims pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Subsequently, on November 14, 2001 Next Century filed an amended complaint in which it asserted only fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims. Ellis responded by again moving for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), and on July 30, 2002 the district court granted this second motion to dismiss. The court reasoned that appellant had failed to plead facts constituting justifiable reliance, which is an indispensable element of both fraud and negligent misrepresentation under Georgia law. It is from this latter order that Next Century presently appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">On appeal, Next Century contends that contrary to the district court\u2019s conclusions, its complaint does state claims for fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>and negligent misrepresentation. It argues specifically that under Georgia law expressions of opinion can be actionable if the speaker possesses \u201cspecial knowledge\u201d of their veracity, and that its reliance on Ellis\u2019s representations was reasonable because of the close personal relationship between appellant and Ellis, appellee\u2019s position within iXL and the confirmation of the substance of Ellis\u2019s February 13, 2001 memorandum by iXL press releases and SEC filings. Next Century also emphasizes that reasonableness of its rebanee on appebee\u2019s statements is a factual question properly resolved by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Ellis argues in response that (1) appellant\u2019s complaint fails to satisfy the heightened pleading standard for fraud set forth in Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b); (2) appellant has failed to state viable fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims under Georgia law because (a) Ellis merely expressed his opinion as to the likelihood of a future <em>event </em>\u2014 viz., that iXL would perform strongly in the future \u2014 as opposed to a past or present fact, and (b) as a matter of law appebant could not have justifiably relied on his statements; and (3) appellant failed to raise before the district court\u2014 and therefore has waived \u2014 its arguments that (a) Ellis\u2019s representations fall within a \u201cspecial knowledge\u201d exception to the non-actionabbity of statements of opinion, and (b) the reasonableness of Next Century\u2019s rebanee on appellee\u2019s representations is established by the close personal relationship that Ebis enjoyed with Next Century personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">Under Georgia law, which applies in this diversity action, the tort of fraud consists of five elements: \u201c(1) false representation by defendant; (2) scienter; (3) intent to induce the plaintiff to act or refrain from acting; (4) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and (5) damage to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Ades v. Werther, </em>256 Ga.App. 8, 567 S.E.2d 340, 343 (2002) (citation omitted). However, as the Georgia Court of Appeals has explained, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that a false representation made by a defendant, to be actionable, must relate to an existing fact or a past event. Fraud cannot consist of mere broken promises, unfilled predictions or erroneous conjecture as to future events.\u201d <em>Fuller v. Perry, </em>223 Ga.App. 129, 476 S.E.2d 793, 796 (1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">In its brief, appellant points to\u2014 and, indeed, repeatedly draws our attention to \u2014 only one specific<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> statement made by Ellis that fabs within' this definition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That is his representation in his February 13, 2000 memorandum that: \u201cI think our share price will start to stabbize and then rise as our Company\u2019s strong performance continues.\u201d Notably, the first half of this sentence plainly is not actionable under a fraud theory, as it is framed as a mere opinion as to future events. <em>See GCA Strategic Inv. Fund, Ltd. v. Joseph Charles &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>245 Ga.App. 460, 537 S.E.2d 677, 682 (2000) (\u201cMisrepresentations are not actionable unless the complaining party was justified in relying thereon in the exercise of common pru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>dence and diligence. Moreover, a party is not justified in relying on and assuming to be true representations consisting of mere expressions of opinion, hope, expectation, puffing, and the like; rather, representations of this nature must be inquired into and examined to ascertain the truth.\u201d). Accordingly, the only portion of Ellis\u2019s statement that could possibly constitute actionable fraud is his declaration regarding iXL\u2019s \u201cstrong performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">However, we believe that the sounder interpretation of these words is that they constitute mere \u201cpuffing,\u201d and that as such appellant Next Century cannot demonstrate the satisfaction of either the first or fourth element of fraud under Georgia law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There are two primary bases for this conclusion. First, Ellis\u2019s characterization of iXL\u2019s performance as \u201cstrong\u201d is not the sort of empirically verifiable statement that can be affirmatively disproven, as it is inherently a label expressive of, and generated by, opinion. As such, although to our knowledge the Georgia courts never have addressed whether the characterization of a company\u2019s performance as \u201cstrong\u201d constitutes mere puffery, other courts have answered this question affirmatively. <em>See, e.g., San Leandro Emergency Med. Group Profit Sharing Plan v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc., </em>75 F.3d 801, 807, 811 (2d Cir.1996) (holding that the statement \u201c[w]e expect 1993 to mark another year of strong growth in earnings per share,\u201d constituted non-actionable puffery, reasoning that a rational investor would not have relied thereon); <em>In re ATI Techs., Inc. Secs. Litig., </em>216 F.Supp.2d 418, 433 (E.D.Pa.2002) (\u201cATI\u2019s spin on its historical performance, as setting a \u2018record in revenue, conferring a \u201cstrong start,\u201d and giving ATI \u201cmarket leadership,\u201d is puffery.\u2019 These self-congratulatory comments would not have significantly altered the mix of information deemed important to a reasonable investor in making its investment decision.\u201d); <em>In re Splash Tech. Holdings, Inc. Secs. Litig., </em>160 F.Supp.2d 1059, 1077 (N.D.Cal.2001) (\u201c[S]tatements which used the words \u2018healthy,\u2019 \u2018strong,\u2019 or \u2018increased awareness\u2019 constitute! ] vague assessments of past results, on which no reasonable investor would rely.\u201d); <em>see also Lasker v. New York State Elec. &amp; Gas Corp., </em>85 F.3d 55, 59 (2d Cir.1996) (holding in the context of a federal securities fraud claim that \u201cby proffering its conviction that [its] \u2018business strategies [would] lead to continued prosperity,\u2019 NYSEG was in no way insuring that dividend rates would remain constant, or that the stock price would not decline. These statements consist of precisely the type of \u2018puffery\u2019 that this and other circuits have consistently held to be inaction-able.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">This conclusion is perfectly consistent with the Georgia courts\u2019 explanation of the concept of puffery. <em>See Sheffield v. Darby, </em>244 Ga.App. 437, 535 S.E.2d 776, 779 (2000) (collecting examples). Indeed, as the Georgia Court of Appeals has said in a slightly different substantive context, \u201c[m]ere \u2018puffing\u2019 does not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>legal fraud, the same not being calculated to really mislead a purchaser, especially when he is afforded a full opportunity to form his own independent opinion as to the advisability of becoming a purchaser.... \u201d <em>Marler v. Dancing Water Lakes, Inc., </em>167 Ga.App. 99, 305 S.E.2d 876, 878 (1983) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">The second basis for our conclusion that Ellis\u2019s statement is not actionable under Georgia law is especially relevant to the reasonable rebanee element of the prima facie showing of fraud. Specifically, when considered in the context of the February 13, 2001 memorandum as a whole, it is perfectly plain that appellee\u2019s comment regarding iXL\u2019s \u201cstrong performance\u201d cannot possibly have induced the rebanee of any reasonable investor, especially one possessing the financial sophistication of Next Century. Indeed, this question is not sufficiently close to warrant presentation to a jury. <em>See generally Tri-Eastern, </em>342 S.E.2d at 349; <em>see also San Leandro, </em>75 F.3d at 807, 811 (holding that the defendant\u2019s statement that \u201c[w]e expect 1993 to mark another year of strong growth in earnings per share\u201d is \u201cpuffery\u201d that \u201ccannot have misled a reasonable investor ... \u201d); <em>In re Eng\u2019g Animation Secs. Litig., </em>110 F.Supp.2d 1183, 1195 (S.D.Iowa 2000) (labeling as mere puffery a CFO\u2019s statement that his company was \u201cin strong financial condition and our business prospects remain excehent\u201d); <em>Simon v. Am. Power Conversion Corp., </em>945 F.Supp. 416, 428 (D.R.I.1996) (labeling as puffery a CEO\u2019s statement that \u201cwe are gaining market share, we are gaining momentum, and our revenues are strong\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">Ellis\u2019s memorandum was replete with caveats that iXL\u2019s stock price had been on a \u201cdownward\u201d track, and that the hopeful tone of the correspondence was a product of Ebis\u2019s personal beliefs and opinions. Moreover, it not only clarified in the most explicit conceivable terms that Next Century was entitled to sell its shares, but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>also set forth the procedure to be followed if appellant wished to sell despite Ellis\u2019s contrary pleas. Finally, towards the end of the memorandum appellee reiterated that \u201cI can only ask for your individual cooperation. I cannot dictate what you can or cannot do. However, it is times like this where we need to act like a Team. Let\u2019s hang together and make the daytrad-ers eat crow.\u201d Quite simply, we do not believe that Next Century could justifiably have relied on Ellis\u2019s statement that iXL\u2019s performance had been \u201cstrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Appellant\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim fails for largely the same reason. Under Georgia law, the tort of negligent misrepresentation consists of 3 elements: (1) the defendant\u2019s negligent supply of false information to foreseeable persons, known or unknown; (2) such persons\u2019 reasonable reliance upon that false information; and (3) economic injury proximately resulting from such reliance. <em>Hardaway Co. v. Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade &amp; Douglas, Inc., </em>267 Ga. 424, 479 S.E.2d 727, 729 (1997). As the Georgia courts have recognized, the reasonable rebanee that is required to state a negligent misrepresentation claim is equivalent to that needed in the fraud context. <em>See Paul v. Destito, </em>250 Ga.App. 631, 550 S.E.2d 739, 745 (2001); <em>Artzner v. A &amp; A Exterminators, Inc., </em>242 Ga.App. 766, 531 S.E.2d 200, 205 (2000) (\u201cAs the same principles apply to both fraud and negligent misrepresentation, justifiable reliance is an essential element of [both claims].\u201d). As explained, <em>supra, </em>Next Century cannot justifiably have relied on Ellis\u2019s statement regarding iXL\u2019s \u201cstrong performance.\u201d This conclusion is equally fatal to appellant\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim as it is to that sounding in fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">Because Next Century is not entitled to relief even when its claims are viewed in the light most favorable to it, the district court correctly granted Ellis\u2019s motion for dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">. The need for specificity here derives from Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). <em>See United States ex rel. Clausen v. Lab. Corp. of Am., Inc., </em>290 F.3d 1301, 1310 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">. The district court noted that appellant had alleged that a November 29, 1999 press release and iXL's 1999 and 2000 financial statements also were fraudulent. However, in its brief, Next Century plainly points to these statements as evidence that Ellis was aware of the falsity of his characterization of iXL's performance as \"strong\u201d when he so labeled it on February 13, 2001. Despite its reiteration before us that these statements were themselves false, appellant does not raise on appeal separate fraud claims based on these statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">. It seems to us evident that these prongs of the fraud inquiry overlap to a substantial extent. If a fraud claim is based on a mere statement of opinion or expectation, then the court is not presented with a representation as to an empirically verifiable truth such as would satisfy the first prong. <em>See King v. Codisco, Inc., </em>217 Ga.App. 704, 458 S.E.2d 881, 882 (1995) (holding a promise to give a customer the \"lowest\u201d price of any customer in a given geographic area to satisfy the first element of the fraud inquiry because \"it is definite, capable of exact proof, and not a mere expression of opinion\u201d). Similarly, as explained in <em>GCA Strategic Inv. Fund, </em>a party cannot justifiably rely on a statement \u2014 as it must do in order to satisfy the fourth fraud element \u2014 that is not empirically verifiable, e.g., an expression of opinion or \"puffing.\u201d <em>See </em>537 S.E.2d at 682.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">. It is to the issue of whether Next Century actually enjoyed such an opportunity to form its \"own independent opinion\u201d that appellant\u2019s \"special knowledge\u201d argument is directed. Under Georgia law, as explained above, reliance on puffing or mere expressions of opinion generally is unjustifiable as a matter of law; a commercial actor is required to investigate the veracity of such statements before he may reasonably relied thereon. <em>See Wilkinson v. Walker, </em>143 Ga.App. 838, 240 S.E.2d 210, 211 (1977) (citations omitted). However, it is true, as Next Century notes, that expressions of opinion or aspiration can become actionable where the speaker has \"special knowledge\u201d of the matters about which he is speaking and the listener is ignorant of the same. <em>See Tri-Eastern Petroleum Corp. v. Glenn's Super Gas, Inc., </em>178 Ga.App. 144, 342 S.E.2d 346, 349 (1986). However, as <em>Tri-Eastern </em>makes clear, even where this latter situation is manifest the listener is not completely relieved of the obligation to inves- \u2022 tigate the veracity of the representation. In fact, in that case the court held the statements in question not to be actionable based on the plaintiff\u2019s absolute failure to attempt to ascertain the veracity of the assertions in question. <em>See id. </em>In this case, although Next Century repeatedly claims in its amended complaint that Ellis was aware of the genuine nature of iXL's financial condition and that it was not privy to this information, it never asserts that it even attempted to investigate how strong the company\u2019s performance had been. As such, even assuming the \"special knowledge\u201d exception to the unactionability of statements of opinion to be otherwise applicable in this case \u2014 and further assuming appellant\u2019s argument as to the applicability of this exception to be properly before us \u2014 the exception does not resuscitate Next Century\u2019s claims. As in <em>Tri-Eastern, </em>this is so despite the fact that \"[ojrdinarily, questions of ... whether the plaintiff could have protected himself by the exercise of proper diligence are ... questions for the jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">We also note that Next Century has directed us to no holding of the Georgia courts indicating that otherwise non-actionable puffery is rendered actionable by the existence of a personal relationship between the speaker and listener.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
