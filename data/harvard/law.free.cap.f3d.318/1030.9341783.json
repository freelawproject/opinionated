Ortiz challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to seven of his nine firearms-related convictions and makes an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge to his sentence. After review, we affirm as to Ortiz\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">I. INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-9\">A nine-count indictment charged Ortiz with (1) making false statements to a federally licensed firearms dealer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6) (Counts 1 through 7); (2) dealing in firearms without a license, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(1)(A) (Count 8); and (3) transporting firearms in interstate commerce with intent to engage in dealing in firearms without a license, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(b) (Count 9). The jury convicted Ortiz on all nine counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">On appeal, Ortiz does not challenge his convictions in counts 8 and 9. Instead, Ortiz challenges only his convictions under counts 1 through 7. As to those seven counts, Ortiz argues that the government did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he made false statements to a federal firearms dealer. Thus, we outline in detail the trial evidence as to those seven counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-11\">II. TRIAL EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"Aq6\">\n<em>A. Ortiz Purchased Seventeen Guns</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-12\">At the time of his offenses, Ortiz was a private in the U.S. Army, stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia. Ortiz legally could purchase firearms in the State of Georgia for himself. Ortiz made a total of seven sales transactions with two pawn shops in Hinesville, Georgia, resulting in his aggregate purchase of seventeen pistols. Prior to each purchase, he completed an ATF Form 4473, answering \u201cyes\u201d to question 9a: \u201cAre you the actual buyer of the firearm indicated on this form?\u201d The question continues: \u201c[i]f you answer \u2018no\u2019 to this question the dealer cannot transfer the firearm to you. <em>(See Important Notice 1.) </em>\u201d Important Notice 1 warns that \u201c[a]ny individual who is not buying the firearm for himself or herself or as a gift, but who completes the form, violates the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-14\">On the following dates, Ortiz purchased the listed firearms and completed ATF Forms 4473, as described above, which forms were kept on file at the relevant pawn shop:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-15\">\n<em>Mr. Cash Pawnshop</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-16\">August 1, 2000: Intratec, model AB-10, 9 MM pistol, SN A051098</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-17\">August 23, 2000: Hi-Point, model C9MM, 9MM pistol, SN P065627</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-19\">October 3, 2000: Hi-Point, model C9MM, 9MM pistol, SN P065541</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-21\">Hi-Point, model CF380, .380 caliber pistol, SN P741351</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-22\">Hi-Point, model CF380, .380 caliber pistol, SN P741305</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-23\">October 13, 2000: Hi-Point, model CF380, .380 caliber pistol, SN P741355</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-26\">Hi-Point, model CF380, .380 caliber pistol, SN P741306</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-27\">Hi-Point, model JC40, .40 caliber pistol, SN 112014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-28\">Hi-Point, model JC40, .40 caliber pistol, SN 112013</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-29\">\n<em>Super Pawn</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>July 28, 2000: Lorcin, model L380, .380 caliber pistol, SN 445386 Lorcin, model L380, .380 caliber pistol, SN 552608</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-5\">October 3, 2000: Jennings, model Jennings Nine, 9MM pistol, SN 13046098 Intratec, model AB-10, 9MM pistol, SN A054690</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-6\">October 13, 2000: Lorcin, model L380, .380 caliber pistol, SN 549756 Lorcin, model L380, .380 caliber pistol, SN 556690</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-7\">Lorcin, model L380, .380 caliber pistol, SN 556693</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-8\">Lorcin, model L380, .380 caliber pistol, SN 556691</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">When an unlicensed person purchases two or more pistols and/or revolvers within a five-business day period, the licensed firearms dealer (a) must complete an ATF Form 3310.4 with information about the purchaser and the firearms sold and (b) submit it to the National Tracing Center and State or local authorities, as provided on the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">Upon receiving the ATF Forms 3310.4 reporting multiple gun sales to Ortiz, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\u201cATF\u201d) had suspicions as to whether Ortiz was reselling the firearms due to the large quantity of pistols purchased, the purchase of multiples of the same model of pistol, and the fact that the pistol models purchased were low cost. (The ATF indicated that low cost guns are often sold at a much higher cost and thus allow for a greater profit upon resale.) In addition, Georgia is considered a \u201csource area\u201d due to the ease with which handguns may be purchased. Because Ortiz was an army soldier, the ATF notified Fort Stewart about its suspicions and requested assistance. The U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division (\u201cCID\u201d) informed the ATF that Ortiz had not registered any firearms, despite a requirement that soldiers who reside on post are required to register any weapons in their possession. The CID obtained a search warrant from a military magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-13\">On November 14, 2000, CID Agent Hickey and ATF Special Ag\u00e9nt Louis Val-oze conducted a warrant-based search of Ortiz\u2019s quarters and found no firearms. The search produced sales receipts, one dated August 23, 2000, and three dated October 13, 2000, from the pawnshops for gun purchases, for full metal jacket purchases and for bus and plane transportation between Savannah and New York City.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-14\">\n<em>B. Ortiz\u2019s Signed Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-15\">On November 21, 2000, CID Agents Hickey and Miller met Ortiz at Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia, upon his return from military training in California. ATF Agents Valoze and John Limbach also were present at the airport. The agents did not arrest Ortiz at that time, but did interview him \u2014 first at the CID office and then at the ATF field office. The agents advised Ortiz of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ortiz read and signed waivers of his rights to counsel and to remain silent, and agreed to speak with the agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>At the CID office, Ortiz stated that he had transported the seventeen firearms to New York City. During his interview at the ATF office, Ortiz agreed to make a written statement, which he asked Agent Valoze to write for him, about his alleged firearms-related activity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After Agent Valoze completed the statement on Ortiz\u2019s behalf, Ortiz read it and signed each page of his statement. Ortiz made no changes or corrections to the statement dictated to Agent Valoze. Above the signature block where he signed, Ortiz verified that his statement was true and correct as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axx\">I have read the foregoing statement consisting of_pages, each of which I have signed. I fully understand this statement and I declare, certify, verify and/or state under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I made the corrections shown and placed my initials opposite each. I made this statement freely and voluntarily without any threats or rewards, or promises of reward having been made to me in return for it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">ATF Form 5000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">The government introduced Ortiz\u2019s signed statement into evidence at trial. According to his statement, Ortiz traveled to New York City and sold four guns to Richard Alexander Rivera (\u201cRivera\u201d or \u201cAlex Rivera\u201d), whom he knew from when he lived in New York, for about $900.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He then made a second trip to New York City and sold five guns to Martin Jenkins (\u201cJenkins\u201d or \u201cMarty Jenkins\u201d) for about $900. On a third trip, Ortiz again traveled to New York City and sold eight guns to Rivera for about $1300.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ortiz resold seventeen guns, the same number of guns he had purchased in Georgia, to the two buyers in New York City. Because they are not Georgia residents, neither Rivera nor Jenkins legally could purchase firearms in Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-10\">Ortiz\u2019s statement indicated that <em>\u201c[b]efore I purchased any of these firearms, </em>an individual named Alex Rivera, a friend of my sister, Elisha Ortiz, had asked me if I could buy guns for him in Georgia\u201d (emphasis added). In his statement,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ortiz described each of his three trips to New York City. Regarding the first trip, Ortiz stated that he traveled to New York City by Greyhound bus with the first four guns, which he took to his fiancee\u2019s house. She objected to having the guns there, so Ortiz \u201ccalled Alex Rivera ... and offered to sell him the guns.\u201d He then returned to Hinesville, Georgia. Using some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>proceeds from his previous sale, Ortiz purchased five more guns in Hinesville. As to this second purchase for Rivera, Ortiz\u2019s statement also indicated: <em>\u201cRivera had asked me to purchase more firearms </em>and that he would buy them from me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">About one week later, Ortiz made his second trip. He returned to New York City by bus and brought the five guns he purchased in Hinesville to his sister\u2019s house. His sister provided him with the name of Marty Jenkins, a friend of hers, as a potential buyer. Ortiz contacted Jenkins. Jenkins came to Ortiz\u2019s sister\u2019s house, paid cash and picked up the guns. Ortiz flew back to Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">On his third trip to New York City, Ortiz brought eight guns by Greyhound bus. Ortiz stated that he \u201ccalled Alex Rivera from the bus station in New York and told him that I had the guns and told him to meet me at my sister\u2019s house.\u201d According to Ortiz\u2019s statement, Rivera met Ortiz at his sister\u2019s house and gave Ortiz about $1300 for the guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">While being interviewed on November 21, 2000, Ortiz agreed to telephone Rivera and Jenkins. Ortiz made a total of five telephone calls, two of which were unsuccessful attempts to reach Jenkins. Each call was made in the presence of Agent Valoze and recorded by the ATF via mi-crocassette recorder. The recorded calls indicated that Rivera and Jenkins had purchased guns from Ortiz. Arrest warrants were obtained for Rivera and Jenkins and were executed by the ATF in New York City on November 30, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">At the time the arrest warrant was served, Rivera consented to a search of his home. Among other things, four guns were recovered at Rivera\u2019s home, and the serial numbers on three of them had been obliterated. The guns were identified as four of those originally purchased by Ortiz. Although three had no serial numbers remaining, the guns were found with their boxes, and each box listed the serial number of the corresponding gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-12\">\n<em>C. Rivera\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-13\">Rivera\u2019s testimony at trial confirmed that he purchased the weapons at issue from Ortiz.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rivera\u2019s testimony, however, diverged somewhat from Ortiz\u2019s as to who initiated the purchases and as to the gun resale prices in some instances. Although Ortiz\u2019s statement indicated Rivera initiated the purchases and asked Ortiz to buy the guns, Rivera testified that he did not arrange in advance to purchase guns from Ortiz prior to Ortiz\u2019s purchase of the guns at Super Pawn and Mr. Cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-14\">According to Rivera, on each occasion Ortiz was already in possession of the guns when he contacted Rivera to inquire whether he was interested in purchasing them. Rivera further testified that Ortiz had a different buyer lined up for the first batch of guns but that the deal fell through and then Rivera bought them. Rivera contends that he later paid $100 to swap two previously purchased guns with two in the second group Ortiz brought to New York City. Rivera also testified that he bought the third batch of guns from Ortiz only after Ortiz was extremely persistent in asking Rivera to purchase them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-15\">Additionally, Rivera stated that Ortiz was the person who had obliterated the serial numbers on three of the four guns found in Rivera\u2019s home. Rivera explained that Ortiz did not deface the fourth gun because Ortiz ran out of time before leaving for military training in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>Finally, Rivera further testified as follows: that he lives in Bronx, New York, and always has worked \u201coff-the-books\u201d (for cash and without reporting his income) with the exception of one job with a toy store; that he smoked marijuana from age 18 to the date of his arrest by the ATF in connection with this case; and that he was involved for approximately eight years in delivering stolen cars to designated destinations. Rivera never was arrested for his involvement with the stolen cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">A jury convicted Ortiz on all nine counts. The district court sentenced Ortiz to terms of 33 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. Ortiz timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">With respect to Ortiz\u2019s convictions, we review <em>de novo </em>whether there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. A jury\u2019s verdict will be affirmed \u201cif a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Miles, </em>290 F.3d 1341, 1355 (11th Cir.2002). We view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the government, with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in the government\u2019s favor\u201d in determining a sufficiency of the evidence claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">With respect to Ortiz\u2019s sentence, \u201c[w]e review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 800, 806 (11th Cir.2000) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, which provides that \u201c[t]he court of appeals ... shall accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous and shall give due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AI5\">\n<em>A. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">In counts 1 through 7, Ortiz was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-13\">it shall be unlawful ... for any person in connection with the acquisition ... of any firearm ... from a ... licensed dealer ... knowingly to make any false or fictitious oral or written statement or to furnish or exhibit any false, fictitious, or misrepresented identification, intended or likely to deceive such ... dealer ... with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of such firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6). To sustain a conviction under \u00a7 922(a)(6), the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) the defendant knowingly made; (2) a false or fictitious written statement in connection with the purchase of firearms; (3) intended to deceive or likely to deceive a licensed firearms dealer; (4) and the false statement was a fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or disposition of the firearm. <em>Id.; see United States v. Nelson, </em>221 F.3d 1206, 1210 n. 6 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 951, 121 S.Ct. 356, 148 L.Ed.2d 286 (2000); <em>United States v. Polk, </em>118 F.3d 286, 294-95 (5th Cir.1997).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The identity of the actual purchaser is clearly \u201ca fact material to the lawfulness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>sale\u201d of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6). <em>See United States v. Klais, </em>68 F.3d 1282, 1283 (11th Cir.1995).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, a defendant violates \u00a7 922(a)(6) when the defendant signs the ATF form using a false name because that misrepresents the identity of the purchaser. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>71 F.3d 819, 833 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">This Court also has made it clear that \u201cstraw purchases\u201d equally misrepresent the identity of the purchaser in a firearm sale and violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6). <em>See Nelson </em>221 F.3d at 1210. Straw purchases of firearms occur when an unlawful purchaser, such as Rivera, uses a lawful \u201cstraw man\u201d purchaser, such as Ortiz, to obtain a firearm. <em>See Nelson </em>221 F.3d at 1209.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cIf an ineligible buyer could simply use a \u2018straw man\u2019 or agent to obtain a firearm from a licensed dealer, the statutory scheme would be too easily defeated.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In <em>Nelson, </em>the two ineligible buyers actually supplied the money for the firearms and recruited and paid Georgia residents to purchase the firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">In contrast to <em>Nelson, </em>Ortiz points out that he used Ms own money to purchase the firearms and that Rivera testified that he never requested Ortiz to make purchases on his behalf. Ortiz\u2019s argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, the evidence was more than sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Rivera had in fact asked Ortiz to purchase firearms for him and that Ortiz, therefore, was a straw purchaser for Rivera and not the actual buyer.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In his own signed statement, Ortiz expressly admitted that Rivera made two requests for Ortiz to purchase guns for him before Ortiz actually purchased the guns, which he then promptly delivered to Rivera. Thus, an agency relationship clearly is established with respect to the sales transactions involving Rivera.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">Second, there is no requirement that the ineligible purchaser must supply the money up front in order for a straw purchase to occur. Here, there was evidence that Rivera had asked Ortiz to buy firearms; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>Ortiz then bought the firearms for Rivera, promptly delivered them to Rivera and was paid by Rivera. We conclude that the evidence sufficiently showed that Ortiz purchased the guns for Rivera, an ineligible buyer, that Ortiz was not buying the guns for himself or as a gift, and that Ortiz misrepresented that he was the \u201cactual buyer\u201d on ATF Form 4473.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Indeed, ATF Form 4473 specifically asks in question 9a: \u201cAre you the actual buyer of the firearm indicated on this form?\u201d And, Important Notice 1 explains: \u201cAny individual who is not buying the firearm for himself or herself or as a gift, but who completes the form, violates the law.\u201d Ortiz expressly was put on notice that he is the \u201cactual buyer\u201d <em>only if </em>the purchase of firearms is for himself or for a gift and, thus, as to what constitutes a violation of the law. Thus, a straw transaction occurred here because Ortiz <em>at the time of completing Form H7S </em>had no intention of keeping the firearms or giving them as a gift and instead was buying the firearms for Rivera, an ineligible purchaser who then paid for and took delivery of the firearms. In this circumstance, Ortiz misrepresents that he is the \u201cactual buyer.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">Sufficient evidence also supports Ortiz\u2019s conviction on all counts involving the guns that he delivered to Jenkins. While there is no direct evidence that Jenkins asked Ortiz to purchase the guns before Ortiz actually bought them, there is overwhelming circumstantial evidence that, at the time of the purchases in Georgia, Ortiz equally was not buying the guns sold to Jenkins for himself or as a gift to another, but specifically was purchasing the guns for the sole purpose of immediately delivering and selling them to an ineligible buyer in New York City, whether the buyer is Rivera or Jenkins. In this factual circumstance, Ortiz may not necessarily be a straw man for Jenkins, but Ortiz is no less involved in a sham transaction and is misrepresenting that he is the \u201cactual buyer\u201d of the firearms when he answers \u201cyes\u201d to question 9a on ATF Form 4473.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">Indeed, it is undisputed that neither Rivera nor Jenkins legally could purchase firearms in Georgia. Ortiz purchased all seventeen guns in Georgia in an approximately eleven-week period between July 28, 2000, and October 13, 2000, and by the time of his November 21, 2000, interview all the guns were delivered to Rivera and Jenkins in New York City, and Ortiz was paid. In fact, Ortiz used the proceeds from the first sale to Rivera to buy more guns to deliver to ineligible buyers in New York City. The types of guns purchased by Ortiz were of low cost and commonly are resold for profit. Ortiz purchased multiples of the same model of gun. None of the seventeen guns were registered with Fort Stewart authorities. Georgia is considered a \u201csource area\u201d due to the ease with which handguns may be purchased, whereas the legal purchase of handguns in New York is extremely restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">Given all the factual circumstances in this case, we conclude that the evidence was also sufficient to sustain Ortiz\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6) as to the guns in the Jenkins transaction. As already mentioned, ATF Form 4473 specifically asks in question 9a: \u201cAre you the actual buyer of the firearm indicated on this form?\u201d The question is not merely \u201care you the buyer of the firearm,\u201d but \u201care you the <em>actual </em>buyer of the firearm.\u201d The essence of the information sought by this question is further clarified by Important Notice 1, which warns \u201c[a]ny indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>vidual who is not buying the firearm for himself or herself or as a gift, but who completes the form, violates the law.\u201d This is precisely what Ortiz did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">\n<em>B. Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">As to his sentence, Ortiz contends that the district court erred in finding that he obliterated the serial numbers on certain guns and in imposing a 2-level increase to his offense level based on this fact finding. Ortiz contends that this fact should have been submitted to and decided by a jury under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a 2-level enhancement \u201c[i]f any firearm was stolen, or had an altered or obliterated serial number.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4). The evidence amply supported the district court\u2019s finding that Ortiz obliterated the serial numbers, and the district court properly imposed this 2-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">Ortiz also makes several <em>Apprendi-</em>based arguments attacking the district court\u2019s sentence, but none has merit. First, in <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cany fact [other than a prior conviction] that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Ortiz\u2019s concurrent terms of 33 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count of conviction do not exceed the statutory maximum penalty of 10 years for each of his \u00a7 922(a)(6) convictions. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2); <em>United States v. Le, </em>256 F.3d 1229, 1240 (11th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1145, 122 S.Ct. 1103, 151 L.Ed.2d 999 (2002); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>240 F.3d 927, 930 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, his sentence does not violate <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-10\">Second, this Court has held that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to calculations under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Snyder, </em>291 F.3d 1291, 1294 n. 3 (11th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>279 F.3d 947, 950 n. 2 (11th Cir.2002); <em>Le, </em>256 F.3d at 1240. Thus, the district court\u2019s fact finding under the Sentencing Guidelines about who obliterated the serial numbers does not violate <em>Ap-prendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-11\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-12\">For the forgoing reasons, we affirm Ortiz\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">. Specifically, they found four documents relating to one-way AirTran Airways travel from New York City to Savannah in the name of Raul Ortiz for 29 August (receipt), 30 August (receipt and boarding passes), 1 October (boarding passes) and 15 October (receipt and boarding passes); one one-way Delta Air Lines ticket in Ortiz\u2019s name for travel from New York City to Savannah on 9 October (ticket and boarding pass); and one Greyhound bus receipt in Ortiz's name on 13 and 14 October for overnight travel from Savannah to New York City.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1033-17\">. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">. According to Agent Valoze's testimony, Ortiz asked Agent Valoze to write the statement because Ortiz was nervous and did not want to write the statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">. Below Ortiz's signature, his statement contains this jurat, completed by Agent Valoze: \"Subscribed and sworn to before me this 21 day of November, []2000 at Savannah. Signature: [Louis Valoze], Title: Special Agent, ATF.\" ATF Form 5000. Ortiz, however, was not asked to and did not actually swear orally before Agent Valoze to the statement and its content. Instead, Agent Valoze as a matter of course completed this section with the date of the interview and his own signature and information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1034-11\">. Ortiz was bom in 1977 and raised in Bronx, New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1034-12\">. Rivera testified that he paid Ortiz (a) $2300 for the first batch of four guns, plus some ammunition and a bullet proof vest, (b) $100 to swap two older model guns previously purchased from Ortiz for newer models from the second batch Ortiz brought to New York City to sell to a different purchaser, and (c) $2100 for the second batch of four guns, for a total of three transactions with Ortiz. This account varies from Ortiz's statement, which gives different sales prices for the guns sold to Rivera and describes the two sales transactions with Rivera, but omits the swap.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1034-13\">. Ortiz and Jenkins did not testify at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">. Rivera testified that he had pled guilty to conspiring to purchase and sell firearms as well as to two other firearms charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">. <em>Smith </em>references \u00a7 3742(d) but this language is actually in \u00a7 3742(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">. In addition, specific intent is not an element of the offense. <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>794 F.2d 589, 591 (11th Cir.1986). In this regard, \u201cspecific intent'' means \u201c[t]he intent to accomplish the precise criminal act that one is later charged with.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>814 (Deluxe 7th ed.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">. \"Whether the identity of the purchaser is a fact material to the lawfulness of the transaction (that is, whether the lawfulness of a firearms sale can hinge on the identity of the purchaser) is purely a question of law.\u201d <em>Klais, </em>68 F.3d at 1283.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">. Although the defendant in <em>Nelson </em>was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A), this Court recognized that the reasoning of \u00a7 922(a)(6) \"provides guidance ... because of the similarities between the two provisions.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>221 F.3d at 1210 n. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">. Other courts have likewise held that \"straw purchases\u201d or similar sham transactions violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6). <em>See United States v. Lawrence, </em>680 F.2d 1126, 1128 (6th Cir.1982) (\"Other courts have upheld convictions for gun registration violations predicated on sham transactions and we must do so here.\u201d); <em>United States v. Sargent, </em>98 F.3d 325, 327 (7th Cir.1996) (gang member makes straw purchases of firearms for gang in exchange for \"money, protection, and status\u201d); <em>United States v. Remsza, </em>77 F.3d 1039 (7th Cir.1996) (defendant acts as \"straw purchaser\u201d for out-of-state resident).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1037-12\">. <em>See United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that the jury has \"exclusive province\u201d over the determination as to the credibility of a witness, and this Court may not revisit this question), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 996, 121 S.Ct. 1658, 149 L.Ed.2d 640 (2001); <em>see also United States v. Shenberg, </em>89 F.3d 1461, 1470 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that if a reasonable person could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury\u2019s verdict must stand).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1037-13\">. We recognize that Rivera testified otherwise, but conclude that, in light of Rivera's background, the jury properly could have discredited Rivera's testimony and believed the direct evidence of Ortiz\u2019s own admissions indicating that Rivera asked Ortiz to buy the guns for him prior to Ortiz's purchases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">. Because both Rivera and Jenkins were ineligible buyers, we do not address the situation where both the ultimate buyer and the \"straw purchaser\u201d are lawfully eligible to purchase firearms. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Polk, </em>118 F.3d 286 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
