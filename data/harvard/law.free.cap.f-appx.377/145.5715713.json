We affirmed Batista\u2019s sentence on appeal. <em>See United States v. Batista, </em>483 F.3d 193 (3d Cir.2007). Batista then moved in the District Court to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 12, 2008, the District Court granted the motion and reduced Batista\u2019s sentence to 151 months, the low end of the amended Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-17\">Shortly thereafter, Batista filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, raising several claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. On January 29, 2009, 2009 WL 235027, the District Court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits, and we denied Batista\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability. <em>See Batista v. United States, </em>CA 09-1640 (Oct. 28, 2009). In between those two decisions, on April 6, 2009, Batista filed a motion in the District Court for reconsideration of its order reducing his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-22\">The Government filed an opposition to Batista\u2019s motion, imploring the District Court to deny the motion as either merit-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>less or untimely. Based on its local rules, the District Court denied Batista\u2019s motion for reconsideration as untimely filed. The District Court alternatively concluded that, \u201c[t]o the extent that [Batista\u2019s] April 6, 2009 filing might be construed as a second or successive habeas petition, it does not meet the necessary prerequisites.\u201d Batista appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">We agree with the District Court that Batista\u2019s motion for reconsideration, filed almost eight months after the underlying order was entered, was untimely. <em>See </em>D.N.J. Civ. R. 7.1(i) (requiring motions for reconsideration to be filed within 10 days of the underlying order for which reconsideration is sought); D.N.J.Crim. R. 1.1 (providing that D.N.J. Civ. R. 7.1(i) applies in criminal cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Accordingly, because the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Batista\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and because this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s February 19, 2010 order, 2010 WL 607299.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-11\">. Batista relied on a retroactive amendment to \u00a7 2D 1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense level for most quantities of crack cocaine by two levels. <em>See United States v. Doe, </em>564 F.3d 305, 308 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b168-12\">. In the motion for reconsideration, Batista stated that \"[wjhile movant appreciates the court granting movant\u2019s motion, movant takes issue with this court\u2019s failure to lower mov-ant's sentence below the 2 levels authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d The motion for reconsideration was docketed in the civil case opened for Batista\u2019s habeas proceedings, even though the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings were docketed in DC No. 03-cr-00514.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion the District Court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration. <em>See Max\u2019s Seafood Caf\u00e9 v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir.1999). Summary affirmance is proper when \"it clearly appears that no substantial question is presented\" by an appeal. Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6. In addition, because Batista's April 6, 2009 filing was, without question, a motion for reconsideration of the District Court's August 12, 2008 order concerning his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we do not consider the District Court\u2019s subsequent order denying reconsideration as a \"final order in a proceeding under section 2255.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). Accordingly, Batista is not required to obtain a certificate of appealability-</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
