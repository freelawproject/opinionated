Fan was academically dismissed after he received unsatisfactory grades in two courses. Vicki Brewer, whom Fan identifies as the Principal Designated Student Officer (PDSO) at the University of Texas Medical Branch, then made an entry in the database of the Student Exchange and Visitors Information System (SEVIS) reflecting Fan\u2019s changed academic status. Fan was subsequently taken into custody by immigration officials and was placed in removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Fan then filed a civil rights complaint against Brewer seeking injunctive relief in the form of changes to his grades, revocation of his academic dismissal, and updates to his SEVIS record to reflect that he was still a student. Fan also demanded that he be awarded $500,000 in compensatory damages for termination of his study toward a Ph.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">The district court dismissed the action. It determined that Brewer had been sued in her official capacity and that she was entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity on Fan\u2019s claims for monetary damages and on his claims for retrospective injunctive relief. As to Fan\u2019s other federal law claims, the district court determined that Fan had failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. The district court also denied Fan\u2019s motion to add defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">Fan now appeals the dismissal of his claims against Brewer. Giving liberal constriction to Fan\u2019s pro se brief, we also understand him to appeal the denial of his motion to add defendants, which the district court implicitly treated as a motion to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">A district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) is subject to de novo review. <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007). A plaintiff fails to state a claim when the complaint does not contain \u201c\u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (quotation marks, citations, and footnote omitted). A district court does not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend if allowing amendment of the complaint would be futile. <em>Briggs v. Mississippi, </em>331 F.3d 499, 508 (5th Cir.2003). This court determines futility by applying \u201cthe same standard of legal sufficiency as applies under Rule 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>Stripling v. Jordan Production Co., LLC, </em>234 F.3d 863, 873 (5th Cir.2000) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Fan argues that, because UTMB received federal funding, none of the defendants has immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. A state is not immune under the Eleventh Amendment from suit in federal court for a violation of, \u201ctitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-7(a)(1). However, Fan, who claims that he was discriminated against on account of his national origin, has not shown that he has stated a claim on which relief could be granted under Title VI or under VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <em>See Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. To the extent that Fan argues that he is entitled to relief under the Equal Protection Clause for discrimination based on his national origin, his claims fail under the same analysis applicable to his Title VII claim. <em>See Lauderdale v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, Institutional Div., </em>512 F.3d 157, 166 (5th Cir.2007). Fan\u2019s claims against Brewer are based on her actions in updating the SEVIS database to reflect his academic dismissal. Because Brewer was merely fulfilling her duty under federal law to update the SEVIS database, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.3(g)(l)(vi), Fan\u2019s claim for violation of the \u201cBorder Security Act\u201d fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; moreover, the claim is legally frivolous because it is based on an indisputably meritless legal theory. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). To the extent that Fan asserts other federal law claims against Brewer, his conclusory allegations fail to state a claim on which relief an be granted. <em>See Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Finally, Fan argues that his unsatisfactory grades were not based on his academic performance and achievements. He argues that the district court erred in dismissing his due process challenges to his grades and his academic dismissal, and he claims that his rights to \u201cfree association and free assembly\u201d under the First Amendment were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Fan\u2019s complaint shows that he received hearings at which he appealed his grades and that he was also afforded a hearing regarding his academic dismissal. The procedures afforded Fan were more than sufficient to satisfy applicable due process standards. <em>See Board of Curators of the Univ. of Missouri v. Horowitz, </em>435 U.S. 78, 85-86, 98 S.Ct. 948, 55 L.Ed.2d 124 (1978); <em>Davis v. Mann, </em>882 F.2d 967, 973-75 (5th Cir.1989). Fan has not shown error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of his First Amendment claim. <em>See Regents of University of Michigan v. Ewing, </em>474 U.S. 214, 226, 106 S.Ct. 507, 88 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Brewer\u2019s motion for summary affirmance and to stay the briefing deadlines is denied. <em>See Southern Farm Bureau Cas. Ins. Co. v. Morgan, </em>339 F.2d 755, 756 (5th Cir.1964). All other outstanding motions are also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR SUMMARY AFFIRMANCE DENIED; ALL OTHER OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
