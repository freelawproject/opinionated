Thompson, a non-prisoner with a history of filing meritless pro se litigation, commenced this action by filing an application to proceed in <em>forma pauper-is </em>(IFP) along with a prolix, 130-page complaint, as well as a supporting affidavit, asserting five counts against the named defendants and seeking damages and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 1, 2009, the District Court denied Thompson\u2019s IFP application based upon an October 20, 2008, order entered in D.N.J. Civ. No. 04-cv-02548.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thompson timely filed a motion for reconsideration of the order denying IFP status. He also timely filed this appeal from that order. This Court stayed consideration of the appeal pending the District Court\u2019s ruling on the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">On October 28, 2009, 2009 WL 3486050, the District Court granted reconsideration, granted the application to proceed IFP, and dismissed Thompson\u2019s complaint <em>sua sponte </em>on the merits under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). The District Court observed that Thompson improperly sought to re-litigate claims that had been rejected on the merits in No. 04-cv-02548, principally a claim that he was unlawfully prevented from closing Narcotics Anonymous meetings with the \u201cLord\u2019s Prayer\u201d and prevented from attending such meetings. In addition, the District Court rejected Thompson\u2019s attempt to seek review of the final judgment in No. 04-CV-02548, as well as decisions issued by various state courts, and it further held that Thompson did not state a viable claim for relief against any of the named defendants for fraud, conspiracy, or a denial of constitutional rights. The District Court dismissed the pendent state law negligence claim without prejudice. Thompson timely filed an amended notice of appeal from the order dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Thompson has been granted leave to proceed IFP on appeal. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is plenary of the order dismissing the complaint. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). Because Thompson\u2019s appeal lacks any arguable legal merit, we will dismiss it under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">The District Court\u2019s Opinion dismissing the complaint on the merits is thoughtful and comprehensive, and we see no need to discuss Thompson\u2019s claims in any detail here. Suffice it to say that all counts in the complaint were properly dismissed for the reasons fully explained by the District Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Among other things, the District Court properly rejected Thompson\u2019s attempt to re-litigate or seek further review of claims that were fully adjudicated in No. 04-cv-02548, properly applied the doctrine of judicial immunity to bar claims for damages against the judges who rejected Thompson\u2019s past claims, and properly rejected as insufficient Thompson\u2019s allegations of collusion, conspiracy, and fraud on the part of the attorneys and others who participated in the prior proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Only one aspect of the District Court\u2019s ruling merits further discussion. The District Court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint states in part: \u201c[I]n light of his frequent and inappropriate filings and because this case is closed, Mr. Thompson may not file, and the Clerk of Court shall not accept, any action, motion, or pleading dealing with the issues resolved in this case without leave of the District Court.\u201d Docket No. 14, 10/20/09 Order at 2. This injunction against further litigation essentially reimposed the ban on additional filings that the District Court had imposed in No. 04-cv-02548. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra. </em>As noted, this Court affirmed the judgment in No. 04-cv-02548, including the order setting forth the injunction against further filings. <em>See </em>note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">We have held that a filing injunction against a vexatious litigant \u201cshould not be imposed by a court without prior notice and some occasion to respond.\u201d <em>Gagliardi v. McWilliams, </em>834 F.2d 81, 83 (3d Cir.1987). Here, because the District Court merely reimposed the injunction that was entered in No. 04-cv-02548, we are satisfied that Thompson had adequate notice. Further, any challenge to the injunction\u2019s scope is without merit, as the injunction is narrowly tailored to prohibit future action concerning the issues resolved in the present case. <em>See Chipps v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for the M.D. of Pa., </em>882 F.2d 72, 73 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">For these reasons, we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Thompson\u2019s pending motion for permission to file a Rule 60(b) motion is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-5\">. The District Court accurately described the complaint as raising the following five claims: (1) a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for alleged Fourteenth Amendment violations; (2) a civil rights conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985; (3) intentional fraud upon the court; (4) a RICO violation; and (5) state law negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-6\">. In No. 04-cv-02548, the District Court granted summary judgment to many of the same defendants named in the present action, and further held that \"in light of Mr. Thompson's frequent, inappropriate filings in this matter and because the docket is closed, the Clerk is directed to return to Mr. Thompson any further filings he attempts to submit in connection with this docket.\u201d Docket # 146, 10/20/08 Order at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b164-12\"><em>.See also Thompson v.
