For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">In February of 2003, a grand jury in the Northern District of Texas returned a three-count indictment against McTizic. Count one charged her with with bank fraud and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1344 &amp; 2. Count two charged her with possession of a forged security, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a). Count three charged her with fraudulent possession of identification documents, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(3). McTizic pleaded guilty to count one on October 27, 2003. At sentencing, McTizic\u2019s counsel objected to the two-level increase in her base offense level for the use of \u201csophisticated means\u201d to commit bank fraud and the four-level increase based on McTizic\u2019s role as the \u201corganizer\u201d or \u201cleader of criminal activity involving five or more participants\u201d. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C); \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). McTizic\u2019s counsel objected that these enhancements amounted to double-counting, but did not raise any constitutional objection. The district court overruled all of the objections, denied the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure under \u00a7 5K1.1 and sentenced her to 77 months imprisonment, which was near the bottom of the then-mandatory Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">McTizic appealed her conviction and sentence, which this court affirmed. <em>United States v. McTizic, </em>111 Fed.Appx. 255 (5th Cir.2004) (unpublished) <em>vacated by McTizic v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 917, 125 S.Ct. 1682, 161 L.Ed.2d 473 (2005). In a petition for rehearing, McTizic argued for the first time that her sentence was invalid in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). This court denied rehearing and McTizic filed a petition for certiorari. The Supreme Court vacated McTizic\u2019s conviction and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>McTizic, </em>544 U.S. at 917, 125 S.Ct. 1682. This court reinstated its judgment affirming conviction and sentence, declining to consider McTizic\u2019s Booker-related claims, as they had been presented for the first time in her petition for rehearing. <em>United States v. McTizic, </em>139 Fed.Appx. 635 (5th Cir.2005) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">McTizic timely filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in which she raised a number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. She claimed that her trial counsel failed to object that certain factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>issues related to sentencing had been resolved by a judge rather than a jury, in \u25a0violation of the Sixth Amendment, despite her specific instructions to make this objection. The government responded that McTizic had failed to establish that her counsel had been ineffective because this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Keith, </em>280 F.3d 784 (5th Cir.2000), foreclosed any objection on <em>Apprendi </em>grounds at the time of sentencing and counsel could not be expected to foresee the developments in the law following <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker. </em>The district court denied the motion for the reasons stated by the government and declined to order an evidentiary hearing. This court granted a COA on the question of whether McTizie\u2019s counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to heed her requests to lodge an objection under <em>Apprendi </em>to her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258 because we previously issued McTizic a COA in this case. \u201cWe \u2018review a district court\u2019s conclusions with regard to a petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel de novo.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Molina-Uribe, </em>429 F.3d 514, 518 (5th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Conley, </em>349 F.3d 837, 839 (5th Cir.2003)). We review \u201ca district court\u2019s refusal to grant an evidentiary hearing on a \u00a7 2255 motion for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Cavitt, </em>550 F.3d 430, 435 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the \u201cright to effective assistance of counsel at every critical stage of the proceedings against them.\u201d <em>Burdine v. Johnson, </em>262 F.3d 336, 344 (5th Cir. 2001). This right \u201cis denied when a defense attorney\u2019s performance falls below an objective standard of reasonableness and thereby prejudices the defense.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1, 4, 124 S.Ct. 1, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003) (citing <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 521, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003)). We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-pronged test established in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">To satisfy this test, a petitioner \u201c[fjirst ... must show that [his] counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cThis requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The petitioner must demonstrate that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Second, the petitioner \u201cmust show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cThis requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the [petitioner] of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To do so, the petitioner \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">We are mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that \u201cjudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. An appellate court \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id.; accord United States v. Fields, </em>565 F.3d 290, 294 (5th Cir.2009). Further, we must make \u201cevery effort ... to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>time.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Guided by this principle, \u201cwe have repeatedly held that \u2018there is no general duty on the part of defense counsel to anticipate changes in the law.\u2019\u201d <em>Fields, </em>565 F.3d at 294 (citing <em>Green v. Johnson, </em>116 F.3d 1115, 1125 (5th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Here, McTizic asserts that her counsel was ineffective for failing to lodge an objection under <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Blakely </em>to the district court\u2019s factual findings that supported her sentence enhancements. At the time of <em>McTizic\u2019s </em>sentencing, however, <em>Blakely </em>had not yet been decided and this court\u2019s controlling preceding made clear that <em>Apprendi </em>did not apply in cases where a defendant\u2019s sentence was not enhanced beyond the statutory maximum. <em>See Keith, </em>230 F.3d at 787; <em>United States v. Doggett, </em>230 F.3d 160, 165 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Meshack, </em>225 F.3d 556, 576 (5th Cir.2000), <em>amended on rehearing in part by </em>244 F.3d 367 (5th Cir.2001). McTizic\u2019s sentence of 77 months was well within the statutory maximum sentence for bank fraud. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344.- We have previously held that the failure of defense counsel to anticipate the direction that the Supreme Court would take in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>does not give rise to a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See, e.g., Fields, </em>565 F.3d at 297 (\u201c[W]e cannot hold Fields\u2019s counsel ineffective for failing to predict the absolute sea-change in federal sentencing wrought by <em>Booker.\u201d </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>332 Fed.Appx. 973 (5th Cir.2009) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">We pause to note that this case is somewhat distinguished by the fact that McTizic submitted a sworn affidavit in which she describes in detail how she was made aware of the potential impact of <em>Blakely </em>and communicated her request to her trial counsel that he file an objection based on the case. In general, attorneys are obliged to follow the explicit instructions of their clients. <em>See Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 820, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975) (\u201cThe counsel provision ... speaks of the \u2018assistance\u2019 of counsel, and an assistant, however expert, is still an assistant.\u201d); <em>Autry v. McKaskle, </em>727 F.2d 358, 362 (5th Cir.1984) (noting defense counsel\u2019s ethical obligations to follow a competent client\u2019s wishes). We believe that McTizic\u2019s counsel should have better communicated with her as to why he did not file an objection pursuant to <em>Apprendi. </em>Under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>rigorous test, however, we cannot say that the failure to raise what would have been a fruitless objection amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Because we find that McTizic has failed to meet the first prong of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>test, we need not address the question of prejudice. <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>207 F.3d 750, 751 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">We likewise conclude that there was no need for an evidentiary hearing in this case, as \u201cwe can conclude as a matter of law that [McTizic] cannot establish one or both of the elements necessary to establish [her] constitutional claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Walker, </em>68 F.3d 931, 934 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
