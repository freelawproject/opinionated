Cruz contends that the Immigration Judge and Board erred in concluding that he was not credible. He argues that his testimony, when considered along with the evidence in the record, establishes that he is entitled to withholding of removal and CAT relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-16\">\u201cWhen the BIA issues a decision, we review the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the BIA has expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Niftaliev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211, 1215 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo the extent that the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1199 (11th Cir.2009). Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning concerning the adverse credibility finding, we will review both decisions. \u201cCredibility determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we will not overturn them unless the record compels it.\u201d <em>Shkambi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>584 F.3d 1041, 1049 n. 6 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>ments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">The BIA and IJ gave specific, cogent reasons for finding Cruz not credible and for concluding that he was ineligible for withholding of removal. In support of the adverse credibility finding, the BIA and the IJ pointed to material omissions and inconsistencies in Cruz\u2019s hearing testimony and asylum application. In his application, Cruz alleged that MS-13 gang members attacked him in October 1996 and February 1997 because of his sexual orientation. However, at his hearing Cruz testified on direct examination that he did not know the identity of his attackers and had never seen them before. Only after the IJ pointed out the inconsistency did Cruz testify that his attackers were MS-gang members and that he feared they would attack him because of his sexual orientation if he returned to El Salvador. The BIA and IJ also pointed to inconsistencies in Cruz\u2019s hearing testimony. Cruz\u2019s testimony that he feared being attacked by MS-13 gang members because of his sexual orientation was inconsistent with his testimony that he only feared gangs because he believed that they would steal from him and attempt to recruit him if he returned to El Salvador.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Cruz contends that he should not have been discredited because Dr. Henriquez\u2019s letter corroborated his testimony. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (stating that \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant\u201d). In his brief, he argues that Dr. Henriquez\u2019s letter is the \u201csingle most important piece of evidence in this case\u201d and compels reversal. The letter, which was dated July 5, 2007, stated that Cruz was an emergency room patient on October 18, 1996 \u201cfor having received multiple injuries by, according to him, a group of men who showed contempt because of his sexual preference.\u201d The letter also stated that Cruz was hospitalized for five days in February 1997 after \u201cthe same act was repeated.\u201d We disagree with Cruz that Dr. Henriquez\u2019s letter compels reversal. It was dated over ten years after the attacks and did not identify Cruz\u2019s attackers. The letter\u2019s assertion that \u201caccording to [Cruz]\u201d the attacks were performed by \u201ca group of men who showed contempt because of his sexual preference\u201d does not compel a conclusion that Cruz was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">The BIA and IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence and thus Cruz is not entitled to withholding of removal. Because he has failed to show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be tortured upon his return to El Salvador, Cruz is also not entitled to CAT relief. <em>See D-Muhumed v. U.S Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004). Accordingly, we deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b993-13\">. The BIA and the IJ denied Cruz\u2019s claim for asylum because his application was untimely and he failed to satisfy the requirements for any exception to the one-year filing deadline. We lack jurisdiction to review those findings. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201d[S]ection 1158(a)(3) divests our Court of jurisdiction to review a decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
