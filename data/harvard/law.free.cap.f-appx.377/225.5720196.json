The District Court dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(b) for failure to state a claim and for seeking relief from defendants with immunity. Vasquez filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">Because Vasquez is proceeding in <em>forma pauperis </em>on this appeal, we must analyze his appeal for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), we must dismiss an appeal if the action (i) is frivolous or malicious, (ii) fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or (iii) seeks monetary damages from a defendant with immunity. An action or appeal can be frivolous for either legal or factual reasons. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-17\">In his complaint, Vasquez alleged that John Dwyer, his public defender, intentionally lost his trial file because Vasquez had filed a complaint against him. As noted by the District Court, public defenders are not state actors. <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981). Thus, Vasquez\u2019s allegations against appellee Dwyer fail to state a claim under \u00a7 1983. Moreover, according to a letter from Dwyer submitted by Vasquez in his habeas proceedings, Dwyer made substantial efforts to find Vasquez\u2019s criminal file.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-18\">Vasquez alleged that James Avigliano, the prosecutor, purposely lost or destroyed his file to prevent him from getting a copy of the arrest warrant. However, Vasquez has not pleaded any facts to support his conclusory allegation that Avigliano destroyed the file and did so willfully. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Moreover, Avigliano has prosecutorial immunity. <em>See Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 410, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-21\">Vasquez contended that Judge Clark of the Superior Court denied his post-conviction petition and ignored his motion to compel discovery. He alleged that she knew he had no files when she denied his PCR petition. Judge Clark is entitled to absolute immunity from suits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>for money damages. <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Vasquez also asserted that Dominic Palumbo, the Manager of the Criminal Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey, had an obligation to maintain his files and losing the file violated Vasquez\u2019s rights to due process. We agree with the District Court that Vasquez\u2019s allegations against appellee Palumbo fail to state a claim. <em>See County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 849, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998)(\u201c[L]iability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process.\u201d). Moreover, in a letter submitted by Vasquez in his habeas proceedings, Palumbo informed him that the Criminal Division does not maintain discovery such as an arrest warrant and affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Vasquez also requested release fi-om prison if his arrest warrant was not produced. This relief is not available in a civil rights action under \u00a7 1983 and must be sought via a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">For the above reasons, we will dismiss the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
