Ehrisman appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) denial of her application for disability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) and supplemental security income (\u201cSSI\u201d) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). On appeal, Ehrisman argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred at step four of the sequential evaluation process by failing to complete a Mental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment (\u201cMRFCA\u201d) and by failing to consider her mental and physical impairments in combination. Upon review of the record, and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-18\">\u201cIn Social Security appeals, we review <em>de novo </em>the legal principles upon which the [ALJ\u2019s] decision is based. However, we review the resulting decision only to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citations omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is less than a preponderance, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). We, therefore, will not \u201cdecid[e] the facts anew, mak[e] credibility determinations, or re-weigh[] the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-20\">An individual seeking disability benefits or supplemental security income must prove that she is disabled and unable to perform her past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The Social Security regulations outline a five-step, sequential evaluation process to determine whether a claimant is disabled. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted); <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4). The ALJ must evaluate whether: (1) the claimant engaged in substantial gainful employment; (2) the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) the severe impairment meets or equals an impairment in the Listing of Impairments; (4) the claimant has the Residual Func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>tional Capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform past relevant work; and (5) in light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience, there are other jobs the claimant can perform. 20 C.F.R \u00a7 \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4); <em>see Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.2004). If the ALJ determines that the claimant is not disabled at any step of the evaluation process, the inquiry ends. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">At step four of the sequential evaluation process, the ALJ assesses the claimant\u2019s RFC and ability to do past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv), 416.920(a)(4)(iv). \u201cThe [RFC] is an assessment, based upon all of the relevant evidence, of a claimant\u2019s remaining ability to do work despite [her] impairments.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). In evaluating a claimant\u2019s RFC, the ALJ considers the claimant\u2019s ability to \u201cmeet the physical, mental, sensory, and other requirements of work.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 404.1545(a)(4), 416.945(a)(4). The ALJ must consider all of a claimant\u2019s medically determinable impairments, even those not designated as severe. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1545(a)(2), 416.945(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">A <em>The MRFCA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">Ehrisman argues that the ALJ erred by not completing an MRFCA. This argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">In the ease of a \u201ccolorable claim of mental impairment, the social security regulations require the ALJ to complete a [Psychiatric Review Technique Form (\u201cPRTF\u201d) ] and append it to the decision, <em>or incorporate its mode of analysis into his findings and conclusions. </em>Failure to do so requires remand.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1214 (emphasis added); <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520a(e)(2), 416.920a(e)(2). Social Security regulations \u201crequire the ALJ to use the \u2018special technique\u2019 dictated by the PRTF for evaluating mental impairments.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1213 (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a(a)); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920a(a). \u201cThis technique requires separate evaluations on a four-point scale of how the claimant\u2019s mental impairment impacts four functional areas: \u2018activities of daily living; social functioning; concentration, persistence, or pace; and episodes of decompen-sation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1213 (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a(c)(3-4)); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920a(c)(3-4). \u201cThe ALJ is required to incorporate the results of this technique into the findings and conclusions.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1213-14 (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a(e)(2)); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920a(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">The record shows that while considering Ehrisman\u2019s depression, the ALJ properly employed the four PRTF functional limitation categories and rendered a finding about the degree of limitation as to each category. R2 at 19; <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520a(b) and (e), 416.920a(b) and (c). In evaluating her mental limitations, the ALJ concluded that Ehrisman had \u201cmild restriction of activities of daily living; mild difficulties in maintaining social functioning; moderate difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence or pace; and no episodes of decompensation.\u201d R2 at 19. Ehrisman has cited no controlling authority holding that, in addition to performing a PRTF analysis, the ALJ must complete a separate MRFCA form or undertake a separate MRFCA analysis. The ALJ\u2019s decision indicates that he appropriately incorporated the PRTF mode of analysis into his findings and conclusions, as required by the Social Security regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>tions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">\n<em>B. The Combination of Impairments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ax4B\">Ehrisman also asserts that the ALJ failed to consider her impairments in combination. This argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">\u201cWhen a claimant has alleged a multitude of impairments, a claim for social security benefits may lie even though none of the impairments, considered individually, is disabling.\u201d <em>Walker v. Bowen, </em>826 F.2d 996, 1001 (11th Cir.1987) (per curiam) (citation and quotation omitted). The ALJ must \u201cmake specific and well-articulated findings as to the effect of the combination of impairments and ... decide whether the combined impairments cause the claimant to be disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation omitted); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1523, 416.923.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">The record demonstrates that the ALJ considered all of Ehrisman\u2019s impairments in combination prior to determining her RFC. R2 at 19-20. In making a credibility determination, the ALJ accounted for both her depression and degenerative disc disease. <em>Id. </em>He then compared Ehris-man\u2019s RFC with the \u201cphysical and mental\u201d demands of her past work and concluded that \u201ceven with nonexertional limitations due to her depression,\u201d she was capable of performing \u201cpast work as a maid or counter clerk as she actually performed it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 21-22. Although the ALJ did not specifically include the findings as to Ehrisman\u2019s mental limitations in the statement of her RFC, any error to this extent is harmless since the ALJ\u2019s decision indicated that its conclusions were based on consideration of both her physical and mental impairments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 19-21; <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1545(b),(c), 416.945(b),(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">Additionally, to the extent Ehrisman argues that the ALJ failed to develop the requirements of her past relevant work, she has shown no error because the ALJ properly consulted the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles. </em>R2 at 21; <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1560(b)(2), 416.960(b)(2). Accordingly, we find that the ALJ did not err at step four of the sequential analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">\n<em>C. Testimony from a Vocational Expert</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">In the alternative, Ehrisman argues that the ALJ committed reversible error at step five by not taking testimony from a vocational expert. Ehrisman, however, offers no discussion of this point other than a conclusory statement with no supporting legal authority, and so the argument is waived. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that a party waives an issue where she fails to offer argument on it in her appellate brief). Furthermore, because the ALJ found Eh-risman not disabled at step four of the sequential evaluation process, we need not address this issue at step five.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">Because the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, and Ehris-man has not shown reversible error in the ALJ\u2019s determination that she was not dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>abled at step four of the sequential evaluation process, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-7\">. <em>See Maier v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>154 F.3d 913, 915 (9th Cir.1998) (holding that the ALJ did not err by failing to append a MRFCA form because the form does not encompass any of the criteria involved in steps one through four).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-8\">. The ALJ's decision states that none of the Ehrisman's treating physicians opined that her impairments precluded her from the performance of work activity at any exertional level. R2 at 20. Furthermore, the ALJ indicated that Ehrisman reported no history of mental illness or treatment for mental or emotional difficulties. Ehrisman also claimed that she did not think she was depressed, but was upset only because of what was happening to her due to the accident. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
