He also seeks review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider the order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-26\">Marquez-Morales was born in Mexico to his mother, Josefina Morales Andazola, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Mexican citizen. No father was identified on his birth certificate. In 1994, an Oklahoma state court awarded his father, Jesus Jose Marquez, permanent and exclusive custody of Marquez-Morales. Marquez was naturalized in March, 1998. In June 2008, the Department of Homeland Security charged Marquez-Morales as subject to removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii). The charges alleged that Marquez-Morales had been previously removed from the United States under an outstanding removal order in December 2003, and that he had been convicted in 2005 of the offense of reentry of a deported alien previously convicted of an aggravated felony. DHS also charged him as subject to removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) as an alien present in the United States without being lawfully admitted or paroled, or who arrived in the United States at a time or place other than that designated by the United States Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Before the IJ, Marquez-Morales denied both charges on the grounds that he was entitled to derivative citizenship under former section 321(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a)(3) (repealed 2000), which provided citizenship for a child born outside the United States through, <em>inter alia, </em>the naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child when there had been a legal separation of the parents, or the naturalization of the mother if the child was born out of wedlock and the paternity was not established by legitimation. The IJ determined that he did not meet the statutory requirements of section 321(a)(3) and rejected his alternative argument that former section 321(a)(3) was unconstitutional. The BIA affirmed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">On appeal, Marquez-Morales argues that he is entitled to derivative citizenship because the Oklahoma court\u2019s custody order should be considered a \u201clegal separation\u201d for the purposes of former section 321(a)(3) even though his parents were never married. Alternatively, he argues that former section 321(a)(3) was unconstitutional because it establishes \u201ctwo different standards for men and women\u201d because an unmarried mother can confer derivative citizenship on her child but an unmarried father cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">This court has limited jurisdiction to consider challenges to removal orders based on the commission of an aggravated felony. The REAL ID Act amended 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) to preclude judicial review of any removal order based, inter alia, on an alien\u2019s commission of an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 518-19 (5th Cir.2006). The Act provides, however, that none of its provisions \u201cshall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We may review Marquez-Morales\u2019s \u201cclaim to be a national of the United States, and decide such claim if, as here, the pleadings and affidavits reflect that no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner\u2019s nationality is presented.\u201d <em>Marquez-Marquez v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 548, 554 (5th Cir.2006) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)). As the claim presents a question of law, our review is <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">We first consider Marquez-Morales\u2019s argument that he is entitled to derivative citizenship under former section 321(a)(3). Because Marquez-Morales was not born in the United States, naturalization is his \u201csole source for a claim of citizenship.\u201d <em>Marquez-Marquez, </em>455 F.3d at 554. He bears the burden of proving that he qualifies for naturalization, and this court re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>solves all doubts on the matter in favor of the United States. <em>See id. </em>Because he turned eighteen in 1997, the provisions of former section 321(a) apply to his claim. Those provisions were repealed by the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Pub.L. No. 106-395,114 Stat. 1631 (2000), but as Marquez-Morales acknowledges, the Child Citizenship Act is not retroactive. Thus, his claim is governed by Section 321(a). <em>See Nehme v. INS, </em>252 F.3d 415, 430-32 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Former section 321(a) of he Immigration and Nationality Act provided that \u201ca child born outside the United States of alien parents ... becomes a citizen of the United States\u201d upon \u201cthe naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child <em>when there has been a legal separation of the parents; </em>and if ... such naturalization takes place while such child is under the age of 18 years; and ... such child is residing in the United States pursuant to lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of the naturalization of the parent.\u201d Marquez-Morales claims that, despite the fact that his parents never married and thus could not be legally separated, he is entitled to citizenship because his father obtained \u201clegal custody\u201d of him when he was under age eighteen. He contends that he is not required to demonstrate that his parents were legally separated because Congress\u2019s intent in drafting Section 321(a) was the protection of parental rights by ensuring that only those alien children \u201cwhose real interest^]\u2019 were located in America with their custodial parent\u201d would be automatically naturalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Marquez-Morales\u2019s argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Nehme, </em>which held that a child born overseas to alien parents was not entitled to naturalization when his father was naturalized but his parents never obtained a \u201clegal separation\u201d or divorce under Pennsylvania law. 252 F.3d at 418-20. We also clarified that \u201clegal separation\u201d meant a <em>\u201cjudicial </em>separation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 426, but he has presented no evidence that his parents were ever married or judicially separated. Other circuits have likewise concluded that former section 321(a)(3) requires a legal separation of married parents before a single parent can confer automatic citizenship on an alien child. See <em>Barthelemy v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 1062, 1065, 1067-68 (9th Cir.2003) (finding that because alien\u2019s parents never married and thus could not legally separate, the alien could not establish citizenship under former section 321(a)(3)); <em>Wedderburn v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 795, 799-800 (7th Cir.2000) (concluding that BIA acted within its authority in construing \u201clegal separation\u201d to mean an alteration in marital status). Accordingly, we find his claim to be without merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">We also reject Marquez-Morales\u2019s argument that former section 321(a)(3) violates the Equal Protection Clause by establishing \u201ctwo different standards for men and women.\u201d This court has recognized that \u201c[a]n alien has no constitutional right to citizenship which is a privilege conferred as a matter of grace by Congress under Article I, Section 8 of the United States constitution relative to the power of Congress \u2018to establish a uniform rule of Naturalization.\u2019 \u201d <em>Villanueva-Jurado v. INS, </em>482 F.2d 886, 887 (5th Cir.1973) (citing <em>Rogers v. Bellei, </em>401 U.S. 815, 840, 91 S.Ct. 1060, 28 L.Ed.2d 499 (1971)). Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>has a \u201ccompletely free hand in defining citizenship as it relates to persons born abroad.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Challenges to INA classifications are typically subject to rational basis review, <em>De Fuentes v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 498, 503 (5th Cir.2006), but gender based classifications receive review under a heightened standard. In <em>Nguyen v. INS, </em>533 U.S. 53, 121 S.Ct. 2053, 150 L.Ed.2d 115 (2001), the Supreme Court stated that gender-based classifications in the INA must serve \u201cimportant governmental objectives ... and the discriminatory means employed\u201d must be \u201csubstantially related to the achievements of these objectives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60-61, 121 S.Ct. 2053 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">We find that <em>Nguyen\u2019s </em>heightened scrutiny is not triggered here where Marquez-Morales has not argued a true \u201cgender-based\u201d classification. Marquez-Morales bases his equal protection claim on language from former section 321(a)(3), which provides that an alien child born outside the United States becomes a citizen when, among other factors, \u201cthe naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents <em>or the naturalization of the mother if the child was born out of wedlock and the paternity of the child has not been established by legitimation.\u201d </em>\u00a7 321(a)(3) (emphasis added). He argues that gender-discrimination is present because \u201conly the [unmarried] mother\u2019s naturalization\u201d could confer derivative citizenship, whereas his father\u2019s naturalization could not confer the same. This argument misses the mark. Marquez-Morales\u2019s father established paternity, so the provision regarding mothers of children born out of wedlock where paternity is not established is inapplicable. Thus, his mother was similarly powerless to confer citizenship upon him through her naturalization alone. As such, where mothers and fathers of children whose paternity is established are treated similarly, Marquez-Morales\u2019s claim does not implicate equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Moreover, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that he had shown a gender-based classification, we would nevertheless conclude that former section 321(a)(3) is not unconstitutional. In <em>Nguyen, </em>the Supreme Court rejected a constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409(a), which prescribe how persons born abroad to one United States-citizen parent and one non-citizen parent acquired citizenship for the child when the parents were not married. 533 U.S. at 62-70, 121 S.Ct. 2053. Although the statute imposed requirements on the children of a citizen father which were not imposed when the citizen parent was the mother, the court found that the gender-based classification met heightened scrutiny as the distinction was substantially related to serving the important governmental interests of \u201cassuring that a biological parent-child relationship exists\u201d and \u201censuring that the child and the citizen parent have some demonstrated opportunity or potential to develop\u201d more than a mere legally-recognized relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 62, 121 S.Ct. 2053. As there, we find that Congress is entitled to prescribe rales for citizenship that reflect differences in the way unmarried parents establish a biological tie to the alien child.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Finally, we note that two other circuits have rejected similar challenges to former section 321(a)(3). In <em>Barthelemy, </em>the Ninth Circuit assumed without deciding that section 321(a)(3) entitled the alien to \u201cthe higher standard of scrutiny,\u201d but held that the alien\u2019s equal protection claim failed where he admitted his father had legitimated him. 329 F.3d at 1066-68. In <em>Wedderbmn, </em>the Seventh Circuit concluded that section 321(a)(3)\u2019s classification was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>not a sex-based classification at all, but rather a classification based on whether or not the child had been legitimated. 215 F.3d at 801-02. Accordingly, we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-6\">. We also note that Marquez-Morales has not pursued his arguments made before the BIA that his parents' relationship constituted a \"common law\" marriage under Oklahoma law or that he qualified for derivative citizenship under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409. These arguments are therefore waived. <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v. Amway Corp., </em>376 F.3d 496, 499 n. 1 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
