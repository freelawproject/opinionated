Martin was sentenced to life imprisonment. The district court denied Martin\u2019s request for DNA testing. The district court denied Martin\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pau-peris (IFP) on appeal and certified that his appeal was not taken in good faith. Martin now moves to proceed IFP in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-25\">A prisoner who contests the district court\u2019s certification decision must direct his IFP motion solely to the district court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Cir.1997). This court may authorize Martin to proceed IFP on appeal if the appeal presents a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1); <em>Holmes v. Hardy, </em>852 F.2d 151, 153 (5th Cir.1988). The inquiry into Martin\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Section 3600 of Title 18 provides individuals under a federal sentence of imprisonment with an opportunity to move for post-conviction DNA testing. The court that entered the defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction is to order DNA testing of specified evidence if 10 prerequisites are met. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3600(a)(1) \u2014 (10). Most relevant to this appeal, the applicant is required to identify a theory of defense that would establish his \u201cactual innocence,\u201d and the applicant must show that \u201c[t]he proposed DNA testing of the specific evidence may produce new material evidence that would ... raise a reasonable probability that the applicant did not commit the offense.\u201d \u00a7 3600(a)(6), (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Whether DNA testing would produce a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that Martin did not commit the robberies, as required under \u00a7 3600(a)(8), is a question of law that is reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Fasano, </em>577 F.3d 572, 575 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s \u201cunderlying fact findings are reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">As the district court determined, the evidence of Martin\u2019s guilt is overwhelming and includes testimony from Martin\u2019s co-defendants regarding Martin\u2019s participation in the robberies, as well as letters written by Martin that amount to a confession. Martin makes no attempt to explain how DNA testing would raise a reasonable probability that he did not commit the bank robbery offenses, so as to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 3600(a)(8). Martin has not demonstrated that he has a nonfrivo-lous issue for appeal, and the record shows that he has no grounds for obtaining DNA testing. Accordingly, Martin\u2019s IFP motion is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>see Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
