Yale brought a products liability action against Stapleton Corporation, the step ladder\u2019s manufacturer, seeking to recover under theories of strict liability, negligence, and negligent failure to warn. After a two-day jury trial, the jury returned a verdict in Stapleton\u2019s favor on all three claims. The district court entered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>and denied Yale\u2019s motion for a new trial. This is Yale\u2019s appeal. She contends that the district court erred by discussing worker\u2019s compensation during voir dire and by refusing to give a proposed jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">During voir dire the district court asked, \u201cHave any of you or an immediate family member been either a plaintiff, meaning you filed a lawsuit, or a defendant, meaning a lawsuit was filed against you, in a civil case?\u201d A prospective juror responded that her husband had filed a worker\u2019s compensation case against his employer. After more questioning, the court asked the juror whether her husband had filed a civil lawsuit against his employer or a worker\u2019s compensation claim. When the juror responded that she \u201cthought that was the same thing,\u201d the court explained: \u201cNo. In worker\u2019s compensation, you should understand, in worker\u2019s compensation, if you are employed and you work for someone and you were injured on the job, you are automatically covered through that employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance for your injuries. There is no issue of fault involved.\u201d The court distinguished Yale\u2019s lawsuit stating: \u201cIn this case, Ms. Yale is suing \u2014 not the employer, she was working for Bass. She was an employee of Bass Pro Shop, but she is suing Stapleton Corporation, the manufacturer of the step stool in this case. This is not an issue of worker\u2019s compensation in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Yale contends that the court\u2019s statement that employees are \u201cautomatically covered\u201d by them employers\u2019 worker\u2019s compensation insurance informed the jury that she had been paid worker\u2019s compensation benefits for her injuries in violation of Florida\u2019s collateral source rule. <em>See Sheffield v. Superior Ins. Co., </em>800 So.2d 197, 200 (Fla.2001) (\u201cUpon proper objection, the collateral source rule prohibits the introduction of any evidence of payments from collateral sources.\u201d). We disagree. The court explained to the prospective juror how the worker\u2019s compensation system differs from traditional civil litigation. The court never suggested that Yale had filed a worker\u2019s compensation claim or received worker\u2019s compensation benefits. <em>Cf. Sosa v. Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Inc., </em>435 So.2d 821, 826 (Fla. 1983) (reversible error to allow defense counsel during closing arguments to inform the jury that the plaintiff had received worker\u2019s compensation benefits); <em>Kreitz v. Thomas, </em>422 So.2d 1051, 1052 (Fla. 4th DCA 1982) (concluding that trial court committed reversible error by admitting into evidence statements establishing that the plaintiff had received worker\u2019s compensation benefits); <em>Grossman v. Beard, </em>410 So.2d 175, 176-77 (Fla. 2d DCA 1982) (reversible error to admit evidence that plaintiff\u2019s medical and hospital bills were paid by workers\u2019 compensation); <em>Clark v. Tampa Elec. Co., </em>416 So.2d 475, 477 (Fla. 2d DCA 1982) (reversible error to admit evidence of plaintiffs income before and after accident; error could not be cured by giving collateral source rule instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">We find <em>John Deere Company v. Thomas, 522 </em>So.2d 926 (Fla. 2d DCA 1988), to be persuasive. In <em>John Deere, </em>the defendant\u2019s counsel asked prospective jurors during voir dire whether they had \u201cever been injured on the job and brought a worker\u2019s compensation claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 926-27. The plaintiff immediately moved for a mistrial, but the court denied the plaintiffs request. <em>Id. </em>at 927. After the jury returned a verdict for the defendant, the court granted the plaintiffs motion for a new trial concluding that defense counsel\u2019s remark \u201clikely influenced the jury against the [pjlaintiff at the very start of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Second District Court of Appeal disagreed observing that nothing about the defense counsel\u2019s remark suggested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>the plaintiff had filed a worker\u2019s compensation claim or received worker\u2019s compensation benefits. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[T]he trial court ascribed a higher degree of impact or effect to the question than can reasonably be said to have occurred.\u201d). The court also noted that the remark was an isolated event \u201coccurfing] at the very onset of the trial proceedings and not at a point proximate to the jury\u2019s deliberation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court determined that any prejudicial effect was remedied by the five day delay between the voir dire and the jury\u2019s deliberation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">As in <em>John Deere, </em>nothing in the court\u2019s exchange with the prospective juror in this case suggested that the plaintiff had filed a worker\u2019s compensation claim or received worker\u2019s compensation benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The reference to worker\u2019s compensation was an isolated event occurring long before the jury deliberated. <em>Cf. Tampa Sands and Material Co., Inc. v. Johnson, </em>103 So.2d 250, 253 (Fla. 2d DCA 1958) (finding reversible error where trial court responded to juror\u2019s question about worker\u2019s compensation during the jury charge). It was meant merely to determine whether the prospective juror could remain impartial in light of her husband\u2019s experience. We conclude that no error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Yale also contends that the district court erred by failing to give a proposed jury instruction on worker\u2019s compensation \u2014 which she characterizes as \u201ccurative.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s refusal to give a requested jury instruction for abuse of discretion, and \u201c[w]e reverse when we are left with a substantial and ineradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>590 F.3d 1238, 1247 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). Yale proposed a two-paragraph instruction. The first paragraph informed the jury that \u201ceven if someone is injured while working on the job, they have a legal right to bring a claim against any party they feel is responsible for those injuries.\u201d The second paragraph explained to the jury that Yale would have to repay the worker\u2019s compensation benefits that she had received if the jury awarded her damages. The district court\u2019s refusal to give the proposed jury instruction was not an abuse of discretion. As the court correctly pointed out, worker\u2019s compensation was not an issue in Yale\u2019s trial. The instruction would have interjected an extraneous matter into the proceeding clouding the actual issues and confusing the jury. Accordingly, we affirm the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\">. At an earlier stage of the proceedings, the plaintiff's counsel seemed to agree with that conclusion. During a discussion about a proposed jury instruction, the plaintiff's counsel and the district court had the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-9\">Plaintiff's Counsel: [T]he jury is aware that [Yale] did get worker's compensation benefits ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-10\">Court: How is the jury aware? Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: They were told in jury selection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-12\">Court: No, they weren\u2019t told in jury selection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAf3\">Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: I may be mis remembering\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar1\">Court: I think what happened, if I recall, is one of the panel members who was on the jury ... discussed prior claims that her husband had brought that were worker's compensation claims, and I drew the distinction for the panel in respect to those, but there\u2019s been no evidence that she filed for workers\u2019 compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A04\">Plaintiff's Counsel: I agree with that, Your Honor. I\u2019m not accusing the Court or anyone of anything. ...</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
