Carreon argues that his sentence of 60 months of imprisonment, an upward variance three months greater than the top end of his guidelines sentence range, was unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to effectuate the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Carreon acknowledges that the district court considered proper sentencing factors in fashioning his sentence, but he asserts that the district court improperly failed to consider his likely need for rehabilitation. He maintains that his history of sexual misconduct reflected a mental or emotional issue and that the sentence was unreasonable because it did not require diagnosis or treatment for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">At sentencing, the district court explained that it based the sentence upon the \u00a7 3553(a) factors of the nature and circumstances of the offense, Carreon\u2019s personal history and characteristics, and the need to protect the public. It noted Carreon\u2019s long criminal history, the lewd nature of Carreon\u2019s previous offenses, and that Car-reon had many prior convictions that did not result in additional criminal history points. While Carreon argues that the district court failed to take into consideration his need for mental or emotional treatment, Carreon averred at rearraignment that he did not have mental problems that would interfere with his understanding of the proceedings, and nothing in the record indicates that a lesser sentence would have allowed Carreon to receive mental or emotional treatment that he would not receive while incarcerated. Given the small extent of the variance, Car-reon\u2019s criminal history and propensity to commit crimes of a sexual nature, and the deference given to district court determinations regarding \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Car-reon has not shown that the sentence constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v.
