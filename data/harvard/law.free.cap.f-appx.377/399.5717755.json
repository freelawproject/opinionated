Lewis\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 of the Sentencing Guidelines. In denying the motion, the district court reasoned that Lewis had received two prior substantial sentence reductions, pursuant to motions under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and Fed.R.Crim.P. 35; his sentence was already 57 months less than the bottom of his recalculated guidelines range; and no further reduction in his sentence was warranted. Lewis argues that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-17\">Lewis\u2019s appeal is not barred by the waiver in his plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 296-97 (5th Cir.2009) (holding that an identical waiver did not bar an appeal). A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939). The district court was permitted but not required to grant a reduction in Lewis\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B); <em>Cooley, </em>590 F.3d at 297. The record reflects that the district court was aware of its authority to grant a reduction to Lewis\u2019s sentence, was presented with Lewis\u2019s arguments in favor of a reduction, and had before it documents allowing for consideration of the factors relevant to the decision whether to grant a reduction. We discern no abuse of discretion by the district court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>See Cooley, </em>590 F.3d at 297-98; <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73; <em>United States v.
