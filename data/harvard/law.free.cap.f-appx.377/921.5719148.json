Dale alleges unlawful search and seizure, false arrest and unlawful detainment by the officers for a period of three hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-20\">Based upon a series of discovery-related problems and chronic noncompliance by Dale, the report and recommendation prepared by the magistrate judge was that Dale\u2019s amended complaint be dismissed with prejudice. This report was adopted in full by the district court, based upon Dale\u2019s unreasonable, defiant conduct, consisting of repeated violations of the Federal Rules and multiple court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-21\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record in this case, the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, the district court order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s order, the briefs and the arguments of counsel. Finding no error, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
