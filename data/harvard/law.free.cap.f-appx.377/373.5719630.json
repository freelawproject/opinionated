Bradley claims that the evidence at trial was legally insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict that he was guilty of robbery. Specifically, he asserts that no evidence in the record supports a finding that he \u201cintentionally or knowingly threaten[ed] or place[d] another in fear of imminent bodily injury or death.\u201d <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 29.02(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">We have reviewed the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and hold that Bradley failed to meet his burden of establishing that the state court\u2019s adjudication of his claims resulted in a decision that was contrary to federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 402-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 324-25, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>Wilmeth v. State, </em>808 S.W.2d 703, 705-06 (Tex.1991). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
