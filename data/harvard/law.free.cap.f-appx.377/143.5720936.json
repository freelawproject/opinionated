He is serving a sentence of life without parole, imposed when he was a juvenile. Planning to challenge the constitutionality of that sentence, Mitchell sought assistance from a prison paralegal, Appellee Debra Wydra, to prepare a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Wydra refused to assist Mitchell because he did not meet the criteria outlined in the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections\u2019 legal assistance policy. Mitchell filed a grievance based on Wydra\u2019s refusal to assist, and it was denied by a grievance officer, Appellee Kandis Dascani. Mitchell\u2019s administrative appeals were denied as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">Mitchell filed the instant civil rights action in August 2008. Therein, Mitchell claimed that the actions of Wydra and Dascani denied Mitchell his constitutional right of access to the courts. Appellees Wydra and Dascani filed a motion to dismiss Mitchell\u2019s complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The District Court determined that it would be futile to give Mitchell leave to amend his complaint, and it granted Appellees\u2019 motion. Mitchell appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">Accepting the facts alleged in Mitchell\u2019s complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor, see <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam), Mitchell\u2019s complaint nonetheless fails to state a viable access to courts claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">\u201cAlthough a specific method of access is not mandated, prison practices or regulations are invalid if they can be construed as imposing barriers to such access.\u201d <em>Valentine v. Beyer, </em>850 F.2d 951, 955 (3d Cir.1988). Prisoners have a right of access to the courts, not to a law library or to legal assistance. <em>See Para-Professional Law Clinic at SCI-Graterford v. Beard, </em>334 F.3d 301, 305 (3d Cir.2003) (citing <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 350, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996)). Nevertheless, prisoners must be afforded the availability of either \u201cadequate law libraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the law,\u201d <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 828, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977), in order to exercise their right of court access. \u201cPrison authorities need not provide both of these, but must provide one or the other....\u201d <em>DeMallory v. Cullen, </em>855 F.2d 442, 446 (7th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Here, according to Mitchell\u2019s own complaint, SCI-Coal has both a legal assistance program <em>and </em>a law library. Mitchell does not allege that the law library is inadequate in any way, or that he is unable to access its materials. Thus, Mitchell\u2019s access to courts claim plainly fails under <em>Bounds. </em>To the extent, though, that we can infer from Mitchell\u2019s complaint an allegation that his placement in restricted housing has impeded his access to legal materials in the law library,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mitchell\u2019s claim fares no better; Mitchell\u2019s allegations do not even suggest that Appellees\u2019 conduct caused him actual injury, a requirement of a claim asserting a violation of the right of court access. <em>See Lewis, </em>518 U.S. at 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">More specifically, Mitchell does not allege that the \u201cshortcomings in the ... legal assistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim,\u201d <em>id., </em>nor can we reasonably infer that conclusion. To the contrary, by Mitchell\u2019s own admission he has filed multiple applications for state post-conviction relief in the Pennsylvania state courts. In addition, Mitchell has filed several (sixteen, by his count) civil suits pro se. <em>See Wilson v. Prasse, </em>404 F.2d 1380, 1381 (3d Cir.1968) (per curiam) (\u201cthe many civil actions instituted by appellant in the federal and state courts supported the conclusion of the District Court that the contention that appellant had been denied access to the court was frivolous.\u201d). Mitchell\u2019s allegations thus demonstrate the absence of any prejudice (i.e., actual injury) from Wydra\u2019s failure to help Mitchell draft his habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Accordingly, because this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-10\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and our review is plenary. <em>See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, </em>515 F.3d 224, 230 (3d Cir.2008). Having granted Mitchell leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we must dismiss his appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it has no arguable basis in law. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Alternatively, we may summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order if Mitchell\u2019s appeal fails to present a substantial question. <em>See </em>LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\">. <em>\u201cA </em>prisoner\u2019s constitutional right of access to the courts is undiminished when that prisoner is held in a segregated unit.\u201d <em>Peterkin v. Jeffes, </em>855 F.2d 1021, 1038 (3d Cir.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\">. In an abundance of caution, the District Court appears to have gleaned an additional claim from Mitchell\u2019s complaint: a constitutional challenge to Mitchell\u2019s life sentence. We see no indication from either Mitchell\u2019s complaint or his subsequent briefs and motions filed below that Mitchell intended to raise such a claim in this civil action. Instead, the constitutional attack is the intended subject of Mitchell\u2019s prospective federal habe-as petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
