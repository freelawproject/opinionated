Derrow sought a reduction in his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the crack cocaine Guidelines. The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance or, alternatively, for an extension of time to file a brief on the merits. Derrow has moved to respond to the Government\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">Although the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence ordinarily is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, a court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Contrary to Derrow\u2019s argument that the district court failed to provide reasons for its denial, the sentencing court is not required to provide reasons for its denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (09-8939). The district court did not provide reasons for its denial, but the order was entered after the Government filed its response arguing that Derrow\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>guidelines range was not altered by the amendments. Because the district court\u2019s denial of Derrow\u2019s motion was presumably based on a determination that Derrow\u2019s sentence remained the same under the amended Guidelines, review is de novo. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582 are thus governed by the policy statements of the Guidelines. <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Under the amended Guidelines, Derrow\u2019s offense level was altered, but his guidelines range remained the same. Thus, a reduction was not permitted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Derrow\u2019s arguments regarding the applicability of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), are unavailing because those concerns \u201cdo not apply in an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. Although the Guidelines must be treated as advisory in an original sentencing proceeding, <em>Booker </em>does not prevent Congress from incorporating a guideline provision \u201cas a means of defining and limiting a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The district court did not err in denying Derrow\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and its motion for an extension of time is DENIED. Derrow\u2019s motion to file a response to the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
