Although the district court denied the Rule 60(b)(6) motion for relief, it nevertheless granted Jef-fus a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-13\">Whether Petitioner was entitled to equitable tolling in his second federal habeas petition for the time his first federal habeas petition was pending before the district court and, if so, whether he is entitled to relief from judgment, the reopening of his case, and federal habeas review pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-14\">On appeal, Jeffus argues that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his initial \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, after the one-year limitations period for filing a federal habeas petition had expired, because he was procedurally barred from raising his unexhausted claims in state court and was not expressly offered the option of amending his initial petition to proceed solely on the exhausted claims. Given the alleged error, Jeffus maintains that he was entitled to equitable tolling of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to his second \u00a7 2254 federal habe-as petition, which was dismissed with prejudice as untimely. Jeffus further argues that reopening federal habeas proceedings would not be futile because his underlying constitutional claim is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-16\">The denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Jackson v. Crosby, </em>437 F.3d 1290, 1295 (11th Cir.2006). An appeal of a grant or denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is narrow in scope, addressing only the propriety of the denial or grant of relief, and not issues regarding the underlying judgment. <em>Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Florida v. Nw. Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>198 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir.1999). When reviewing for an abuse of discretion, we must affirm unless the district court applied an incorrect legal standard or made findings of fact that were clearly erroneous. <em>See Mincey v. Head, </em>206 F.3d 1106, 1137 n. 69 (11th Cir.2000) (addressing the denial of a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e)). In addition, in an appeal brought by an unsuccessful habeas petitioner, appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see Jackson, </em>437 F.3d at 1294 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a COA is required to appeal the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion from a judgment in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-17\">Pursuant to Rule 60(b), a party may seek relief from a civil judgment based on a number of specified reasons, including excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, and misconduct. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>60(b). Under Rule 60(b)(6), the catchall provision of Rule 60(b), a party may also seek relief based on \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). To qualify for relief under this catchall provision, the moving party must \u201cdemonstrate that the circumstances are sufficiently extraordinary to warrant relief. Even then, whether to grant relief is a matter for the district court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>Cano v. Baker, </em>485 F.3d 1387, 1342 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). To reverse the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion, it is not enough that a grant of the motion might have been permissible or warranted; rather, the appellant must demonstrate that the district court was required to grant relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">To the extent that the district court\u2019s ruling concerned the dismissal of Jeffus\u2019s initial \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6). Given that Jeffus\u2019s attempts to challenge the merits of the underlying judgment wei*e consistently denied for over a decade, we cannot conclude that the district court committed a clear error in judgment in denying the instant Rule 60(b) motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To the extent that the ruling pertained to the dismissal of Jeffus\u2019s second \u00a7 2254 ha-beas petition as untimely, which constituted a distinct case, the issue is not properly before us in the present appeal. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b987-8\">. We cannot conclude that Jeffus has demon- . strated extraordinary circumstances to warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6), especially in light of his extended delay and lack of diligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b987-24\">.
