Mobley\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. On appeal, Mobley argues that the district court: (1) erred by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on his post-sentencing conduct; (2) violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by considering such conduct, (3) violated his constitutional double jeopardy rights; and (4) erred by considering his prison disciplinary reports without allowing him an opportunity to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-20\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). An abuse of discretion occurs if a district court \u201cfails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making [its] determination.\u201d <em>Birmingham Steel Corp. v. TVA, </em>353 F.3d 1331, 1335 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-21\">In <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2010), we held that \u201ceach party must be given notice of and an opportunity to contest new information relied on by the district court in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d In that case, the district court relied on a memorandum from the Probation Office containing information on Jules\u2019s prison conduct in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1241. In this case, the district court relied on Mobley\u2019s prison conduct record in denying Mobley\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion; however, the record does not demonstrate that Mobley was given notice or an opportunity to contest the information contained within that record. Thus, the district court abused its discretion by not affording Mobley this opportunity. On remand, Mobley must be given an opportunity to contest the information contained in his prison conduct record. The district court is not required to grant Mobley a hearing to contest this information; allowing him to contest it in writing is sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 1244-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-22\">We reject Mobley\u2019s additional allegations of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-23\">AFFIRMED, in part; VACATED, in part; AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
