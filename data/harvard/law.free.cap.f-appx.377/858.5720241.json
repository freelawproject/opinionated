On appeal, he contends that his testimony established that: (1) he suffered past persecution in Colombia on account of imputed political opinion; and (2) he had a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"AdEn\">When the BIA issues a separate decision, we review only that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that [the BIA] expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">We review a factual determination by the BIA that an alien is statutorily ineligible for asylum under the substantial evidence test. <em>Id. </em>at 1283. Under that highly deferential test, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284 (quotation omitted). Moreover, we review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision, and will not overturn factual findings unless the record compels it. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-14\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. In order to meet this burden, the applicant, with specific and credible evidence, must establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground, or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cIn addition to providing an independent avenue for asylum eligibility, a showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1007 (11th Cir.2008); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-17\">In determining whether the applicant has suffered past persecution, the BIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>must consider the cumulative impact of the alleged incidents of persecution. <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861 (11th Cir.2007). While the INA does not define \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have indicated that it is an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). In other words, \u201cmere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Even if the applicant fails to demonstrate past persecution, that applicant may still establish asylum based upon proof of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1007; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2). It is enough that the applicant shows a reasonable possibility of future persecution, as long as that applicant also shows that the fear is both \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1256; <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1007. \u201cThe subjective component is generally satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution.\u201d <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1007 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe objective prong can be fulfilled by establishing that the applicant has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The applicant must also establish a nexus between a statutorily protected ground and the feared persecution, by presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution\u201d on account of a protected ground. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotation omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">To qualify for withholding of removal, the applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that the applicant\u2019s \u201clife or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A)). When the applicant fails to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, that applicant \u201cnecessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Based on a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we hold that substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s determination that Bernal-Gacha did not suffer past persecution. The incidents Bernal-Gacha endured, taken cumulatively, simply did not rise to the level of persecutory acts that we have held compels a reversal of the agency\u2019s decision. Substantial evidence also supported the BIA\u2019s determination that Bernal-Gaeha\u2019s fear of future persecution was objectively unreasonable, and, therefore, not well-founded. Bernal-Gacha\u2019s family has remained in Colombia, unharmed, despite the FARC\u2019s knowledge of their presence, and he did not suffer receive any threats when he relocated to Medellin. Additionally, he has been absent from Colombia for more than four years. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 (reasoning applicant\u2019s notoriety as student activist would not outlast four year absence). As a result, we deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
