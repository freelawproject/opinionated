Nunez, a firefighter for Defendant-Appellee City of Texas City, Texas before he was fired by the Fire Chief effective October 15, 2001, appeals the district court\u2019s Final Judgment of September 3, 2009, granting summary judgment of dismissal with prejudice of Nunez\u2019s claim that his firing was grounded in racial discrimination. Having reviewed the record on appeal in light of the applicable law presented by the parties in their appellate briefs as applied to the relevant facts, we conclude that the district court properly granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment, dismissing Nunez\u2019s action, for the reasons exhaustively and correctly set forth in that court\u2019s Memorandum and Order signed on September 3, 2009. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
