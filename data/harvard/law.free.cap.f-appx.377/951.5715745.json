Torres Hernandez\u2019s brief, however, challenges the BIA\u2019s February 24, 2009 decision dismissing her appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision denying her claims for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Torres Hernandez\u2019s brief fails to present any arguments about the BIA\u2019s September decision denying her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-14\">\u201cWe review de novo our subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007). A petition for review challenging an order of removal must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The 30-day time period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d and is not subject to equitable tolling. <em>Dakane v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, filing a motion to reconsider will not stop the 30-day time-to-appeal clock from running. <em>See Stone v. I.N.S., </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (\u201c[A] deportation order is final, and reviewable, when issued. Its finality is not affected by the subsequent filing of a motion to reconsider.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-15\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Torres Hernandez\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s February 2009 decision dismissing her appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>The petition for review was not filed until October 2009, which was long past the 30-day deadline, and the filing of the motion for reconsider did not stop that deadline from passing. We must dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">As for Torres Hernandez\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision denying her motion to reconsider, her initial brief presented no arguments at all on the subject. \u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Similarly, \u201c[t]his court has a well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the initial brief are deemed waived or abandoned.\u201d <em>United States v. Day, </em>405 F.3d 1293, 1294 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Although Torres Hernandez filed a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s September 2009 decision, her initial brief does not address the standard of review, legal requirements, or factual arguments pertaining to the denial of her motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, any argument on that issue is abandoned.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-10\">. Torres Hernandez's daughter, Olga Yurany Torres, is a co-petitioner, and her granddaughter, Louren Tathiana Gaitan, is a derivative petitioner. This opinion will refer to all three petitioners collectively as \"Torres Hernandez.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b975-10\">. Torres Hernandez has also filed a motion for leave to file an amended brief, submitting an amended brief along with that motion. The amended brief addresses the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration. The motion for leave to file an amended brief is DENIED. We do not consider issues that are not timely raised in the initial brief, nor do we permit supplemental briefs that seek to raise new issues on appeal. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1242 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
