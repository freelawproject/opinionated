It is based upon the original and supplemental complaints filed in the action, and the supplemental complaint was not served on the defendant Rosa Kilfoy. There is no difference between an amended complaint and a supplemental complaint as regards the necessity for service upon the adverse party. (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 464,465.) Service of any amended or supplemental complaint filed, upon all the adverse parties who have not appeared and are to be bound by the judgment, is indispensable, when the judgment is to be taken by default. <em>(Elder </em>v. <em>Spinks, </em>53 Cal. 293; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>60 Cal. 292; <em>Reinhart </em>v. <em>Lugo, </em>86 Cal. 399; 21 Am. St. Rep. 52.) On appeal from a judgment by default, nothing will be presumed in its favor. The record must affirmatively show the existence of every material fact to give the court jurisdiction, and that all the proceedings were in accordance with the law. (Black on Judgments, sec. 93; <em>Schloss </em>v. <em>White, </em>16 Cal. 65.) The proof of service of summons and the original complaint was not sufficient to justify the clerk\u2019s entry of the default of the defendant Rosa Kilfoy, and does not sustain the judgment rendered against her, as she was served as \u201cRose\u201d Kilfoy. Difference of name prima <em>facie </em>imports difference of person, until identity is made to appear. <em>(McNally </em>v. <em>Mott, </em>3 Cal. 235; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Yoell, </em>45 Cal. 586.) A much less difference of names than Rosa from Rose has frequently been held to be a variance. <em>(Garrison </em>v. <em>People, </em>21 Ill. 538; <em>Cruikshank </em>v. <em>Comyns, </em>24 Ill. 603; <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Marrs, </em>29 Ill. 511.) The amount allowed the plaintiff as attorney\u2019s fees was too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>large, and should he reduced by the appellate court. <em>(Grangers\u2019 B. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>84 Cal. 201.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b120-5\"><em>T. C. Law, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-6\">The point made by the appellant, that the service of summons and the original complaint were not sufficient, is not well taken, as the names \u201cRosa\u201d and \u201cRose <em>\u201d </em>are <em>idem sonans. (O\u2019Meara </em>v. <em>North American Min. Co., </em>2 Nev. 121; <em>Dillahunty </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>74 Tex. 344; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sutherland, </em>81 N. Y. 1; <em>Petrie </em>v. <em>Woodworth, </em>3 Caines, 219.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b120-7\">Garoutte, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABZ\">This was an action to foreclose two certain mortgages upon real property. A judgment by default was entered against all the defendants, from which judgment Rosa Kilfoy appeals. Rending the action a supplemental complaint was filed, asking judgment under certain covenants contained in the mortgages for moneys paid out for the insurance of the property. Respondent gave appellant written notice, to which was attached a copy of the supplemental complaint, that upon a certain day he would ask leave of the court to file such complaint. Thereafter the complaint was filed by permission of the court, and subsequently a default thereon was entered against appellant, without any additional service thereof. This was erroneous; a copy of the supplemental complaint should have been served upon appellant after it was filed, and the judgment should be modified to the extent of the relief granted by that complaint. <em>(Washburn </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>59 Cal. 538.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Appellant attacks the proof of service. The defendant was sued as \u201c Rosa \u201d Kilfoy; the return shows the service to have been made upon \u201c Rose \u201d Kilfoy, \u201c by delivering to \u201c Rose <em>\u201d </em>Kilfoy, one of the defendants, personally, in the city and county of San Francisco, state of California, a copy,\u201d etc. Upon this return a default was entered against \u201c Rosa \u201d Kilfoy. It was said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>13 Allen, 571: \u201c The question whether one name is <em>idem sonans </em>with another is. not a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>of spelling, but of pronunciation, depending less upon <em>rule </em>than upon the <em>usage.\u201d </em>In various languages \u201cRose \u201d is pronounced \u201c Rosa,\u201d and even in this country, in various communities and among various classes of people, that pronunciation is maintained. Indeed, it may well be said that they are substantially the same name, and taken in connection with the recital in the return, her identity as one of the defendants, as against nothing to the contrary, is <em>prima facie </em>established.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The record is not all before us, and in its absence we cannot say that the attorney\u2019s fee allowed to plaintiff was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Let the cause be remanded, and the judgment modified to the extent of the relief given by the supplemental complaint, and in all other respects let it be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Paterson, J., and Harrison, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
