GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b631-26\">In this case, several plaintiffs brought suit under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd, alleging that a hospital failed to stabilize an individual\u2019s emergency medical condition before discharging her. The hospital presented sufficient summary judgment evidence that it had stabilized the individual\u2019s medical condition. The plaintiffs, however, chose not to offer any evidence contradicting the hospital\u2019s contention that it had fulfilled its obligations under the statute. The district court granted the hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">On April 6, 1990, at approximately 4:00 p.m., Christeen Robertson went to the Touro Infirmary (\u201cTouro\u201d) emergency room complaining of swelling in her extremities, pain in her right shoulder, dizziness, headaches, and numbness in her right hand. The emergency room staff took her vital signs. All were within normal limits except for her blood pressure, which was slightly elevated. The emergency room staff also took her medical history and learned that Robertson had spent the last three days at Charity Hospital in New Orleans. Robertson had left Charity Hospital without waiting for her test results. Touro\u2019s staff contacted Charity Hospital and obtained Robertson\u2019s test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In the emergency room, both Dr. Harry Hersey and Dr. Edward Dees examined Robertson. Ultimately, Dr. Jairo Barona was her treating physician. Touro\u2019s medical records indicate that Dr. Barona concluded that Robertson was \u201chaving acute nephrotic syndrome and needs to be admitted.\u201d Dr. Baro-na told Robertson \u201cto go to the Charity Hospital due to her insurance status for evaluation and admission.\u201d Touro\u2019s medical staff treated Robertson in the emergency room and followed her condition for approximately seven hours. The hospital discharged Robertson at about 11 p.m. At that time, Robertson\u2019s vital signs were stable, she was not in acute distress, and she was ambulatory. Touro\u2019s staff instructed her to go to Charity Hospital as soon as possible. Later Robertson died. She was survived by her children Joyce Smith Green, Michael Smith, Eric Robertson, Felita Robertson and her husband Charles Robertson, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Robertson\u2019s surviving spouse and children brought this suit against Touro for an alleged violation of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (\u201cEMTALA\u201d). Touro moved for summary judgment arguing that there was no evidence supporting the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that Touro violated EMTALA. Touro argued that it had not violated the act because when it discharged Robertson her vital signs were normal, she was ambulatory, and she was in a stable condition. In support of its motion for summary judgment, Touro submitted its medical records and affidavits from Dr. Barona and Dr. Dees. Both Dr. Barona and Dr. Dees agreed that Touro\u2019s staff had stabilized Robertson and that her condition was not life threatening when Tou-ro discharged her.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">Athough this case has been pending since 1990, the plaintiffs have undertaken virtually no discovery and they have not produced a medical expert. The plaintiffs did not submit any competent evidence to rebut Touro\u2019s contention that it had complied with the statute. The only evidence the plaintiffs presented was a letter from Dr. Lawrence Levy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court determined that Dr. Levy\u2019s letter was not competent summary judgment evidence because it was not submitted through an affidavit. Finding that the plaintiffs had failed to rebut Touro\u2019s evidence that it had stabilized Robertson\u2019s condition as required by EMTALA, the district court granted Touro\u2019s motion. The plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">III</p>\n<p id=\"Afh4\">On appeal from a district court\u2019s summary judgment, we review the record <em>de novo </em>to ascertain whether any genuine issues exist as to any material fact. If the record is devoid of a genuine issue of material fact, we review the evidence to determine whether the moving party was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>FDIC v. Myers, </em>955 F.2d 348, 349 (5th Cir. 1992). Once a motion for summary judgment has been made and adequately supported, the non-movant cannot rest on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>pleadings. The non-movant \u201cmust bring forth significant probative evidence to prevent summary judgment.\u201d <em>Stine v. Marathon Oil Co., </em>976 F.2d 254, 265 (5th Cir.1992) (citing <em>Union Planters Nat\u2019l Leasing Inc. v. Woods, </em>687 F.2d 117 (5th Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The plaintiffs contend that they have a cause of action against Touro under EMTALA because 1) Touro failed to perform appropriate tests to determine whether Robertson\u2019s renal failure presented an emergency condition, 2) Touro failed to stabilize Robertson\u2019s renal condition before discharging her, and 3) Touro failed to transfer Robertson to another medical facility. The plaintiffs\u2019 arguments fail. As we explain below, the only evidence in the record leads to the inescapable inference that Touro\u2019s staff had stabilized Robertson\u2019s condition before discharging her. EMTALA requires only that a hospital stabilize an individual\u2019s emergency medical condition; it does not require a hospital to cure the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">EMTALA strictly sets out a hospital\u2019s responsibilities toward individuals who enter their emergency rooms requesting care. The statute provides that when such a person requests medical attention, the hospital must first screen the individual \u201cto determine whether an emergency medical condition (within the meaning of subsection (e)(1) of this section) exists.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the individual suffers from an emergency conditions the hospital must provide either:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">(A) with the staff and facilities available at the hospital, for such further medical examination and such treatment as may be required to <em>stabilize </em>the medical condition, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">(B) for transfer of the individual to another medical facility in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd(b)(l) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under EMTALA an, emergency medical condition is \u201cstabilized\u201d if \u201cno material deterioration of the condition is likely, within reasonable medical probability, to result from or occur during the transfer of the individual from a facility.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd(e)(3)(B). Transfer \u201cmeans the movement (including the discharge) of an individual outside a hospital\u2019s facilities at the direction of any person employed by (or affiliated or associated, directly or indirectly, with) the hospital.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd(e)(4). The hospital\u2019s responsibility under the statute ends when it has stabilized the individual\u2019s medical condition. <em>See Brooker v. Desert Hosp. Corp., </em>947 F.2d 412, 415 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">The district court found that Touro met its obligations under the statute when it-stabilized Robertson\u2019s condition. The district court based this conclusion on Touro\u2019s medical records and the affidavits from Dr. Dees and Dr. Barona. . Dr. Dees states in his affidavit that he \u201ctreated and followed Chris-teen Robertson for approximately four hours prior to her discharge and that she was stable and able to be discharged home at approximately 23:00.\u201d Dr. Dees goes on to say that Robertson was \u201cambulatory[,] with no acute distress[,] and with stable vital signs.\u201d Dr. Barona states that he \u201cwas aware of her [Robertson\u2019s] condition[,] which was not life threatening[,] and of her need for further evaluation and treatment of nephritis and hypertension,\u201d and that \u201che recommended follow-up treatment at Charity Hospital New Orleans.\u201d This evidence leads to the inescapable inference that Robertson was in a stable condition.when Touro discharged her and, thus, Touro adequately supported its motion for summary judgment. Since the plaintiffs failed to present any evidence to contradict Touro\u2019s evidence, it was appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ate for the district court to grant Touro\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\">. Dr. Levy\u2019s letter stated only that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">it would have been appropriate [for Touro] to repeat her [Robertson\u2019s] renal function tests.
