There is nothing in the record indicating that the same person bore the several names used.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number><em>W.

J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The Attorney General very properly remarks that \u201c the record in this case exhibits a great deal of carelessness,\u201d but we think the conclusion at which he arrives does not follow. After stating the facts, he recapitulates as follows : <em>Ye Cow </em>is indicted ; <em>Ah Cow </em>is arraigned and pleads not guilty; <em>My Chow </em>demands a separate trial and is tried ; the verdict and judgment are against <em>Ah Coiv ; My Chow </em>moves for a new trial and appeals. He contends that as the judgment is against <em>Ah Cow, </em>an appeal in the name of <em>My Chow </em>cannot be maintained; but we think the <em>My Chow </em>who appeals is, for that purpose, sufficiently identified with the proceedings by being named as the party Avho was tried. The appeal being properly taken, it is clear that the judgment should not be permitted to stand. If the defendant should again be indicted for the same offense, it might be very difficult for him to establish a previous conviction. The record is AA\u2019anting in certainty to a degree which should not be tolerated in criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a neAV trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
