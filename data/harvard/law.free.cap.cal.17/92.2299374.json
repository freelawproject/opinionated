Answer, a set-off. The case was sent to a Referee; who reported a finding and judgment in favor of plaintiff. Judgment being entered in accordance with the report, defendant excepted to the report, and moved to set it aside, and for a new trial, on the ground, among others, that the evidence was insufficient to justify it. Motion denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-7\">Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-8\"><em>James W.

In making the order, the Court acted in the exercise of a sound legal discretion, and upon the evidence embodied in the record we cannot undertake to say that this discretion ivas abused. Our interference, under the circumstances, would be a departure from the rule upon which we have always acted in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">There is nothing in the other point made; and the judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
