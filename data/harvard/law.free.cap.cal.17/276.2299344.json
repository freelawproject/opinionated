The indictment was not so returned and filed in the Court of Sessions as to entitle it to become a record in said Court, and the proceedings thereunder are <em>coram nonjudice. </em>(Wood's Dig. art. 1530, sec. 229, art. 1533, sec. 233.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-13\">Under the statute, the indictment must be presented by the fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>man of' the grand jury, in their presence, to the Court; and these things' must be shown affirmatively by the record. In this case there is no evidence that the indictment was ever so presented.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-4\">II. The indictment is insufficient: 1st, because no force or violence is averred. (Archbold's Cr. Pl. 573.) 2d, because there is no averment that the alleged victim was within the county at the time. The indictment ought to read that the crime was committed \u201c in and upon one M. A. W., <em>then and there being.\u201d </em>3d, because the age of the girl is not averred to be under ten years; the words, \u201c to wit: of the age of nine years and upwards,\u201d qualifies and limits the preceding words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-6\">III.
