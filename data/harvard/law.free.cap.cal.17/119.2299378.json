J. concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Upon a further examination of this case, we are satisfied that our former decision was erroneous, and that the judgment should be reversed. The -principal defendant is a married woman, and as against her the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause- of action. She could only be held in the character of a sole trader under the statute; and the allegation that she was doing business as a <em>femme sole </em>with the consent of her husband is insufficient. Enough should have been stated to establish her liability as a sole trader.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
