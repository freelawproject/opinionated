It is a virtual admission that the judgment entered for the plaintiff is erroneous and must be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-9\">But we insist that the judgment should not only be reversed, but that a judgment should be ordered to be entered for the defendant upon the special verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-10\">The general verdict and the special verdict are inconsistent, and in such a case the latter must control. (Practice Act, secs. 174, 175.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-11\">McCune having paid the purchase money, remained in possession as purchaser, and assumed a liability to Bowman. It would be a fraud on him to treat him as a trespasser, or to consider the parol contract of sale as void. (2 Story's Eq. sec. 761; Browne on the Statute of Frauds, sec. 463, 464, 465.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-12\">\u201c The general rule is that possession of land is notice to the purchaser of the possessor\u2019s title.\u201d (4 Kent's Com. 179; <em>Troup </em>v. <em>Hurlbut, </em>10 Barb. 358; <em>Grimstone </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>3 Paige, 423; <em>Goveneur </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>2 Id. 300; and numerous cases cited in argument in <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>12 Cal. 363.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The opinion in <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Dennison, </em>7 Cal. 306, cannot be considered as narrowing this rule. Nor can <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>in which the Court only lays down the rule in terms broad enough to cover the facts of the case, without intending to impose any restriction upon it. Certainly the Court never intended to say that possession was never to be regarded as notice, unless taken under an unrecorded deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-4\">This Court has applied the rule in cases strictly analogous to the present. <em>(Ellis </em>v. <em>Jeans, </em>7 Cal. 415; <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Dennison, </em>7 Id. 308; <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>8 Id. 467; <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Lisbros, </em>9 Id. 6.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-5\">The special verdict is suEcient. All the findings taken together show the nature, character and time of commencement of the defendant\u2019s possession, and the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-6\">McDowell was a settler on the land. He had a bare possession. The effect of his dealing with the defendant was in law an abandonment of his possession. When he subsequently conveyed to the plaintiff, he had no interest to convey. <em>(Bequette </em>v. <em>Caulfield, </em>4 Cal. 278; <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Lisbros, </em>9 Id. 5, 6.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-7\">The defendant may so assert, though he entered originally as McDowell\u2019s tenant. He does not deny that McDowell had title, but asserts that his title had ceased. And in this view of the case it was an immaterial issue whether the plaintiff, when he took his deed, had or had not notice of the defendant\u2019s equitable title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-8\"><em>Tod. Robinson, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-9\">I. A special verdict should present only conclusions of fact. (Practice Act, sec. 174.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-10\">II. No instrument can be drawn to support a defective special verdict. <em>(Lawrence </em>v. <em>Beaubien, </em>2 Bailey, 623; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>4 Porter, 198; <em>Turnell </em>v. Watson, 2 Munf. 283; <em>Seaward </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>8 Cow. 406; <em>La Frombois </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>Id. 589; <em>Blank </em>v. <em>Foushee, </em>4 Munf. 61; 11 Wheat. 415; 10 Bac. Abr. 312.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-11\">III. Possession is not conclusive, but only presumptive notice of the occupant\u2019s claim. <em>(Bird </em>v. <em>Dennison, </em>7 Cal. 306; <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Lick, </em>Id. 489; 3 Pick.; 5 Id.; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Wiel, </em>8 Green. 77, 99; 2 Sumner, 556.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-12\">IV. To the inquiry if the plaintiff had notice, the answer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>jury was: \u201c If possession is notice, he had.\u201d This finding cannot support a judgment. (Gould's Pleading, 525; <em>Black's Lessee </em>v. Davis, 20 Ohio, 249; <em>Hambleton </em>v. Dempsey, Id. 168; 2 Coms. 401; 1 Id. 522; 6 Richardson, 54; 2 Swan, 399; 20 How. [U. S.] 432.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-4\">V. The special verdict is inconsistent and vague. <em>(Thayer </em>v. <em>Society of United Brethren, </em>20 Penn. [8 Harris] 62-63.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-5\">VI. The facts found in the special verdict do not take the defendant\u2019s case out of the Statute of Frauds. (2 Story's Eq. Jur. secs. 760, 761; 4 Kent, 494 [Marg. 451]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Glancy, </em>4 Black, [Ind.] 93; <em>Allen's estate, </em>1 Watts &amp; S. 383; <em>McKee </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>9 Watts, 85; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Cartwright, </em>5 Munf. 308; <em>Mialhi </em>v. <em>Lassabe, </em>4 Ala. 712; <em>Church of the Advent </em>v. <em>Farrow, </em>7 Rich. Eq. 378; <em>Letcher </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>2 A. K. Marsh. 106; <em>Wilber </em>v. <em>Paine, </em>1 Ham. [Ohio] 252; <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>2 Overt. [Tenn.] 192; Brown on the Statute of Frauds, sec. 477.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b304-6\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"A1P\">Field, C. J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The judgment must be reversed. The special finding is insufficient on the question of notice by Woodson, of the sale from McDowell to McCune. The answer of the jury \u2018to the issue presented was in this form: \u201c Yes, if the possession is notice.\u201d But this response is too equivocal; it neither directly finds the fact of possession, nor the time of it, nor the kind of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">We are asked to render judgment here upon the findings in favor of the defendants; but apart from other objections, we think the verdict does not so distinctly find the facts put in issue as to warrant us in so ordering. (See tenth and eleventh issues and findings.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">In respect to the question of notice of a sale or conveyance, as furnished by possession, we need only refer to the previous decisions of this Court. <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(12 Cal. 363) was not de'signed to confine the application of the principle to an unrecorded deed; but the same rule would apply as well to any other title consistent with the possession. (See <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Ramirez, 8 </em>Cal. 461.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>On petition for rehearing, the opinion was rendered by the same Justices as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The general verdict was not rendered by their own volition by the jury, but merely by the order of the Court, and that apart from the special findings upon disputed facts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
