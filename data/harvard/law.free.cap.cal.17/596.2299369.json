Chase, a former suit between the same parties. The defendant here was the judgment debtor there. The premises were sold on the ninth of July, 1859, were bid in by plaintiff, and redeemed by defendant on the first of August following, by the payment of the judgment and costs, (the amount bid) and twelve per cent. This suit was commenced Oct. 22d, 1859. The premises were occupied by several tenants of the judgment debtor, and he received the amount of rent sued for and accruing between the time of sale and redemption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>The Court below gave plaintiff judgment for the amount claimed, upon the authority of <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Reynolds </em>(13 Cal. 514).</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-4\"><em>A. </em>Smith, for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-5\">1. The defendant was neither actually nor constructively a tenant in possession of the premises between the date of the Sheriff\u2019s sale and the redemption.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-6\">2. Defendant redeemed the premises. The effect of the sale was then terminated, and the debtor was restored to his estate. (Pr. Act, 150, sec. 232.) \u201c If the debtor redeem at any time before the time for the redemption expires, the effect of the sale shall be terminated, and he be restored to his estate.\u201d The term \u201c effect \u201d includes every conceivable consequence resulting from a sale of real property ; and that \u201c he be restored to his estate,\u201d is an expression equally generic, and must imply a complete restoration to his estate, unburdened by any \u201c effect \u201d of the sale\u2014such as attornment to the purchaser, liability for use and occupation, interference by injunction or otherwise. In other words, this section must mean an unconditional restoration to his estate as it was at the time of the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-9\">The former decisions of this Court only go to sustain a recovery for rents and profits, or the value of the use and occupation of premises in suits brought to recover the same, after the time for redemption has expired and no redemption made. In the case at bar, the redemption was duly made within twenty-one days after the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-10\"><em>W. Campbell Alexander W. </em>Baldwin, for Respondent, relied on <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>(13 Cal. 514) and Pr. Act, 236.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b597-11\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"A7h\">Cope, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Judgment affirmed, for the reasons given by the Judge below in his opinion. It is unnecessary to state these reasons, since the principles governing the case have already been settled in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>(13 Cal.) and other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">See <em>Knights </em>v. <em>Truett, </em>18 Cal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
