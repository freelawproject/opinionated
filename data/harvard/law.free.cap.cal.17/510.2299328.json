Also, that on the eighteenth of June, 1858, defendants, by their authorized agent\u2014one Kappelman\u2014admitted in a writing signed by him as agent, a certain amount due, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-11\">\u201cKnight\u2019s Ferry, June 18th, 1858.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-12\">\u201c We, the undersigned, do hereby acknowledge the lien of M.

The facts seem to be, that on and before June 25th, 1857, Kappelman &amp; Co. were constructing under contract a dam for the defendants. The dam was to be constructed for $110,000, payable in the capital stock of the company, which constituted the whole stock, and was delivered to K. &amp; Co.,\u2014the work being finished and handed over to the defendants January, 1858. Kappelman &amp; Co., in June, 1857, employed plaintiff to work on the dam as a day laborer, and in August and October, 1857, issued certificates of indebtedness in the following form:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">\u201c Due to A. B. for labor on the K. F. &amp; T. M. W. Co.\u2019s ditch, -dollars and-cents, payable in water.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-7\">(Signed) Kappelman &amp; Co.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-8\">These certificates were subsequently paid in water by the employees of the defendants, and charged by the corporation to Kappelman &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-9\">The question between the parties is whether plaintiff was employed by Kappelman &amp; Co. as <em>contractors </em>or as <em>agents </em>of the corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-10\">The Court below submitted to the jury the following issues:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-11\">\u201c 1. Was the work and labor done by the plaintiff in the construction of the dam, as charged in the complaint, done at the instance and request of the defendants, or at the instance of some other party ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-12\">\u201c2. Were Kappelman &amp; Co. the agents of the defendant-corporation on the eighteenth of June, 1858, in and about the business of constructing the dam and ditch ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-13\">To which the jury reply: \u201c We, the jury, find that the work and labor done by the plaintiff in the construction of the dam, was done at the instance and request of Kappelman &amp; Co., who were agents of the corporation defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>The Court then subsequently found that plaintiff did the work and filed his mechanic\u2019s lien, etc., and gave him judgment against defendants for the amount claimed. Defendants appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b512-4\"><em>H. P. </em>Barber, for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-5\">No judgment should have been entered for plaintiff on the special verdict, because it does not show that Kappelman &amp; Co. employed plaintiff as agents of defendants. K. &amp; Co. might have been agents, and yet have employed plaintiff in their individual capacity. A special verdict must stand or fail alone\u2014it cannot be aided by reference to extrinsic facts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b512-6\"><em>L. Quint, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-7\">The special verdict in effect finds that Kappelman &amp; Co., as agents of defendant, employed plaintiff. When there is enough in the verdict as rendered to enable the Court to ascertain the intention of the jury, that intention should be carried out. <em>(Truebody </em>v. <em>Jacobson, 2 </em>Cal. 284.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b512-8\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"Ajd\">Field, C. J. and Cope, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The finding in this case is in the nature of a special verdict. It is that the work was done at the instance of Kappelman &amp; Co., who were the agents of the defendant\u2014the defendant being a corporation. It was claimed by the defendant that though Kappelman &amp; Co. were agents, they were also contractors, and that they employed the plaintiff in this last capacity. There is no necessary inconsistency between a man being an agent and his contracting in an individual capacity; and the very question here was, as to what capacity Kappelman &amp; Co. acted in making this contract. The rule is that enough must be found by a special verdict or finding, when that is relied on as the basis of a judgment, to show in and of itself a legal conclusion of liability. This is not done here. We must, therefore, reverse the judgment, that the issue may be directly and explicitly found.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
