The indictment is headed <em>\u201c </em>State of California: in the Court of Sessions of the city and county of San Francisco, December term, a. d. one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine; <em>The People of the State of California </em>v. <em>Philip R. Robinson; </em>\u201d and runs \u201c Philip R. Robinson is accused by the grand jury of the city and county of San Francisco, State of California,\u201d etc., charging the offense to have been committed \u201c at the s.aid city and county and State aforesaid.\u201d The certificate of the Clerk transferring the indictment to the Fourth District Court is in the usual form, that the indictment was found in the Court of Sessions of the city and county of San Francisco, State of California, and is hereby certified and transmitted to the Fourth District Court of said city, county and State, for trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-10\">The facts as to the separation of the jury during the trial are, so far as shown by the record, that \u201c the jury were dismissed and allowed to separate under the statutory caution of the Court.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>jury were dismissed several times, on adjournment of the Court, during the trial, and the above entry made by the Clerk each time. After the evidence was closed, the Court adjourned till the next day, ihe jury being allowed to separate as above stated, without being under the control of an officer. So of a separation during the argument of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-4\">As to the instructions, the record shows that \u201c the argument being closed, the Court read to the jury its written charge, and defendant\u2019s counsel read to the jury the instructions by them asked and allowed by the Court, and thereupon the jury retired in charge of a sworn bailiff of the Court, to deliberate upon their verdict and that after the jury had returned for further instructions, \u201c the Court read to the jury so much of its written charge and such further written instructions as were requestedbut neither the charge nor the instructions appear in the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">As to how the jury came into Court when they asked for instructions, and also when they had agreed on their verdict, the record says : \u201cAnd now, at nine o\u2019clock and twenty minutes, p. M., the jury in this cause came into Court, and being called, answered to their names,\u201d etc.; and \u201c Now', at ten o\u2019clock and fifteen minutes p. M. of this day, the jury herein again came into Court, and being called, answered to their names; and the defendant and his counsel, and the District Attorney being present in open Court as before, the jury herein rendered their verdict as follows: \u2018We, the jury, find the prisoner guilty of murder in the second degree,\u2019 and so said they all and were thereupon discharged. And on motion of the District Attorney, the Court fixed Saturday, the third day of March, 1860, as the time for passing sentence upon the defendant, until which time the defendant was remanded to the custody of the Sheriff.\u201d The record does not show any entry of an adjournment of the Court at this time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">The entry at the time of sentence is:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-7\">\u201c District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of California in and for the city and county of San Francisco :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-8\">\u201c February term, A.

Robinson, the defendant herein, has been duly convicted in this Court of the crime of murder in the, second degree, it is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the sentence of the Court is that said defendant, Philip R. Robinson, be imprisoned in the State Prison of the State of California for the term of his natural life.\u201d Then follows the certificate of the Clerk that <em>\u201c </em>the1 foregoing is a true and correct copy of an order, and the judgment entered on the minutes of said Fourth District Court in the above entitled* action,\u201d the certificate bearing date March 5th, 1850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\">The record shows no date of the session of the Court w'hen sentence was pronounced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-8\">Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-9\">The precise facts as to certain technical points made by counsel for appellant have been given at some length for the reason that he seems to have noticed about all the irregularities which would be likely to arise in the course of a criminal trial, and the opinion of this Court being adverse to his positions, will serve as a precedent for a large number of cases.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-10\"><em>A. M. Heslep, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-11\">I. The indictment in this cause is entitled <em>\u201c </em>of a Court <em>defacto, </em>and not a Court <em>de jure.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-12\">II. The indictment on its face, and the certificate of transfer thereon, does not show that the District Court of the Fourth Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>District had jurisdiction of said indictment; jurisdiction being an affirmative element, the same must appear on the face of the pleadings, and not be claimed by inference or intendment of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-4\">When an indictment is found in the Court of Sessions, for murder, manslaughter, or arson, it shall be transmitted by the Clerk to the District Court sitting in the county for trial. (Art. 665, sec. 53, 153, Wood\u2019s Dig.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-5\">\u25a0 The Fourth Judicial District is composed of a portion of the county of San Francisco.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-6\">The Twelfth Judicial District is composed of another or remaining portion of the county of San Francisco and the county of San Mateo. (Art. 632, sec. 12, 149, Wood\u2019s Dig.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-7\">The territorial division or limits of the districts aforesaid are defined and fixed, and both include the county of San Francisco, and one the entire county of San Mateo.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-8\">Another provision of the statute gives to both these counties jurisdiction territorially of the county of San Francisco. (Arts. 642-3, secs. 2-3, 150, Wood\u2019s Dig.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-9\">The District Court sitting in the county where 'the indictme nt s found has jurisdiction in cases of murder, <em>a fortiori </em>but one District Court has jurisdiction though two Courts may exist in the county. It follows that that Court has jurisdiction only where the offense is committed within its territorial limits. If this conclusion is well founded, certain consequences result.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-10\">1st. It becomes necessary then to include, by way of averment, a <em>locus in quo, </em>to give jurisdiction to one or the other Court, where two are within the limits of one county.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-11\">The Court of Sessions is controlled by the statute, and has no discretion in cases of murder, manslaughter and arson. The indictment must be certified to the District Court sittingyn the county where it is found ; and if two Courts exist in the same county, then to the one containing the <em>locus in quo, </em>or place of commission of the offense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-12\">The same remarks apply to the certificate of transfer indorsed on said indictment. The objection is, that it does not show sufficient on its face in the absence of a <em>locus in quo </em>in the indictment to give jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>III. It does not appear from the record at each adjournment or recess of the Court, that the jury were charged by the Court \u201c not to converse among themselves, or with any one else, on any subject connected with the trial, or to form or express any opinion thereon, until the cause was finally submitted to them.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-4\">It is not sufficient for the Clerk to say the jury were permitted to disperse \u201c under the statutory caution of the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-5\">IV. The Court below erred by allowing the jury to separate after all the evidence was closed, and all the facts of the case were before the jury, without being in the control or custody of an officer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-6\">The question raised under this assignment.of error is: At what stage of the proceedings, in a criminal trial, is the case deemed submitted to the jury ? The answer to the query is narrowed down by another inquiry. Are the argument of counsel and the charge of the Court, incidents to a trial, necessary and indispensable to the finding of a verdict by the jury ? If they are, then the cause cannot be deemed as submitted until these events have taken place. But if a verdict can be rendered without, then the cause is submitted on the closing of the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-7\">The judgment of the jury is pronounced upon the facts, not upon argument of counsel, or the charge of the Court. The jury deals exclusively with the facts; we therefore insist that with the closing of the testimony, the cause is submitted to the jury, after which time they cannot be allowed to separate. (Art. 1645, sec. 393 ; Art. 1646, sec. 394; Art. 1856, sec. 410, 300, 302, Wood\u2019s Dig.; 4 Wen. Black., Ch. 27, 360.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-8\">V. The Court below erred in this ; that after the evidence had closed on both sides, and the argument opened by the District Attorney, and the defendant\u2019s counsel had concluded his argument, a recess of one hour was taken, during which time the jury were allowed to separate and without being in the custody of an officer, (Foregoing authorities and the case of the <em>People </em>v. Backus, 5 Cal. 275.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-9\">VI. It appears from the record in this cause, that the Court read to the jury its written charge, and the same does not appear to have been filed and thereby made a part of the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The Court of its own motion may charge the jury (Art. 1649, 301, Wood\u2019s Dig.) ; and any error therein will be reviewed by the Supreme Court, though exceptions thereto were not taken at the time. <em>(The People, &amp;c., </em>v. <em>Levison</em>; Art. 1677, sec. 438, 304, Wood\u2019s Dig.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-4\">Exceptions may be taken to the charge of the Court. (Art. 1673, 303-304, third clause of the section, Wood\u2019s Dig.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-5\">The appellate Court will review the instructions or charge of the Court, though no exceptions are taken at the time of trial. <em>(The People </em>v. Levison.) <em>A fortiori, </em>the charge or instructions of the Court are (when given) a part of the record or judgment roll, and it is error to withhold the same, thereby taking from the prisoner the right or opportunity for a review if desired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-6\">VII. It does not appear from the record, that after the cause was finally submitted, the jury was committed to the custody of an officer or bailiff, who was first \u201c sworn to keep them together in some private and convenient place, and not to permit any person to speak to them, nor to speak to them himself, (the bailiff) unless it be to ask them' whether they have agreed upon a verdict, and then return them into Court when they have so agreed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-7\">The language used in the record, in this respect, is thus : \u201c The jury retired in charge of a sworn bailiff of the Court to deliberate upon their verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-8\">The Sheriff of the county always has sworn bailiffs in attendance on Court. The bailiff has taken a general oath to perform his duties. But there are special eases of duty demanding by the statute a special oath. The oath is prescribed in the statute. (Art. 1650, sec. 402, 301, Wood\u2019s Dig.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-9\">The duty here being imperative, if it was performed it must be shown affirmatively, and not claimed by implication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-10\">VIII. It does not appear from the record in this cause that the jury during their deliberations were kept together by an officer first sworn for that purpose. Nor does it appear therefrom, before and after the case was finally submitted for their consideration, that the jury was brought into Court in the custody of an officer or sworn bailiff, when they came into Court to deliver their verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-11\">The officer sworn to take charge of the jury when deliberating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>on their verdict shall bring them into Court when they have agreed. (Art. 1650, sec. 402, Wood\u2019s Dig.) Or if they (the jury) desire further instructions the officer shall conduct them into Court, or if they have agreed upon a verdict. (Art. 1655, sec. 458, art. 1659, sec. 414, Wood\u2019s Dig.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-4\">It does not appear in what manner the jury found their way into the Court room on either of these occasions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-5\">IX. It does not appear from the record that the verdict recorded herein was agreed upon by the jury, or that the jury ever did agree upon a verdict, or that at the time they were in Court that it was for the purpose of rendering their verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-6\">When a jury is brought into Court by the proper officer, \u201c they shall be asked by the Court or Clerk whether they have agreed upon their verdict, and if the foreman answer in the affirmative they shall, on being required, declare the same. (Art. 1660, sec. 416, 302, Wood\u2019s Dig.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-7\">X. It does not appear at the time the sentence and judgment of the Court was pronounced therein, the Court convened, <em>defacto and de </em>jure, or acted as a <em>defacto </em>Court, but without authority of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-8\">The day of the month is not stated in the record, so we are left entirely in the dark, whether the time of sentence was the same as fixed by the Court on the ninth day of February. And there is nothing in the previous orders of the Court to authorize an assembling of the Court; for the record does not show an order of adjournment to that time, and the words \u201c Court met pursuant to adjournment \u201d will not cure this defect, and legalize the meeting of the Court on the third of March, unless a previous order of adjournment to that time was made, either at that or some subsequent consecutive time. The record should show upon its face continuous orders of adjournment up to the day of sentence, to give to this meeting of the Court the quality of a <em>de jure </em>as well as <em>de facto </em>meeting of the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-9\">XI. The record and pretended judgment do not show a judgment of the Court that the appellant hath been adjudged upon the verdict of the jury guilty of the crime of murder upon the person of Peter Burns, but the judgment simply recites the verdict of the jury, and does not pronounce judgment thereon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>This statement is wholly insuEeient; the accused must be on the verdict of the jury adjudged guilty of the crime found by the verdict, and be made to respond thereto by its sentence or penalty annexed to the crime. The judgment and sentence of the Court are distinct and at the same time connecting elements; the sentence or punishment is a conseqence annexed to the judgment, or a result flowing therefrom.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b370-4\"><em>Thos. H. Williams, Attorney General, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-5\">I. The first objection is the same as that made in the case of the <em>People </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>and is answered in my brief on file in that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-6\">II. The indictment charges the offense to have been committed in the city and county of San Francisco, but does not set forth the particular locality within said city and county so as to determine whether it was within the Fourth or Twelfth Judicial District. The Clerk of the Court of Sessions transmitted the indictment to the Fourth Judicial District Court. The defendant appeared in the latter Court, with Mr. Byrne as his attorney, plead to the indictment, was tried and committed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-7\">The practice in this case was precisely that which has prevailed in the county of San Francisco since the organization of its Courts. I submit this point, so gravely urged, by a simple reference to the following sections of statutory law: Wood\u2019s Dig. 150, arts. 640, 642, 643 ; page 153, art. 665 ; and page 289, art. 1541.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-8\">III. Answered in Connor\u2019s case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-9\">IV and V. Answered by article 1622, Criminal Practice Act (Wood\u2019s Dig. 297).</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-10\">VI to XI. Answered in Connor\u2019s case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b370-11\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">Field, C. J. and Cope, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">Defendant was convicted of the crime of murder in the District Court of the Fourth District.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">1. The first assignment has just been disposed of in the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Connor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">2. That the indictment, on its face, and the certificate of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>transfer thereon, does not show that the District Court of the Fourth District had jurisdiction. The indictment charges the offense to have been committed within the city and county of San Francisco. It is true, the particular place or locality in which it was committed is not given. Nor was this necessary.. The Court must take judicial notice that the Fourth District is a district within and for the county of San Francisco, though it comprises only a portion of the territory of that county. But this division does not interfere with its jurisdiction over persons and subjects within the county. It would lead to very great inconvenience if this were so. By article six hundred and forty, section twenty of the Act respecting Courts of Justice, (Wood\u2019s Dig. 150) it is provided, that in all the counties of this State, the District Court shall have jurisdiction to try and determine all indictments transmitted to them from the Courts of Sessions in the cases provided for by law. No distinction seems to be made as to the district, arising from the place or particular locality where the crime is committed. The District Court for the Fourth District is not less a Court for the whole county because it has territorial limits\u2014these being given not for the purposes of limiting its powers, but for convenience in elections, etc. <em>(Slade </em>v. <em>His Creditors, </em>10 Cal. 483.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Several errors are assigned which we do not think it necessary to notice in detail; for they have either been decided in other cases, or fall within principles already settled. District Courts are Courts of general jurisdiction, and the regularity of their proceedings is presumed. It rests with a party seeking to impeach them to show affirmatively any imputed irregularity, or acts or omissions which affect the validity of their judgments, especially after the jurisdiction of the person is once shown. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>9 Cal. 231; <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>6 Id. 478 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>decided at this term.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">There is nothing in the point that the record does not show the instructions given by the Court. It appears that they were given in writing, and if they were erroneous, this must be shown by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The other points are not sustained by the record, or present, if sustained, no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
