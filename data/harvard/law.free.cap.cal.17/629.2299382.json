The intention of this stipulation being to waive proof of the genuineness of the signature of Luis Peralta to said original, and to admit the use of said copy in. like manner as said original might be used, if produced; but not to waive or admit any other matter or thing whatever.

Plaintiff objected on the ground, among others, that the will purported to have been admitted to probate at chambers and in vacation; that no petition for the .probate thereof appears; that no time was appointed for the hearing, and no notices served ; that it does not appear that the testator died in Santa Clara county, or left property there; and that neither the Probate Judge nor the Probate Court ever acquired jurisdiction to admit said will to probate.

The picture of St. Joseph and our lady Guadalupe being for my said daughter Guadalupe, and the Crucifix and our lady of Dolores for my. daughter Maria Josefa. I command these two daughters to remain in peace enjoying the property that I leave therein; but if by marriage or other motive either one of them should wish to separate from the other, then the two may make such agreement as they shall deem fit for this and for any other arrangement of their domestic affairs, or of their property of which they remain the owners and mistresses without ever being disturbed by any person; and may they remain always together, the one serving the other as her guardian angel, that God our Lord may preserve them from the storms of this world, and from all ill-inclined persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-6\">As regards the cattle belonging to me, that is to say, horned cattle, I declare that on the marriage of my children Maria Teadora, Ygnacio, Domingo and Trinidad, to each one were given two cows and calves by reason of having just commenced the rearing of my cattle, but afterwards they received in gift more cattle, as they themselves can say, as they know how to speak the truth; also in the year 1831 there were delivered to William Castro two hundred and thirty head of horned cattle, which were the marriage portion of his wife Maria Louisa Peralta, my daughter. Also, I repeat again, that there have been given to my daughters Maria Teadora and Maria Trinidad two hundred head of horned cattle, and to my son Ygnacio three hundred head of cattle; and over and above those which have already been given to my son Domingo, I command that there be given to him one hundred head of cattle. I likewise command that out of the cattle in San Antonio and Temascal that shall be found to belong to me, there shall be given two hundred head to each one of my daughters Maria Josefa and Maria Guadalupe, and the remainder in Temascal shall belong to my son Vincente, and the remainder in San Antonio shall belong</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>to my son Antonio Maria; and these two brothers shall take the charge of the cattle of the two sisters Maria Josefa and Maria Guadalupe. Inasmuch, as I have already portioned out to my sons their respective lands, I declare that these lands comprehend all my property of the Rancho de San Antonio, the title of whose concession and possession are in the hands of my son Ygnacio, and which lands I have already divided amongst my sons as a i: donation <em>inter vivos \u201d </em>to their entire satisfaction, and which donations by these presents I hereby ratify.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-4\">I declare that I owe no man, and that Nazared Berreyeza owes me fifteen dollars.

Lastly, I command all my children, sons and daughters, to educate and bring up their children in the holy fear of God, showing them good example and keeping them from all bad company, in order that God our Lord may shower upon them his blessings, the same which I leave to you, in the name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Ghost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-6\">I declare that this is my last will and testament, dictated by me and written in my presence, read and signed by myself; and by these presents I revoke and annul all and every other will or wills, codicil or codicils, that I may have executed; I declare it or them null and of no value in law or otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-7\">In testimony whereof, I have hereunto placed my hand this twenty-ninth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one, in the city of San Jos\u00e9, and in the presence of witnesses that I have called to serve as witnesses of this my last will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-8\">(Signed) LUIS MA PERALTA, [seal.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-9\">James Alex Forbes, )</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-10\">Padre Juan Nobile, &gt; Witnesses. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-11\">Dom\u2019o Daruco, )</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Plaintiff then asked the following among other instructions, all of which were refused except the last, which was given :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-5\">1. \u201c That the will of Luis Peralta is not proved according to the requirements of the Statute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-6\">2. \u201c That the paper purporting to be a certified copy of proceedings before Judge Redman, Probate Judge of Santa Clara county, to probate the will of Luis Peralta, does not prove the execution of the will; nor the competence or the capacity to make a will; nor that it was subscribed by the subscribing witnesses in the presence of the testator; or that said Luis Peralta was dead.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-7\">3. \u201c That the paper above mentioned furnishes no evidence of the due proof or probate of the will, in the absence of evidence giving the Judge or Court jurisdiction to adjudicate the probate of the will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-8\">4. \u201c That said will is not so proved as to make it any evidence in this Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-9\">5.

The alleged probate of the will of Luis Peralta was null and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b635-16\">2. Excluding said will and record of probate, defendant established title to only one undivided ninth, and plaintiff to the undivided five-ninths of the premises, which entitled the plaintiff to be let into possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>3. No proof of the will was offered other than the record of probate ; and proof of the will by subscribing witnesses was not admissible, because our system gives the Probate Court exclusive jurisdiction of the probate of wills, and makes its record, when in due form, conclusive. <em>(Tompkins </em>v.

Even if defendant had the right to the will as an original will or as a deed, it could not be proved except by full evidence, such as is required by statute to prove it in the Probate Court. (10 Paige, 85; 1 Denio, 33 ; 26 Wend. 331; 1 Barb. 527; 5 Cow. 221.) Proof of the signature of the testator would not be sufficient. The statute says : \u201c No will shall be valid,\u201d unless executed with certain formalities ; and these formalities are matters of affirmative proof, not a particle of which was offered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b636-6\"><em>E.

If the instrument is to have no effect until after the death of the maker, it can only operate as a will. If it is to take effect immediately, for any purpose, it may operate as a deed.

The act of livery, by which the four sons of Luis Peralta went into possession and received an investiture of their respective portions of the San Antonio Rancho, was equivalent to a feoffinent at common law; they thereby became seized, in fact, of an estate in fee simple. (4 Cruise Dig. 62; Lit. 32, ch. 4 sec. 33 (old ed.); 4 Kent, 482-484.) Hence they had an estate in the land upon which a release or confirmation could operate. (<em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>Cowp. 597; 2 Coke Litt. (B. &amp; H. Ed.) 274 <em>a, </em>274 <em>b, </em>296 <em>a, </em>296 <em>b; 2 </em>Greenl. Cruise Dig.

It consists of the solemn admissions of the plaintiff, deliberately made, in writing, for the express purpose of being used as evidence on the trial of the cause. It was wholly unnecessary to call on the subscribing witnesses to testify to what was admitted to be true, or to produce the original, when that was expressly waived.

Independent of the words of confirmation operating on the seizin in fact of the four sons, the recital contained in the instrument, to the effect that the Rancho of San Antonio had been disposed of to them by a gift <em>inter </em>vivos, estops Luis Peralta, his heirs or devisees to deny the gift or alienation. <em>(Salter </em>v.

J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">This is an action of ejectment to recover five undivided ninths of a tract of land in the city of Oakland. Both parties deraign title from Luis Peralta, deceased, to whom the land was originally granted by the Mexican Government. The plaintiff claims under conveyances from certain of the heirs at law of Peralta, and the defendant under an instrument purporting to be a will executed by Peralta on the twenty-ninth of April, 1851. This instrument, after reciting that he, Peralta, had already portioned out to his sons their respective lands, contains the following clause: <em>\u201c </em>I declare that these lands comprehend all my property of the Rancho de San Antonio, the title of whose concession and possession is in the hands of my son Ygnacio, and which lands I have already divided among my sons as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>a donation <em>inter vivos, </em>to their entire satisfaction, and which donation by these presents I do hereby ratify.\u201d The grounds upon which the defendant bases his claim to a title are: <em>Mrst, </em>an estoppel growing out of these recitals; and, <em>second, </em>the ratification contained in this clause. In our view, the title is perfect upon either ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The case of <em>Denn </em>v. <em>Cornell </em>(3 John. Ca. 174) is directly in point upon the question of estoppel. The action was ejectment, the plaintiff claiming, as in this case, under a conveyance from the heir at law, and the defendant under a will containing a clause in these words: \u201c And whereas I have conveyed to my son Cadwallader my lands at Coldenham, and to my son David my lands in the township of Flushing, I give and devise all my remaining lands,\u201d etc. The suit was brought to recover the lands referred to as having been conveyed <em>to </em>David, whose title had been acquired by the defendant. \u201c I consider,\u201d said the learned Judge who delivered the opinion of the court, \u201c that the heir of the testator is estopped by the recital in the will, to deny that the premises were conveyed to David. It is an act of his ancestor, to whom he is a privy.\u201d After referring to a number of authorities, and particularly to the ease of <em>Shelley </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>(Willes\u2019 R. 9) he proceeded as follows: \u201cFrom these authorities the Court concluded, in that case, that the defendant was estopped by the recital in a bond of a particular fact, from denying that fact. In the present case, the will contains a recital of a particular fact, viz: that he had conveyed the premises in question to David. By this recital the lessor of the plaintiff is estopped, as heir to the testator, from denying that the testator conveyed the premises to his son David.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">It is impossible to distinguish that case, in any of its material features, from the case at bar. Here the recitals are also of particular facts, and there is no doubt that the two cases stand substantially upon the same footing. The difference between them is merely verbal, and there is not a plausible reason in favor of an estoppel in the case cited which does not apply with equal force in this. In that case the will recited the fact of a conveyance, and the difference is that in this it recites an apportionment and donation. If the word conveyance had been used instead of donation, the analogy would be complete, and we think the effect is the same, not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>withstanding this difference in the use of terms. Nothing could have been meant by a donation but a gift in accordance with the apportionment, and the necessary intendment is that this gift had been consummated in such a manner as to render it legal and valid. This is undoubtedly the proper construction, and our opinion is that the heirs at law, and all persons claiming under them, are estopped from denying that a title had passed in conformity with the recitals in the will. In this view of the case, it is immaterial whether the instrument, although it purports to be a will, is operative for testamentary purposes or not. It is executed with all the formalities required in the execution of a deed, and it was admissible in evidence without regard to its testamentary character.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Upon the question of ratification we entertain the same opinion of the merits of the controversy, but it is unnecessary to dwell upon this point. The language used was equivalent to saying, I have given these lands in certain proportions to my sons, and I hereby confirm and ratify the gift. There is no doubt that this was sufficient to pass the title, and it is clear that a testamentary disposition was not contemplated. The intention was to vest the title immediately in the sons, and it is of no consequence that the instrument professes on its face to be a will. The same instrument may operate both as a conveyance and as a will or devise, in regard to different pieces of property. <em>(Robinson </em>v. Schly, 6 Georgia, 515.)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\"><em>H. W. Carpentier, Wm. H. Patterson </em>and <em>A. A. </em>Cohen, on behalf of appellant, filed separate petitions for rehearing, mainly to the point that the record shows that the will of Peralta was not admitted in evidence, and that this Court erred in passing upon the construction of the will; counsel insisting that the will was offered and admitted in the Court below as a regularly probated instrument, and not as an original deed or instrument; that consequently their objections were to it as a probate record, and that if it had been offered as a deed of confirmation of a previous gift, appellant would have met it by proof, <em>first, </em>that Peralta was <em>non cbmpos mentis </em>at its execution, and, <em>second, </em>that its \u201c <em>donatio inter vivos </em>\u201d was upon conditions which had been broken by the donees.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>On this petition, Cope, J., delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014 Field, C. J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">We see no' ground upon which to grant a rehearing in this case. There is no foundation in the record for the position that the will of Peralta was not admitted in evidence. The only question raised by the appellant in the Court below seems to have been in regard to its admissibility as a probated instrument. In our view of the case, that question was entirely irrelevant, and the character of the instrument for testamentary purposes is immaterial. The only matters that we regard as properly before us were passed upon in our previous opinion, and we have no doubt of the correctness of the conclusion arrived at. The suggestions of counsel in reference to the validity of the instrument may all be true, but they have lost the opportunity to show that fact in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
