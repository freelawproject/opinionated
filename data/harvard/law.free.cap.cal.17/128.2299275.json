As part of these improvements, plaintiff was to place on the lot a small frame house, which he had previously constructed, and make certain additions thereto; and for the house plaintiff tvas to receive a certain sum. Plaintiff complied with his agreement, and defendant gave his note for the amount due: <em>Held, </em>that although the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act does not probably afford a lien for the. price of a building already constructed, and then sold to be put on a lot, still, as in this case the building sold was to constitute part of a larger structure, the erection of which was provided for by the agreement, and as it was used in accordance with the provisions of the agreement, it may be regarded as material furnished for that purpose, and hence within the statute giving a lien.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Appeal from the Sixth District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-4\">After plaintiff had complied with the agreement stated in the opinion of the Court, defendant Meeks executed to him a note for six hundred and twenty-five dollars and seventy-eight cents, as the amount due for the small frame house and the other improvements\u2014 the sum agreed on for the house being two hundred and seventy-five dollars. To secure this note, plaintiff, on the fifteenth day of October, 1858, filed his notice of lien, as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-5\">\u201c To all whom it may concern, and particularly W. Meeks, will take notice that I, John M. Selden, of the city and county of Sacramento, State of California, do claim a lien on that part of lot, etc., * * * * Said lien is to secure the performance of a contract for the payment of six hundred and twenty-five dollars and seventy-eight cents, as specified by note, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-6\">\u201c$625.78.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-7\">\u201c Twelve months after date, I promise to pay John M.

Plaintiff\u2019s work was completed before this sale to Stewart.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-15\">The case was tried by the Court, and a decree rendered for a sale of the premises, out of which the lien of plaintiff was to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>first satisfied, and then the mortgage of intervenor, who appeals from so much of the decree as gives plaintiff a lien.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-4\"><em>George Cadwalader, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-5\">I. To illustrate the error of the Court below, I assume, as law, \u201c that the owner of an old house selling the same for two hundred and twenty-five dollars, and removing it to the lot of the vendee, cannot secure a mechanics\u2019 lien for its value, although he is a mechanic.\u201d (Section 1st of Mechanics' Lien Act.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-6\">The vendor of an old house cannot secure a mechanics\u2019 lien for its value; for he is not within the words or intention of the statute. If so, every time the house is sold, a new lien has origin.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-7\">The lien law affords protection to two classes of men\u2014the material man, and the labor man; for, in the language of the first section, \u201c the work and labor done or material furnished by each respectively.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-8\">The vendor of old houses is not protected any more than the vendor of old boots, by the mechanics\u2019 lien law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-9\">This invalidates two hundred and seventy-five dollars of the lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-10\">II. A lien cannot be held good of which thirty per cent, is false. \u201c <em>Falso in unofalsus in </em>omnibus,\u201d is the maxim. The false element destroys it\u2014the whole falls, and the lien is bad <em>in toto.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-11\">II. The lien is bad, inasmuch as it fails to show\u20141st, an account, or the balance of an account, or that the contract was in gross. <em>(Heston </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>11 Cal. 41); 2d, because it fails to show that the materials were furnished expressly for the building. <em>(Bottomly </em>v. <em>Grace Church, </em>2 Cal. <em>90; Houghton </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>5 Id. 240; <em>McAlpin </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>16 Id.)<em>; </em>3d, it does not show that no offsets existed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-12\"><em>Clark </em>&amp; <em>Gass, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-13\">I. We do not combat the proposition that if A owns a frame building and sells it upon credit and parts with it, he can have no lien upon that building for the purchase money. But that is not this case. Under the agreement between Selden and Meeks, the frame building, when incorporated into the building on Meeks\u2019 lot, constituted a portion of the material furnished by plaintiffs for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>building. For the purposes of a lieu, it is immaterial whether timber of which this frame house was made was worked up into a frame on the lot, or before it was taken there. In either case, it was a portion, and only a portion of the structure for the erection of which the lien is claimed. The gist of the contract between Selden and Meeks was not the sale of this frame house, but that the former should erect a building upon the latter\u2019s lot, into which building this frame house should be worked as a part.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b131-4\">Cope, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"Abx\">Field, C. J. and Baldwin, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The questions in this case arise upon the following facts: The defendant Meeks employed the plaintiff, who is a mechanic, to erect certain improvements upon a lot owned by the former in the city of Sacramento. As a part of these improvements, the plaintiff was to place upon the lot a small frame house, which he had previously constructed, and make certain additions thereto. The other improvements were to consist of out houses, fences, etc. The plaintiff was to receive for the house the sum of two hundred and seventy-five dollars. The agreement was fully complied with on his part, and Meeks executed to him a promissory note for the amount due. The object of this suit is to enforce a lien upon the property for the amount of this note.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The objections to the notice are technical, and unsubstantial. In <em>Brennan </em>v. Swasey, (16 Cal. 140) we held that it was unnecessary to set out the items of the account, and that nothing more was required than a statement of the demand, showing its amount and character. The only question in the case about which there can be any doubt is, whether the plaintiff was entitled to a lien for the price of the building constructed prior to the agreement. The language of the statute is, that \u201c all artisans, builders, mechanics, lumber merchants, and all other persons performing labor or furnishing materials for the construction or repairing of any building, wharf or other superstructure, shall have a lien,\u201d etc. It is contended that this language is not sufficiently broad to include the sale of a building already constructed, and with that opinion, as expressed, we are inclined to agree. But there are other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>circumstances in this case which we think are sufficient to bring it within the terms of the statute. The building sold was to constitute part of a larger structure, the erection of which was provided for by the agreement. It was used in accordance with the provisions of the contract, and may with propriety be regarded as material furnished for that purpose. This, we think, is a reasonable view of the subject, and no violence is done to the letter or spirit of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
