Motion denied, and the case proceeded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-4\">It appeared in proof that defendant\u2019s cattle were Spanish cattle, and permitted to roam at large on the south side of plaintiff\u2019s land, which was fenced on three sides, the fourth side being bounded by a steep bluff on the ocean. The fence on the south side was made by a ditch three or four feet wide, three feet deep, with posts eight feet apart on the inner edge of the embankment thrown up by digging the ditch, and two rails, leaving the ditch on the outside of the fence. The distance from the outside of the ditch to the top rail was seven feet, and from the bottom of the ditch to the top rail five or six feet. One witness, to whom the Statute of 1855 as to lawful fences was read, stated, defendants excepting, that plaintiff\u2019s fence was as strong and substantial as that named in the statute. Another witness stated that twenty feet of the fence on the south side was not three feet high ; and another that in some places the fence had been broken down and patched up. Defendants\u2019 counsel asked the Court to instruct the jury, in effect, that if defendants\u2019 cattle entered on plaintiff\u2019s land where the fence was of lawful height, still plaintiff could not recover if any part of his inclosure was under the statute height. Refused. Verdict for defendants, judgment accordingly. Plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-5\"><em>J. J. </em>Papy, for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-6\">I. The answers are insufficient. <em>(Hensley </em>v. <em>Tartar, </em>14 Cal. 508; 9 Id. 59, 453; Id. 37, 38; <em>Blankman </em>v. <em>Vallejo, </em>15 Id.; <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Wetmore, </em>16 Id. 379; <em>Kuhland </em>v. <em>Sedgwick, infra.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-7\">II. The verdict is contrary to the evidence. The defendants were bound so to keep their cattle as to prevent them from destroying their neighbor\u2019s growing crops. Our statute relative to lawful fences applies only to fences along a highway where a person has a right to have his cattle pass from one point to another. But the owner of cattle cannot turn them into a highway for pasture. (16 Mass. 33; 19 Johns. 385; 2 H.
