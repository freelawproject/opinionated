The complaint alleged that there were creditors in fact, and prayed relief for them as well as for Meyer. It is not supposed that Meyer, by adopting this form of declaring, necessarily implicated the creditors as parties, but it gave them an opportunity to become such in their election. When they, under the provisions of the decree, went before the Referee and submitted their claims to him, they became parties to the suit as fully as though they had voluntarily joined with Meyer in the first instance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-12\">3d.

An issue was or might have been taken upon the question of its existence, as a claim, and was in fact taken upon the question of its amount. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Proofs were taken with the customary solemnities, and the Referee found, that is, \u201c determined,\u201d that Kalkman &amp; Co. were absolutely indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum of 14,632.24, and in a larger sum should the plaintiffs hereafter elect to do a certain thing, which they have never done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-4\">4th. By the definition in question, the <em>\u201c </em>determination \u201d on the rights of parties to \"the action must be \u201c final.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-5\">What is the meaning of the term \u201c final,\u201d as used in the definition in hand ? We submit, that it means final <em>in effect, </em>and not final in view of the familiar classification of judgments into interlocutory and final. This latter distinction goes entirely upon the relative position of the judgments in the general chain of the proceedings, as that the one comes before the other, or comes between the commencement and close of the action, and the other at the end of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-6\">This classification of judgments into interlocutory and final does not proceed to any extent upon the effect of those judgments respectively, considered as adjudications upon the matters which they respectively involve. (3 Blk. Com. 396-7.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-7\">Row, does the word \u201c final,\u201d as it is used in the one hundred and forty-fourth section of the Practice Act, mean final with reference to the place, or final with reference to effect ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-8\">The section itself furnishes an answer to this question, for the \u201c final determination \u201d spoken of is to be of \u201c rights.\u201d Thus \u201c rights \u201d are made the subject matter upon which the determination is to act, and if the determination, in effect, concludes the right, then it is a final determination of the right of necessity, and at once takes on the full statute impression of a judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-9\">The decree in <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Kalkman </em>established, as by judgment, the existence of the firm of P. Kalkman &amp; Co.; that the plaintiff and defendant were members of and constituted the firm; that Kalkman had, in sundry particulars, violated the partnership contract ; that there were partnership creditors; and that the firm was in fact insolvent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-10\">The decree was not only final, in effect, to establish the truth of the allegations in the bill, but was so comprehensive in its directions for the future, and in its provisions for the relief of those who were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the parties, or who, as creditors, might thereafter become such, as to supersede the necessity of any further directions or provisions remedial to the rights to be redressed. The decree, therefore, was not only final in effect, but was final also by position. No other decree was ever entered in the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-4\">Thus the decree, in both, the meanings of the word \u201c final,\u201d determines that P. Kalkman &amp; Co., on the sixth of May, 1856, were absolutely indebted to Jesse Seligman <em>et al. </em>in the sum of |4,682.24. Whether the Seligmans were or were not creditors, and if creditors, then to what extent, were matters \u201c directly in issue \u201d before the Referee. They were not brought into the controversy \u201c incidentally\u201d during the trial, for the controversy, in the proportions which the complaint gave to it, comprehended all the creditors,|with their claims. The theory of the action could be fulfilled only by a trial and determination of those claims, and of the precise' amount of each. So far as the creditors were concerned, the ultimate relief was full payment or a dividend, but in either event it was absolutely indispensable that it should be judicially ascertained and judicially determined who were creditors, and the exact amount of their several claims. Therefore, those questions were not \u201c incidental.\u201d The \u201c allegations\u201d of the creditors before the Referee were \u201c material and traversable,\u201d and therefore the determination on those allegations was \u201c final and conclusive.\u201d The fact that plaintiffs were absolute creditors to the extent of $4,632.24, is not left to be \u201cinferred by argument from the judgment,\u201d but is one of the express determinations of the report and of the decree that adopts it. (I. G. Ev. sec. 528.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-5\">The result is, that the record offered in evidence shows a \u201c determination \u201d that Jesse Seligman <em>et al., </em>\u201c parties to the action \u201d of <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Kalkman, </em>were by \u201c right \u201d creditors of P. Kalkman &amp; Co. in the sum of $4,632.24, and discloses all the grounds essential by the rule of common law to invest that determination with the remaining quality of \u201cfinalty.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-6\">It may be added, that the case is fully within the policy upon which the rule of <em>res adjudieatce </em>proceeds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-7\">It may be added further, that it is of no moment that the plaintiffs could not have had execution on the alleged judgment. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>possibility of an execution issuing is not made a feature in the statute definition of the term \u201cjudgment.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-4\">Nor was this feature necessary at common law. <em>(Dubois </em>v. <em>Dubois, </em>6 Cow. 494; <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Qabill, </em>4 Yt. 556 ; 6 Cal. 666 ; 7 Id. 228.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">The term judgment is, under the statute, synonymous with the term \u201c adjudication.\u201d The modes of enforcing an adjudication are distinct from the adjudication itself, forming no part of its essential constitution. <em>(Ileydenfeldt </em>v. <em>Towns, </em>27 Ala. 423; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Q-ayle, </em>20 Id. 825; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>1 Hill\u2019s Ch. R. 297; and see also, <em>Hardwick </em>v. <em>Hooks, </em>8 Geo. 354; <em>Danington </em>v. <em>Borland, </em>3 Port. 35.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">It may be added further, that any creditor proving before the Referee in <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Kalkman, </em>and dissatisfied with the determination upon his claim, either as to the existence or amount of it, might have moved for a new trial, or have appealed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-7\">It may be further named, that if the action had been framed directly upon the facts which we offered to .prove, the defendants would have been estopped from denying that the plaintiffs were their creditors, and to the extent stated in the Referee\u2019s report. But why ? Obviously, for the reason that there had been an adjudication upon both those questions. But \u201c adjudication \u201d and \u201cjudgment \u201d are synonymous. Hor was it necessary to detail the facts at length. Under the rules of pleading it is not necessary to set forth records and written instruments at large; they may be declared on according to their legal effect. Therefore, if the record offered in evidence exhibited an adjudication or judgment in legal effect, then the complaint is properly framed, and the plaintiffs are entitled to the full benefit of the estoppel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-8\">The question, then, comes to this: The plaintiffs have an admitted right; it can be enforced only by action. In an action properly brought, would not the record in <em>Meyer </em>y. <em>Kalkman </em>estop the defendants from denying the indebtedness which the record discloses ? If it would not have the full effect of an estoppel, it is clear that it could have no effect whatever as an instrument of evidence; and to say this is subversive at once of the plainest rules in the law of evidence, and of the policy upon which they proceed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>An action of debt will lie on a chancery judgment. <em>(M'Kim </em>v. <em>Odon, </em>3 Fairfield, 94; <em>Post </em>v. Neafie, 3 Carnes, 22; <em>Thrall </em>v. <em>Weller, </em>13 Vt. 231.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-4\"><em>Sidney V. </em>Smith, for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-5\">There was no judgment entered at any time in the Superior Court of the city of San Francisco, in the suit brought by Chas. T. Meyer against Philip Kalkman, which created any personal liability on the part of either the plaintiff or defendant in that suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-6\">I. By section one hundred and forty-seven of the Practice Act, the relief granted, if there be no answer, shall not exceed that which is demanded in the complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-7\">The judgment or decree of May 6th, 1856, was entered upon the default of the defendant Kalkman in not answering.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-8\">The Court, therefore, had no power to grant any relief beyond what was asked by the complaint in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-9\">All that the complaint prayed was a dissolution, an account, a Receiver, and that the assets of the firm should be ratably distributed among the creditors; and the judgment does not pretend to go farther than this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-10\">II. The action of <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Kalkman </em>was a mixed action; it was <em>in personam </em>as between Meyer and Kalkman; it was <em>in rem </em>so far as the creditors of the firm of Kalkman &amp; Co. were concerned. It was <em>in personam </em>as to Kalkman, because it sought a dissolution of copartnership. It was <em>in rem </em>as to the creditors, because it demanded that the assets of that copartnership should be distributed among the creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-11\">The creditors were merely brought in that they might prove their debts\u2014not as against Meyer or Kalkman, but as against the fund in the hands of the Court; and the reference was to ascertain who were the creditors and what were the sums respectively due to them\u2014not in order that the Court might order the payment of those sums by Meyer or Kalkman, but merely that the Court might thereby be enabled to discover what was the <em>status </em>of the subject matter of the action, so far as respected the creditors\u2014which subject matter was the fund\u2014and thus direct its distribution according to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Mow, in the action <em>in </em>personam, the Court by its judgment determined that Meyer was entitled to a dissolution of the copartnership existing between him and Kalkman; and as to the action <em>in </em>rem, it determined that the assets should be distributed among the creditors of the firm. The rights of the parties to the action were, therefore, settled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-4\">The argument of the appellants, if it amounts to anything, is just this; That <em>every </em>final judgment or decree creates a personal liability. If this doctrine be true, then upon every decree <em>in rem </em>an action may be brought <em>in personam.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-5\">The cases in 6 Cow. 494; 4 Vt. 556; and 6 Cal. 666, cited by appellants, have no application.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-6\">The respondents fully admit the conclusiveness of the judgment of May 6th, 1856, but they deny it in the sense and to the extent that is claimed for it by appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-7\">It is conclusive only in one respect: it puts at rest forever the question whether the appellants had any right to distribution of the funds in Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-8\">A judgment to be conclusive must be mutual in its operation. (1 Greenl. Ev. sec. 524.) To test, therefore, the conclusiveness of the decree of May 6th, 1856, in the sense in which the appellants insist on, let it be supposed that Seligman &amp; Co., instead of suing as they have done, had sued for the value of the goods sold and delivered by them to Kalkman &amp; Co. Could Kalkman &amp; Co. have pleaded in bar of the action that Seligman &amp; Co. had obtained a prior judgment against them, and as evidence of it have relied on the decree of May 6th, and the proceedings subsequent thereto ? Would not the reply have been : That judgment was not a judgment against you; it did not enable us to have execution against you or your property ; it was useless to us, except so far as it decided that we were entitled to have our distributive share of the fund which was in Court, and we have not out of that fund received the whole of our debt ? And tvould not such a reply have been a complete answer to such a plea in bar ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-9\">In <em>Mohler's appeal </em>(8 Barr, 31) the Court say: \u201c It is alleged that judgment has been had for the arrear of rent now claimed, at least in part <em>de terris ; </em>that this is a bar to a proceeding to charge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>alienee <em>personally. </em>If the land was of value to levy the money by sale, there would be no necessity for this proceeding; but as it is notoriously otherwise, the parties are compelled to invoke the aid of the Orphans\u2019 Court. A judgment <em>in rem, </em>without satisfaction, is no bar. The remedies are cumulative, even if an action lies at common law.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b162-4\">Cope, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"APM\">Field, C. J. and Baldwin, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The evidence in this case was not sufficient to maintain the action. It was necessary for the plaintiffs to show a personal judgment to entitle them ib recover; and the record in <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Kalkman </em>was insufficient for that purpose. The action in that case was for the settlement of a partnership and a distribution of the assets for the benefit of creditors. A judgment was entered, dissolving the partnership and directing an account. The plaintiffs were creditors, and the Referee who took the account reported in their favor the amount sued for'in this case. An order was made confirming the report^ and directing a distribution of the assets upon the basis therein established. We see nothing in these proceedings which can be regarded as amounting to a personal judgment. Such a judgment would have been foreign to the purposes of the suit, and the relief granted was confined to these purposes. If it had been the intention to go further, and bind the defendants by a personal judgment, such intention would doubtless have been expressed in some legitimate and proper form. We think that the mere ascertainment of the indebtedness for the purpose of enabling the Court to make a proper distribution of the assets, cannot be regarded as a judgment <em>in personam </em>for the amount of such indebtedness. Something is due to the forms of the law in this respect; and while no particular words are necessary to constitute a judgment, enough should appear to indicate the intention of the Court to grant the relief which the judgment is relied upon as securing.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
