B. Meech &amp; Co., were owners of the brig Tallahassee, which, on the eighth day of August, 1837, was lying-in the port of Philadelphia. They effected with the defendants an insurance of two thousand dollars upon the freight of the said brig \u201c at and from Philadelphia to Tampico; at and from thence to Laguna or Campeachy; and at and from either, to Philadelphia or New York;\u201d and paid to the insurers the sum of eighty-one dollars, being four per cent, on the amount insured, and one dollar for the policy.

On the 12th day of August, 1837, a charter-party, (a copy of which is hereto appended,) ivas entered into between the plaintiffs, A. B. Mleech &amp; Co., owners of the brig Tallahassee, by their agent, her captain, Edward Walford, and one Edward W.

When off the coast of Mexico, by stress of weather, she was wrecked: a total abandonment took place, of which the defendant received and accepted notice, on the 11th of November, 1837; and the vessel and cargo were sold for the account and benefit of the underwriters. The brig did not reach Tampico, her outward port of destination; and under these facts, the-questions presented for decision are, 1st. Was the policy on the freight an open or valued policy ? 2nd.

Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AnJ\">It is immaterial whether the policy be regarded as valued or open, because the amount to be recovered will be the same. It would seem, however, to be an open one; for it will scarce be thought,' that had the outward freight been earned and paid, as it might have been by the terms of the charter-party, it could have been demanded of-the defendant. Yet there was but a single voyage- for purposes of insurance. It is described as such even in the charter-party, and the freight for it is specified in a gross sum. That part of this sum was to be advanced on performing part of the voyage, may have modified the law of the contract as to earning and payment of it; but it cannot be suffered to divide its very essence, when no division was intended. No part of the freight was earned; and the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment for the sum covenanted to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
