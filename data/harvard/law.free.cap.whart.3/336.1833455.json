Martin, late of the city aforesaid, merchant, was attached to answer John Still\u00e9, Jr., to the use of William T. Smith, of a plea of trespass in the case, &amp;c. And thereupon the said John, by C. Ingersoll, his attorney, complains, that whereas heretofore, to wit, on the first day of September, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and thirty-four, at the city aforesaid, he was possessed of one hundred and ten shares of the stock of the West Philadelphia Canal Company, then standing in his name on the books of the said company, and the said John, being so possessed thereof afterwards, to wit, on the day and year aforesaid, at the city aforesaid, at the special instance and request of the said Robert, did sell to him, the said Robert, the said shares of stock at and for the price or sum of five hundred dollars, and then and there promised the said Robert, that he would transfer the said shares of stock to him, the said Robert, on the books of the said company, upon payment by the said Robert of the said price or sum for the same, when he the said John should be thereto afterwards requested. And in consideration of the premises the said Robert then and there promised the said John to accept the said shares of stock, and to pay for the same the price *or sum aforesaid, when he the said Robert should be thereunto afterwards requested.

And the said plaintiff, further relying on the said information and assurance of the said defendant, so to him communicated as aforesaid, did on the 'day and year aforesaid, at the county aforesaid, sue and prosecute in the District Court, for the City and County of Philadelphia, an action against the supposed purchasers of the said stock, namely, Augustin Stevenson, Benjamin E. Carpenter, Joseph L. Thomas, and Edwin T. Scott, to recover from them the amount by the said plaintiff supposed to be due. by them to him under the said supposed purchase of the said stock, in which action the said plaintiff was then and there forced and obliged to suffer a judgment to be rendered in favour of the said supposed purchasers, namely, Augustin Stevenson, Benjamin E. Carpenter, Joseph L. Thomas, and Edwin T. Scott, and against him the said plaintiff, and the' sa^ Action -was wholly abortive and of no avail to the said plaintiff, and he was forced and obliged to incur and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>pay therein a large sum of money, to wit, the sum of one hundred dollars for his costs and charges, and counsel fee, in and about the prosecution of the said action, and by means of the premises in this count mentioned, the said plaintiff hath lost and been deprived of the said stock, and hath also incurred and paid large costs and charges, to wit, the sum of two hundred dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-6\">The defendant pleaded <em>non-assumpsit; </em>and on this issue the cause came on for trial before Jones, J. on the 27th of April, 1837, when the nominal plaintiff Still\u00e9, was offered as a witness. It appeared by an instrument produced, that on the 7th day of January, 1834, and before the commencement of the action, he had assigned his claim or cause of action to William T. Smith, in consideration of .one dollar. The subscribing witness to this assignment, having proved its execution, said, on the cross-examination, \u201cI don\u2019t know that William T. Smith was present at the time I saw Mr. Still\u00e9 sign the paper. It was signed at Still\u00e9\u2019s office. I am sure I saw him sign it. I don\u2019t remember to have seen any consideration pass.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-7\">The counsel for the defendant objected to the admission of Mr. Still\u00e9 as a witness, on the ground that he had not been released by Smith. The learned judge, however, overruled the objection, and the witness was sworn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-8\">It appeared from the evidence that Mr. Still\u00e9 was the owner in 1832, of one hundred and ten shares of the West Philadelphia Canal Company, of which company the defendant was treasurer. The defendant kept an office as a broker, and was told by Mr. Still\u00e9 that he was willing to sell his stock at a certain price. A few days afterwards the defendant told him that he had sold the stock, and that he would call and give him the names of the persons to whom it was to be transferred. He did not call at the time appointed, but at a subsequent day, told the plaintiff that the proposed purchasers had not made up their minds. The plaintiff insisting that the bargain had been concluded, the defendant gave the names of certain persons as his principals. The plaintiff then gave them notice that he would transfer the stock and hold them responsible. Afterwards he caused the stock to be sold at auction, and brought suit against them to recover the difference between the proceeds at auction and the price bargained for. On the trial before arbitrators, Martin the present defendant, was examined -as a witness for the plaintiff, but he denying that they had authorised him to purchase the stock for them, the plaintiff failed in his action. In the course of his examination, Mr. Still\u00e9 said that he made a *gift of the claim to William T. Smith, and that no consideration passed for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The counsel for the defendant requested the judge to charge the jury on the following points, viz.\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-6\">\u201c 1. That even if there be evidence that the defendant told Mr. Still\u00e9 that he had sold his stock to Stevenson, Scott, Carpenter, and Thomas, when in truth he had not, such evidence will not authorise the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff under the pleadings in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">2. That the statement on oath of the defendant before the arbitrators in the action <em>Stille </em>v. <em>Stephenson, et al. </em>June, 1832, No. 549, is evidence in this action to contradict the evidence of Mr. Still\u00e9.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-8\">The judge, however, charged the jury in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-9\">\u201c This is an action brought for the breach of a contract. The plaintiff alleges that he sold to the defendant one hundred and ten shares of the West Philadelphia Canal Stock for five hundred dollars \u2014 that he offered to transfer the stock in fulfilment of the contract, and the defendant refused to accept and pay for it. He also alleges that he was obliged to sell the stock at public auction and that it produced forty-eight dollars only. The action in fact is brought for refusing to accept and pay for the stock according to the alleged agreement of the defendant. The plaintiff must therefore prove, 1. The contract for the sale of the stock. 2. That he was ready and offered to deliver the stock according to the contract. 3. That the defendant refused to accept and pay for the stock according to his part of the contract. 4. Having proved these facts, he would be entitled to damages for the breach of the contract. The circumstances of this case are somewhat special. The transaction does not appear to be the ordinary contract of a sale, where the parties acting professedly on their own account, one contracts to sell and the other contracts to buy the article. Mr. Martin, it seems, was the treasurer of the West Philadelphia Canal Company. Mr. Still\u00e9, (in whose name the action is \u2019brought, for the use of Mr. William T. Smith,) was in the habit of calling at the office of Mr. Martin, to inquire about the stock of this company. On one occasion he said to the defendant that he would take five hundred dollars for his stock. A few days after, the defendant called on him and told him he had sold it, and appointed a time for the transfer. The time for the transfer was afterwards postponed, on the defendant\u2019s request, from Monday until Thursday of the same week. On Thursday, the defendant told Mr. Still\u00e9 that the refused to take it, and he then gave up their names. *The plaintiff further that Mr. Martin acted in this matter without authority from the persons whose names he had given as purchasers, and this fact, he says, appears by Mr. Martin\u2019s own declaration. The defendant, on the other hand, contends that he was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>agent of Mr. Still\u00e9 to sell this stock \u2014 that it was not his fault that the purchasers did not accept it \u2014 that at all events the plaintiff cannot maintain this action, but he should have brought an action for deceit. The first thing to be determined is, what was the contract between Mr. Still\u00e9 and Mr. Martin, in point of fact. This is for you to determine. The second consideration is, what is the legal effect of the contract. As the parties differ as to the facts, I am obliged to state to you what the law is upon either view of the case. In the first place, then, if Mr. Still\u00e9. agreed with Mr. Martin to act for him as broker and sell this stock for him if he could find a purchaser, the plaintiff cannot recover in this action. The reason is, the plaintiff has alleged a sale of the stock to the defendant, whereas the contract upon this supposition was an entirely different one. But if you should find the fact to be, that Mr. Martin acted generally, and on his own account, and closed a bargain for the stock with Mr. Still\u00e9, he would be liable, although he might have said to Mr. Still\u00e9 that he was buying it for other persons. An agent may make himself responsible, personally, on his contracts, and if such was the understanding of the parties he may be treated as a purchaser. But suppose you should find from the evidence that Mr. Martin, not professing to purchase on his own account, represented himself as acting for and as having authority from third persons and as such closed the contract, when in point of fact he had n.o authority from those persons to purchase it. In this view of the facts, he would be personally liable. For in such case the owner of the stock has a right to hold to the bargain and get the benefit of it from somebody; and .the agent having-made the bargain without authority, is the only person to whom the vendor of the stock can look. Such a case would be different from that of an agent acting with authority and within his authority for a known responsible person or for persons whose names he gives up at or before the time the contract is to be executed. You will perceive the difference between the two cases and the reasonableness, not to say the necessity of making a distinction between cases where an agent makes a bargain without authority and with authority. If, then, you believe that Mr. Martin did close a bargain for the purchase of this stock under pretence of authority from third persons whose names he afterwards gave up to Mr. Still\u00e9, when in truth he had no authority from them, he is liable. Nor would it make any difference if Mr. Martin supposed he'had authority from Messrs. Carpenter, Stevenson, Scott and Thomas. He was bound to see to it that he was authorised, and if he closed a bargain with Mr. Still\u00e9 under a mistake of his own powers, Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>* Still\u00e9 may nevertheless insist upon the bargain. Nor -would Mr. Still\u00e9\u2019s claim be prejudiced by the proceeding against Messrs. Stevenson, Carpenter, Scott, and Thomas. <em>A </em>man who contracts with an agent may sometimes have an action against the agent and the principal. ' In such a case as this is alleged to be by the plaintiff, it might be impossible to know whether the agent had authority or not before suit brought and trial against the supposed principal. The law, however, did not require it of Mr. Still\u00e9 to give notice to Mr. Martin that he held him responsible, when he commenced proceedings against Messrs. Stevenson and others. These are all the questions of law which have been discussed. With these principles in view you will settle the case. The questions of fact are those which I have stated. Two questions have been proposed, upon which an opinion is requested. (Here the judge read them.) The first of these questions I have sufficiently answered. As to the second question, the evidence before us is that Mr. Martin did testify before the arbitrators to certain facts; and that he did so testify is a fact 'in this cause. It was admitted without objection. But Mr. Martin cannot be considered a witness in this cause, nor can what he there said be treated as testimony in this cause, but only the fact that Mr. Martin did on oath or affirmation before the arbitrators make a statement of certain matters in the manner stated by Mr. Still\u00e9 and Dr. Thomas. What Mr. Martin said on that occasion is to be considered in respect to this cause merely as a declaration made upon the occasion referred to by the witnesses, Mr. Still\u00e9 and Dr. Thomas.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-6\">The jury found for the plaintiff; and the defendant having-taken a bill of exceptions, sued out a writ of error, and on the return of the record filed the following specifications.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-7\">\u201c1.

Supposing this to be the case, the question arises whether there is a misjoinder' of different actions. The rule is now settled, that different counts may be joined in one action, either when the same plea may be pleaded and the same judgment given, on all the counts of the declaration, or when the counts are of the same nature, and the same judgment is to be given on them all. 1 Chitty\u2019s Plead.. 197.

If the additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>counts added to their allegation of a promise and undertaking by the defendant, matters founded on negligence and tort, and advantage could be taken thereof by the defendant, it could only be by sp\u2019ecial demurrer for informality, as was held in <em>White </em>v. <em>Risden, </em>(Cro. Car. 20.) After verdict it is sufficient that they concur with the original declaration in stating a contract. There is, therefore in this case no misjoinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">There is nothing in the other error relied on, of the admission of Mr. Still\u00e9 as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"pAEH\">Cited by Counsel, 5 447 5 Watts &amp; 509 7 Id. 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Overruled as to the competency of the witness, 6 Barr, 326; see also, .4 Watts, 254; 5 Watts <em>&amp; </em>Sergeant, 510; 6 Id. 556 : 7 Id. 145 : 8 Id. 57 , 274: 1 Barr, 173, 365; 2 Id. 46, 427 ; 3 Id. 376 ; 7 Id. 326 : 10 Id. 430; 1 Harris, 110; 5 Id. 103 ; 7 Id. 177,193 ; 9 Id. 298, 476 ; 11 Id. 28; 2 Casey, 512; 11 Id. 457; 5 P.
