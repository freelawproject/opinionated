It was prepared in my office, and I think it was signed there. I have no recollection who was present. I presume Mr. Henniss and Mr. Page were there: there is no question about it. I was the counsel of John Henniss in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>transaction. I acted in the matter as the attorney of Mr. Henniss. At the time of the execution of the bond, there was, I think, $200 paid by Mr. John Page to Mr. Henniss ; and there were releases signed and executed by them both; this is one of the releases. I think there were two releases given to Henniss, one by John and.one by Samuel Page. My intention was to close the business forever. \u2019 Thefe was an agreement that all the claims which the two Pages had against Henniss should be released and given up, and that Henniss should release John Page. The other $200 of the bond was the difference agreed upon to be due by Henniss to John Page. There was a note of Henniss\u2019s for $400 or $500, claimed by John Page. I don\u2019t know whether it was given up. Mr. Henniss agreed to give up the judgment in the District Court of 1812. Every thing was to be settled between them. I don\u2019t know in whose name the note of $400 or $500 was drawn. John Page held it. I don\u2019t think there was any thing said about Hermiss\u2019s releasing Samuel Page. At the time the bond was given, Mr. John Page said, \u201cNow you will go and buy another judgment against me:\u201d Henniss said, \u201c I will not buy any judgment against you; I will pay the bond when it becomes due.\u201d John Page said it was Samuel\u2019s money, the whole of the bond: that he, John, was very poor; that he had been ruined by the Rays. He acted, or professed to act, throughout the whole of this transaction,' as the agent of his son Samuel. I am not sure that I saw Samuel Page on this occasion. I think there was a release from him. He may have been present at the exeetion of the bond. I think he was some way connected with the note for $400 or 500. \u25a0 I thought it necessary for Samuel to execute the release. I had a claim against Samuel Page in the country, and could not get the money. It might have been the fault of the attorney. John Page and Samuel Page were both, I believe, insolvent. Samuel Page was brought to my office by his father more than once. I understood Samuel was a teacher: at that time he did tolerably well.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-7\">The plaintiff further gave in evidence a judgment in the District Court, in a suit to March term, 1812, by C.

Mr. Henniss paid me six months interest, and I settled with Mr. Page, giving him the balance. I don\u2019t recollect a receipt, but I have no doubt I took a receipt.

But if the jury are satisfied that the bond, at the time it was given, was the property of the plaintiff, although taken in the name of Samuel Page, and that the defendant knew it to be so, then the set-off should be disallowed, and the plaintiff have a verdict. Or if the jury find that at the time the bond was given, it was not strictly the plaintiff\u2019s property, yet if the defendant knew the truth, and made a compromise of other matters, with an understanding between the plaintiff and the defendant, growing out of and connected with the compromise, that the bond should be paid at all events when due; and that the defendant should not buy up or present another judgment as a set-off against it, then the jury ought not, in equity or justice, and consequently, in Pennsylvania, ought not in law, to allow the set-off.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-11\">The charge was excepted to ; and the jury having found for the plaintiff, the defendant removed the record to this Court, and assigned the following error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-12\">\u201c That the judge instructed the jury, that although the bond, at the time it was given, was not the plaintiff\u2019s property, and the defendant had no notice of its assignment until after he had acquired the judgment offered as a set-off, yet they might refuse to allow the set-off, and ought to do so.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aqf\">*Mr. <em>Graham, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiL\">cited <em>Lechmere </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>(2 Esp.

The defendant pleaded a set-off, and under .that plea gave in evidence a judgment, Eli Thomas v. John Hammond and Samuel Page; a <em>scire facias </em>to revive the same; and judgment, December 13th, 1834, against Samuel Page alone; and an assignment of the judgment, on the 3d of April, 1835, to the defendant. In avoidance of the set-off, the plaintiff proved, that at the time the bond was given, John Page said to Henniss, \u201c Now you will go and buy another judgment against me.\u201d Henniss said, \u201cI will not buy another judgment against you. I will pay <em>the bond </em>when it becomes due.\u201d It appears, from a previous part of the testimony, that the bond on which suit was brought was the result of a compromise of former conflicting claims, and a further advance of cash to the defendant, to the amount of two hundred dollars. It would seem, that the precaution was taken, because of a similar difficulty in which the plaintiff had been involved by the defendant. The contract, then, as I understand it, is, that the defendant agrees, that in consideration of a compromise, and of a further advance of money, he will not purchase another judgment so as to set it off against the bond in suit, but that he will pay the same, when it becomes due. The question is, whether the defendant is bound by this agreement. The contract is one which <em>may </em>materially affect the interest of the plaintiff; for his credit may depend upon the punctual payment of the money loaned, at the day. Why, therefore, he may not guard himself against this contingency, by such a stipulation, it is difficult to imagine, particularly as there is nothing in the contract either unfair, illegal, or contrary to public policy. The statutes of set-off are intended for the benefit and protection of defendants ; and it is grown up a maxim in the law, that a person may waive a statute intended for his benefit. <em>Quisqu\u00eds potest renunciare jure per seintroducto. </em>It is optional with defendants to avail themselves of the statutes of set-off; and if they choose to preclude themselves from this advantage, at the time, or by a previous agreement, why may they not be permitted to do so ? Each party consults his own interest in the agreement, and it is best ^eave Pities at full liberty to make their own contracts, unless opposed to some principle of policy or good morals. The argument assumes ground, may be the consideration or form of the agreement, whether written or parol, yet the defendant can insist on the set-off. Eor this position, the defendant relies on <em>Colson Assignee of </em>Hunter, (1 Esp. Rep. 378); <em>Lechmere </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>(2 Esp. Rep. 626); <em>Eland </em>v. <em>Kerr et al. </em>(1 East, 375); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Okey, </em>(13 Ves. 180); <em>Comfort </em>v. <em>Rivett, </em>(1 Maule &amp; Selw. 510); <em>The Assignees of English </em>v. <em>Simons, </em>(22 Com. Law Reps. 383). The two cases of <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Welsh, </em>(1 Esp. Rep. 378,) and <em>Lechmere </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>(2 Esp. Rep. 626,) which gave rise to the doctrine for which the defendant contends, were decided by Lord Kenyon, at Nisi Prius. In <em>Leehmere </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>Erskine contended, that the defendant could have no benefit of his set-off: that where a creditor borrowed money of his debtor, under an express promise to pay it, it bound him under every circumstance to the absolute payment; nor could his undertaking be satisfied by setting off the debt against his own demand. In answer to that argument, Lord Kenyon said, he knew no such law; nor did he think, there was any such legal obligation on the creditor; it might, be an honorary obligation, and such as a man who gave it ought to observe; but if he thought fit not to consider such an obligation as binding, he could not compel him. They were mutual subsisting demands at the time of the action brought, and such as the statutes of set-off gave the party defendant power to set off against the plaintiff\u2019s demand. Besides this, if he were to refuse the set-off here, it would drive the defendant into a Court of Equity, where the judgment obtained here would be set off against the debt admitted to be due by the plaintiff to the defendant. If, as Lord Kenyon supposed it was the case, of an honorary, and not a legal obligation, no person can question the soundness of the decision, nor that a Court of Equity would relieve the defendant. The decision must be based on the assumption, that the promise amounted to nothing more than what the law implies; for in every contract to pay money, it is implied, that it shall be paid in legal money; and no person. doubts, that in such cases, \u25a0a set-off is a legal defence. But if the promise was part and parcel of the contract, made for a consideration, and without which the contract would not have been made, it is something more than an honorary engagement; it is a legal obligation which a Court will enforce; and this was the opinion of the Court in <em>Eland </em>v. <em>Kerr. </em>The Court there held, that in estimating the plaintiff\u2019s damages, the jury would take into their consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the loss the plaintiff had sustained by the non-payment of the money; that is, that the jury would give damages for the breach of the contract, which could not be done, unless it was something more than an honorary engagement. The Lord Chancellor decided, in <em>Taylor </em>v. Okey, on the opinion of Lord Kenyon, as expressed in <em>Lechmere </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>*that a Court of would relieve a defendant. Now that a Court of Equity would relieve a person against his express agreement, thus in effect enabling him to commit a fraud, is a position supported by no authority which has come under my notice, and which I venture most respectfully to deny. It may be, that a case may occur, under very peculiar circumstances, in which the defendant might claim the intervention of a Court of Equity; but no such circumstances exist here. It is simply the case of a person wishing to be relieved from a contract, with a valid consideration, contrary to no rule of either law. or morality. <em>Eland </em>v. <em>Kerr et al., </em>was the case of an assumpsit for goods sold and delivered. The defendant pleaded a set-off, of more money due to him, from the plaintiff. Replication, that the goods were agreed to be paid for in <em>ready money; </em>which replication was held to be bad, on demurrer. Lord Ellenborough, in <em>Farr </em>v. <em>M'Iver, </em>S6 East, 138,) in speaking of this case, says, \u201cAs to the case of <em>Eland </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>there a party, upon a sale of goods, had stipulated for ready money payment only, which was held to be satisfied by a payment of his own bill. I defer to the authority, but am not convinced by it.\u201d On the authority of the ease of <em>Eland </em>v. <em>Kerr, Comfort </em>v. <em>Rivett </em>and <em>English </em>v: <em>Simons </em>were ruled; and thus stands the matter on authority in England. From the reasons given, and the doubts expressed, it appears to me plain, that if the defendant had, in addition to the promise to pay in ready money, as in <em>Eland </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>expressly agreed that he would not purchase other claims, and set them off against the \u25a0plaintiff\u2019s demand, the decision would have been entirely different. Rut be this as it may, this Court are neither trammelled by authority, nor are we convinced by the reasoning, in the cases cited. If the defendant knew the truth, as to the bond, (as the jury have found,) and made a compromise of other matters, with an understanding between the plaintiff and defendant, growing out of and connected with this compromise, that the bond should be paid, at all events, when due, and that the defendant should not buy up another judgment and set it off against it, then, neither in justice nor equity, ought the set-off to be allowed. In my opinion, a Court of Justice is never better employed, than in sustaining the principles of good faith, and in discountenancing fraud, or breach of contract. My greatest difficulty has been, in determining whether what took place amounted to a contract; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>but from this difficulty we are relieved by the verdict of the jury, under the charge of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">'Cited by Counsel, 5 Barr, 379: 3 Grant, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Cited by the Court, 5 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 368; 12 Casey, 234; 2 Grant, 494.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
