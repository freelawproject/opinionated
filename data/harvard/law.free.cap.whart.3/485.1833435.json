Because, if it did not, the defendants, the assignees of W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>&amp; L. Krumbhaar, were purchasers for a valuable consideration, without notice of any equity between the plaintiffs and the Krumbhaars, and therefore took the premises discharged therefrom.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b497-6\">Mr. <em>M\u2018Call, </em>for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AV9v\">said, that this was an attempt by a particular creditor to set up a secret trust against a regularly recorded conveyance to the general creditors. .The trust is secret, unrecorded, and one which no vigilance of the creditors could have led to or discovered. Pie submitted that this attempt ought not to <em>succeed, </em>\u2014 first, on grounds of public policy; that these secret trusts may not to be encouraged against third persons: <em>secondly, </em>because the equity of the general creditors is greater than that of the particular creditor: and, <em>thirdly, </em>because if their equity be not greater than, it is at least equal to, that of the particular creditor; and having the legal estate, the Court will not take the plank away from them; in other words, they are <em>bona fide </em>purchasers, without notice, and come within the rule which protects such purchasers. \u2014 The Court expressing a desire that he should speak to the last point, he contended that the equities being equal the law must prevail: that the equity of both parties was that of creditors; that the equity of a mechanic was not greater that that of any other creditor, although the legislature had fortified it by giving a specific lien which was the result, not of any peculiar equity, but of positive law. In the present case, the effect of the sheriff\u2019s sale was to discharge the land from the lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-7\">Upon.this superior advantage of the legal estate when the equities are equal, is founded the rule as to purchasers without notice. Assignees for the benefit of creditors or rather the creditors themselves are such purchasers, and are entitled to the <em>tabula in naufragio. </em>In considering this question we must throw out of view all assignments, by <em>operation of law; </em>such as in bankruptcy and insolvency, in which it must be admitted that the lights of the bankrupt or insolvent are passed in the same plight and condition as he possessed them; because it is the law that casts it on the assignee. But there is a wide difference between an actual assignment by <em>contract, </em>for a valuable consideration ; and one by mere operation of law, as was stated by Lord Thurlow, in <em>Worrall </em>v. <em>Marlow, </em>in a note Mr. Cox to <em>Bosvill </em>v. <em>Brander, </em>(1 P. Wins. *459). Here the contract is a to creditors, for a valuable consideration, viz. their debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-8\">If it be objected that no money is actually paid at the time by the assignee, the answer is, that it is no where laid down, that the rule as to purchasers without' notice, requires that it should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>be paid at tbe time. All that it requires, is, that the consideration should be paid, and-not merely secured to be paid. In the case of an assignment to creditors, the consideration is actually paid, the money advanced, or the goods delivered. An antecedent debt, is a valuable consideration, within the doctrine of purchasers. It appears to have been so considered by the eminent counsel who argued the case of <em>Mackreth </em>v. <em>Symmons, </em>(15 Ves. 331). Sir Samuel Romilly, says, \u201ccertainly a former debt is sufficient to sustain a purchase, as for a valuable consideration.\u201d <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Salisbury, </em>(3 Grill &amp; Johns. 426); was a case of a conveyance as an indemnity for responsibilities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-5\">But the question is decided in favour of the assignees, by the highest judicial authority in this country. In New York, it was decided by Chancellor Kent, in <em>Dey </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>(2 Johns. Ch. R. 182); that assignees for creditors, are purchasers within the rule: and although this was reversed in 15 Johns. R. 557; yet the reversal was only upon another point, and left the decision upon the question at bar unimpaired. But there is still higher authority for the position, \u2014 the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, made after great deliberation and a most learned and able consideration of the subject, in <em>Bayley v. Greenleaf, </em>(7 Wheaton, 46): in which it was held that the lien of a vendor for purchase-money, was defeated by an assignment to trustees for creditors. Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering the opinion of the Court, reviews the English authorities, and places the decision on the solid basis of the policy of the United States, in protecting creditors against secret and unrecorded trusts. This case has been adopted and carried out by the Supreme Court of Tennessee in <em>Gunn </em>v. <em>Chester, </em>(5 Yeager, 205); where the vendor\u2019s lien was held not good against creditors of the vendee, for whose benefit the land was mortgaged. And Chancellor Kent, in the last edition of his Commentaries, vol. 4, page 153, refers to the decision in <em>Bayley </em>v. <em>Greenleaf, </em>as made \u201c after a full examination of the question, and upon grounds that will probably command general assent.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-6\">Certainly the policy of protecting creditors is quite as strong in Pennsylvania as in any other state. The case of <em>Friedley </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>(17 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 70); affords a strong illustration of this. An absolute deed and defeasance made at the same time, were held to constitute a mortgage; and the defeasance not being-recorded, it was considered as an unrecorded mortgage and postponed to a judgment creditor of subsequent date, notwithstanding the absolute deed had been duly recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-7\">It is true that it has been held that a is not a *Purc^aser within the recording act of 1775. . But this, to adopt the lang'tiage of the present Chief Justice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>in the case just referred to, is, \u201c because he cannot be prejudiced by ignorance of an absolute conveyance, which leaves nothing in the debtor to answer his demand, and it is therefore, not necessary to his protection that he should have notice of it.\u201d This reason does not, however, exist, in the instance of a mere lien which only binds the debtor\u2019s interest, and leaves it subject to the claim of other creditors. The recording act of 1715, strongly shows the protective policy of our state, in favour of creditors; and the cases of <em>Kauffelt </em>v. Bower, (7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 64); <em>Semple </em>v. Burd, (7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 286); and the late case of <em>Megargel </em>v. <em>Saul, </em>(ante, p. 19); may also be referred to, to show the policy in Pennsylvania, to be the same as that on which <em>Bayley </em>v. <em>Greenleaf, </em>is founded. In the first of these cases, a vendor who had made an absolute conveyance with a receipt for the purchase-money, was held to have no lein against judgment-creditors of the vendee, even with notice, unless the claim was evidenced by a mortgage or other writing on record. In the second, a mortgage not duly recorded was held not a lien against a subsequent judgment-creditor. In the present case, the creditors derive their title through a <em>recorded </em>conveyance; the material men derive theirs under a <em>secret </em>and <em>unrecorded </em>instrument: the creditors have the vantage ground of the legal estate: the Court will not take away the shield with which the law has covered them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-6\">But is the equity of the material men in the present case, equal to that of the general creditors ? We think not: because by their deliberate act, they held out the Krumbhaars to the world as the absolute and unqualified owners of this property, free from the lien of their claims. They gave them a false credit; and their conscience is affected by their act. They were bound to have disclosed on the record their incumbrance, and their not doing so was such <em>C7'assa negligentia, </em>as amounts to constructive fraud, and ought to postpone them to the general creditors. The effect of this secret agreement was to give the Krumbhaars credit to the unincumbered value of this property, and to induce their creditors to trust to trust them on the faith of it. It was not an unadvised agreement on the part of the lien creditors. Twelves being insolvent, they were compelled to sue out their liens. To avoid this, they took the personal responsibility of the Krumbhaars, at that time in apparently flourishing circumstances, and are, therefore, not entitled to any peculiar favour.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-7\">The security of titles requires, that these secret and underhand agreements, should be stifled with inexorable rigor. The decision in <em>The Corporation </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>(3 Rawle, 109,) has produced certainty. The community understand that a sheriff\u2019s sale discharges the land from all liens, except that of the first mortgage. No private agreement should be permitted to counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>va,d stern rule of law. And *indeed, this Court in <em>Shultz </em>v. Penn. seem to have declared for the future, that the legal effect of a sheriff\u2019s sale should not be altered by any agreement of the parties which was not a part of the <em>record </em>of the sale.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-8\">Mr. <em>Price </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-9\">1. As between the original parties, the lien continued. <em>Modus et conventio vincunt legem. </em>(2 Co. 73.) A sheriff\u2019s sale may be clear or subject to liens, as agreed by the parties in interest. <em>Muse </em>v. <em>Letterman, </em>(13 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 167, 170, 171); <em>Stackpole </em>v. <em>Glassford, </em>(16 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 163). The case in 2d Bawle, 166, only decides that loose talk shall not make the sale subject to a mortgage. It would be a fraud on the creditors if the Messrs. Krumbhaars could clear the property of the liens, contrary to their agreement; and to avoid such a consequence, this Court have imposed the lien or a trust on the purchaser. <em>Gilbert v. Hoffman, </em>(2 Watts, 66); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Dysinger, </em>(1 Rawle, 408, 413, 414); <em>Kisler </em>v. <em>Kisler, </em>(2 Watts, 325); 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 492; 2 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 461.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-10\">2. The assignees are in no better condition than the assignors. They pay no purchase-money on the transfer, and take what the debtor had, as he held it, subject to all assets and contervailing equities. The doctrine in England in bankruptcy cases, is unquestionable and not denied. 3 Sugd. on Vendors, 81: 12 Ves. Jun. 349; <em>Mitford </em>v. <em>Mitford, </em>(9 Ves. Jun. 99); 2 Ves. &amp; Beam. 309; Powell on Mortgages, 542; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>(2 Vernon, 564); <em>Finch </em>v. <em>Winchelsea, </em>(1 P. Wms. 280); Cowp. 565; Doug. 636. The American cases, with a. single exception, accord with the English decisions, and establish the principle, that it is only the purchaser who has paid a valuable consideration on the transfer, without notice, in the ordinary course of business, that is protected, and put in any better situation than the assignor. 1 Dallas, 430; 4 Binn. 368 ; 3 Rawle, 99, 203 ; 4 Rawle, 345, 354; <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Eichelburger, </em>(2 Penn. Rep. 346); 1 Whart. 433; 10 Johns. Rep. 540; 13 Wendell, 570; 16 Wendell, 574; 15 Mass. 156. It would be plainly unjust that the Krumbhaars should pay their general creditors, who did not trust specifically to this property for payment, at the expense of those who did so trust to it, and whose claims constituted the price or purchase-money that was to be paid for it, without a forfeiture of those claims by laches.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-11\">3. The assignees also had notice by the assignment of these liens. <em>Lodge </em>v. <em>Simonton. </em>(2 Penn.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoJ\">Were it not for the agreement to the contrary, the plaintiff\u2019s lien would certainly have been discharged by the sheriff\u2019s sale. The Messieurs Krumbhaar, however, had power to sell, subject to it; and they actually sold in performance of an agreement to' buy the property themselves, or bid it to a price that would ensure satisfaction of this and another incumbrance from the proceeds, with a proviso that they should continue to bind till they were paid. They bought it in; and, by force of the agreement, the lien was an incumbrance on it while it remained in their hands.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> They have made a general assignment with the usual preferences ; and the single question is, whether the assignees in trust for the creditors, hold discharged of the lien, as purchasers without notice, and for valuable consideration. It is not doubted, that they are invested with the title, and that the lien, \u25a0 apparently discharged by the sale, and deriving its actual force from a private agreement, was essentially a secret one; but it is contended, that the assignment gave notice of it, or disclosed what would, by inquiry, have led to it. It indeed contains a provision for mechanics\u2019 liens by name; but such provision by the owner of a title, acquired through a judicial sale, points rather to personal than to real security, and intimates not the conditions on which it was given. The object being avowedly to procure a title, pursuant to a previous purchase, may have induced the vendee to assume the liens as personal liabilities, in consideration that the creditors would not interfere with the sale; and this shows, that to provide for them as personal charges, even by the name of liens, is not necessarily or naturally inconsistent with a previous extinction of them as such. The vendee\u2019s responsibility might well be supposed to have been accepted as a substitute for them; and whatever is sufficient to direct an inquiry, must point distinctly' to the object of it. It seems, therefore, that there is not enough in the case to affect the creditors with actual or constructive notice; but are they the purchasers for valuable consideration ?</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>It is conceded, that they have not released; and that the interests of the parties remain as they were at the date of the assignment. The assignees, being instruments selected by the debtor, and having no beneficial interest as such, stand in no personal or distinctive equity; for though a pecuniary consideration is always inserted in the deed, where they are not creditors, (the necessity of which, to protect the transaction from the statutes of Elizabeth,) is shown in *Roberts on Fraudulent Conveyances, 429, and recognised in <em>Howry </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>(3 Penn. Rep. 381,) it is merely nominal, and not that substantial sort of equivalent which gives a claim to something in return. Then equity, if any, must be the equity of the creditors represented by them; and what substantive or formal advantage have these surrendered in compensation of the benefits expected from the assignment? None are pretended. Neither are they placed in the category of purchasers by their character or position. That they are not protected as such by the recording acts, was declared in <em>Heister </em>v. <em>Fortner, </em>(2 Binn. 40;) and though it was said in <em>Petrie </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>(11 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 377,) that the extinguishment of a debt is a valuable consideration for a thing taken in satisfaction of it, the acceptance of it as a security without astipulation for forbearance, was held to be otherwise. So also in <em>Ramsay\u2019s Appeal, </em>(2 Watts, 232,) creditors were held to stand exactly in the equity of their debtor. I know of no case in which the abstract existence of debts was held to be a valuable consideration for a transfer of property to trustees for distributive payment, except <em>Bayley </em>v. <em>Greenleaf, </em>to be presently noticed. In <em>Lord Paget\u2019s Case, </em>(1 Leon. 194,) it was held, that the mere destination of property to payment of the grantor\u2019s debts, by a general assignment to a <em>stranger, </em>is not a consideration even to raise a use on a covenant to stand seised, and consequently, not to pass even the legal title; and there is therefore nothing to sustain it, under the statutes of Elizabeth, against a creditor or a purchaser, though it is good against an heir. <em>Leech </em>v. <em>Leech, </em>(Ch. Ca. 249). But where the creditors are party to the deed, there is a clear valuable consideration in the forbearance of suit and mutual accommodation expressed by the terns, or implied by the nature of the transaction. Roberts on Fraud, Con. 431. In the case before us, the creditors, not having become parties to the transaction, by performance of the condition, which alone could make them so, were bound in the meantime to no forbearance or accommodation whatever. In <em>Bayley </em>v. <em>Greenleaf, </em>however, an equitable lien of admitted obligation betwixt the vendor and vendee, was not enforced against assignees in trust for the vendee\u2019s creditors. In Pennsylvania, such a lien is rejected altogether; but admitting the general existence of it, in that case the question was, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the creditors were exempt from it as purchasers. For aught that appears, they had relinquished nothing in compensation of the benefits of the trust; nor had they elected to look to it for satisfaction ; and though the assignment could not prejudice them, it was held to divest the vendor\u2019s lien for purchase-money. The reasoning of the Chief Justice, in delivering the opinion of the Court, is unsatisfactory on principle and authority. . Analogous decisions-on assignments in bankruptcy and statutory insolvency, were admitted to be adverse to his conclusion; yet though no essential difference betwixt one of these and an assignment by act *of the party was pointed out, a distinction was taken on the ground that, by the latter, creditors are purchasers for a specific consideration. What advantage or thing they are supposed to part with in the one case, in order to make them so, which they do not part -with in the other, was not attempted to be shown. The truth is, they part with nothing. Before satisfaction or release, the reclamation of a preferred creditor is unimpaired ; and the exertion of the debtor\u2019s power to provide for him, is consequently gratuitous. The intended preference is a gift of his dominion, which enables him to pay in the order that pleases him; and the thing destined to payment, whilst unappropriated, continues in the hands of Ms agents, subject to the equities which adhered to it in his own. The appointment of a trustee is in fact no more than a substitution of the hand to pay. Preferred creditors are not more meritorious than the creditors of an intestate, who stand in his place; the difference in other respects being that the trustees succeed to the title by-act of the party, and the administrators succeed to it by act of the law; but, in either case, without a beneficial act done-or prejudice suffered. When the trust is- executed, however, the money cannot be followed; but, as was intimated in <em>Heister </em>v. <em>Fortner, </em>the creditors must cease to be so, before they can be purchasers. Here.the trust remains unexecuted; and as the creditors will not be put in more unfavourable circumstances by the-enforcement of the lien than if the assignment had not been made, nothing has moved from them that can prejudice them, or benefit the debtor; and they are consequently not purchasers of its benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Cited by Counsel, 4 Wharton, 502 ; 5 Id. 183 ; 8 Watts, 49 ; 2 Barr, 371; 3 Id. 76, 138; 4 Id. 437 ; 5 Id. 78 ; 10 Harris, 316; 11 Id. 227; 8 Casey. 475; 6 Wright, 393; 9 Id. 156; 14 Id. 79 ; 4 P.
