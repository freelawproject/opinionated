If the society is within the act, there is no discretion about -it. Now the act speaks of associations for literary, charitable, or religious purposes. *This may be considered either as a literary or charitable institution. The object is the advancement of the knowledge or learning of medicine, not surgery. It is therefore a literary or learned society. The legislature have in several instances shown that they regarded colleges as literary institutions; as in <em>The Case of Dickinson </em>College, (2 Sm. Laws, 71;) the preamble to which distinguishes between science and literature; <em>Jefferson </em>College, (3 Sm. Laws, 478); <em>Washington </em>College, (4 Sm. Laws, 335); <em>Franklin </em>College, (2 Sm. Laws, 398); <em>University of </em>Pennsylvania, (3 Sm. Laws, 53); <em>La Fayette Coll</em>ege, (Pamph. Laws, 1825 \u2014 6, p. 56); <em>Gettysburg College, </em>(Pamph. Laws, 1831-2, p. 365). In 1789, only two years before the passing of the act under which this question arises, the legislature incorporated the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. If not strictly a literary, this may be considered a charitable association. E<em>x parte Wrangham, </em>(2 Ves. Jr., 609). In <em>The Attorney General </em>v. <em>The Earl of Lonsdale, </em>(1 Simons, 105; s. c. 2 Eng. Chan. Rep. 55,) the Vice Chancellor said, \u201c The institution of a school for the sons of gentlemen is not, in popular language, a charity; but in the view of the statute of Elizabeth, all schools for learning are to be so considered.\u201d Stat. 43 Eliz.; 23 Hen. 8, c. 10; 1 Edw. 6, c. 14; <em>Porter's Case, </em>(1 Rep. 22. 5); <em>Martindale </em>v. <em>Martindale, </em>(Cro. Eliz. 288); <em>Case of Magdalen College, </em>(11 Rep. 71). Charitable uses for education are held to be good, notwithstanding the statutes of mortmain. Bacon\u2019s Reading on the Statute of Uses, (4 Bacon\u2019s Works, 167-8); 1 ICyd on Corp. 61. In fact, this is not the first application of the kind. In 1827, the charter of the Medical Society of Philadelphia was amended on the certificate of this Court. About the same time, the Central Medical Society was incorporated; and in 1837, the Medical Institute; the members of which receive compensation from those who attend their lectures.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-10\">2nd. Is there any thing in the articles unlawful ? If there is is not, how can the Court refuse to give their certificate ? The power of conferring degrees has been objected to. Now it is well known, that this is a mere honorary distinction. In Pennsylvania, it confers no civil right or privilege. There is no law here requiring a license or diploma to practise medicine, In some parts of Europe, the title of M.D. may be bought for money. The charter of the University of Pennsylvania confers no power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>on that body to grant degrees. Act of 1791, (3 Sm. Laws, 53). Such is the case with several other colleges established by the legislature. In England, a degree of M.D. is not necessary to authorize the practice of medicine. Willcock on the Laws of the Medical Profession, part II. p. 4. Degrees appear to have been originally granted in Paris; and they have since been usually conferred by colleges and universities; but there is <em>no </em>law which limits the right of conferring them to the colleges incorporated by the legislature.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b460-5\">*Mr. <em>Wharton </em>and Mr. <em>Smith, contra.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"pAEr\">The trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, the oldest college in the Commonwealth, have felt it to be their duty to state to the Court the objections that have occurred to them in relation to this method of incorporating colleges, by application to the Court, instead of the legislature. \u201c It is proper to remark, that the medical faculty of the University have taken no part whatever in the opposition to the proposed charter; and the trustees by whom the objections are made entertain great respect for the many eminent persons connected with the society asking to be incorporated. The objections of the trustees are not to the society being incorporated, but to the <em>manner </em>in which it asks to be incorporated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-7\">If it is in <em>thepower </em>of the Court to grant charters of the kind asked for, the Court <em>must </em>grant them. They can exercise no discretionary control. It is the apprehension of the injurious consequences which may result from the establishment of a power, the exercise of which the Court itself cannot control, that has induced the trustees of the University to object <em>to </em>the present application. They have considered it more especially their duty to call the attention of the Court to the subject, because, although the act authorizing the Court to grant charters in certain cases has been in force for forty-seven years, this is the first instance of an application to incorporate a college, with power to confer degrees; and the respectability of the applicants might induce a supposition, that the application was well founded, unless the legal objections to it were formally presented.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-8\">The preamble of the act of 1791 declares, that \u201c a great portion of the time of the legislature has heretofore been employed in enacting laws to incorporate private associations,\u201d &amp;c., and it provides a method of relieving the legislature from the burthen. Now since the passing of the act, nearly one hundred colleges have been incorporated by the legislature. This is a strong argument against the application. 1st. The preamble speaks of private associations. Is this, therefore, such a private association ? Can a medical college,' invested with a large jurisdiction, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>powers to be exercised upon a subject of great public importance, and with power to grant honours and privileges to persons not members, be properly called a private society ? In all countries, the profession of medicine has been considered in the light of a public trust; and in many states, no one can practise, without a license granted by the public authority. ' Whatever may have been the original meaning of the word <em>college, </em>it has now come to signify an institution for the higher branches of education, established or incorporated by the state. 2 Kent\u2019s Comm. 270. 2d. To authorize the Court to grant a certificate, the association must be either for a literary, charitable, or religious purpose. The Court will not go beyond their authority. In <em>The Gaze of St. Mary's Church, </em>(6 Serg. <em>&amp; </em>Rawle, 505,) C. J. Tilghman said, \u201cIn this business of charters, the Court acts\" under *the grant of an extraordinary power of a special nature, and is confined to the cases described in the acts of assembly.\u201d This can hardly be called a literary institution. This word seems to be applicable in the connection, to libraries and other associations connected with literature. Medicine is a science. The constitution of this commonwealth (Art. VII, \u00a7 11,) declares, that \u201c'The arts and sciences shall be promoted in one or more seminaries of learning:\u201d that is, as would seem, promoted by the direct action of the legislature. Here a distinction seems to be taken between the sciences and other knowledge, which has been followed since. Then it is said, that this may be considered as an association for a charitable purpose. Certainly, in a large sense, all scientific associations may be so considered; and colleges have been sometimes ranked among eleemosynary corporations: but it is obvious, that the legislature had in view institutions established for the purpose of affording relief to the indigent and unfortunate. The decisions under the English statutes of charitable uses are not at all applicable. 3d. Supposing, however, that colleges and academies are within the purview of the act of 1791, there is a peculiar feature here, viz. the power to confer degrees. This is undoubtedly a very high power, and however it may have originated, or whatever may be the intrinsic value of the distinctions, it is certain, that none but the highest institutions have heretofore undertaken to grant degrees in the arts and sciences, and that the power has been granted only by legislative acts of incorporation. It is believed, that there is no instance of any private association having undertaken to grant the degree of Doctor in Medicine. It is in effect, granting a license to practice, since that degree is of great weight in public opinion. In several of the acts referred to on the other side, the legislature has shown its sense of the importance of the distinction. In the act of 1791, the legislature has enu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>merated the cases in which it shall be lawful for this Court to act; and it is not a subject on which they will be disposed <em>ampliare jurisdictionem. </em>The fourth section of the act of 1791 enumerates the powers of the corporations to be created by that act, and it -would seem to follow, that no special power can be conferred, not mentioned in the act. It is true, that the act of 1791, relating to the University of Pennsylvania, does not give the power of conferring degrees; but that act merely united two institutions, which severally possessed that power by their previous charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-5\"><em>Reply. </em>\u2014 All the universities and colleges in this country are private institutions; that is, they were founded in a great measure, at least, by private persons. If there be a difference between the preamble and the act, the latter is to govern. There is nothing in the constitution or laws, to prevent the incorporation of colleges by the Court. Nor is there any reason, in relation to medical science, which distinguishes it from any other. The legislature has frequently incorporated churches since are within the act. In fact, an examination of the list of charters granted before the act of 1791, will show that the applications for colleges were then very few. What is a degree, but an honorary distinction, such as is awarded societies to of merit ?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b462-9\">Huston, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQP\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">On the 16th of April, 1791, was passed an act of assembly entitled \u201c an act to confer on certain associations of the citizens of this commonwealth the powers and immunities of corporations or bodies politic in law,\u201d and is in part as follows</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">\u201c Whereas a great portion of the time of the legislature has heretofore been employed in enacting laws to incorporate <em>private associations ; </em>and it would not only be more advantageous to the public, but also convenient to individuals, who are desirous of being so incorporated, that the same might lawfully be effected without an immediate application in all cases to the general assembly of this commonwealth: therefore be it enacted that,</p>\n<p id=\"A5J\">Section 1. When any number of persons, citizens of this commonwealth, are associated or mean to associate, for any literary, charitable or religious purpose, and shall be desirous to acquire and enjoy the powers and immunities of a corporation or body politic in law, it shall and may be lawful for such persons to prepare an instrument in writing, specifying the objects, articles, conditions, and name, style or title, under which they have associated, or mean to associate, and exhibit and present the same to the attorney-general of the commonwealth, for the time being, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>who is hereby required to peruse and examine the said instrument ; and after such perusal and examination to transmit it with a certificate thereon endorsed, testifying his opinion of the lawfulness of the objects, articles, and conditions therein set forth and contained, unto the Supreme Court; and the said Court is hereby also required, thereupon to peruse and examine the said instrument, and transmit with a certificate thereon endorsed, testifying also the opinion of the said Court, touching the lawfulness of the objects, articles and conditions therein set forth and contained unto the governor of the commonwealth: and if the said attorney-general and said Court shall certify their opinion as aforesaid, to be, that the objects, articles and conditions in such instrument set forth and contained are lawful, the governor shall transmit the same to the Master of the Rolls, &amp;c. &amp;c.; \u2022 and they shall become a body corporate in law and in fact, by the name style and title in such instrument declared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The succeeding sections proceed to state the powers of such corporation, which are precisely those stated by Rlackstone and others to be the rights and powers <em>incident to every corporation. </em>The property to be held is by this law not to exceed <em>\u00a3500 </em>per annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">By an act of the 3d April, 1833, a supplement to the above, the *provisons of the above act are extended to beneficial societies and associations, and to fire engine and hose companies; and the amount of property which may be owned may be two thousand dollars annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Some of the words used in the preceding acts would seem to give very extensive powers, but they have been considered as not admitting so large a construction as here contended for; in short as authorising this Court to certify only in cases where the articles, objects and conditions are those specified in the following sections, and as are incident to every corporation. In the first place, the Court cannot certify except in case of private associations; and in the next it is to prevent the necessity of making application to the legislature <em>in all cases. </em>In other words, the objects, articles and conditions, might be quite constitutional in a charter granted by act of assembly, and yet such as were not within the purview of this act. The word powers, is not added to the objects, articles and conditions in the first section; and when the association wishes for a power or powers, or authorities, not mentioned in this act, it must apply to the legislature. This Court can certify as far as the law gives power; but when an association asks not only to have the powers and rights specified in the act above cited, but other powers not there mentioned or alluded to, it requires of us what the law does not authorise us to do. For example, the fifth article in the proposed charter, is, <em>\u201c </em>the college <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>shall have power to grant and confirm, in the manner and form prescribed by its by-laws, such degrees in- medicine to such students <em>or others, </em>whom by their proficiency in learning <em>or other meritorious distinction, </em>they shall deem entitled to them, as are usually conferred in other colleges and universities, and to grant to such graduates such diplomas or certificates under their common seal, as may authenticate and perpetuate the memory of such graduation.\u201d Now we look in vain for any such authority among the powers which shall belong to a corporation established under the provisions of this act; and if we do not find it there, we have not power to certify as to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In ICyd on Corporations, 61, the author speaks of powers existing in certain corporations, which, powers could not by common law be granted by the king, who at one time was supposed to have the exclusive power of creating corporations. In such case, says the author, recourse must be had to parliament to grant them, or confirm them when such had been granted by the king; as in the case of the powers exercised by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and the College of Physicians in -London.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">In this state there was, previous to 1791, no mode of obtaining a charter of incorporation except by act of assembly; and it is a sound principle, that even in such a charter, from the legislature, the corporation has no powers except what are expressly granted, or are necessary to effect the objects expressly granted. We have *many schools and academies for the advancement of learning; none of which, no institution except a college having express power by legislative enactment, have attempted to confer degrees or give diplomas ; and none of which has power to confer such degrees or grant diplomas unless so expressly given. There is a Medical Society, and a Medical Institute already in this city; and the members of those bodies are very much the same persons who propose to form this medical college. They understand perfectly, that their several acts of incorporation do not give the power asked by this fifth section.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">We admit that men of higher grade in the departments of medical science, or of greater moral worth than many of the applicants for this charter are not to be found; but they have been mistaken as to the duty and authority of this Court, in the premises. Wherever we have authority to certify, we are bound to certify: if Are have authority to certify, and thus in effect incorporate this college with these powers, we must if applied to, grant a similar charter with similar powers to the physicians of every county and toAvn in the state; Ave have no more right to decide on the degree of medical science in the applicants, than on the piety of a congregation of any religious sect, Avho apply to us to certify to a proposed charter of incorporation; and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>might place the degree of doctor of medicine in a situation somewhat similar to what was threatened by a celebrated minister of France, who said he would create so many dukes, that it would be a shame not to be a duke, and no honor to be a duke.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The degrees conferred in colleges are not offices or appointments, but they confer honour, influence and respectability to a certain extent. The power of conferring such degrees was never meant to be put in such a situation that the attorney-general and this Court were bound to concur in granting it to any association which wished to be incorporated for literary or scientific purposes, and this without the power of inquiring as to the qualifications of the applicants, to exercise such power with advantage to the community, or advancement of medical science.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">We repeat, the act of 1791 authorises us to certify on the application for a charter by any literary, charitable or religious association, who wish to be a corporation, or body politic, with a right of perpetual succession, of a common seal, of suing and being sued, of making by-laws and holding property of a yearly value not exceeding $2000. These powers are specified in that act. Our authority extends no further; and when an association wishes other authority,, or other or greater powers, such can only be obtained from the legislature of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Application denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
