The bond of John is dated on the 26th of May, 1818. The bond of Jacob and that of Joseph are dated the 15th of April, 1818. Each of the said bonds is made payable one year after the decease of the obligee. In his will the father gives and bequeaths unto each of his said three sons the sum of $1218 75; for which sum he holds a bond of each one of them, and directs his executor to give up the said bonds to his said sons, after his decease. This was in full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>of their share of his estate. His will is dated the 30th of May, 1818.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-6\">The bond of Jacob has been produced in Court, and given in evidence on this trial. The following endorsement is written on this bond: <em>\u201c </em>This is to certify to whom it may concern, that I, Isaac Rothrock, having sold a piece of land to my son Jacob Rothrock, for which this bond is given, which sum of money is to be in full of his share of my estate, real and personal, and I do order my executors or administrators to give up this bond to my said son as his full share of my estate, on his signing a release for his whole share of my estate.\u201d This endorsement is dated on the 18th of April, 1818, and is signed and sealed by Isaac Rothrock, and attested by two witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-7\">It appears by the administration account, as settled in the Orphans\u2019 Court, that the defendants did give up their bonds to the obligors, according to the directions of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-8\">Gertrude Rothrock, the widow of the testator, testified, that when her husband and herself executed the deed to Jacob for the land, Jacob refused to sign a bond until it was understood that it was not to be paid: that she heard her husband afterwards say that Jacob\u2019s bond was not to be paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-9\">John Brock, Esq., who drew the bond and endorsement, and is a witness to them, testifies that it was expressly understood, that the bond of Jacob was not to be paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-10\">*Was this bond assets in the hands of the defendants for the payment of debts ? If it was not, they cannot in this suit be charged with its amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-11\">It appears by the testimony of the two witnesses, that it was part of the agreement between the father and son, that it was not to be paid. The endorsement on the bond forms part of the transaction. It was binding upon the testator of the defendants. If binding on the testator, it must be equally so on his representatives. It is accompanied by all the solemnities with which the bond was executed. It is under seal. It is attested by two witnesses. By it the obligee certifies that it is to be in full of Jacob\u2019s share in his estate. By it he orders his executors to give it up to the obligor. That they were also to stand as his share of the estate, forms part of the condition of the bond itself. This is a part of the agreement between the parties, and is as binding as any other part of the agreement. Jacob would not have contracted on any other terms. The old man in his will, which is afterwards made, provides for the fulfilment of this part of the contract on his part. He could not have changed it by his will, without the consent of Jacob.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-13\">I am of opinion that the defendants could not have enforced the payment of this bond by Jacob; that its amount was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>assets in their hands for the payment of debts, and that they cannot be charged with it in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-6\">The bonds of John and Joseph are not to be found, and cannot be produced. The defendants contend, that they were subject to terms similar to those which have been proved in regard' to the bond of Jacob.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-7\">This their counsel have argued may be inferred from the fact that they are all dated near the same time; that they are for the same sum: that they are all made payable one year after the decease of the father: that the provision in the will is the same as to them all: that this sum was to be in full of each one\u2019s share in his father\u2019s estate: that the old man had about this time sold lands to each one of them : that this was done by the father, as Brock testifies, to settle his estate among his children in his life-time: that he had calculated the amount of his debts, and that he thought he had enough left to pay his debts, after giving these bonds to his children. What bonds does the witness refer to ? Is it to the three bonds now in dispute ? The Court intrusts all the evidence to your consideration. If you are satisfied from it that the bonds of John and Joseph were given, subject to the same condition that Jacob\u2019s was, then the defendants cannot be charged with their amount. If they were not subject to the same conditions, then they would be chargeable with their amount; and as you believe them to have been the one way, or the other, so you will regulate your verdict in regard to this part of the case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pAUi\">jury found for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWY\">The errors assigned in this Court were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-10\">\u201c 1st.

C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARm\">The question is, whether these bonds were assets for payment of debts. That they were not intended to be so, is evident from the terms of the endorsement, by which the defendants were ordered to redeliver them to the obligors, when they should relinquish all claim to any other part of the estate. Had there been a reservation for payment of the debts, it would have been easy to express it; but, as it was supposed there would be enough beside, none was intended. Then why, it has been aslced, should bonds have been taken at all ? Simply because it is a custom in some parts of the state to take securities for advancements, merely as acknowledgments of them, which do not, however, always contain a clause of self-defeasance, and which may consequently be used to enforce the. father\u2019s plan of distribution. That was certainly not the object to be accomplished by them here; for had he died intestate, 'and leaving a greater estate than was anticipated, the sons might, consistently with the terms, have thrown their bonds and advancements into hotchpot, and entitled themselves to enhanced portions; and to enable them to do- so was probably the motive for giving the transaction its peculiar form. But whatever the motive, the provision is, in this respect, an unconditional <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>one, and it is not the office of to violate it. I the will out of the case. Its arrangements are subordinate to those of the contract by which the rights and responsibilities of the parties had been definitively fixed. If the particular disposition were valid as to creditors at its date, they cannot object to a particular part of it now; and if it were not, their recourse is to the land, and not to the nominal price of it as personal assets. Its validity under the 13 Eliz. would depend on the sufficiency Of the property retained to answer the debts, and on the consideration of the conveyances, which ought to be not merely good, but valuable.* It was testified, in respect of the first, that the deficiency has been caused by subsequent depreciation ; and as to the second, that at least one of the sons insisted on a stipulation against personal.liability, without which the expected bounty might have been a burden to him. Hopeless insolvency has been sometimes brought on children born to expectations of fortune, by the enforcement of securities for owelty of partition; of which <em>Gfelback\u2019s Appeal, </em>(8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 205,) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>where the value of the whole estate fell below the auio'unt of the recognisances, is a notable instance. Now the creditors could impeach the present transaction only by treating it as a measure of distribution, however valid as between the parties, yet as a nullity throughout in respect to themselves; for if' the sons despite the stipulation to the contrary, were held liable to the executors for any purpose, it would assume the character of a contract on valuable consideration; and the pretention of the plaintiff to hold them so, is destructive of itself. lie may not recover against the terms of the contract by an action affirmative of it. On the other hand, if the bonds were treated as the nullities they purport to be, the conveyances, thus destitute of support from a valuable consideration, would be avoided by the statute, and the land would be left specifically liable to execution for the debts. Rut as the bonds and endorsements constitute an entire transaction which is fraudulent or fair in the whole, it cannot be affirmed in part and disaffirmed in part, so as to make it what the parties intended it should not be. The plaintiff might, perhaps, entitle himself to judgment <em>de terris </em>against the proper parties; but he cannot recover so as to involve the defendants in personal liability for having delivered up a contract which, by its terms, they were bound to do. The circumstances recapitulated in the charge, were sufficient, at least to go to the jury, as evidence that the lost bonds were executed on the same condition as was the one produced; and the whole case seems to have been properly submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Cited by Counsel, 10 Barr, 428 ; 3 P.
