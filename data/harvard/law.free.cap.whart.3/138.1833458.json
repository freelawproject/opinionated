Dr. Jening prescribed, and I got medicine from a druggist in Callowhill-street, near Fair Mount. The boy refused to take the medicine, which I told Dr. Jening. He then advised that I should get the boy bled. I went'home and inquired of my hostler for a doctor. He mentioned that there was two in Callowhill-street, Drs. Foster and Small. I told him to go for the nearest to come and see my boy, and if the nearest should be out, to try the next one. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>It appears he went to both doctors, Foster and Small. Dr. Foster came first. I showed him into the room, and whilst he was bleeding the boy, I went down into the bar ro.om, and Dr. Small was there. I told him how it happened, and that Dr. Foster was bleeding the boy. He then turned round and said he would charge for this visit. I offered to pay him for it, but he went out without telling me his charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-6\">Dr. Foster continued attending the boy and he got well. Sometime after that, the druggist sent in his bill to me for the medicine which had been got for the boy. I called down to the drug store to inform him how he could get his money. Dr. Small was there. I explained to Small how they, (F. and S.) met at the same time. He, (Dr. Small,) said, if <em>Dr. Foster ivas a two-penny </em>bleeder, <em>he was </em>none; <em>he was a regular graduate and no quach. </em>I told him I did not know whether he was a graduate or quack.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-7\">James C. Keen deposed: \u2014 \u201cI am acquainted with Doctors Foster and Small. Have heard Dr. Small speak derogatively of Dr. Foster at two different times. He said Dr. Foster was no regular bred physician \u2014 had no diploma, and that he killed his patients. Went on to that he would bleed them to death. He named a patient *that Dr. Foster had in the neighbourhood, and said he thought Foster would bleed him to death; that he did not know the treatment. I walked off, not wishing to listen at that time. At another time he, (Small,) stopped me and began to talk of Foster. He said something like he did before, as that he was no doctor, and behaved ungentle- and took out of his hands.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AdJ\">Mrs. Montgomery deposed: \u2014 \u201cWe rented the front room, and Dr. Small came in: He asked me if this was not where the butchered baby was. I told him not as I knew of \u2014 no butchered bahy was here. I told him there was a woman living up stairs who had two children \u2014 neither of them was sick to my knowledge. Mr. Given had a baby that was sick since I came to the house\u2014 it was getting well. I told him it never got any medicine that I knew of except a little lime-water and new milk. I called the mother out, as I had got frightened on account of the child\u2019s sitting in my room all the while. The reason I was frightened was that I was in the habit of nursing the child, and for fear that some person would tell Dr. Small that I had done something cruel to the child, (and that is the reason I called the child\u2019s mother out,) and thought she would understand the thing better than myself. When she, (Mrs. Given,) came out she said, \u2018Doctor, you must be under a mistake.\u2019 He said, \u2018No, not at all. I am under no mistake; the child\u2019s father bid me come round the first time it was convenient to see it \u2014 that Foster had given it stuff to butcher it.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>William Gourley deposed: \u201cI visited the house of Mr. Gordon at different times, in company with Dr. Poster. I was there when Dr. Poster inquired of Mr. Gordon whether he had heard Small say he, (Poster,) was no physician. Gordon replied, \u2018 Dr. Small did. say he, (Poster,) was no physician.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-6\">The defendant produced Mary Small as a witness, who deposed as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-7\">\u201cI am acquainted with Thomas Given \u2014 know him by sight. Given was coming in Callowhill-street: Dr. Small was standing in the door: Given said to Small, \u2018Doctor, I wish you to come and see my child; Poster is butchering it.\u2019 Small said, \u2018I guess not.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-8\">The learned Judge charged the jury in substance as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-9\">\u201cThe slander which the plaintiff alleges to have been uttered of him by the defendant, is stated in the declaration to be, 1st, \u2018He is <em>no </em>physician, but a two-penny bleeder\u2019; or, as it is laid in another count, \u2018He is <em>not </em>a physician, but a two-penny bleeder\u2019; 2d, Poster has given a child stuff to butcher it\u2019; and 3d, \u2018He has butchered a child.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-10\">Two Avitnesses, Richard Greening and James C.Keen, have been examined to the first There is no reason to think *&amp;ey speak of the same utterance, for Greening says, one was in the shop beside himself, Dr. Small, and the apothecary; and Keen makes no mention of having been there, or of having heard the words there. The charge is entire and ought to be proved substantially as laid. Now Greening only proves that Small said \u2018 If Poster was a two-penny bleeder, he was none. He was a regular graduate and no quack.\u2019 This does not support the charge as laid. Keen says, \u2018 Small spoke derogatively of Poster \u2014 said he was not a regular bred physician \u2014 had no diploma;\u2019 and in the second conversation, \u2018 He said something like he did before, as that he was no doctor \u2014 behaved ungentlemanly, and took his patients out of his hands.\u2019 This is not the charge in the declaration, it does not sustain it. It is a very different charge; and if it had been so laid in the declaration would have raised a different question. The 2d count is in effect abandoned \u2014 no witnesses having been called to speak to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-11\">The 3d charge is supposed to be proved by the deposition of Catharine Montgomery. But her evidence is that the defendant said the father of the child had told him what is here charged to have been spoken by the defendant, on his own authority, without reference to a third person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-12\">The proof establishes what the law considers a milder charge than what is laid; and therefore, by express decision of our courts, docs not support it. The plaintiff, therefore, has failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>to prove either of the counts, and the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">The jury accordingly found for the defendant, and the plaintiff having taken a bill of exceptions, and writ of error, filed the following exceptions:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-7\">\u201c 1st. The Court erred in charging the jury that the depositions of Greening and Keen did not, in substance or fact, sustain the first count in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-8\">2d. The Court erred in charging the jury that the deposition of Christiana (Montgomery did not sustain the second count in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-9\">3d. The Court erred in charging that the deposition of James C. Keen did not sustain the third count in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-10\">4th. The Court erred in withdrawing the case from the jury, and directing a verdict for the defendant, because the plaintiff had not sustained any of the counts in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-11\">5th. The Court erred in charging the jury that James C. Keen\u2019s proving that Small said that Foster was no doctor, was not, in substance, that he was no physician.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-12\">Mr. <em>Jack, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az_\">cited Starkie on Slander, 114; <em>*Hersh </em>v. <em>Ringwalt, </em>(3 Yeates, 509); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>(1 Nott &amp; M\u2018C. 290.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-14\">Mr. <em>W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Av\">Though evidence of all the words alleged need not be given, it seems necessary that at least some of those that are actionable be proved as they are laid; and while the proof of speaking is for the jury, the correspondence betwixt the words spoken and the words laid, is for the court. The very words need not be proved; but where they are in fact proved, they must, it seems, correspond with the very words laid; and hence perhaps it is, that words spoken in the second person are not legal equivalents for words of the very same import spoken in the third. The only words before us, of which there is a semblance of proof, are contained in the first count: \u201c He is not a physician, but a two-penny bleeder.\u201d Now though words which impute professional ignorance are certainly actionable, yet to say of a physician that he is a two-penny bleeder, imputes not want of professional skill, but want of professional dignity manifested by a petty attention to the humbler employments of the art. They are, in fact, words of mere contempt. But the time has been when the business of the bleeder was not a distinct one, and when it was performed, as it still is in the country, by physicians of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the first eminence. How far then are the actionable words \u201c he is no physician,\u201d supported by the proof? The words sworn to by the first witness are: \u201c If Dr. Foster is a two-penny physician I am none; I am a regular graduate and no quack.\u201d Now granting for the moment that proof of insinuation is equivalent to proof of assertion, and that a charge may be laid indifferently as insinuated or asserted, without regard to the proof, yet the charge insinuated here, Avas in fact not want of skill, but want of graduation; and though the imputation of being a quack might sustain an action, it is not laid as a gravamen in the jjresent. The words proved by the second witness are : \u201c Dr. Foster is no regular bred physician; he has no diploma; he kills his patients and bleeds them to death.\u201d Here too it is proper to remark, the imputation of killing by blood-letting is not laid as a ground of action, and the material words are consequently those which allege irregular breeding, and want of the usual collegiate certificate. Now were these admitted to be actionable Avhen accurately laid, proof of them would not support the present declaration; for there is an evident difference, in respect to the malignity involved as well as in the injury intended to be done by it, betwixt being irregularly bred and not being bred at all. But though it was held in <em>Cowdry </em>v. <em>Highley, </em>(Cro. Car. 270,) that it is actionable to say of a physician, he is no scholar, yet rules that are the growth of a country in which collegiate testimonials are the only *passports to professional fame, are unsuitable to the habits of a whom instruction in colleges and universities was not originally attainable. Fifty years ago medicine and surgery were in the hands of American practitioners who taught their pupils-as they had themselves been taught, without that collegiate training which now is happily accessible to all; and the want of a diploma is still not indispensable to medical reputation. But decisions in Croke\u2019s Reports are unsafe precedents for the law of slander at the present day. The same witness hoAvever testified that the defendant said on another occasion, \u201c <em>something like he did before, </em>as that he Avas <em>no doctor, </em>that he behaved ungentlemanly, and took patients out of his hands.\u201d Were this not qualified by reference to something said before, the Avords \u201cno doctor,\u201d Avouldhave furnished matter for the jury; but the reference to the former colloquium, conclusively indicated that no more Avas meant than a repetition of the former charge. The proof therefore did not support the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Cited by Counsel, 9 Harris, 523.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
