One of them, made by the plaintiff, sot forth his cause of action, and concluded as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b8-6\">\u201cThis deponent also declares, that the said defendant told this deponent, about three weeks since, that he intended to quit the Commonwealth, and, as the deponent believes, without leaving sufficient real or jersonal estate therein to satisfy the demand of the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b8-7\">The other <em>a </em>.xdavit was made by one Jervis, who stated at the commencement of it, that he had been in the employ of the plaintiff, who was a manufacturer, between one and two years; and after detailing the circumstances which gave rise to the action, concluded in the following words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b8-8\">\u201c This deponent also declares, that the said defendant is about to quit the Commonwealth, without leaving sufficient real or personal estate therein to satisfy the demand of the above-named plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b8-10\">Mr. <em>U.

He cited the case of <em>Diehl </em>v. <em>Perie, </em><footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> (stated in 1st Troubat &amp; Haly\u2019s Practice, p. 175,) where the District Court of Philadelphia held that the word <em>or </em>in the act of 1836, must be construed <em>and; </em>so that an affidavit, concluding .to the best of the deponent\u2019s knowledge <em>or </em>belief, was insufficient. He also cited <em>Boyer </em>v. M\u2018Culloh, (1 Penn. Rep. 421); <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Crabb, </em>(2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Wharton\u2019s Rep; 181); <em>Jewell </em>v. <em>Hoar. </em>(3 Watts, 144); <em>Whitehill </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>(1 Watts, 396); <em>Boas </em>v. <em>Nagle, </em>(3 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 250.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b9-6\">Mr. <em>Senderson, contra,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A98\">contended that the two affidavits made together a sufficient foundation for the <em>capias.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b8-14\"> Incorrectly printed <em>or </em>in the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b8-15\"> Reported 2 Miles, 47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b9-7\">The Court quashed the writ, on the ground that the affidavit of the plaintiff was insufficient, and that the other deponent was not such an agent as the act of assembly contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-8\">Capias quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
