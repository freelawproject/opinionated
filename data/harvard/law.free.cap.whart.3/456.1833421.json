P saw Syndonia Jamison execute the mortgage. P saw Hugh Jamison execute the mortgage also. Michael Rapp the other subscribing witness is dead. P am a justice of the peace. The mortgage was acknowledged before me, as a justice of the peace, by Plugh Jamison and Syndonia Jamison. P took the acknowledgment.\u201d And on being cross-examined he testified as <em>follows: </em>\u2014 \u201c This transaction took place at the house of Plugh Jamison. Syndonia Jamison was examined before it was acknowledged. Her husband was then unwell and in bed. P took her out of the room from her husband. She said it was done of her own free will and accord, and that she had at first proposed it. This was before she signed it. We then went back in the room and they both signed it. P read it to both in the hearing of the husband and wife before P took her out of the room. When we went back in the room they both signed it, and P took the acknowledgment in the room with her husband. I took the.acknowledgment of them both in the room in the presence of each other. John Jamison the brother of the plaintiff, the plaintiff, and Michael Rapp the other witness, were in the room when P took the acknowledgment. Robert Jamison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>took possession of the mortgage before we left tbe room, after giving them tbe money. I think the mortgage remained in my possession till they got the matter arranged. This was not long, not half an hour. I think it was ten minutes. I think it was only while they were counting out the money it remained in my possession, or perhaps it might have remained on the table. There was nothing done by Syndonia Jamison except signing the mortgage, that I recollect of. Robert Jamison took possession of the mortgage before Syndonia Jamison left the room. The acknowledgment of Syndonia Jamison which I took was in the room where she signed it. They lived in the room. Hugh Jamison was in bed. He sat upon the side of the bed to sign it. He was sick, he never got well after that. I don\u2019t know who counted the money. I can\u2019t tell how much money was counted. There was a note that Robert Jamison had against Hugh Jamison that went in part, but I don\u2019t recollect what amount. This transaction was in the evening after candle-light. When I took the acknowledgment of Mrs. Jamison she stood along side of the bed. The land on which the mortgage was given was the land she inherited of her father. The money was paid down on the table, I believe, and a request made by Syndonia to John Jami-son and myself, that we should take a part of it and pay it to the sheriff. We did so. I have not a recollection how much we took. The sheriff had an execution against Hugh Jamison. The acknowledgment of the mortgage I have mentioned, was when Hugh Jamison was sitting *on the side of his bed and Syndonia standing by it. There was no other taken after the execution of the mortgage. There was no other acknowledgment of the mortgage by Mrs. Jamison excepting the one in the entry before we went in to sign it. The acknowledgment by the bedside was that of Hugh Jamison and Syndonia also. There is an acknowledgment on the mortgage in writing, signed by me. I can\u2019t say positively when the mortgage was delivered to Robert Jamison; can\u2019t be positive in regard to who delivered it to him. Mrs. Jamison was up and took an active part. Her husband was not out of bed. . I wrote the mortgage.

At common law, a married woman cannot alien her lands, *nor bind her interest in them, except by fine; and all her acts during coverture are void. 1 Black. Com. 444; 1 Penn. Blac. 223, 404; 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 303. In this state, she cannot convey or bind her lands in any other manner than that prescribed by the act of 1770. 2 Binn. 341. This act only authorizes the \u201c estate of the wife,\u201d \u201c which she shall incline to dispose of,\u201d to be \u201cpassed and conveyed,\u201d by a \u201cdeed or conveyance,\u201d \u201cfor the lands, tenements and hereditaments intended to be passed and conveyed;\u201d acknowledged according to the act. Pur. Dig. 252, (16.) The idea, of \u201c conveyance\u201d embraces a transfer of that title, not to return; and \u201c deed,\u201d an absolute assignment of title and possessory right. 2 Penn. Rep. 23. A mortgage is not within the meaning of the act. The mortgagor continues to be the owner of the lands mortgaged. The mortgagee has no interest in them. His interest cannot be bound by a judgment, nor taken in execution. A mortgage is only a <em>chose in action </em>\u2014 a mere evidence of a debty or security for the payment of money. 4 Rawle, 255; 1 Rawle, 325, 328, 355, 356; 3 Penn. Rep. 244; 2 Rawle, 66; 1 Binn. 177; 1 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 317; 7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 419; 9 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 303; 11 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 223; 4 Kent\u2019s Comm. 153; 2 Penn. Rep. 23. If an instrument is in substance only evidence of, or security for a debt, and in law transfers no interest in lands, it is immaterial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>what form or name it may have. A mortgage of husband and wife is therefore a mere contract or promise for the payment or security of money, and so far as she is concerned, rests on no better footing than a bond, note, or joint promise made during coverture, for the payment of money; none of which could be enforced against her after her husband\u2019s death. 2 Penn. Rep. 410, 49; 1 Watts, 229. It has never been decided by this Court, that the mortgage of a <em>feme covert </em>will bind her lands after her husband\u2019s death. Such a decision would be in conflict with all the cases referred to. [Gibson, C. J. It has been decided that a mortgage executed by a woman during coverture will bind her lands.] None of our books contain any such case. No such decision has been reported. I have made the most diligent search in my power, and have been unable to find any thing of the kind in the books. If the question has been determined by this Court, I will not pursue the argument. [Rogers, J. The question has been decided.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-6\">2. If <em>a feme covert </em>may bind her lands by mortgage, I contend that Syndonia Jamison is not a party to the mortgage on which the <em>scire facias </em>issued. She is not named in the premises, nor joined with her husband in the operative words, or granting part of the instrument. She must be joined with him in conveying a title which proceeds from her. No grant has been made by her, nor has she agreed to grant any thing. In deeds, all matters must be legally set out. 2 B. C. 297-8. The forms which the wisdom of has settled must be observed. A deed does <em>n\u00b0t </em>operate in <em>favour </em>of one *who is not named in the premises, or operative clause of the \u201c If. the thing granted be only in the habendum, and not in the premises the deed will not pass it.\u201d 1 Shep. Touchstone, 76; 4 Cruise on Real Property, tit. 32, chap. 3, sec. 44, 51-52; 3 Preston on Abstracts of Title, 25, 41, 43; 7 Petersdorff\u2019s Ab. 676. Eor the same reason, a deed will not operate against one not named in the premises, nor the thing mentioned pass from him. The words must import a grant. If a married woman sign and seal a deed with her husband in which her name if not otherwise mentioned, it does not bar her right of dower. 9 Mass. Rep. 220. If the wife\u2019s name be mentioned in the conclusion of the deed only, she will not be barred of her dower. 13 Mass. 223. These cases are decisive of the present question. In the case of <em>Lithgow </em>v. Cavenagh, (9 Mass. Rep. 161, 172,) the deed in which the wife\u2019s name was not otherwise mentioned, which was duly acknowledged, had the following conclusion: \u201cI, the said A., and S. my wife, in token of her full, free, and entire relinquishment of all her right to the said granted premises, have hereunto, set our hands and seals,\u201d and it was held, that this was no con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>veyance of the wife's interest in the lands. This case goes much further than the one before the Court requires. The words of the deed must import a grant by the wife. No words importing a consent only will bind her. If the principles on which the cases cited rest, be sound, the mortgage in this case is no conveyance, and is insufficient to pass or bind the estate of Syndonia Jamison.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-6\">3. We also contend, that the certificate of acknowledgment, on its face, is defective, and insufficient to bind the estate of Mrs. Jamison. The act requires, that the <em>feme </em>covert, on her separate examination, (besides other things,) shall \u201c declare that she did voluntarily and of her own free will and accord, seal, and as her act and deed deliver the said deed or conveyance,\u201d &amp;c., without any coercion or compulsion, &amp;c. Purd. Dig. 252, (16). And this must be certified by the officer taking the acknowledgment. 1 Watts, 322. Deeds of <em>feme coverts, </em>so acknowledged and certified, are declared to be valid. Of course, all others are void. In this certificate, the word \u201cacknowledged\u201d is substituted for the words \u201cas her act and deed delivered.\u201d These words are a substantial part of the act. It does not appear by the certificate, that the wife declared that she \u201c as her act and deed delivered\u201d the mortgage, as required. Delivery is absolutely essential to the validity of a deed. This is the reason this declaration is required. \u201cAcknowledged\u201d is not synonymous with or equivalent to, the words omitted. If this word will imply delivery of the deed, it will also as well imply the several other requisites of the act, the omission of any one of which has always been held to be fatal. 1 Binn. 470, 480; 4 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 272; 6 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 49, 145; 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 303; 9 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 268; 10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 446; 14 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 84; 15 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 72. There is no case in which the words omitted have</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"pA1J\">been ^dispensed with. In <em>M'Intire </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>(5 Bi296,) which goes further than any other case, the words</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATfB\">\u201c acknowledged the premises to be the right of the grantee\u201d were held sufficient. This case has never been approved of, and was for a long time considered by the profession as overruling <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>(1 Binn. 470). In <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>(6 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 49,) the Court declared, that but for the practice and authorities they would adhere to the letter, and would not go beyond the cases determined. To sustain this certificate, the Court must go much further than <em>M'Intyre </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>or any other precedent, and conflict with the principles settled in <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Mercer.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-7\">4. The parol testimony of James Cummings of his appointment as a justice, when he took the acknowledgment, was incom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>petent under notice given. The best evidence (Ms commission) ought to have been produced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-6\">5. If the certificate of acknowledgment is on its face not defective, we contend it was only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the facts set forth in it, and not conclusive; and that the Court erred in overruling the testimony of the justice, who took the acknowledgment, who was offered to prove that Mrs. Jamison did not acknowledge the mortgage after its execution, separate and apart from her husband, nor make tbe. declarations specified in tbe certificate. Tbe law requires, not only that tbe certificate should set out that tbe <em>feme covert </em>was separately examined, &amp;c., but also, that tbe examination shall in fact be separate. Both are required. Tbe law is mandatory; and is as plain as is positive. A deed of husband and wife, not separately acknowledged by tbe wife, is void against her. 10 Serg. and Rawle, 446. This requisite has been interposed by tbe law for tbe protection of tbe wife\u2019s rights, and cannot be dispensed with. 4 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 272-274. \u201cA married woman cannot convey her land in any other manner than is prescribed by our acts of assembly.\u201d 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 808. . \u201cA separate examination is essential.\u201d Tbe law protects a married woman by giving her \u201c an opportunity of disclosing her mind to tbe magistrate, out of tbe presence of her husband. Tbe act therefore directs this examination of tbe wife to be separate and apart from her husband; and in this the magistrate has no discretion.\u201d 9 Serg. &amp; Rawle, -273, 274. \u201c A wife is not barred of her dower, if she is not separately examined.\u201d 5 Serg. <em>k </em>Rawle, 289. Our books are'full of decisions to the same point. By tbe whole current of decisions in this Court, supported by unanswerable reasoning, it is settled, that a separate examination in fact, is indispensable to bar- a married woman\u2019s rights in land. No contradictory authority can be produced. Hence it follows, that tbe certificate is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence ; that tbe fact may be inquired into; and it is error in tbe Court to refuse such evidence. Neither tbe acts of assembly, nor tbe authorities, confine *us to tbe certificate. To make certificates conclusive, would be to commit tbe rights of <em>femes covert </em>to tbe mercy of every ignorant magistrate, and give them a discretion in a matter in which this Court has declared \u201ctbe magistrate bad no discretion.\u201d Tbe guards which tbe law has provided for tbe protection of tbe rights of married women, would then be rendered a mere mockery, and, in tbe words of tbe present Chief Justice, <em>([Evans </em>v. <em>Commonwealth,) </em>tbe Court might as \u201c well dispense with tbe separate examination altogether.\u201d Tbe time of tbe examination is also as material as tbe manner. Tbe act requires tbe examination to be taken \u201cafter\u201d tbe execution of tbe deed. If taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>in fact before, it will not avail. If a law requires that a jury shall view after being sworn, it is fatal to their proceedings to view before they are sworn; because \u201cthe law is so. written.\u201d <em>2 </em>Penn. Rep. 207. For the same reason this also may be inquired into. This Court has never allowed the defeet of a certificate to be supplied or patched up by parol evidence; because, if the acknowledgment was proven to have been in fact taken correctly, the certificate, which the law requires should contain all the particulars, would still be defective, and the deed void against the wife. But it has never been settled, that you shall not impeach the certificate of acknowledgment; that is yet undetermined. There is nothing in the way to overturn, review or modify. In none of the cases in our books, except <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Maffit, </em>(5 Serg. <em>k </em>Rawle, 523,) was there any attempt to prove that the facts were untruly certified. Why may you not impeach the certificate of the justice ? There is nothing sacred in it: it is not a record. To make it conclusive, will be to deprive a married woman of all protection, in regard to her property. In the language of the Court, (10 Serg. <em>k </em>Rawle, 878,) in relation to the certificate of a notary public, \u201c it would be highly dangerous, and going far beyond the object of the legislature, to declare it to be conclusive.\u201d A notary public is appointed and commissioned in the same manner, and holds his office on the same tenure, a justice does. He is required to keep a register of all his acts. His official seal must have the arms of the commonwealth engraved on it, and other devices. Yet it is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence, and may be impeached and contradicted. 10 Serg. <em>k </em>Rawle, 378. And the notary himself may be compelled to testify against the statement of his certificate, and contradict the facts set forth therein. 12 Serg. <em>&amp; </em>Rawle, 284. A justice is not required to keep a register of such acknowledgments ; and none is kej)t. He is not required to have an official seal. Justices use only a private or ink seal, and generally only a scroll or flourish of the pen is attached to their certificates. On a comparison in every particular, their certificates would seem to be entitled to much less regard than those of notaries. If a notary\u2019s certificate maybe contradicted, <em>a fortiori, </em>a justice\u2019s may. The justice was the most proper person to testify to the transaction, because the particular *circumstances, in almost every instance, must rest exclusively in the knowledge of the officer. 10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 378. The certificate should not be make conclusive, but on considerations of public policy, and only in cases in which <em>bona fide </em>purchasers without notice, or third persons, had become interested. The same reasons would not hold where the original parties are concerned. <em>Caveat emptor </em>applies as well to such a case as this, as to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>other. A grantee or mortgagee is as much bound to see to his title in this particular, as in any other. \u201c If he will not look to his title, he must suffer.\u201d 6 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 51. Here the mortgage has not passed out of the hands of the mortgagee, who was not only bound to know, but in fact witnessed the whole transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-6\">But this question seems to have been settled in the case of <em>Jones </em>v. Maffit, (5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 523, 534, 535,) in which parol evidence was admitted to prove that the examination of the wife was not in fact separate, although so certified; but the party failed in his proof. Upon the evidence, (the Court say,) \u201c the examination was separate and apart from the husband. There was no evidence that he was in such a state that he could hear the examination.\u201d There was no evidence that contradicted the certificate. The validity of the deed was put on that fact. Only a <em>prima facie </em>import was given to the certificate \u2014 not a word about its conclusiveness. The Court also say, \u201cif there had been any evidence that the magistrate designedly permitted the husband to be present, to intimidate the wife, it would have effected the acknowledgment.\u201d Here the husband was permitted to be present, under circumstances well calculated to intimidate. Upon the principles of the cases cited, the defendant below had a right to impeach and contradict the certificate; and the Court erred in overruling the testimony offered for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-7\">6. The Court also erred in charging the jury to take the certificate as conclusive evidence of the separate examination of the wife, and other facts set forth in it, and to disregard the testimony of the justice, received Avithout objection, which contradicted and disproved the statements set forth in the certificate. This was directing the jury to be governed by Avhat was proven to be false.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-8\">As to the assent, which it is intimated Mrs. Jamison has given to the mortgage, that is nugatory. A <em>feme covert </em>can give no consent, nor do any act which will bind her or her lands, except in the manner provided by law. 9 Mass. Rep. 172, 220; 13 Mass. Rep. 223. Nor AArould a chancellor carry into effect any deed on such grounds, in opposition to the positive enactments of the legislature. DoAver and all the interests of married women have been favourites of the law. Our legislature and Courts have always shown a disposition to protect their interests against the rapacity of their husbands and their creditors. The current of legislation still runs strong in this Avay. The law noAV does not allow the proceds of the real estate *of the wife\u2019s ancestors to be paid to him, until she goes before a judge of the Court \u2014 not a justice of the peace \u2014 and makes a declaration of her voluntary consent, AYhich is to be filed of record. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>This court will not retrograde, nor set up a judicial decision against these judicial principles and the spirit of all our legislation. The necessity of some more adequate provision for the protection of the property of <em>femes covert, </em>and to restrain the husband from getting possession of the wife\u2019s estate, has often been intimated from this bench, and that in some instances it was not a matter of regret that some circumstances merely formal were omitted, that saved the wife and family from rapacity. In this case there is enough both formal and substantial to save this woman from poverty. 4 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 272, &amp;c.; 6 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 50, &amp;c.; 9 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 273, &amp;c.

Dyer, 89, b. ; Rolle\u2019s Abr. 757.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-7\">Mr. <em>Mallery </em>was heard in reply.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"pAuS\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b477-8\">Sergeant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AI4\">The first and third bills of exceptions, and a portion of the charge of the Court, raise the question, whether the certificate of the justice pf the peace of the acknowledgment by the husband and wife, was conclusive as to all matters legally contained in it, so that the defendant was not at liberty to prove by parol evidence, that the mortgage was not acknowledged by her before the justice, in the manner it purports to have been, and thus destroy its validity. This point has not perhaps been expressly ruled, but the principle has been repeatedly recognised, that the certificate of the judge or justice, as to the acknowledgment of a deed by a married woman, is to be judged of solely by what appears on the face of the certificate itself; and that parol evidence of what passed at the time of such acknowledgment, is not to be received, except in cases of fraud and imposition. In <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Baily, </em>(1 Binn. 470,) the acknowledgment being held to be defective and not to pass the estate of the wife, the defendants offered to produce evidence of parol declarations by the wife, that she executed the deed voluntarily; and that if it was not sufficient, *she would execute and acknowledge it over again, or do other act to make the thing good. The evidence was held to be inadmissible. This case was recognised, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>and the same decision made in <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>(9 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 268). \u201c There would be no certainty in titles,\u201d says Tilghman, C. J., \u201c if that kind of evidence were permitted. The law directs the magistrate to make his certificate in writing, and he has made it. ' To that the world is to look and to nothing else.\u201d And again in <em>Barnet </em>v. <em>Barnet, </em>(15 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 73); he says, \u201c The third error assigned, is in the rejection of parol evidence offered by the defendant, to prove that when the demand-ant made her acknowledgment, she knew the contents of the deed, and received eight dollars from E. Barnet for executing the deed. That such evidence was inadmissible, was decided by this Court in the case of <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Baily. </em>There may be cases of gross fraud in which parol evidence would be received, unless the land had passed into the hands of a purchaser for valuable consideration, without notice of the fraud.\u201d These decisions all show that the defendant is not permitted to prove by parol evidence, that the magistrate\u2019s certificate does not contain the whole truth, even when the. object of such evidence is to support the deed. I can see no distinction between these cases, and that in which the defendant endeavours to show by parol evidence, that the certificate of the magistrate contains what is not the truth, and thus falsify it, for the purpose of destroying the deed. The judge or justice of the peace in taking an acknowledgment acts judicially, not ministerially. The law imposes on him the duty of ascertaining by his own view and examination, the truth of the matters to which he is to certify, and points out precisely his duty. Having thus entrusted him to see that the proper forms are observed, his solemn certificate that they have been observed, on the faith of which parties act, contracts are proceeded in, moneys are paid, and deeds accepted, must (in the absence of fraud or collusion,) he considered as entitled to full faith and credit; and cannot, without rendering titles to real estate exceedingly insecure, be left at any distance of time afterwards, to the uncertainty and frailty of parol proof, and to all the mistakes, prejudices, imperfections, and hazards that attend it. Eor these reasons, I -am of opinion, that the Court below was right in refusing to permit the plaintiff to produce parol evidence to controvert the magistrate\u2019s certificate, and in charging the jury that it was conclusive evidence that the defendant acknowledged the mortgage as required by law.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">2. The mortgage is objected to, first, because the wife did not grant her estate; and, secondly, it is said that she was not a party to the indenture of mortgage, and, therefore, could convoy nothing by it. The indenture is certainly informal in the promises, so far as respects the wife, in not making her one of the grantors in the indenture, in the manner usually practised. But the omission of all or any of the formal parts of a deed, does not destroy its validity, *where sufficient appears on its face to show, that those having an interest intend to convey it, and they join in sealing the instrument. The office of the <em>premises </em>in a deed, is, rightly to name the grantor and grantee, and to comprehend the certainty of the thing granted. The office of the <em>habendum </em>is to set down again the name of the grantee, the estate that.is to be made and limited, or the time that the grantee shall have in the thing granted or demised, and to what use. But the deed that does usually consist of all these parts, may be good notwithstanding some of them be omitted, and if it be not so formally made; for an estate may be made by a deed without any <em>habendum </em>at all: and if the name of the grantee be \u25a0 not contained in the premises, yet if it be in the <em>habendum, </em>it may be good enough. Shep. Touch. 73. In the present instance, Mrs. Jamison joined in this instrument by executing and acknowledging it; and though she is not named in the premises, yet the premisfes describe the whole land by metes and bounds, and grant and convey it and also all the estate, right, title, interest, use, possession, property, claim and demand whatsoever, of them the <em>said Robert Jamison </em>and <em>Syndonia his wife, </em>of, in, to, or out of 'the same; \u201cto have and to hold the said described sixty-five acres and sixty-one perches \u00f3f land, <em>hereditaments and premises, </em>hereby granted,\u201d &amp;c., with a clause of redemption in favour of both. At the conclusion is the clause, \u201c in witness whereof, the <em>said parties </em>to those presents, have interchangeably set their hands and seals;\u201d and both the husband and the wife sealed the indenture.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">It would seem to be apparent on the face of this instrument, that her interest as well as his, was intended to be conveyed. It cannot be supposed that the husband alone intended to convey the estate of his wife. That could only be done by her. And as it is plain her interest was intended to be conveyed, and the indenture could not have effect except by her conveyance, such must be deemed the operation of the instrument, in order to give effect to the intention of the parties. The leading rule of construction of deeds is, in all cases, that the construction be favourable, and as near to the minds and apparent intent of the parties as possibly it may be, and the law will permit. Shep. Touch. 83; Co. Litt. 313; Plow. 154, 160. And another rule is, that the construction be upon the entire deed, and that one part of it doth help to expound another, and that every word, (if it may be,) may take effect and none he rejected, and that all the parts do agree together, and there be no discordance therein. Shep. Touch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>84. Another rule is, that the construction be such as that the whole deed, and every part of it, may take effect, and as much effect as may be to that purpose for which it is made. Ib. 84. And this is a rule both in law and equity. 1 Pr. Wms. 457. For these reasons, I am of opinion, that the mortgage was sufficient to pass as well the interest of Mrs. Jamison as of her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"pA8GP\">*In Nation to another part of this objection, that this is an indenture between parties, and she not being-named in the premises as a party, is a stranger to the deed, which has no operation as to her, the rule is, that a stranger executing a deed-poll or an indenture not <em>inter partes </em>is bound by it, and may also take advantage of it. But where the deed is <em>inter partes, </em>he who is a party to the deed, cannot covenant with another who is no party. But if a mere stranger, not named a party, (where the instrument is <em>inter partes,) </em>covenants with another who is named, and seals the deed, he is bound by such sealing. This distinction, is taken by Holt, C. J., in <em>Salter </em>v. <em>Kidley, </em>(Carth. 76,) and has been often made. See the cases collected in Platt on Covenants, 7, Law Library, January 1834, and 13 Vin. Ab. 52 to 57. In the case of <em>Salter </em>v. <em>Kidley, </em>above mentioned, which is also reported in 1 Show. 56, and Holt 210, covenant was brought on certain articles of agreement, between J. S. of the one part, and C. R. of the same county, by which J. S. let a house to C. R. at a yearly rent, which C. R. agreed to pay, \u201c and that said rent'may be satisfied, I, John Kidley do covenant for myself, &amp;c. on behalf of said 0. R., to pay,\u201d &amp;c., which deed was sealed by C. R. and Kidley the defendant. It was argued that the defendant was not bound by this covenant, because he was not a party to the deed; and it is a rule in law, that he who is not a party to the deed,- can neither give nor take any thing by it, except by way of remainder. 3 Cro. 76; 2 Inst. 673; 2 Rolle\u2019s Ab. 220; 3 Cro. 359; 1 Inst. 352; Roll. 72; 3 Lev. 138; 2 Lev. 74. But Holt, C. J. said, \u201cWhy cannot a man oblige himself by a deed, if there be express words for it, and he seals it ? Suppose at the end of an indenture it be \u2018 And be it known unto all men, that A. B. for himself covenants &amp;c.\u2019 and he puts his seal to it, why should not this oblige him? A man cannot take immediately when he is not a party; but where do you find that a man cannot give without being a party? In a deed of feoffment a warrant of attorney to A. not a party, is good now, though formerly held to be otherwise.\u201d And the Court was clear in opinion, that the action should lie against the defendant on this deed. So in Perkins, sec. 158, \u201cit hath been holden, that a man shall be bounden by the speaking, if another man, by averment thereof, in putting his seal to it, and delivering of it as his deed.\u201d And in section 159, \u201c and it is to be known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>that at this day, a man shall be bounden by putting his seal unto a deed indented, and delivery of the same, and yet the words within the deed are spoken by another man.\u201d I am, therefore, of opinion, that the defendant\u2019s interest passed by the sealing and acknowledgment of the mortgage, though she was not named as a party in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">It has been further contended, that a married woman has no power to mortgage her lands. It is believed, however, that nothing has been more usual in Pennsylvania, than for husband and wife to *mortgage the wife\u2019s lands, by the ordinary mode of conveyance in mortgage, acknowledged according to the legal form; and it cannot be doubted, that the power to convey in fee simple, practised from the first settlement of the province, and recognised and established by the act of-assembly of 1770, confers the right to mortgage \u2014 since a power to grant the whole estate necessarily implies a power to grant any lesser estate. This point has been already decided by this Court, in the case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>The Harrisburg Banh, </em>determined at Chambersburg, at October term, 1831.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The form of the acknowledgment is also objected to as defective, in not complying with that which the act of assembly prescribes, in two respects; 1st, in stating that she \u201c did of her own free will and accord, seal and acknowledge the within indenture of mortgage\u201d instead of \u201c seal and deliverand 2d, in omitting the word \u2018 compulsion.\u2019 I am of opinion, however, that although these are literal deviations from the act of assembly, yet the certificate is substantially in compliance with it; and, therefore, the certificate is sufficient, according to the decisions in <em>M'Intire </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>(5 Binn. 301,) and <em>Shaller </em>v. <em>Brand, </em>(6 Binn. 435). Acknowledging a deed sealed by the party, is tantamount to a delivery of it, if none had been made before. A delivery may be not only by acts, but by words without any act of delivery. Co. Litt. 36, <em>a. </em>The word \u2018coercion,\u2019 seems to be synonymous with \u2018compulsion,\u2019 and substantially to include it.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Cited by Counsel, 9 Barr, 15 ; 7 Harris, 406 ; 11 Id. 237 ; 3 Casey, 24: 1 Grant, 404 ; 4 Wright, 40 ; 8 Id. 230; 4 P.
