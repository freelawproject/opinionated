The Courts there require an affidavit that the bad pleading arose from error, and was not intended for delay. Id. pi. 503. The act of 1806 does not apply, because at the time of its passage these proceedings were not in the nature of civil suits. By the act of 1836, regulating proceedings upon <em>quo warranto, </em>the method of proceeding is the same, whether it is at the suit of an individual, or of the commonwealth. Amendments must be allowed in both cases, or not at all.

Wolfe, come into Court, protesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>that the suggestion aforesaid is not sufficient in law, and that they are not under necessity, by the laws of the land, to answer thereto.; for a plea they, nevertheless, say, that on the ninth day of January, one thousand *eight hundred and thirty-seven, they were duly elected and chosen directors of the Philadelphia Savings Institution, agreeably to the original charter created by act of assembly of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, dated the fifth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four, and to the provisions of the tenth section of the act of assembly, passed the sixteenth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-six, entitled, an act authorising John Garnber, of Dauphin county, to construct a canal or slip from the Pennsylvania canal to his furnace, and for other purposes; (of which several acts of assembly, true copies are hereto annexed for greater certainty; and to them the said respondents refer, and pray that they may severally be received .as parts of this their plea) and the said respondents thereby became and were entitled to all the rights, privileges, franchises, and offices of directors of the said corporation. And the respondents farther say, that on the first day of May, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven, they, the said respondents, were again duly elected and chosen directers of the said corporation, by the members thereof, convened for that purpose, agreeably to the provisions of a resolution of the General Assembly of the- commonwealth of Pennsylvania, passed on the night of the 3d of April, 1837, entitled, \u201c a resolution relative to removing the Schuylkill Bank at Port Carbon to Pottsville;\u201d and to resolutions of the said corporation, passed at meetings of the directors thereof, duly convened and held on the 20th, 24th, and 28th days of April, 1837; (of which resolutions, copies are, for greater certainty, hereto annexed, to which the respondents refer, and pray that they may be received as part of this their plea) and on the 2d day of May, 1837, at a meeting of the directors of the said corporation, duly convened and held, it was resolved, that in case the said last mentioned election should prove to have been irregular and illegal; then in obedience to the fourth section of the charter of incorporation, the persons so elected continue to hold and exercise their offices by virtue of their election in January preceding. And the respondents aver, that they were, on and before the 1st day of January, 1837, and have so continued to be, stockholders; and on and before the 1st day of May, 1837, they were, and have so continued to be, members of the said Philadelphia Savings Institution, agreeably to the acts of assembly and by-laws aforesaid; and since the said elections, respectively, they, the said respondents, have used, during all the said time, and still use, the liberties, franchises, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>offices, and privileges of directors of the said corporation, as they well might, and still may: without this \u2014 that the said respondents have usurped, or now usurp, the said franchises, offices, liberties, and privileges of the said corporation, in manner and form, as by the suggestion aforesaid is supposed \u2014 all which they are ready to verify.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">And the said respondents expressly deny, that the members of the said corporation at the time or times stated in the said suggestion, or *at any other time or times whatever, at a general meeting of the members thereof duly convened and held, passed and enacted certain by-laws of the said corporation as set forth in the said suggestion, and termed respectively, \u201cLaw 5.\u201d And the respondents expressly deny that any such by-laws in substance or in letter are in force or existence as by-laws, regulations, enactments, or resolutions of the said corporation. On the contrary, the said respondents aver, that on the sixth day of February, 1837, certain by-laws were enacted by-the directors of the said corporation in pursuance 'of the authority vested in them by law, whereof a true copy is hereto annexed (which the respondents refer to, and pray may . be received as part of this their plea,) among which by-laws is law 4. Whereby it is provided, that every person holding one share of stock shall be a member of the said institution, and that upon a transfer of such stock, such person shall cease to be a member. And at a meeting of the said directors duly held and convened on the 24th day of April, 1837, the said code of laws passed on the sixth day of February, 1837, was confirmed and re-enacted, and the by-laws which were passed previously to the sixth day of February, 1837, and had not been legally repealed, were then repealed agreeably to the resolutions and enactments, of which copies are hereto annexed, to which the respondents refer, and pray that they may be received as parts of this their plea. Which several by-laws are inconsistent with, and contradictory to the alleged by-laws \u201c5,\u201d stated by the relators to have been duly passed and enacted, and to remain in full force and unrepealed; and the respondents aver that the by-laws, so by them stated to have been enacted by the directors, are and remain in full force and virtue, unaltered and unrepealed.

The respondents set up two inconsistent titles to the offices they hold. In <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>(8 Mod. 180,) a plea of right by prescription, and also by charter, was held to be inconsistent and bad. So, also, are the cases of <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Weymouth, </em>(7 Mod. 374; s. c. 4 Bro. Parl. Cas. 464); <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Leigh, </em>(4 Burr. 2143); <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Grymes, </em>(4 Burr. 2147); <em>Symmers </em>v. <em>Regem, </em>(Cowper, 506). Here the respondents claim, first, under the election of May, 1837, and then under the 4th section of the charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-18\">2. The respondents aver merely that they were \u201c duly elected\u201d directors, without setting outth^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>law No. 4, by which every person holding one share of stock was made a member, was a good by-law. By the original charter, the control of the institution was with the members alone, and such was the construction given to it by this Court. (1 Whar^on 868.) The *aet of 16th June, 1836, certainly did not <em>propria vigore, </em>make the stockholders members; and this must have been the opinion of the respondents when they passed this by-law. It has been decided that the 2d clause of this by-law is invalid; and the rule is, that if part of a by-law is invalid, the i^hole is so. <em>Case of the Taylors of Ipswich, </em>(11 Rep. 54, <em>a.); Norris </em>v. <em>Staps, </em>(Hob. 211); <em>Dodwell </em>v. <em>Oxford, </em>(2 Ventris, 34); <em>Guilford </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>(Id. 248). This by-law is also bad, because it violates the constitution of the society. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>(3 Burr. 1827); <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Cutbush, </em>(4 Burr. 2204); <em>The King </em>v. <em>Ginever, </em>(6 Term Rep. 733); Angell on Corporations, 177, 199.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-5\">Mr. <em>Chew </em>and Mr. <em>I.

P. 210.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-6\">1. The general rule as to duplicity in pleading is, that the plea is bad where two distinct inconsistent defences are set up. Many circumstances, however, may be alleged, which together form but one plea. (Popham, 186.) Mere surplusage in a plea, will not vitiate. (1 Sid. 135.) Here if one election be established the averment of the other is surplusage. <em>Lawyne </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>(Moore, 297). The respondents do not say that they hold under the elections of January <em>and </em>May. The resolution of the directors is in the alternative. The averment is a mere relation of necessary incidents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-7\">2. It is alleged that the manner of the election is not sufficiently set forth. This is purely a technical objection. It is not necessary to aver more than the nature of the right by which the election'was held; as by charter or prescription. The record would be grievously burdened if the particulars of every election eiiklo be detailed. The cases cited on the other side do not</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>4. Tbe question whether these stockholders have a right to membership, seems to be settled by the opinion of the Court in 1 Wharton\u2019s Rep. 467, 468, where Judge Rogers, says, that the legislature has granted to the directors power to elect such persons as members as <em>they </em>may deem best fitted to carry into effect the objects of the charter. By the 5th section of the charter, the directors acquired this power, which was necessary to the existence of the corporation. *The act of 1836, in effect, made all the stockholders members, and such was plainly the intention. The rights acquired under that act were'not invalidated by the resolution of the legislature of April, 1837. It required an election to be held in May, but could not retrospectively affect the election of January, 1837. The by-law No. 4, disfranchised no one; it merely created new members, and specified the terms on which they should continue such. There is nothing in the charter or in the general law of corporations, to prevent the election of fifty or one hundred members at once.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-8\">Mr. <em>Meredith </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6F\">It is laid down in the books, that upon a disclaimer judgment is to be entered for the king. (Angell, 499.) It has been argued that the relators must recover on the strength of their own title. The proceeding, however, is on the part of the commonwealth; and therefore the reverse is the rule. Hagner\u2019s answer is in effect a disclaimer. If it is not, it is bad, as it amounts merely to the plea of <em>non umrpqmt.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-9\">The plea of the defendants relies on <em>both </em>the elections. The ' respondents were only called to answer why they held the offices, &amp;c. since the 1st of May, 1837. The objection therefore is substantial. The <em>manner </em>of the election also is material. The object of the writ is, by its terms, to ascertain by what right they hold; and it requires some explanation of the method by which they were \u201cduly elected.\u201d The charter requires thirteen directors, whereas eleven only are shown to be elected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-10\">The act of 1836, merely gave a right of voting to the stockholders. If it made them members, so much the worse for them, since it is repealed, and it is admitted that all powers created by it cease to exist. The by-laws made in pursuance of it, of course fall with it. The by-law is repugnant to tt \u00bfbarter, <em>since it </em>ma tea* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>It clearly is not, since the act of admission must be deliberate, and implies choice and discrimination.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b234-10\"> See 1 Wharton\u2019s Kep. 461.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b246-7\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgB\">This is a writ of <em>quo warranto, </em>issued by leave of Court, at the suggestion of Peter Eritz et al. commanding William Gill and others, to show by what authority they exercise the offices, and liberties, of directors of the Philadelphia *Savings Institution; and in the latter case, by what authority they claim to be <em>members </em>of the institution. The respondents have filed a plea in bar, to which the relators have demurred specially.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The case, as it appears from the pleadings, is this. On the 5th of April, 1834, the legislature incorporated the Philadelphia Savings Institution. In the first section, the persons therein named, viz. Peter Eritz and others, and all and every person or persons thereafter becoming members of the institution, are created a corporation by the name and style of the Philadelphia Savings Institution. By the fifth seetipn, the directors have power to provide for the admission of members, and furnishing proofs of such admission. The act also provides for a meeting of the members and choosing thirteen directors from among them, to manage the affairs of the institution. This act received a judicial construction at the March term 1836, when, among other things it was resolved, 1st. That stockholders were' not, as such, members of the corporation; and 2d. That persons originally members, continued to be such, although they never possessed stock, or had parted with it. After this decision, viz. on the 16th of June 1836, the legislature enacted, that the third section of the 4th article of an act, entitled, an act to recharter certain banks, which directs the mode of voting for directors be extended to this institution; and that, therefore, stockholders shall bo eligible.for directors, and that every depositor of six months standing shall be entitled to one vote for every one hundred dollars he or she shall have in the institution. And it also provides, that the election for directors shall be held on the second Monday in January next, and annually thereafter. This act gave \u2014 and denositors the right of voting, and the for- \" .Airactors, a right which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>institution. With the exceptions of those specific changes, the charter remains as before. By the authority of this act, on the 9th of January, 1837, the respondents in the first <em>quo warranto </em>were elected directors; and on the 6th of February, of the same year, they passed the by-laws Nos. 4 and 32, that every person holding one share of stock, shall be a member of the institution, and upon a transfer of such stock, such person shall cease to be a member; and that the proof of the admission of members shall be furnished by their appearing on the books to be stockholders. Various other by-laws were passed, viz. by-laws, Nos. 33, 34, and the by-laws adopted the 28th April 1837, referred to in the pleas in bar, but which it is immaterial to notice. On the 3d of April, 1837, the legislature repealed *the 10th section of the act before referred to, and further enacted, that the company shall elect the directors on the first Monday in May, and the first Monday in every May thereafter, annually. The respondents aver, that on the 9th day of January, 1837, they were duly elected, and chosen directors, agreeably to the original charter, and to the provisions of the 10th section of the act of the 16th June, 1836; and that the respondents thereby became, and were entitled to all the rights, &amp;c.- of directors. They also aver, that on the first day of May 1837, (the time fixed for the election of directors by the repealing act of the 3d April, 1837,) they were again duly elected and chosen directors by the members of the institution, agreeably to the resolution of the 3d April, 1837, &amp;c. and to resolutions of the corporation, passed at meetings of the directors duly convened, and held on the 20th, 24th, and 28th April, &amp;c. And they further aver, that on the 2d day of May, 1837, at a meeting of the directors, it was resolved, that in case the said last mentioned election should prove to have been irregular and illegal, then, in obedience to the 4th section of the charter, the person so elected continue to hold and exercise their offices by virtue of the- election in the January preceding. They also aver, that they were, on or before the 1st day of January, 1837, and have so continued to be, members of the institution, agreeably to the acts of assembly, and bylaws aforesaid; and since the said elections, respectively, they have used during the said time, and still use, the liberties, franchises, &amp;c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>two alleged elections, of the 9th of January and 1st of May, 1837.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">And 3dly. The relators contend that the directors had no power under the charter to <em>admit members, </em>but that their authority extended merely to provide for their admission. If they had the power, the by-laws Nos. 4 and 32, were an improper and unreasonable exercise of that power, contrary to the fundamental principles of the charter, and therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">As to the first objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The respondents cannot, in general, aver, that they were duly elected director\u2019s; and if the plea contained nothing more than this general averment, it would be bad. The case of <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Leigh, </em>(1 Burr. 2144,) is full to this point. But the respondents, in addition, set out the times and places of the election, and aver that the first election was held in pursuance of the authority granted by the original charter, and to the provisions of the 10th section of the act before referred to, copies whereof they annexed, and made parts of their plea. It was open to the relators to demur or take issue on the fact, whether the election had been in conformity to the charter, *without being exposed to the difficulty suggested in <em>The King </em>v. <em>Birch, </em>(4 T. R. 619,) of not knowing on what fact to go down to trial. The respondents allege, that the election was held at a particular time, and aver the authority under which it was held; and this, we think makes the plea certain to a common intent, which is all the law requires in a plea in bar. Com. Dig. title Pleading, E. 7, c. 17; 1 Saund. 49, n.; 1 Chitty, 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">Then as to the second objection, viz. duplicity and uncertainty in pleading, in relying upon the alleged elections of the 9th January and 1st May, 1837.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">At the common law, it was a general rule, equally affecting declarations, pleas, replications, &amp;c., that the pleading must not be double ; that is, that no single count or plea should state two or more facts, either of which would of itself, independently of the other, constitute a sufficient ground of action, or defence; a rule founded on the principle, that it would be unnecessary and vexatious, to put the opposite party to litigate and prove two points, when one would he sufficient to establish the matter in isjgeneral, be <em>single; </em>and if Rjsonlains.. and remn're _</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Whether the respondents would have the right to rely on two titles or distinct pleas, under the statutes 4 &amp; 5 Anne, ch. 16, and 9 Anne, ch. 20, sect. 7, which extends the former to all writs of mandamus, and informations in the nature of a writ of <em>quo </em>warranto, it is unnecessary to determine. It would seem, however, that those acts, in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Newland </em>and <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Briscoe, </em>(2 Burr. 2147,) have been so construed, as not to give liberty to plead more pleas than one, even with leave of the Court. The statute of Anne, allowing double pleas, does not appear to aid a duplicity in one and the same plea, though it allows of different grounds of defence being stated in different pleas, with the exception that the pleas must not be entirely inconsistent, an exception which has been somewhat relaxed. These principles are in effect conceded, but the respondents seek to avoid their application, by the allegation, that all the facts in the plea constitute but one title; that they rely upon the election of the 1st of May, 1837 ; and that the other averments are but inducement, or surplusage, which the Court will disregard. It is undoubtedly .true, that the defendants are not precluded from introducing several matters into their plea, if they be constituent parts of the same entire defence, and form one connected proposition, or be alleged as inducement to, or as a consequence of another fact. But the facts stated in the plea are ^neither constituent parts of the same entire nor do form one connected proposition; nor can they properly be said'to be inducements to, or the consequence of another fact. The plea takes two grounds, either of which, independent of the other, would constitute a valid defence. If the election of the 1st of May, 1837, was an election in conformity to the charter, it would be a bar to the writ, or if that election was illegal, and the election of the January preceding, good, that would be a defence; for the charter expressly provides, that the directors chosen to manage the affairs of the institution, shall continue in office for twelve months, and until a new election takes place. The respondents rely upon two titles, 1st, Upon the election held on the 1st of May, 1837, when, as they allege, they were duly elected and chosen directors of the corporation, agreeably to the provisions of a resolution passed the 3d of April, 1837, entitled^&amp;m any passadj <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>ceding. It is impossible to understand this part of the plea, otherwise than an assertion of title, by virtue of the election of the 9th of January, in the event of the last election being declared void. And this, we believe, was so understood and intended by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The third, last, and most important objection, remains to be disposed of. It relates to the claim of the authority, by the directors to admit members, and the validity of certain by-laws, particularly Nos. 4 and 32, passed by the directors. The relators deny that the directors have the right to admit members, but they insist, that the authority is confined to providing for their admission. They also contend, that the by-laws Nos. 4 and 32, by whomsoever passed, were an unreasonable exercise of power, contrary to the fundamental principles of the charter, and therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The by-laws are in the following words. By-law No. 4. \u201c The directors, in accordance with the powers to them given by the charter, to provide for the admission of members, and furnishing proofs of such admission, do declare, that every person holding one share of stock, shall be a member of the said institution; and that upon a transfer of such stock, such person shall cease to be a member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">By-law No. 33. \u2014 \u201cThe proof of the admission of members shall be furnished by their appealing to be stockholders, on the \u25a0 books of the institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">It cannot be reasonably doubted, that it was the intention of the legislature, so far as it could be legally done, to re-the the in the same situation it was in under the original charter. In 1 Wharton, 461, it was held that this corporation was not a monied institution, but that it partook of the nature of a charity: that it was principally intended for the benefit of the depositors. As a means to effect this principal object and design of the charter, a capital was raised, as a pledge for the security of the money deposited. That there were three classes of persons referred to in the charter; members, who may or may not have a pecuniary interest in the institution; stockholders, Kitovs. ... Tbn.t the members alone had the direction bat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>ley may, if they are so disposed, convert into Promote their own pecuniary interests, at the expenwrir^iBB^positors, for whose benefit alone the institution was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The respondents base their right on that part of the charter which authorises the directors to provide for the admission of members. They must rest on the power given by the charter, before the passage of the act of the 3rd of April. The tenth section of that act confers no new power which bears on this point. It provides merely, under certain regulations, that, stockholders and depositors may vote, and that the former, as such, may be elected directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The question divides itself into two parts. Have the directors a right to admit members ; and if they have, are the by-laws, Nos. 4 and 32 a proper and legitimate exercise of the right ? We are of the opinion, that the respondents have failed in both particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In the first section of the charter, Peter Fritz, and others, naming them, and all and every other person or persons, after-wards becoming members, in the manner mentioned, are created a corporation and body politic, by the name and style of the Philadelphia Savings Institution, and by that name have succession ; and they have generally the power to do every other act or thing necessary to carry into effect the provisions of the act, and to promote the object and design of the corporation. Under that section, without more, the members would have power to admit other members; for the power of electing both officers and members, is an incident to every corporation. It is not necessary that such a power should be expressly conferred by the charter. If the power is not expressly lodged in other hands, it must be exercised by the company at large. But this power of election may, by the charter, he taken from the body at large, and reposed in a body of directors, or any other select *body. Whether this has been done, either 'expressly, or by necessary implication, is the question; and to determine this point, reference must be had to the provisions and spirit of the charter. It is contended, that the legislature have manifested the intention of, talrir\u2122 \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>or by necessary implication, taken away in rectors have authority to provide for the adml___ that is, to .prescribe the time, place, and maiJBBWMfffcfmg^the election, (on all of which the charter is silent); an exemplification of which is given in several by-laws, made by the respondents, and incorporated into their special plea. In the preceding part of the section, the legislature have expressly conferred the power on the directors, to elect a president from their own body, to appoint such officers and agents as they shall deem necessary to conduct the business of the institution, and to pay them compensation. This is the only express power given; for in the remaining part of the section, the phraseology is certainly different. They have the power only to <em>provide </em>for the manner in which certain specific duties, enumerated, shall be performed. Rut besides, in the absence of an express injunction, we cannot give it the construction for which the respondents contend, as it would tend to disappoint the general intention and design of the charter, which was evidently framed with a view to an efficient control over the directors, vested in the body at large, which would be effectually prevented, if the directors could admit whom they pleased, as members.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Rut granting the power, was this a proper exercise of it? The by-laws of a corporation must not be inconsistent with its charter. The charter is the fundamental law of the corporation ; and as is said in Angell and Ames on Corporations, 188, is in its terms and spirit as a constitution to the petty legislation of the body acting by and under it; and hence all by-laws in contradiction of it are void. In <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>(3 Burr. 1838,) it is said, that the true test of all by-laws, is the intention of the Crown in granting the charter, and the apparent good of the corporation. In the same case it is said, by Mr. Justice Wilmot, that corporations cannot make by-laws, contrary to their constitution. If they do, they act without authority. The power of making by-laws, in whomsoever it may reside, is in trust for the benefit of the whole, and must be exercised with discretion. Hence, by-laws must be reasonable, and *II_\u00b1hnsA which are nugatory, vexatious, and oppressive, or mani-</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">-- \u2014 -1 .in.' Mf IP \u25a0 ' \u201c <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>void. As has been before observed, this is tion, but in the nature of a charity, intendea^^^^^H^^^^I depositors. The legislature have said, in languag^^^^^^^^H be mistaken, that stockholders, as such, are not cipate in its management. They have confided that original members, and such as might be afterwards chose!^^^^# have also thought proper (the wisdom of which cannot be to impose an important check on the directors, resting ir^^H body at large. \"With a full knowledge of all this, the respondent# who were elected by the stockholders under a law (which was' soon afterwards repealed,) and who themselves are stockholders, and not members, have by one sweeping resolution, obtained, and seek to retain, the entire control of the institution. The by-laws admit at once all the stockholders (of course including themselves) to all the rights, benefits and privileges of memN\"'*, in subversion of the fundamental principles, and contrary to spirit and provisions of the charter. The election is made \u2022 i-out regard to the qualification of the individual to perfori\u00a1 .-the trust, and to carry into effect the object of the charter, but for the single purpose, so far as appears, of having the government of the company, by means of others who are identified-in interest and feeling with themselves. The case itself is an illustration of the wisdom of the rules before stated. As well might they have admitted any other class of persons, the butchers, tailors, or shoemakers, as a body, or indeed any free white male inhabitant, of the city and county of Philadelphia; and in some respects such a by-law would be more reasonable. They would at least have no particular pecuniary interest to subserve, as they would stand strictly impartial, between the conflicting interests of the stockholders and depositorswhereas stockholders may have an interest in opposition to the depositors, of which the legislature</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
