He did not do so. I saw Adams; he asked if he was to pay the money to me or to the company. I told him I would let him know. I did not know but that Adams was to pay the money. I did not know they-were bought by Adams for the People\u2019s Line to Baltimore. I suspected they were to go to that company. Adams had told me he was acting for that company, and this was my reason for suspecting it. fie afterwards told me so expressly. Adams had told me, before he bought the horses, that he was acting for that company, but afterwards told me the company were failing, but that he would pay me for the horses; that that had nothing to do with it. I don\u2019t recollect telling the plaintiffs that Adams had bought the horses for the People\u2019s Line. Adams often told me that he bought the sorrel mare for his own use. Adams acted as agent for plaintiffs, and the People\u2019s Line to Baltimore. I may have heard the directors of the Columbian Steam Boat Company say that Adams bought wood for the company.\u201d (Reexamined in chief. Memorandum shown, dated November 11th, 1834, being an order drawn by witness on defendant, and directing him to pay eighty dollars, on account of two horses bought of him.) \u201cMr. A.dams told me he had bought a certain bay horse from Mr. Richardson. Richardson was said to be a director of the company, and acted as such. I think he said he bought it cheap, forty-five dollars, very cheap, worth both the others. I know Mr. Richardson.

That if the book of entries did not sustain the claim filed, the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-20\">2nd. For that the plaintiffs must show for whose use the flag was wanted, and that they cannot recover the cash paid for a flag to replace it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pATJ\">*3rd. That as to the demand for sixty-four and a quarter cords of wood, the books do not prove it, and that, on the oral evidence, the plaintiffs cannot recover for more than twelve and a quarter cords, if for any.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-23\">4th. That as to the two horses, the company cannot recover because the defendant was the agent of the People\u2019s Line Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>pany, and the charge in the books was not made till long after the time they were alleged to have been bought by the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-5\">The defendant also requested the court to charge that the books of original entries were not sufficient to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s claim; and that supposing no other evidence had been produced by the plaintiffs, they could not recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-6\">Rut the Court answered, \u201cthat the books of original entries were not produced by the plaintiffs in making out their case, but upon the call of the defendant, and were given in evidence by him. That the books of original entries were not necessary or indispensable evidence, nor the best evidence, nor better evidence of goods sold and delivered, than the testimony of witnesses; that the plaintiffs were allowed to make out their case by their books, verified on oath, but that they are not obliged by law to prove their case in that way. And as to so much of the defendant\u2019s proposition as was founded on a supposition, the court said the case supposed was not the case on trial; other evidence had been given besides the books of original entries, and the court declined to answer that part of the proposition. And the court further charged the jury, that the plaintiffs could not recover the value of goods lent, in an action for goods sold and' delivered. That a loan was of a different nature from a sale, and that if the jury believed the flag was lent to the defendant and never returned, (and such appeared to be the evidence,) the plaintiffs could not recover its value in this action, nor could they recover the money paid by the plaintiffs to replace it, unless he agreed with the plaintiffs that they should do so. The court also charged, that the evidence in relation to the claim for the sixty-four and a quarter cords of wood, depended on the testimony of Richmond and Byrnes. That these witnesses testified as to sixty-one and a quarter cords; and if the jury believed these witnesses, the plaintiffs might recover for that quantity. That in regard to the two horses which the defendant is said to have bought, as the agent of the People\u2019s Line, the defendant was liable to pay the plaintiffs, unless he disclosed his agency at the time he bought them. That the suspicions of Mr. Stout were of no consequence, if the defendant acted in his own name.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to the opinion of the court; and the jury having found for the plaintiff, removed the record to this court, and made the following assignments of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ARq\">*\u201c 1st.

It will be observed that this was a declaration at common law, and not a statement under our act of assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">The plaintiff, here, who was defendant below, filed an affidavit of defence, and pleaded non assumpsit, payment, and a set-off, and another special plea. There was no statement by the plaintiffs, nor counter-statement by the defendant, or if any such they were superadded to the narr. and plea. The plaintiff filed a specification of the items claimed by him. The first of these was a flag borrowed by him and not returned, $20; and three of the items were for the prices of three horses sold to the defendant, at dates specified, and for prices specified. The principal charge was for wood sold at different times. The plaintiffs did not before the jury rely on their books, but called witnesses to support the several charges, and did give evidence as to each of them. They then offered evidence as to another horse sold, not in the account filed. This the Court rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">The defendant\u2019s counsel then called on the plaintiffs to produce their book of original entries, and it was produced, and read to the jury. *The defendants after reading this, closed, and requested the court to charge the jury, first, That if the plaintiff\u2019s books did not sustain the claim, the plaintiff could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">The second, related to the flag borrowed and not returned; this, the court told the jury could not be recovered in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The third, in substance was, that the books did not prove it, being only one charge of 66-J cords, and the proof was of the delivery at sundry times in lesser quantities, and the proof did not amount to so many cords.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The fourth, that the two horses were sold to the defendant as the agent of another company, and that he was not personally liable. As the court was requested to charge that the books of original entries were not sufficient to support the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, and supposing no other evidence had been given, the plaintiffs could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The judge charged the jury in .substance as follows(here the judge stated the remarks of the court below already given.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The last part of it as to the liability of the defendants for the two horses, was more favourable to the defendant than the testimony \u2014 which was \u2014 \u201cthe two horses were bought in 1833. Adams was to send me the money when he took the horses. lie did not do so. I did not know but that Adams was to pay the money. I did not know they were bought by Adams for the People\u2019s Line to Baltimore. I suspected they were to go to that company. Adams had told me he was acting for that company, and this was my reason for suspecting it. He afterwards told me so expressly. Adams had told me before he bought the horses, that he was acting for that company. But <em>afterwards he told me the company were failing, but he would pay me for the horses: that that had nothing to do with it.\u201d </em>This was the testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 agent who sold the horses. And the express declaration by Adams to him, that he (Adams) would pay, would have put the case on strong grounds for the plaintiffs. This declaration of Adams was calculated to prevent the plaintiffs from using exertions to save themselves from a failing debtor, by the assurance that Adams individually would pay; besides there was no proof that the horses were ever given to the People\u2019s Line, or used by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">There is nothing in the charge of the Court of which the defendant had cause.to complain. How did the books of original entry of a shopkeeper, or mechanic, or labourer, or merchant, become evidence? Was it not from necessity? The human memory could not retain all the items of the account, and dates, and prices, and debtors \u2014 and entries at the time were necessarily \u25a0 admitted, because the sale and delivery in most cases could not otherwise be proved. When the agent or clerk can, from his memory, state the sale, and date, and price, and purchaser, the book which is admitted to supply the defect of memory is not necessary. I do not speak of a case where the book of entries at the time, and memory differ, H\u00e9re *they agree except as to two cords of wood; and as to these the was favourable to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>As to the last error assigned, that the Court ought to have told the jury, the evidence was not <em>sufficient </em>to sustain the plaintiffs\u2019 action. It is a mistake, as it appears to me, of the vital principle of trial by jury. The court decides matters of law; the jury matters of fact. In this case, witnesses proved every item of the claim. To be sure, except as to the two horses, there was no express promise to pay; but where the buyer is known, and is in good credit, what merchant, or mechanic, or auctioneer, asks the purchaser if he will pay ? Or who ever did more than order the article, or bid at the auction. The transaction includes the promise to pay, if the article is obtained. I will not say it is inferred. Though nothing is said, the transaction is itself a promise, as distinctly understood as if uttered; but if it was an inference, still it is for the jury and not for the judge.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This is proved by another principle of law: if you demur to parol evidence, you must distinctly admit all the facts testified to by the witnesses of the other party, and all that a jury may fairly infer from the facts proved.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Inferences from facts are for a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Cited by Counsel, 1 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 415 ; 2 Harris, 480.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b81-14\"> See 6 Barr, 186; 9 Id. 174.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AHi\"> <em>See post, </em>400.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
