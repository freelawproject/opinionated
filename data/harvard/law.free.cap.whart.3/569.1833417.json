Because the judge permitted the contract between Eyre &amp; Massey of the one part, and Coe and Lewis of the other part, dated May 16th, 1831, to be given in evidence, though it was a paper under seal, and executed by Charles Massey; the presence or assent of Eyre not being proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-14\">2. Because the judge permitted Edwin N. Lewis, one of the contractors to be examined as a witness to support the claim of the plaintiff, when in fact he should have been one of the plaintiffs, if any one but Eyre &amp; Massey could sustain an action against the defendant for freight.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-15\">3. Because the judge charged the jury, that a contract to carry the defendant\u2019s goods by Coe was proved by the evidence and testimony in the cause, and that Coe had a right of action against him founded upon such contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-16\">4. Because the judge refused to charge the jury, that the only contract to carry the defendant\u2019s goods arose between Eyre &amp; Massey and the defendant upon the bill of lading, signed by the captain of the Globe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-17\">5. Because the judge refused to charge the jury, that no action could be sustained except an action for money paid for the use of Cook, and that only in case the money was paid with his consent, express or implied, and not against it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-18\">6.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIb\">The objections to the verdict, depend on the nature *of the original contract of affreightment. Coe and Lewis undoubtedly chartered their part of the Globe\u2019s tonnage \u2014 540 tons \u2014 jointly; and they were jointly liable for it to the owners; but were they joint owners of it betwixt themselves? Their property in it was severed in all respects but liability to the owners for it, by an express clause in the charter party, containing an agreement of Coe to freight 375 tons, and of Lewis to freight the residue. There may be a partnership which is to cease with the act of purchase, the thing bought being divided by the act which vests the title; for a clause in a contract of purchase, that an exclusive property in the casks or packages should vest in the one or the other, according to mark or brand, would undoubtedly sever the ownership.; \u2014 and why should it not sever the ownership of freight purchased on the same terms ? Coe and Lewis, therefore, stood in no joint relation but that of liability. They were tenants in common of an undivided portion of the ship; and their interests being several, might be disposed of in severalty. \u25a0 Lewis was competent, therefore, to prove the defendant\u2019s contract to have been with Coe. The original charter party, in the name of the firm, was sealed only by one of the' owners, and it is certain that an action on it could have been maintained only against Mm who sealed it. But this action is not founded on it. It is brought for the price of the freight sold by the plaintiff to the defendant, and the instrument is no further material than as it affords evidence of the ownership of the freight. But the contract of affreightment need not be by specialty; and subsequent assent to it by a party not originally bound, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>make it a valid contract by parol, which is all that is necessary to show the ownership of the freight to have been in the plaintiff. Now, the receipt of its price by the owners, is a full ratification of the original agreement; and there was therefore no contract to carry the defendant\u2019s goods by the owners of the ship, but a contract to carry by the plaintiff, on which this action may well be maintained. Consequently, there is no reason to disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Cited by Counsel, 3 Barr, 359.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
