D. 1819, I received a written paper at Norristown, from Mr. Samuel Mifflin, or Mr. Levi Pawling, or one or both of them. It is now eighteen years since that paper was delivered to me, and I cannot say for what, purpose it was delivered to me; nor can I say that any specific purpose *was stated. I should not have delivered up that paper unless the consent of both parties had been obtained; nor did I deliver it up until I thought that consent had been obtained. I presume, but this is matter of inference, that Mr. Mfflin represented the Schuylkill Navigation Company (the defendants.) I kept that instrument for many years. My memory is not charged with any instructions that both parties were to have access to it. I spoke to Joseph S. Lewis, on more than one occasion on the subject of this paper, and desired to give it up, as I did not wish to be the depositary of it. Upon one occasion Mr. Lewis told me, I might give up that-paper, that all the parties consented that it should be given up; and delivered it up, to some one, in the presence of Mr. Lewis and the representative of Mr. Levi Pawling, who, I think, was Mr. Thomas Kittera. This occurred in his office. I always understood this paper to relate to the rights of the defendants and Mr. L. Pawling to the water of the river Schuylkill; but I can\u2019t say if I got this impression from reading that paper, or from conversation. I have not seen that paper since I gave it up. I kept no copy of it. I cannot distinctly say if any thing was done at the time of its delivery to me. I have a confused notion that there was a table, and the usual apparatus for writing in the room. I did not recollect the day nor the year, of this occurrence, and I referred to a little diary which I kept, and by it I found, that I was at Norristown, with Mr. Samuel Mifflin, Mr. Poinsett, and Dr. Mifflin, on the 8th and 9th of October; and I never was there with them except when this paper was delivered. I do not think the president of the company or myself referred to the contents of the instrument: though I read it, I cannot say it was the same with the copy shown me. Mr. Lewis was the President of the Schuylkill Navigation Company, and I spoke to him as such. I have no recollection of what fell from Mr. Lewis, except that he was interested in this instrument. I cannot say when I delivered up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>this instrument; think it was more than five, and less than ten years ago.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-5\">On his cross-examination the witness said,\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-6\">\u201c I moved into my present residence in 1830 \u2014 \u201931.

That is the paper for which I have made search. I kept the papers of the mill property of L. Pawling, which afterwards became M'Credy &amp; Wood\u2019s, by themselves together.

Levi Pawling built the abutment of stone which connects with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the company\u2019s clam. Bpth the abutment and dam went oft at the same time together in 1819. The part other than the abutment was built by the company under the directions of Cooley. The part put up by Mr. L. Pawling was one hundred and fifty feet in length from the saw mill, and joined on the centre of the little island, with the ^company\u2019s dam. It was ten feet in height from the low water below the dam. The wood work of the company\u2019s clam was raised seven feet from the sheeting of the dam. That 'was the intention, though it was not quite level. The stone work was three feet higher. Mr. Pawling\u2019s part has stood. The Navigation Company\u2019s clam was raised in 1830. Said to be raised eighteen inches. It was not all finished. There were fifty to seventy-five feet in several places, including the whole left unplanked. More or less of the sheeting logs had been carried away. They were never replaced. Could not be replaced. I perceived some of the sheeting logs were loose. Underneath it had got worn out hollow before they raised the dam. The dam might perhaps have stood if the planking had been on it; but I never worked at it. Nathan Hallowell, who was the agent of the company, asked me in the autumn of 1830, if I could plank the clam. I told him I would clo it almost any time, when I could get the plank. I am a carpenter. He told me he thought the plank was ready sawed at Freedly\u2019s mill, and I must go and see if thqy were there. I said I would. Mr. Freedly told me, that except a few they were not sawed. I thought it not worth while to begin with a small number. I told Nathan a few days after, that the plank was not sawed. Nathan said he would see about it, and let me know when they were ready. I had no further conversation with him at that time,. that fall or winter about the clam. In the summer or fall of 1831, we were walking about a little, and I met him near, and told him I thought it a proper time to plank the rest of the clam. He said he thought so too, and would get Charles Ramsey to clo it, but he was very busy. I told him I thought the sooner it was done the better; and so we parted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-8\">The plaintiff then again offered to prove the contents of the said agreement of 1819, under which the clam and abutment aforesaid, were respectively built by L.

Nathan Hallowell, and Robert Hallowell, who testified that they were the agents of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>company and superintendents of the works, and as such, were employed in raising the dam in 1830, and directing the repairs in 1832.

The Court ought to have allowed the plaintiff to give evidence of the contents of the agreement of 1819. The testimony of the witnesses, Emlen, Wood, Kittera and Pawling, sufficiently proved the existence and loss of the paper, and we wore entitled to go to the jury, upon the question of its delivery. Strict proof of the execution of a lost deed has never been required: it is enough, if it is shown to have existed. 1 Ves. 389. The sole question for the Court is, whether the loss has been proved. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Frier, </em>(16 Johns. Rep. 193). By the first plea of these defendants,- the execution and existence of the instrument were admitted. The proof of a delivery is very strong. It was delivered by Mr. Emlen to Mr. Kittera, who was attorney for Pawling, and this amounted to a delivering to Pawling. At all events, it was sufficient to authorize the jury to pass upon it. It was not necessary to examine Mr. Levi Pawling, because, from the testimony of Mr. Emlen, it appears probable, that the instrument was not delivered until 1831; and after that time, Mr. Pawling was not the legal possessor of the paper. <em>Doxon </em>v.. <em>Haigh, </em>(1 Esp. N. P. Cases, 409); <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Tanswell, </em>(8 Taunt. 450; s. c. 4 Eng. Com. Law Reps. 163); <em>Meeker </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>(3 Yeates, 442); <em>King </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>(4 Maule &amp; Selwyn, 48); <em>Gully </em>v. <em>Bishop of Exeter, </em>(4 Bingh. 294; s. c. 13 Eng* Com. Law Reps. 439); <em>Kensington </em>v. <em>Inglis, </em>(8 East, 273); <em>Cauffman </em>v. <em>Cedar Spring, </em>(6 Binn. 59); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Woodman, </em>(6 Car. &amp; Payne, 206; s. c. 25 Eng. Com. Law Reps. 358).</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"pAlar\">*2. If the first error is made out, it follows of course, that the evidence under this head ought to have been admitted. At all events, under the agreement of 1830, we had a right to give this evidence. We could have shown, that at the time of the execution of the second agreement, the dam was so weak, as not to be able to support the additional eighteen inches required by that agreement, and that one of the inducements to our making that agreement was, that it was necessary that the dam should be put into proper order to bear the additional weight. The offer and rejection were general. We did not adopt the dam as it stood in August, 1830. The expressions are large, and they ought not to be so construed, as to authorise a building upon an insufficient foundation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-8\">3. The witnesses whose testimony was objected to by us were both superintendents. Through their negligence in altering the dam, the breaches took place. It is settled, that where the gist of the action is the negligence of a servant, the latter is not a competent witness. <em>Green </em>v. <em>New River Co. </em>(4 Term Rep. 589). Here, through the negligence of the witness, the dam was left unplanked, by reason of which the mischief took place. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Henrickson, </em>(2 Ld. Raym. 1007); <em>Aislabie </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>(8 Taunt. 454: s. c. 4 Eng. Com. Law Reps. 164); Peake\u2019s N. P. 84, 117; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Falconer, </em>(1 Campbell, 251).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-9\">Mr. <em>Billingham </em>and Mr. <em>B. Tilghman, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-10\">1. If there was any agreement executed and delivered in 1819, it was expressly annulled by the agreement of 1830.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-11\">[The counsel were here told, that it was unnecessary to argue this exception.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-12\">2. The terms of the agreement of 1830 are sufficiently clear and explicit. The words <em>\u201c </em>raise the said dam,\u201d mean the dam as it then stood. The agreement is prospective entirely. It contains no insurance of the condition of the dam prior to its date. In point of fact, some evidence of the state of the dam prior to 1830 was given; and therefore the Court will not reverse on this exception. <em>Crouse </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>(10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 155).</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-13\">3. The interest of a person offered as a witness must be direct and certain, either as regards immediate benefit, or for the purposes of evidence. In all the cases cited on the other, side, the issue was upon the negligence of the agent, which was not the case here, 2 Starkie, 745, 753 ; <em>Wakely </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>(6 Binn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>319); <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Grier, </em>(4 Binn. 83); <em>Rennet </em>v. <em>Hethington, </em>(10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 195). The witnesses in this case were not contractors, but merely agents of the officers of the company.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-5\">Mr. <em>Meredith, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-6\">1. The fact of the deed of 1819 having been released by that of 1830, has nothing to do with the question of the admissibility of the *contents of the deed of 1819. On <em>non est facturn, </em>the release 'could not thus be taken advantage of. Suppose of was delivered to Emlen as an <em>escroto ; </em>yet if made a deed afterwards, it would take effect from the time of delivery as an <em>escrow.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-9\">2. It was material. to the plaintiff to show the state of the dam prior to August, 1830. It was to be raised and kept in repair: and unless its condition prior to August, 1830, can be known, there is no time with which its situation after 1830 can be compared. Certainly we ought not to have been confined to the very day on which the agreement was signed, when the question was as to the situation of the dam generally, or about that time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-10\">3. The negligence of the witnesses was proved; and that negligence is shown to have caused the disaster. They prove their own interest, in showing that they were superintendents. Tho verdict in this case would be evidence in a suit by these defendants against the witnesses, to show the amount of the damages which they have sustained by their negligence of misconduct.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b448-11\">Hibson, C. <em>J.,</em></author>\n<p id=\"AiB\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">As was determined in <em>M\u2018Reynolds </em>v. <em>M'Cord, </em>(6 Watts, 288,) evidence of contents must be preceded by proof of existence, which includes proof of execution. The rule has long been established, with this qualification, however, that proof of suppression or destruction, by the party to be affected, where no better can be had, be taken for proof of execution. That, however, is strictly not a qualification, but a subjunction of the rule, that the best evidence be produced. - How stood the preliminary proofs, when the offer was submitted ? Of delivery, which is an integrant part of execution, there was no colour. On the contrary, the only witness who touched the fact, declared, that the instrument had been put into the hands of Mr. Emlen, its depositary, as an escrow; and the latter did not recollect on what occasion, or, with certainty, to whom it was given up. There is little doubt, however, that having been retained as a security for something left undone by the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in the contract, it was given up in the presence of the parties to it, when previous stipulations were merged in the present covenants ; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>it would seem, that it had not in fact become a deed \u2014 at least, there was no spark of proof that it had. There was therefore not only no proof of execution, but actual disproof of it; and in these circumstances, proof of contents was altogether inadmissible. Besides, the recollection of Mr. Pawling, who, had the paper become a deed, might have been its possessor, ought to have been consulted.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The condition of the dam, previous to the only agreement that has been, produced, was properly excluded from consideration. That this agreement was made to settle and satisfy past differences, *as well as to provide for the future, is expressly declared in it; and that the evidence excluded could have legitimately made the defendant liable on the original covenants, if any had existed, is not pretended. But as he covenanted to maintain the dam at an increased'height, and, casualties excepted, in good condition, it is said he was bound to build on a foundation capable of supporting the superstructure; and this, it is urged, the evidence would have shown he had not done. By the contract, however, he was held no further than to put the additional superstructure on the existing one; and such being the words, each party took on himself the risk of its sufficiency. Had the fitness and stability of the original dam been a matter for subsequent determination, there ought to have been a provision for a survey of it; but that it would be sufficient to resist the ordinary pressure of the current, was taken for granted: and for the consequences of floods, the defendant was bound no further than to repair or rebuild \u2014 to rebuild, however, not in the first instance, but only when experiment should prove it to be necessary. Evidence, therefore, that it would have been better to rebuild in the first instance, could have tended only to mislead.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Neither was the witness to whose testimony exception was taken, disqualified by interest. He was not in the predicament of a servant contingently liable to his employer for the event. He was in the defendant\u2019s service as superintendent of repairs; but the nature of his duties is not shown, or that he disobeyed his instructions and acted tortiously of his own head. He may have been, and probably was, no more than an overseer; and if he failed to keep the labourers duly at work, his neglect in that particular might make him answerable to the defendant, but it could not make the defendant answerable to the plaintiff. The argument is, that there may have been delay in the execution of his task, and a correspondent hindrance of the plaintiff\u2019s business: but, in default of counter proof, the presumption is in favour of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>diligence; and even the possibility of being secondarily liable to an action for it, is classed with those remote and contingent interests which go to credibility. A declaration for consequential loss from the act of a servant, contains an averment of negligence or misfeasance, which must be proved ; and to maintain it against the master, necessarily requires the plaintiff to make out a case for the master against the servant, which the servant, is consequently incompetent to disprove; but the eventual liability of the witness, here, is by no means a postulate of the action, and a possibility of liability is insufficient to exclude him. The want of a direction to disregard the testimony of certain witnesses, has not been pressed: nor could it be, as no prayer for direction seems to have been submitted.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Cited by Counsel, 4 Wharton, 497; 7 Watts, 171; 10 Id. 14; 1 Barr, 51; 3 Id. 198; 2 Jones, 210; 8 Harris, 285 ; 12 Casey, 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Cited by the Court, 6 Watts <em>&amp; </em>Sergeant, 369.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\"> See 5 Casey, 377.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-14\"> See 6 Wharton, 153.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
