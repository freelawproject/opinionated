Alice Yarnall, the widow of the testator, took an estate tail by this devise, under the rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s Case ; </em>and consequently, the limitation over to the unborn children of Walker Yarnall, 'gave a contingent remainder, not an executory devise. It is evident that the intent of the testator here was that the issue should take in succession. The general rule, as 'to this intention, is clear. The words \u201cno heir by me,\u201d are indefinite in respect to time. The meaning is, \u201c all heirs and it is equivalent to saying, \u2022\u201c if my issue shall fail.\u201d There is nothing here to designate any individual as the object of the testator\u2019s bounty. The word \u201cissue\u201d cannot be taken as <em>designatio personae. </em>It is generally equivalent to the words \u201c heirs of the body.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Asplin, </em>(1 Term Rep. 82). The result of the cases is, that \u201c issue\u201d is descriptive of all issue to come. <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>(7 Ves. 522); <em>Leigh </em>v. <em>Norbury, </em>(13 Ves. 340). In <em>Den v. Puckey, </em>(5 Term Rep. 299,) the devise was to A. for life, without impeachment of waste, remainder to the issue male of her body, and to the heirs and assigns of such issue male; yet it was held that A. took an estate tail. Suppose that the testator had survived, and had a second child, if the word <em>issue </em>is held here to be <em>designatio personae, </em>that child would not have taken at all. That the word \u201cissue\u201d is <em>nomen oollectivum </em>is shown by several cases. <em>King </em>v. <em>Mellen, </em>(2 Levinz, 58); <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>(1 Peere Wms. 754); <em>Dobson </em>v. <em>Grew, </em>(2 Wilson, 322). In <em>Carter </em>v. <em>M\u2018Michael, </em>(10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 429,) C. J. Tilghman recognised the rule that a particular intent must give way to the general intent. If the devise here had stopped with the words \u201cheirs and assigns forever,\u201d doubtless this would bean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>estate tail. Are there any inconsistent words ? It is settled that superadded words merely, will not reduce the estate to one for life. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Groff, </em>(11 East, 668); <em>Jesson </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>(2 Bligh, 2); <em>Goodright </em>v. <em>Pullen, </em>(2 Ld. Ray. 1437); <em>Measure </em>v. <em>Gee, </em>(5 Barn. &amp; Ald. 910 ; 7 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 300); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Goldsmith; </em>(7 Taunt, 209); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>(1 East, 229). The fair inference is that the testator intended an estate tail, unless the words necessarily refer to a particular person; and to defeat the rule of law the intention must be so clear and explicit that no one can doubt about it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-6\">2. Even if Alice Yarnall took an estate for life only, yet the limitation *over was not an executory devise, but .a con^ tingent remainder. There is some- confusion in the books, and contradiction in the cases, on this subject. The devise to the unborn child must be considered as executory. Both devises depended upon a contingency. .Suppose that no child had been born, the limitation to the children of Walker Yarnall would clearly have been a remainder. Here was a sufficient estate of freehold to support it. The case of <em>Carlisle </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>(3d Rawle, 489,) whicL recognises the rule that if there be a sufficient preceding estate of freehold, the succeeding estate cannot be an 'executory devise, is in point. So is the case of <em>Rattew </em>v. <em>Waddell, </em>(5 Rawle, 231). The whole doctrine is discussed, and the cases collected in Preston on Estates, p. 59, 83, 88, and 488, 493; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Burnsall, </em>(6 Term Rep. 30); <em>Crump </em>v. <em>Norwood, </em>(7 Taunt. 362; 2 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 136); 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 201; Wilson on Springing Uses, 16, 17, 18.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-7\">Mr. <em>T. I. Wharton, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-8\">1. Alice Yarnall took an estate for life only under this will. The rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s Case </em>has been abrogated in at least four of the states of the union, and considerably modified, by a recent statute, in England. As it in almost every case defeats the expressed intention of the testator, this Court will not be disposed to carry it beyond the limits prescribed by the adjudged eases. No one can doubt the particular intention of the testator in the devise to the first taker in this case, and there is no general intent which can be supposed to have existed, at variance with it. The devise is to his wife for life only; and if an estate tail had been given to her it would have enabled her to give away the whole estate from her child, or to carry it into another family. In this respect the case differs from a similar devise to a child of the testator. From an examination of the rule as it is stated by the best authorities, it may be said that whether the word <em>heirs, heir, issue, child,, son, or daughter, </em>be used, if the word appears to have been employed with reference to a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>person and not to a line of descendants, the first devisee will take an \u00e9state for life only. In this case the words are extremely significant. The testator was within a few hours of his death. He knew that his wife was pregnant, but of course was ignorant of the sex of the child. The use of the words \u201c <em>his or her,\u201d </em>in connection with the word \u201c <em>issue,\u201d </em>proves that he meant, by the latter word, a particular individual. In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Collis, </em>(4 Term Rep. 299,) Lord Kenyon says, that in a will the word <em>issue </em>is a word either of purchase or limitation, as will best answer the intention of the testator. In the <em>Earl of Oxford </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>(3 Ves. &amp; Beames, 67,) the Master of the Rolls calls it an ambiguous term, and says that \u201c it may, and frequently does, mean <em>children </em>only.\u201d The same language is used by Judge Yeates, in <em>Findlay v. Riddle, </em>(3 Binn. 160.) The earliest case resembling *hLis is <em>Archer\u2019s Case, </em>(1 Coke, 66,) where the remainder was to the next heir in the singular number, and it was adjudged an estate for life in the first taker. <em>Cheek </em>v. <em>Day, </em>(which was cited from Fearne\u2019s Cont. Rem. 150,) also greatly resembles this. So of <em>Luddington v. Kime, </em>(1 Ld. Raymond, 203): and the remarks of Powel, J. (p. 204, 5,) as to the meaning of the word <em>issue, </em>are applicable here. In <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Weigh, </em>(2 Strange, 998,) an estate for life was adjudged upon this word. In <em>Goodright </em>v. <em>Puller, </em>(2 Strange, 731,) the devise was to N. for life, and after his decease to the heirs male of the body of the said N. and <em>his </em>heirs forever, but in case he should die without such heir male, then over: it was held to be an estate tail in N.; but this was in consequence of the Court referring the word <em>his </em>to the first taker and not to his heir, as appears from the remarks of C. J. Raymond. In <em>Backhouse v. Wells, </em>(stated in Fearne, 152,) and <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Laming, </em>(2 Burr. 1100,) under similar devises, estates, for life only, were adjudged. The case most closely resembling this in its terms is <em>Gulliver </em>v. <em>Wickett, </em>(1 Wilson, 105,); and there, although no child came <em>in esse, </em>yet the devise over was held to be a good ex-ecutory devise. The remarks of Mr. Eearne on this case, (pages 396, 7, 7th ed.) are entirely apposite to this devise. The cases cited are all which are in point before the revolution. The recent English cases are less satisfactory in respect to principles, since there is some contradiction to be found in them, and there is an apparent disposition in some of the judges to carry the rule beyond its former limits. Still there is no authority for applying it to a case like the present. In <em>Doe v. Collis, </em>(4 Term Rep. 294,) the words were \u201cto the issue of her'body and their heirs forever;\u201d and it was adjudged an estate for life only. So in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Elvey, </em>(4 East, 313,) the devise was to A. and the issue of his body \u201c his, her, or their heirs,\u201d &amp;c. Le Blanc, J. held that A.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>took for life only. A similar doctrine prevailed in <em>Gretton </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>(6 Taunt. 94; 1 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 320,) and <em>Merest </em>v. <em>James, </em>(1 Brod. &amp; Bing. 487; 5 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 156). The American cases in point are generally to the same effect. In <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Enslin, </em>(2 Mass. Rep. 554,) the devise was to the testator\u2019s wife for life, and after her death to his daughter, and her heirs forever. There was no question that the wife took for life only; and the only difference between that case and this is, that here the testator was ignorant of the sex of the infant. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>(3 Cowen, 303); <em>Lyle </em>v. <em>Digges, </em>6 Harr. &amp; Johns. 364,) and the very recent case of <em>Cushney </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>(4 Paige\u2019s Chan. Rep. 345,) also support this view. In the case of <em>James\u2019s Claim, </em>(1 Dall. 47,) it is true that an estate tail was adjudged to be in the first taker, but there the word <em>issue </em>was used in the plural number. The same will came before the Court again in <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>(1 Yeates, 332,) where it was held that the remainder over was vested, and not contingent. In <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Potts, </em>(3 Yeates, 141,) the devise was to E. and to her male heir forever, <em>i. e. </em>her son *T. in ease he should live to come to and enjoy it, but if T. should die before, then to J. and his heirs forever, and the Court held that E. took it for life only, and that J. took by way of executory devise. The words of the devise in <em>Findlay </em>v. <em>Riddle, </em>(3 Binn. 139,) strongly resemble this, and were held to pass an estate for life only. The same will was again considered in <em>Stump </em>v. <em>Findlay, </em>(2 Rawle, 168,) when a similar adjudication took place. <em>Abbot </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>(10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 296,) is to the same effect. The cases cited on the other side may be divided into two classes. 1st. Those which show that <em>issue </em>is sometimes <em>nomen eolleetivum, </em>as <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Asplin, </em>&amp;c. which' is not disputed, but these cases also admit that it is at other times <em>designatio persones. </em>2d. Those which prove that superadded words of limitation as \u201cto the heirs,\u201d or \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d of the second devisee, do not necessarily defeat the rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s Case. </em>Such is <em>Den </em>v. <em>Puckey, </em>&amp;c. These cases merely prove that where the limitation is to \u201c heirs\u201d generally, or \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d as a class, the superadded words make no difference. But none of these cases come up to this point, where the devise was to a particular child, with super-added words to the heirs of such child, followed by expressions limiting the estate over on the death of such child under twenty-one, &amp;c. In the case of <em>Carter </em>v. <em>M'Michael, </em>there was an obvious reference to an indefinite failure of issue; and the language of C. J. Tilghman shows that the Court were governed by what they supposed to be the general intent of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-6\">2. Even if Alice, the widow of the testator, took an estate tail by force of the rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s case, </em>yet there was a <em>vested </em>re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>mainder in fee in the infant child,\u2019 which took effect in possession on the death of the mother ; and consequently, the limitation oyer, could not be a contingent remainder. It is plain from the words of the will, that the testator referred to a particular individual, who was in existence though unborn. There are, it is true, some contradictory expressions in the books, but there is an obvious distinction between an unbegotten child, and one begotten but not born. In the first case the remainder may be contingent, but not in the latter. Suppose a remainder limited to the child of a person living at a distance from the testator, of whose name and sex he was ignorant. Clearly this would be a vested remainder.. Then as to the actual existence in law of an infant <em>in ventre sa mere, </em>there is abundant authority. 2 Vernon, 710; 3 Inst. 50 ; <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Fulham, </em>(2 Strange, 1093); Stat. 10 &amp; 11 Wm. III. c. xvi. In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>(2 Barn. &amp; Cress. 926 ; 9 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 278, 279,) Judge Bayley, referring to <em>Gulliver </em>v. <em>Wicket, </em>says \u201c The description of the child there, was a clear <em>designatio personce ; </em>and as a child <em>in ventre sa mere, </em>is for many purposes considered as <em>in esse, </em>the first remainder, a fee determinable, was vested in that child, and the remainder over could only operate by way of executory devise.\u201d Suppose the mother in this case had died before the actual birth of the child (which is possible) though but for an instant, then if this were but a contingent remainder, the child could not have taken.. The cases cited on the other side, to prove that this was not a vested remainder, are all cases of children not <em>in esse; </em>and the general remarks of the elementary writers quoted, must be understood with this qualification. In <em>Crump </em>v. <em>Norwood, </em>(7 Taunt. 362,) C. J. Gibbs said, that if there had been issue born, the estate over would have been an executory de-. vise. The rule, that when at devise is capable, according to the state of the objects at the death of the testator, of taking effect as a remainder, it shall not be construed to be an executorydevise, does not affect the argument, since here was a vested remainder at the testator\u2019s death. But the rule itself is not an universal one, nor without exceptions. In 2d Powel on Devises, (by Jarman,) p. 244, 2.45, it is shown by several authorities that a limitation is sometimes governed by subsequent events. And this also appears in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>and <em>Crump </em>v. <em>Norwood.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-6\">Then, whether the widow of the testator took an estate for life or in tail, the first remainder was a vested remainder in fee, defeasible on a certain event; and the limitation to the children of Walter Yarnall, was not an alternate or shifting remainder, but an executory devise, and within the limits allowed by law in respect to such estates. Fearne\u2019s Cont. Rem. 395, 396, (7th ed); <em>East</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number><em>man v. Baker, </em>(1 Taunt. 173); <em>Glover v. Monckton, </em>(3 Bing. 13; 11 Eng. Com. Law. Rep. 9).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-6\">Mr. <em>Tilghman, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-\">The testator in this case, it is obvious, considered the probability of his brother having issue as very slight: and it is not to be supposed that he meant to keep the fee in abeyance under any circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-7\">1. It is too late to question the validity or even the propriety of the rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s ease. </em>In the words of Judge Yeates: \u201c It is an unbroken pillar of the system.\u201d And the Courts in this country will find that the real interests of property are best promoted by adhering to it. The opposite argument takes it for granted that the testator referred to an actual existing child. Now, the will does not say so; \u25a0 and <em>non constat </em>that the testator knew that his wife was pregnant. In <em>Gulliver v. Wicket, </em>it appears that the testator distinctly referred to the child with which his wife was <em>enciente. </em>The words here, give an estate tail in express terms. In <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>(1 Burrow, 38,) though the words were \u201cto my wife for life and no longer,\u201d yet an estate tail was held to pass. If his will had stopped at the words \u201cissue by me begotten,\u201d no one would have doubted. I admit that whenever the word <em>issue </em>must necessarily be construed <em>children, </em>the rule does not apply; but in the large majority of cases it is equivalent to <em>heirs of the body. </em>That the testator here uses the word in that sense, is shown by the subsequent expressions \u201cif no <em>heir </em>by me,\u201d &amp;e. The word <em>issue, </em>is *always in the plural. The words \u201chis or do not break the line of descent. It was the tenancy in common that governed in <em>Findley </em>v. <em>Riddle. </em>The rule to be collected from the numerous cases on the subject which are collected and well arranged in Ilayes on Devises, &amp;c., is that superadded words will not of themselves produce any effect upon the rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s case. </em>In <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>or <em>Be Say, </em>cited in 8 Term Rep. 518, the words were to the heirs of the body, and \u201chis heirs and assigns,\u201d yet it was held to be an -estate tail. The same case is cited in 5 Term Rep. 304, 2 Burr. Rep. 1102, and 2 Atkyns, 249. In <em>Measure v. Gee, </em>the words were \u201chis, her, or their heirs and assigns.\u201d No case has been adduced, in which, from the will itself, the Court has not been satisfied that the testator used the words in a sense different from their legal sense. In <em>Archer\u2019s case, </em>the decision turned on the words \u201cnext heir.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Goff, </em>(11 East, 668,) was overruled in <em>Jesson </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>(2 Bligh, 1,) where the whole subject is discussed at length, and the paramount claims of the rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s ease </em>reasserted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>2. If Alice took an estate for life only, yet all the subsequent estates were contingent remainders, not executory devises. It is an established rule that if. there be an estate of freehold capable of supporting a remainder, the next limitation must be a remainder. <em>Purefoy </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>(2 Saunders, 380); Fearne, 393; <em>Dunwoody </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>(3 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 435); <em>Carlisle </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>(Id. 491.) The case of <em>Gulliver </em>v. <em>Wieket, </em>is the only one which expressly sustains the opposite argument; and that case seems, from the language of recent elementary writers, not .to be considered as law at the present day. Wilson on Springing Uses, 24. I contend that the estate given to the unborn child was necessarily a contingent remainder, and that the subsequent vesting in possession, did not alter the condition of the succeeding estate so as to turn it into an executory devise. The rule that it is the state of the objects at the death of the testator that governs, is certainly unshaken; and it is considered to prevail without exception, by the best writers. 2 Jarman\u2019s Powell, 238, &amp;c.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b216-7\">Kennedy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsK\">The question to be determined here is, whether under the will of Eli Yarnall, and the conveyance from Walker Yarnall, the brother of the testator mentioned in the will, and the children of the testator\u2019s sister Sarah, also mentioned therein, to the plaintiff, he has become invested with a good title in fee to the estate mentioned in, and disposed of by the will. The case has been very well argued by the counsel on both sides; and in such a way as to relieve the Court in a great measure fr\u00b0m labour, that *otherwise must have been en-countered in seaching and looking into the cases hitherto decided on this abstruse branch of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">First. It has been argued by the counsel for the plaintiff, that Alice the wife of the testator, took an estate tail under the will, according to the rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s case, </em>(1 Co. 66); which is, that \u201cif by any instrument, a freehold be limited to the ancestor for life, and the <em>inheritance </em>to his heirs, either <em>mediately </em>or <em>immediately, </em>the first taker takes the whole estate; for instance, if it be limited to the heirs of his body, he takes a fee tail, if to his heirs, a fee simple.\u201d Prest. on Estates, 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Second. Supposing that in this they-are mistaken, and that Alice took only an estate for life, it has been contended then, that the limitation to her issue must be regarded as a contingent remainder, and consequently, the subsequent limitation to the testator\u2019s sister Sarah\u2019s children, and the children of his brother Walker Yarnall, is to be taken as a contingent remainder also, and not an executory devise; and the preceding particular estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>of freehold which supported it, having expired without Walker Yarnall\u2019s having a child, the remainder of his children being an undivided moiety of the estate, is gone, and has become vested by descent in Walker Yarnall, and the children of the testator\u2019s sister Sarah, as the heirs at law of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The words of the will, upon which the question arises here are, \u201c I give and devise to my well beloved wife Alice Yarnall, all my estate situate in the township of Edgmont, for and during <em>her natural life, </em>and to her <em>issue, by me begotten, his </em>or <em>her </em>heirs and assigns forever; but if no <em>heir by me </em>should live to the age of twenty-one years, or marry, my will then is, that my real estate shall be equally divided between my sister Sarah\u2019s children and the children of my brother Walker Yarnall, provided he should have any ; my sister Sarah\u2019s children taking one half, and the children of my brother Walker the other half part.\u201d The will was made on the 27th of August, 1812, and the testator died on the following day. His wife was <em>enciente </em>at and for some time before the making of the will, and gave birth to the child shortly after his death. The child, however, died subsequently, on the 24th of March, 1831, about one year after the death of its mother, under the age of twenty-one years, and without having been married. From the testator\u2019s dying the day after making his will, it is reasonable to conclude, that he made it under the prospect of almost immediate death; and as his wife had been pregnant for some time previously thereto, that he must have known it; and she having no other child by him, that he must have intended to provide for it. But as the child was not actually born then, he could not designate it either by its name or sex. Under these circumstances, it would therefore seem, as if he selected and used the word <em>issue </em>for this purpose; and that, after giving the estate to the mother for life, confident, no doubt, *that she AYOuld support and provide for the child out of it during that period, his great object was to make the child, if it should live until it attained the age of twenty-one years or got married, the absolute owner of the estate in fee. This conclusion would seem to be highly probable, if not irresistible, from the terms of the will and the situation of the testator\u2019s family, at the time of making it. He knew that he had no issue by his wife then actually born, but that she was then with child by him; and believing, as it may reasonably be supposed, that death was waiting at the door, as it were, to take him off, he never could, in making his will, have thought that his wife was ever to have any other <em>issue </em>by him than the child of which she was then <em>enciente. </em>The most rational inference certainly is, that he introduced the word <em>issue </em>into his will in reference to what he then believed was the state of his family; intending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>thereby to designate and provide for the child <em>in ventre sa mere, </em>by limiting the estate in fee to it, after the determination of the life estate given to his wife, subject, however, to be determined by the child\u2019s dying before the age of twenty-one, or marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">But it has been objected here, that the situation of the testator\u2019s family at the time of making the will, or other circumstances not appearing on the face of the will itself, are to have no influence upon its construction; it is contended, that it must be interpreted <em>ex viseeribus suis. </em>The late Mr. Justice Duncan, in delivering the opinion of this Court in <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Duffield, </em>(5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 89,) says, \u201cWhere the intention of a testator is ambiguously expressed, the time of making the will; <em>the state of the property; </em>and situation of the family, are often resorted to in aid of its construction.\u201d Lord Talbot, also, in <em>Stapleton </em>v. <em>Col</em>ville, (Talb. Ca. 208,) seems to intimate, where the question was, whether the testator intended by his will to charge his debt exclusively on his real estate, that the amounts of the debts, and <em>quantum </em>of the personal estate might be inquired into, by saying, that it might have thrown great light on the matter in that case had it appeared. This, however, is expressly denied by Lord Thurlow, in <em>Ancaster </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>1 Bro. Ch. Ca. 466, 467,) by Lord Northington, in <em>Stephenson </em>v. <em>Heathcote, </em>(1 Eden\u2019s Ca. 43); by Lord Alvanley, in <em>Brummel </em>v. <em>Prothero, </em>(3 Ves. 113); by Lord Eldon, in <em>Bootle </em>v. <em>Blundle, </em>(1 Meriv. 216, 217,) and by Lord Chancellor Manners, in <em>Aldridge </em>v. <em>Wallscourt, </em>(1 Ball &amp; Beat. 315). See also <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Rawlinson, </em>(1 Salk. 234, 235,) and <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Inchiquin, </em>(Ridg. Ca. 249). Still, however, notwithstanding it seems to be settled by a series of decisions in England,, that the condition of the testator\u2019s estate cannot be inquired into and taken into consideration further than it shall appear from the face of the will itself, in order to determine the construction that shall be put on it, yet the condition of his family may. And Lord Chancellor Manners, accordingly, in <em>Crone </em>v. <em>Odell, </em>(1 Ball. &amp; Beat. 480, 481,) in answer to an argument urged by (with a view to exclude the consideration of the state of the tester\u2019s family,) that the Court could not travel out of the will for that purpose, said, \u201cThe contrary has been held to be the law from the time of <em>Wilde\u2019s Case, </em>(6 Co. 16,) to the present time. In <em>Goodinge </em>v. <em>Goodinge, </em>(1 Ves. 231,) the same argument was urged and overruled by Lord Hardwicke; and his opinion upon that point has been confirmed by the uniform decisions of courts of equity ever since.\u201d See also <em>Radcliffe </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>(10 Ves. 201.) But here it is clear from the will itself, that the word <em>issue </em>is used in the singular number, and cannot be taken as <em>nomen eolleetivum, </em>for it is the antecedent to the relative words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u201chis or her,\u201d which latter, it must be admitted, are in the singular number, and in this respect must agree with their antecedent. Neither the word \u201chis\u201d nor \u201cher\u201d can be referred to the wife here, so as to create in her an estate tail, as was done in <em>Lisle </em>v. <em>Pullen, </em>(2 Stran. 731,) where, though the devise was \u201cto Nicholas for and during the term of his natural life, and after his decease unto the heirs male of the body of the said Nicholas lawfully to be begotten, and <em>his </em>heirs forever yet the Court, by referring the word \u201chis\u201d to Nicholas, held that he took an estate tail. Here, however, it is perfectly manifest, that the words \u201chis\u201d and \u201cher\u201d are referable to the same antecedent; and the word \u201chis\u201d being of the male gender, cannot, in the nature of things, more than by the common rules of grammatical construction, be forced to have reference to the wife; it can only have reference to the word \u201cissue;\u201d and as it was unknown then whether that <em>issue </em>was male or female, the relative of either sex is used, so as to be applicable to the child, whichsoever of the two sexes it might be of. This brings the case then within the principle of <em>Archer\u2019s Case; </em>making the term \u201cissue\u201d here a word of <em>purchase, </em>as the word \u201cheir,\u201d in the singular number, was held to be there. It cannot be said that the word <em>issue, </em>technically speaking, is less a word of purchase, wdien used in the singular number, than the word <em>heir. </em>The word <em>issue, </em>perhaps, has no precise technical meaning affixed to it, and must always depend, I apprehend, upon the context for\u2019its true signification, whether it shall be taken as a word of <em>purchase </em>or of <em>limitation. </em>Indeed, Chief Baron Yelverton, in <em>Mandeville </em>v. <em>Carrick, </em>(3 Ridg. P. C. 365,) considers it, technically, a word of <em>purchase. </em>Lord Kenyon also says, in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Collis, </em>(4 Term Rep. 299,) that it is generally considered a word of <em>purchase, </em>and indeed universally so in deeds, though in a will it may be taken as a word of <em>purchase </em>or of <em>limitation, </em>as will best answer the intention of the testator. Mr. Preston, in his Treatise on Estates, 1 vol. 379, says, it is not <em>ex vi termini, </em>within the rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s Case; </em>and that it depends on the context, whether it will give an estate tail to the ancestor. Justice Clive, in <em>Dodson </em>v. <em>Grew, </em>(2 Wils. 324,) observes, \u201cThe word <em>issue </em>is one of the most vexed words in books; sometimes *it is <em>nomen singulare, </em>sometimes <em>plural, </em>sometimes a word of <em>limitation, </em>sometimes of <em>purchase; </em>but it must always be construed according to the intent of the will or deed wherein it is used;\u201d and Justice Gould, in the same ease, says, \u201cThe word issue is used in the statute <em>de bonis </em>promiscuously with the word <em>heirs of the body. </em>The term <em>issue </em>comprehends the whole generation, as well as the word <em>heirs, </em>and in my judgment, the word <em>issue </em>is more properly in its natural signification a word of <em>limitation</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>than of <em>purchase. </em>Justice Rainsford had said previously, in <em>Warman </em>v. <em>Seaman, </em>(Finch\u2019s Rep. 282,) \u201cthe word <em>issue ex vi termini </em>is <em>nomen collectivu/m, </em>and takes in <em>all issues </em>to the utmost extent of the family, as the word <em>heirs of the body </em>would do;\u201d and for this he vouched <em>Wilde\u2019s Case, </em>(6 Co. 17.) Mr. Justice Grose reports the declaration of Justice Rainsford, in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Applin, </em>(4 Term Rep. 88,) after having said, \u201c There is no case, in which <em>issue </em>has been determined to be a word of <em>purchase, </em>unless coupled with other words, expressing such an intent.\u201d He, however, must be understood as speaking in reference to cases growing out of wills. Rut even thus restricted, it may be questionable, whether he be right. And justice Clive went too far, perhaps, if he meant to say, that the word <em>issue </em>was to be considered either a word of <em>limitation </em>or <em>purchase </em>in a <em>deed </em>as well as a will, accordingly as might seem to accord best with the intention thereof: for I rather take it to be as Lord Kenyon has said, that in a deed it has generally at least, if not universally, been considered, and received as a wrnrd of <em>purchase. </em>In a popular sense, however, I think it can scarcely be doubted, but it is used to mean <em>children ; </em>and the popular meaning of Words is certainly not to be overlooked in the construction of wills, especially when made or drawn by unskilful persons. Rut still, notwithstanding there may have been some diversity of opinion among judges, whether the word <em>issue </em>has any precise technical meaning affixed to it or not, and if it has, whether it be that of a word of <em>limitation </em>or of <em>purchase, </em>yet they all seem to agree, that in a <em>will </em>it shall be taken to signify the one dr the other, as shall best comport with the intention of the testator. See <em>Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>(13 Ves. 483-4-5).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">It is agreed, however, that if the word <em>issue </em>here be in the singular number, it must be considered a word <em>o\u00ed purchase. </em>This was also agreed, in regard to the word <em>heir, </em>as Lord Mansfield says, in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Laming, </em>(2 Burr. 1110,) where words of limitation were ingrafted upon it in the singular number: and therefore agreed, that such <em>heir </em>would take by purchase. This he said was . settled in <em>Archer\u2019s Case, </em>and was admitted in the case of <em>Tubler on the demise of Trollope </em>v. <em>Trollope, </em>(P. 2 Geo. 28, B. R.) though that case was distinguished from <em>Archer\u2019s Case, </em>by having <em>no </em>words of limitation superadded to the words \u201cfirst heir male.\u201d In <em>Luddington </em>v. <em>Kime, </em>(1 Salk. 224; s. c. 1 Ld. Raym. 205,) the ^ord <em>issue </em>was held to be a word of <em>purchase. </em>There the land was devised to A. for life, without impeachment of waste; and in case he have <em>any issue </em>male, then to <em>such issue </em>male and <em>his </em>heirs forever; and if he die without issue, then toR. and his heirs forever. The Court held, that <em>issue </em>was to be taken as <em>nomen singulare, </em>because the inheritance (that is, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>superadded words of limitation) was annexed and limited to the word <em>issue ; </em>so that the inheritance was in the <em>issue, </em>and not in A. the father. And to this it may be added, that the <em>word issue </em>was shown clearly there, as in the case before us, to have been used as <em>nomen singulare, </em>by inserting the relative thereto \u201chis\u201d in the singular number \u2014 \u201c to such <em>issue </em>male and his heirs forever ;\u201d and not \u201c to such <em>issue </em>male and <em>their </em>heirs foreveras most probably would and ought to have been the case, had not the word <em>issue </em>been intended to designate a single individual. Accordingly Lord Northington, in speaking of this case in <em>King </em>v. <em>Burchell, </em>(1 Eden\u2019s Ca.431,) and in undertaking to distinguish it from the case under his consideration, says, \u201c The Court, in order to make the word <em>issue </em>a word of <em>purchase, </em>held that it was to be taken there as <em>nomen singulare, </em>because the inheritance was annexed to the word <em>issue; </em>that is, the <em>words of inheritance </em>were connected with and referred to the word <em>issue, </em>by means of the word <em>his </em>in the <em>singular </em>number. But in the case before Lord Northington, the word <em>issue </em>was shown to be in the <em>plural, </em>by means of its relative \u201ctheir\u201d being placed in the <em>plural: </em>thus, \u201cto his <em>issue </em>and <em>their </em>heirs;\u201d and therefore he held the word <em>issue </em>to be a word of limitation. The -intention, however, of the testator, in the case before us, to use the word <em>issue </em>in the singular number, and as a word of <em>purchase, </em>is not only indicated by the relatives \u201chis\u201d and \u201cher,\u201d but likewise by his substituting the word <em>heir </em>afterwards in the singular number for the word <em>issue ; </em>when he says, \u201c but if no <em>heir </em>by me should live to the age of twenty-one years, or marry,\u201d &amp;c. The term <em>heir </em>alone here would, perhaps, be sufficient to bring this case within the principle of <em>Archer\u2019s Base; </em>but in connection with the word <em>issue, </em>previously used, in the singular number, it becomes a much stronger case than <em>Archer\u2019s, </em>in favour of the child, then <em>in ventre sa mere, </em>taking as a purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">If, however, by confining ourselves to the words of the will, without travelling out of it, any doubt existed in regard to this being the intent of the testator, the state of his family at the time of making it, which is proper, as we have seen, to be taken into the consideration, would be more than enough to remove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Taking the word <em>issue, </em>then, as a designation of the child, with which the testator\u2019s wife was <em>enciente, </em>at the time of making the will, we are next to inquire what interest it took, under the will, upon the death of the testator; and whether it vested The words of inheritance to the word <em>issue </em>*made the interest, intended for such <em>issue, </em>a estate, subject, however, to be determined by such <em>issue </em>or <em>child </em>dying before twenty-one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>ox- marriage. And if it be that this child, which was aftex\u2019wax\u2019ds box\u2019n, though subsequently to the death of the testatox*, is to be regax\u2019ded as <em>in rerum natura </em>at the time of making the will, it would seem natux-ally to follow, that the estate ought to be considered vested, and not contingent. It must be admitted, that according to some, if not all, of the most ancient authox\u2019ities in the common law, it would appear that a devise to <em>fitz in ventre sa </em>mere, was void, because it was not considered tlxeix as being <em>in esse </em>at the time of making the devise. See <em>Scattergood </em>v. <em>Edges, </em>(12 Mod. 282-3, 286-7,) and the books there refex-red to. But the judicial opinion on this subject most unquestionably underwent a change in England before the time of our revolution; so that, at that time, and for a considerable time before, there can be no doubt, it would have been considered good, at least, as a contingent remainder or executory devise, accordingly as it had a particular previous freehold estate, or not, to support it, if not positively good as a vested interest. Lord North, in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Biddal, </em>(2 Mod. <em>292; s. </em>c. 1 Freem. 244,) says, <em>\u201c </em>A devise to an infant <em>in ventre sa mere, </em>is good, axxd it shall descend to the heir in the mean \"time; for the testator coxxld not intend he should take presently; he must <em>first </em>'be <em>in rerum natura; </em>so that it works in the nature of an <em>executory </em>devise.\u201d So in <em>Gynes </em>v. <em>Kemsley, </em>(1 Freem. 293,) he agaixx repeats, \u201c The law is clear now, that a devise to an infant <em>in ventre sa mere </em>is good enough, though he be born after the death of the testator, and he will take by way of <em>executory </em>devise whexx he is born.\u201d Again, some eighteeix years aftex\u2019wards, Pasch. 6 William &amp; Maxy, the Coux-t of King\u2019s Bench, in <em>Reeve </em>v. <em>Long, </em>(1 Salk. 227; s. c. 309; 3 Lev. 408; 4 Mod. 282 ; Skin. 430; Comb. 252; 12 Mod. 52; Holt, 228, 286,) where the testator seised of lands in fee died after devising the same to his nephew H. L. for life, remainder to his first soxx in tail male, and so on to the second, third, &amp;c.; and for default of such issue to his nephew, R. L., &amp;e., H. L., after the death of the devisor, married aixd died without issue, other than leaving his wife <em>enciento </em>with a son, it was held, that this posthumous son was not entitled to the remainder ; thereby affirming the judgment of the Commoxx Pleas, because the remainder being contingent, as the judges of these Courts conceived, so long as the son was not actually born, it was lost by the previous determination of the father\u2019s life estate which supported it. This judgment, however, was reversed upon wx'it of ex'ror in the House of Lords, contrary to the opinion of all the judges, who were much dissatisfied therewith, as it was said. Shortly after-wards, the statute of 10 &amp; 11 W. 3, c. 16, was passed, declax\u2019ing that posthumous children shall take estates limited in remainder by marriage or other settlement to which they would be entitled, if born, in the same manner as if born in the lifetime of \u2666their fathers, although there be no limitation to trustees. It was questioned by some, whether this statute extended to <em>devises, </em>as the words of it are <em>\u201c </em>whore an estate is by any marriage or other settlement limited,\u201d &amp;c. See a <em>quaere, </em>by Mr. Salkeld, at the close of his report of <em>Reeve </em>v. <em>Long, </em>(1 Salk. 228). Mr. Butler, in a note to Co. Litt. 298, says also, \u201c there is a tradition, that as the case of <em>Reeve </em>v. <em>Long </em>arose upon a will, the lords considered the law to be settled by their determination in that case, and were unwilling to make any <em>express mention </em>of limitations or devises made in <em>wills, </em>lest it should appear to call in question the authority or propriety of their determination;\u201d though he seems to think that the words of the act may be considered without much violence, to comprise settlements of estates made by will, as well as settlements of estates made by deed. It is also said in Buller\u2019s N. P. 105, that there is no ground for the doubt suggested by Salkeld. And in <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Quartley, </em>(1 Term. Rep. 634,) the Court seem to take for granted, that it is applicable to wills as well as deeds. But certainly the decision of the House of Lords was sufficient without the aid of the act, to settle the law and the rule in favour of posthumous children taking under a will in the same manner as if actually born; so that, since the determination of <em>Reeve </em>v. <em>Long </em>by the House of Lords, the law, in England, ought to be considered as settled, that an infant <em>in ventre sa mere </em>is capable of taking an estate limited to it in remainder. But it is somewhat unaccountable, that not only, after the law had been thus established, in favour of the capacity of an infant, <em>in ventre sa mere, </em>to take a remainder limited by will, but even after the passage of the statute of 10 &amp; 11 W. 3, it should have been thought by any to be contingent, itntil the actual birth of the child. Yet this would seem to have been the case, from what is said by the Court in <em>Gulliver </em>v. <em>Wicket, </em>(1 Wils. Rep. 106,) where the testator believing that his wife was with child, when in fact she was not, devised lands, of which he was seized in fee, to her for life, and after her death to the child, she was then <em>enciente </em>with, in fee, the Court said, they were of opinion, that the remainder in fee to the supposed child was a good <em>contingent </em>remainder. It is clear, that as the testator was altogether mistaken about his wife being in a state of pregnancy, the remainder was absolutely void; but why the Court, upon the supposition that the fact had been as the testator supposed, seemed to think that the remainder would have been good as a <em>contingent </em>remainder, I cannot conceive; for the child would have been as completely <em>in esse, </em>and as fully capable of taking the estate limited</p>\n<p id=\"AvU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>to it, according to the final determination of <em>Reeve </em>v. <em>Long, </em>and the application that has been made of 10 &amp; 11 W. 3, c. 16, as if it had been actually born and visible to the world at the time of making the will: if so, the remainder limited to it, had been <em>in ventre sa mere, </em>would have been a vested remainder, liable, however, to *be divested perhaps in the event of the child\u2019s not born alive afterwards. And Mr. Bayley pronounces it a vested remainder in <em>Herbert </em>v. (2 Barn. &amp; Cress, 925; s. c. 9 Eng. Com. Law. Reps. Justice <em>Kelley, </em>278-9). His words are, \u201c As a child <em>in ventre sa mere </em>is for many purposes considered <em>in esse, </em>the first remainder, a fee determinable, was <em>vested </em>in the child, and the remainder over could only take effect by way of executory devise.\u201d . It seems to me, then, that not only authority, but reason, and the analogy of the law, all unite in requiring that such a limitation should be treated as a vested remainder, ever after the conception of the child, if subsequently born alive. A child <em>in ventre sa mere </em>is deemed by law as in life or being for a variety of purposes at least. The mother may be guilty of murder by taking poison with an intent to destroy it, if it should be born alive thereafter and die from the effect of the poison ; yet murder can only be committed by killing a <em>reasonable creature in being ; </em>hence the child is deemed such, though only <em>in ventre sa mere </em>at the time of taking the poison. 3 Inst. 50 ; IP. Wins. 245, 487. An infant <em>in ventre sa mere </em>may be vouched in a recovery, though it is for the purpose of making him answer over in value, if Hod should give him birth. 1 Inst. 390, a. <em>Thellusson </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>(4 Ves. 322); so that, from this, it would appear, that such infant is not merely considered as in being in those eases alone, where it is for his benefit to be so, according to the rule of the civil law, <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Hodson, </em>(2 Atk. 119,) but for the purpose also of being charged in some instances. He may be an executor, Swinburne, 359, part 5. He may take under the statute of distributions. <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Hodson, </em>(2 Atk. 115); <em>Burnatt </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>(1 Ves. 156); <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>(2 P. Wms. 446). He may also take by devise. Swinburne, 250, 251; Moore, 177; Com. Dig. tit. Devise (1). He may be entitled under marriage articles to a portion as a child <em>living </em>at the death of the father or mother. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>(1 Ves. 85). He may have an injunction to stay waste. <em>Lutteral\u2019s Case, </em>cited in <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>(Prec. in Chan. 50); 2 Vern. 710; and he may have a guardian; 12 Car. 2, c. 24, sec. 8 &amp; 9. The most of these positions are repeated by Mr. Justice Buller, in <em>Thellusson </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>(4 Ves. 322,) who also repeats there what was laid down by Lord Hardwicke, in <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Hodson, </em>(2 Atk. 117). <em>\u201c </em>The principal reason, says Lord Hardwicke, I go upon in this question is, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>plaintiff was <em>in ventre sa mere </em>at the time of her brother\u2019s death, and consequently a person <em>in rerum </em>natura, so that both by the rules of the common and civil law, she was, to <em>all intents and </em>\u25a0purposes, a <em>child, </em>as much as if born in the father\u2019s lifetime.\u201d This proposition of Lord Hardwicke is fully sustained by the previous cases, decided on this subject, of <em>Burdett </em>v. <em>Hopegood, </em>(1. P. Wms. 486, 487); <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Beale, </em>(Id. 246,) and <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>(Prec. in Chan. 50). And subsequently in conformity to the same principle, Lord Hardwicke decided in <em>* Miller </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>(1 Ves. 88,) that a posthumous child was within the provision contained in marriage articles, for such children of the marriage, as should be <em>living at the death </em>of the father or mother. Lord Thurlow also, in <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>(2 Bro. Ch. Ca. 320,) held that a child <em>in ventre sa mere </em>at the death of A. should take as a child <em>living at the death </em>of A. The same principle was confirmed afterwards by the same, in 2 Ves. Jr. 673. The same question growing out of the same will, came before the Common Pleas in <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>(2 Hen. Bl. 399.) According to the case, as stated there, lands were- devised to B. for life, and after his decease, to <em>all </em>and <em>every such child </em>or <em>children </em>of B. as should be <em>living at the time of his decease; </em>and it was held by all the judges that a <em>posthumous </em>child of B. should share equally with those born in his lifetime: and that in law, at least, if not in fact, an infant <em>in ventre sa mere </em>was considered as <em>born </em>for <em>all purposes </em>which were for <em>his benefit. </em>And in confirmation of this last position, afterwards, in <em>Whitelock </em>v. <em>Heddon, </em>(1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 243,) the devise- being to any son of John Whitelock, begotten and <em>born </em>in lawful wedlock, <em>at the time </em>of John Heddon\u2019s attaining the <em>age of twenty-one years, </em>it was held unanimously, that a son <em>born </em>about <em>four months after </em>the time, when John Heddon attained twenty-one was entitled to take under the devise. So, previously to this, in <em>Lancashire </em>v. <em>Lancashire, </em>(5 Term Rep. 49,) the King\u2019s Bench seem to take it as a matter conceded and settled, that an infant <em>in ventre sa mere </em>is <em>born </em>for <em>every purpose </em>where it is <em>for his advantage </em>to be so; and Mr. Justice Grose there, page 64, says, <em>\u201c </em>The instant the child is born, he is considered by <em>retrospect </em>as <em>born during the parent\u2019s life. </em>For this opinion I refer to the civil law, as was done in <em>Christopher </em>v. <em>Christopher, </em>and the other cases which are founded on that law. Yinniers says, <em>\u201csi modo postea nascatur, tunc enim fictione juris nativitas retrotrahitur.\u201d </em>In <em>Trower </em>v. <em>Butts, </em>the last English case to which I shall refer oh this point, (1 Simons &amp; Stewart, 181; s. c. 1 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 90,) the bequest was in trust for all the children of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the testatrix\u2019s nephew R. <em>lorn in the lifetime of the testatrix, </em>and it was held by the Yice-Chancellor, that a child of which the wife of R. was <em>enciente </em>at the time of the testatrix\u2019s death, though not born for four months afterwards, was included in the bequest.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The stat. of 10 &amp; 11 <em>W. </em>3, c. 16, being in force here, and the. English decisions made anterior to our revolution being regarded as having a binding authority, the case of <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Duffield, </em>(5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 40,) may be considered as having been determined in conformity to them. There it was held that a grand-child, <em>in ventre sa mere, </em>at the time of making the will, and born after the death of the testator, was entitled to a grandchild\u2019s share, under a devise and bequest to the testator\u2019s grandchildren, the children of his son A., deceased, of all the remainder and residue of his estate, both real and personal, whatsoever ^ wheresoever to be found. Mr. Justice *Duncan, in delivering the opinion of the Court, after repeating and recognising the principle as laid down by Lord Hardwicko in <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Hodson, </em>says, \u201cA child in the womb of the mother is under the protection of the law, and <em>possessed of all the privileges of a living being. </em>He is considered <em>as born from the time the will takes effect.\u201d </em>It is perfectly obvious, that the Court considered and treated the share of the posthumous grand-child as an interest that <em>vested </em>immediately upon the dying of the testator. Indeed, it is impossible that such child could have- taken at all under the will, unless as a vested interest; because, otherwise, the whole of the <em>residuum </em>of the testator\u2019s estate, must have vested in the other children of his deceased son A., and been taken by them exclusively.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Seeing, then, that a child <em>in ventre sa mere, </em>at the time of the testator\u2019s death, being the time also when the will takes effect, and born afterwards, is not only considered <em>in esse </em>but as <em>born, </em>for the purpose of taking any benefit under the will that it would be entitled to, in case it had been actually born, then, it would necessarily seem to follow, that whatever is thereby given to such child cannot be considered as contingent by reason of any uncertainty in respect to the child\u2019s existence. As to the object of the testator\u2019s bounty, in such ease it is considered as <em>in being </em>and <em>certain ; </em>and if there be no uncertainty or contingency attending the gift in any other respect, it will be considered as vesting immediately upon the death of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">According to this doctrine, then, the devise here to the <em>issue </em>of the wife, that is, the. child with which she was then pregnant, as we construe it, became vested in interest immediately in the</p>\n<p id=\"AH6a\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>child, upon the death of the devisor, though it could not vest in possession during the life of the wife, who had the right thereto for that period. Consequently, the devise to the child, there being general words of inheritance superadded to the same, constituted a vested remainder in fee, but liable to be determined by the child\u2019s not living till twenty:one or marriage, according to the subsequent provision and limitation of the estate, whereby it is given to the children of the devisor\u2019s sister Sarah, and the children of his brother, Walker Yarnall, provided he should have any. But this last limitation of the estate being after a previous fee therein given to the child of his wife, which vested in it upon the death of the devisor, could only take effect as an executory devise. It is pretty much like the ease in 1 Equity Ca. Abr. 188, pl. 8, where one devised land to his wife, till his son should come to the age of twenty-one years, and then that his son should have the land, to him and' his heirs, and if he died without issue before said age, then to his daughter and her heirs; and it was held to be an executory devise to the daughter, if the contingency happened. The child, then, having died here before it attained twenty-one years of age, or contracted matrimony, the *children of the devisor\u2019s sister Sarah, thereupon became entitled to an undivided moiety of the estate* which they took as an executory devise: and should Walker Yarnall, the brother, having no child or children as yet, hereafter have any, a thing still possible in contemplation of law, as long as he is in being, however old or infirm he may be, such child or children will become entitled to the other moiety. The title of the plaintiff is therefore liable to be defeated, as to- a moiety of the estate, in case Walker Yarnall should have a child hereafter. Consequently, as it is not absolutely indefeasible, the defendant is not bound to accept it under the agreement for the purchase of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Supposing however, the limitation to the child <em>in ventre sa </em>mere, were a contingent and not a vested remainder at the death of the testator, still it cannot be pretended, that it did not become <em>vested </em>immediately upon the birth of the child; for the devise to the child is not given upon any contingency or condition precedent; such as \u201cif it shall attain the age of twenty-one years or get married.\u201d Indeed it might perhaps have admitted of a question whether the words of the will do not import a devise of the estate immediately to the wife and child jointly, for the life of the wife, with a determinable fee in remainder to the child; the words are, \u201c I devise to my wife all my estate during her life, <em>and </em>to her issue (child) by me begotten, his or her heirs and assigns forever,\u201d &amp;c. The wife and child seem to be joined in this devise simply by the copulative \u201c and.\u201d But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>waiving this question, and admitting there were such apparent 'words of condition annexed .to the devise to the child, the limitation over would have been considered so far explanatory of them, as to have prevented their receiving such a construction. This principle seems to be fully established by the cases of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>(8 Lev. 132; s. c. 2 Show. 398 ; <em>4 </em>Bos. <em>&amp; </em>Pull. 324, in note); <em>Broomfield </em>v. <em>Crowder, </em>(4 Bos. &amp; Pull. 313); <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>(14 East, 601,) and <em>Roake </em>v. <em>Nowell, </em>(1 Maule <em>k </em>Selw. 327 ; s. c. 5 Dow. 202). These authorities go to show that the condition in such cases is to be regarded as of a subsequent character. In the last case cited, which was affirmed in the House of Lords, the devisor devised to his nephew J. R. for life, who was not even married, and had no children till after the death of the devisor, remainder to and among his children lawfully begotten, equally, <em>at the age of twenty-one, </em>and their heirs, as tenants in common ; but if only one child should live to attain such age, to him or her, and his or her heirs, <em>at his or her age of </em>twenty-one ; and in case his said nephew should die without lawful issue, or such lawful issue should die before twenty-one then over. J. R. marrying afterwards, and having children, levied a fine during their minority, which raised the question whether their shares were contingent or vested, or in other words, destructible by the act of J. R. or not. The Court of Ring\u2019s Bench held that the remainders were ^vested in the children on their births, and said that the case was concluded by <em>Broomfield </em>v. <em>Crowder, </em>which\u2019was fully considered. There the devise was in <em>remainder, </em>of all the testator\u2019s estate to J. D. Broomfield, <em>if </em>the said J. D. B. should live to the age of twenty-one years; but in case the said J. D. B. died under twenty-one, and C. Broomfield should survive him, <em>then over; </em>and it was resolved that J. D. Broomfield took a <em>vested </em>estate, <em>determinable </em>upon the contingency of his dying under twenty-one. After that devise, came the case of <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>which was an <em>immediate </em>devise of the testator\u2019s real estate in fee to J. Moore, when he attained the age of twenty-one, but in case he died before twenty-one, then to his brother, &amp;c.; and there it was held that J. Moore took a <em>vested </em>estate. So that, whether the devise be in <em>remainder </em>or an <em>immediate </em>devise, it appears there is no substantial difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The remainder in fee determinable having vested in the child here immediately on its birth, if not before, the limitation over to the children of the devisor\u2019s sister Sarah, and of his brother Walker, could only take effect, if at all, as an executory devise, because, according to the rules of law, no estate can be limited to take effect after a fee, except by way of executory devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">But whether the fee upon which the limitation over is en-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>grafted, be immediate, or one in remainder, either contingent or vested, can make no difference, so that the contingency upon which it is limited to take effect, must necessarily happen, if ever, within one or more life or lives in being and twenty-one years after, including a sufficient number of months for the birth of a child <em>in ventre sa mere. </em>See Fearne on Cont. Rem. and Ex. Dev. 429, and note also, (8th ed). Put it has been objected, that as no child was in being at the death of the devisor, and if none had been born afterwards alive, the limitation over, to the children of Sarah and Walker, respectively, would, in that dase, have been good as a contingent remainder ; and if so, it shall\" not be construed.an executory devise according to a change produced in the state of objects subsequently to the death of the devisor; because it is a rule, said to be without an exception, that if a devise <em>according to the state of the objects at the death of the </em>testator, be capable of taking effect as a remainder, it shall not be construed to be an executory devise; for this <em>Purefoy </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>(2 Lev. 39 ; s. c. 2 Saund. 380); <em>Reeve </em>v. <em>Long, </em>(Carth. 310); <em>Goodright </em>v. <em>Cornish, </em>(4 Mod. 258); and 2nd Jarman\u2019s Powell on Dev. 237, are cited. Admitting the applicability of the rule, still I apprehend, it is saying too much, that it is without an exception. And Mr. Jarman himself, in his 2 Powell on Dev. 244, 245, has referred to <em>Fonnereau </em>v. <em>Fonnereau, </em>(Doug. 487, 508, 509,) where the testator devised to the heirs male of the body of T., testator\u2019s eldest son, (to whom an estate for life had been limited by-deed,) and on default of such issue, to testator\u2019s second, third, fourth, and fifth sons, successively in tail male: and it was held, that if T. died ^leaving an heir male of his body, the limitation to the .testator\u2019s next son took effect as a remainder expectant on estate male; he died leaving no male issue, that it took effect immediately as an executory devise. And Lord Mansfield encounters the rule thus: \u201cAn obvious objection to the <em>alternative </em>in this ease is, that if the limitation over is a remainder, it cannot be turned into an executory devise. <em>That </em>is true, if -it ever vest as a remainder. Put here it might or might not, upon a contingency; and it never did. 2d. So in <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>Lord Talbot decided, <em>in support of the intent, </em>that a limitation which in one event would have operated as a remainder, but which event did not happen, should operate as an executory devise. This he did upon principle, without precedents ; and a great estate is now held under his determination. 3d. <em>Brownsword </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>is another strong instance, where it was held that a devise may operate either way, according to the events.\u201d Here, then, according to the reasoning of Lord Mansfield, and the authorities cited by him, in order to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the intent of the testator, the remainder in fee to the <em>issue, </em>or child of the wife, having vested, and having again been determined by the child\u2019s dying before twenty-one or marriage, the devise over to the children of Sarah and Walker, if he should hereafter have any, must necessarily be construed and be permitted to operate as an executory devise. And in <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>before referred to, the devise was to the testator\u2019s son Gr. for life, and from and after his decease, unto all and every the child and children of Gr. lawfully to be begotten, and their heirs forever, to hold as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants; but if his son G. should die without issue, or leaving issue\u2019, and such child or children should die before attaining the age of twenty-one years, or without lawful issue, then over to his son T., his daughter A. S., and his son-in-law W. D., and to their heirs for ever, as tenants in common and not as joint-tenants, Mr. Justice Bayloy, in delivering his opinion in this case, presents it precisely under the supposed aspect which the case before us has actually assumed, from the events that have happened; and expresses his opinion without the least doubt in favour of its operating as an executory devise. \u201cBut it may happen,\u201d says he, \u201cthat an estate may be devised over in either of two events; and that in the one event, the devise may operate as a contingent remainder, in the other, as an executory devise. Thus if G. had left a child, a determinable fee would have vested in that child, and then the devise over, could only have operated as an executory devise.\u201d Judgment is rendered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Cited by Counsel, 7 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 97; 2 Barr, 336; 11 Harris, 238; 4 Casey, 99; 6 Id. 167,. 174; 7 P.
