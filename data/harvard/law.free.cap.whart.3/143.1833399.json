On the contrary, if the Court shall be of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment, judgment to. be entered for the defendant accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-8\">The Court (Banks, President) ordered judgment to be entered for the plaintiff on the case, and expressed their opinion, in substance, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-9\">\u201c The original judgment was entered on the 17th of April, 1812. The debt was $100, of which $50 was payable the 1st of April, 1813, and $50 the 1st of April, 1814. The <em>scire facias </em>was issued on the 17th of January, 1835, a period of more than twenty years after the entry of the judgment, and more than twenty years after the debt was due. From this length of time, the law would presume the judgment satisfied. This presumption is not conclusive evidence that the debt has been paid. It is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of its payment, and casts the burthen on the plaintiffs of removing the presumption by countervailing proofs. Are there any circumstances in this case which do countervail this presumption ? This is the only point in the cause which has been brought to our notice. The only circumstance which can raise a question is the fact that the defendant was insolvent. The principle upon which the presumption of payment arises from lapse of time alone is a reasonable one, and may be overturned and nullified by any fact which destroys the reason of the rule itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-10\">It is reasonable to presume that a man will pay his debts in twenty years, but you remove all reasonable ground to presume this, by proving that the debtor was unable to pay. It is not reasonable to presume that an insolvent man will pay his debts. Proof that the debtor was not in circumstances to pay, would be proper to go to a jury, and from which they might say that the debt was not discharged. This itself would remove the presumption of payment from lapse of time. Here the debtor actually took the benefit of the insolvent laws in 1826. It appears that the judgment creditor was not returned as being a creditor at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>that time, nor clid he return the property bound by this judgment, though it was confessed by him at the time. Then this does not amount to much, either way. It is the act of the defendant alone. It does not make much for the defendant. If the case had been submitted to a jury, and the facts stated had been proved before them, they might very correctly have said by their verdict, that the debt was not paid, and the C.ourt would have been bound to tell them so. If the jury might so have found, it is our duty so to decide; for whatever a jury might have done with propriety on the <em>sam\u00e9 </em>facts proved, the Court may with as much propriety do, <em>on </em>similar facts stated for their opinion. There is a great variety of circumstances by which *the presumption of payment from lapse of time may be repelled. All the books and all the cases unite in the doctrine, that the insolvency of the debtor is one of these circumstances. That being the well established rule of law, and it being made part of the case, that the debtor was insolvent, we must give judgment for the plaintiffs, as this is the only point made in the argument. The Court accordingly gave judgment for the plaintiffs on the case stated.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-8\">Mr. <em>Porter </em>argued for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANm\">In this case 20 years expired after the bond fell due before the <em>scire facias </em>issued. This is such a lapse of time as raises a presumption in law of payment, whether the debt be secured by bond, mortgage, or judgment, <em>Cope </em>v. <em>Humphreys, </em>(14 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 15); <em>Diemer </em>v. <em>Sechrist, </em>(1 Penn. Rep. 420); <em>Foulk </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>(2 Watts, 215); <em>Power </em>v. <em>Hollman, </em>(2 Watts, 219). After this lapse of time, it lies on the plaintiff to prove such facts and circumstances as will satisfy the jury that there were other reasons for the delay of the prosecution of the claim than the alleged payment. Then are there any such circumstances here ? The principal fact relied on, viz. the discharge of the obligor under the insolvent law, is not sufficient. It is settled, that this does not prevent the running of the statute of limitations. <em>Sletor </em>v. <em>Oram, </em>(1 Whart. Rep. 106); <em>Power </em>v. <em>Hollman, </em>(2 Watts, 219). In <em>Foulk </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>it was held, that the circumstance of the husband of a <em>feme covert </em>legatee who died, not having taken out letters of administration, was not sufficient to bar the presumption.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-9\">Mr. <em>Hirie, </em>in support of the judgment below,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE\">cited <em>The Mayor of Hull </em>v. <em>Horner, </em>(Cowper, 109); <em>Summerville </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>(1 Watts, 518); <em>Bolts </em>v. <em>Bullman, </em>(1 Yeates, 584); <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>(5 Watts, 548); <em>Delany </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>(2 Wharton\u2019s Rep. 503).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b150-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b150-6\">Sergeant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1mG\">According to the English practice, a special case is used instead of a special verdict. It is a species of special verdict. The jury find generally for either party, but subject to the opinion of the Court, on a special case (stated by the counsel on both sides, or dictated by the judge), with regard to a matter of law. Leave is sometimes given to turn it into a special verdict. But in a special case, as in a special verdict, the facts proved at the trial ought to be stated, and not merely the evidence of facts. In arguing a special case, the counsel are not permitted to go out of it, and the Court must judge upon it as stated. If it be so defective, that the Court are not able to give judgment, they will grant a new trial, in order to have it restated. 1 Tidd\u2019s Prac. <em>930; </em>1 Arch. Prac. 3 92.</p>\n<p id=\"pAK7\">*Under our practice, a special case, or as it is usually a case has been more used. The parties, where a real contest exists, may enter an action by amicable agreement, and in that action, or in one brought by process issued, may agree to state certain facts for the opinion of the Court; and if they desire to have the benefit of a writ of error, may insert in their agreement that it shall be in nature of a special verdict. 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 529. The rule, however, as to the duty of stating the facts only, and not the evidence of facts, and of submitting to the Court only questions of law, is the same here as in the English practice. Ib. 4 Watts, 312. <em>Ad questiones facti non respondent judices. </em>It would be a departure from established principles, and from sound policy, to allow the parties to submit to the determination of the Court, anything else than questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">A presumption of one fact from others is an inference of fact. Whether in a given case the jury ought to make that presumption, is a question of law. Where, according to the rule of law, the jury are bound to make that presumption, it still remains an inference of fact. The circumstance that the jury are bound to make it, does not render it matter of law, so that the Court can draw the presumption. Erom evidence of any fact which in law is deemed conclusive, the jury are bound to infer the fact; and the Court would so instruct them, and would grant a new trial if they refused. That would not authorize the Court, in a common law suit, to usurp the province of the jury and adjudge on a special verdict or demurrer, that the statement of the evidence proving a fact was equivalent to stating the fact thus proved. So, in the cases of presumptions. After twenty years, bonds and other instruments not within the statute of limitations, are presumed or inferred to have been paid; but that is an inference which the jury must make \u2014 the Court charging as to what is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>rule of law. Though it may appear at first to be singular to require a jury to find an artificial presumption, and not for the Court itself to draw it, (see 2 Stark. Evid. 675,) yet is no more than results from our mixed tribunal of Court and jury, in which each performs its own function without encroaching on the peculiar jurisdiction of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">As the making a presumption of one fact from other facts is thus a matter which belongs to the jury, so do the circumstances which go to repel that presumption; as for instance, to show that payment has not been made. And here the same division of duty occurs. Whether, in point of law, the circumstances proved are sufficient to repel the presumption, is for the Court to determine; but whether they do in fact repel it, is for the jury to find by their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">I am therefore of opinion, on the case here stated, that the Court below erred in deciding on the effect of the circumstances *set forth in repelling the alleged presumption; and that it could only be done by a jury, with the 'aid of the Court, by means of a verdict; therefore the judgment below must be reversed, and the case remitted to the Court below to proceed in.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Cited by Counsel, 2 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 370; 5 Id. 209, 331; 9 Harris, 293; 5 P.
