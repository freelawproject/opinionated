Stitt, and George Wall, trading under the firm of John W. Stitt &amp; Co., and filed a declaration in assumpsit upon a bill .of exchange, dated the 2d of January 1837, drawn by E. E. Haskell upon J. W. Stitt &amp; Co., and accepted by them,.for $750, in favour of E. E. Haskell, and endorsed by him to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-14\">The plaintiff filed a copy of this instrument of writing, in conformity with the provisions of the act of 28th March, 1835.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-15\">The defendant filed the following affidavit of defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-16\">\u201cJohn W. Stitt, one of the above defendants, being duly affirmed, says, there is a defence to the above action, to wit: The draft on which suit is brought, and a copy of which has been filed, was made by the defendants and accepted by them, and handed to E. E. Haskell to get discounted, in the Delaware Co. Bank, Chester, and hand over the proceeds to them, the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>defendants; and in case he should not get it discounted, the said Haskell was to return the draft to the Said defendants. The said Haskell had no interest in the draft except as the agent of the defendants, to get it discounted at bank. The said Haskell was unable to get it discounted; and *affirmant fully believed that it had been returned to the defendants and destroyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">He has since learnt that said Haskell gave the draft to the plaintiff, as collateral security for the sum of $300, borrowed by Haskell from him, for his own use, and not for the defendants\u2019. That the said pawn of the draft was without the knowledge and consent of the defendants; and in violation of the trust reposed in the said Haskell. That the said plaintiff did not receive the said draft in the ordinary and usual course of business, but received it under circumstances of suspicion, and such as ought to have put him on inquiry. Affirmant is instructed, that such being the case, the defendants have the same defence against the plaintiff, as'they would have against the said Haskell, the drawer and endorser of the said draft, had it remained in his possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-7\">And affirmant positively affirms, that the said defendants are not indebted one cent to the said Haskell, but on the contrary, he, the said Haskell is indebted to them in a large sum of money. At the time he received the said draft, the said plaintiff gave the said Haskell the following receipt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-8\">Ashton, 19th January, 1837.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-9\"><em>1 </em>Received of E.

The Court erred in deciding that the affidavit of defence filed in the above case, was not sufficient to entitle the defendant to a trial by jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-15\">2.

But the conclusion thus indicated is matter to be verified, not by the oath of the party, but by the judgment of the Court: it is in fine a conclusion of law. The only pure matter of fact sworn to, is, that the plaintiff took the draft under circumstances which do not ordinarily'attend the negotiation of commercial paper; but all-such circumstances may not equally affect a party with notice; and, without having them exhibited, how can the Court say whether they are circumstances of suspicion at all ? They ought to have been set out; for it is not enough to swear to a general allegation of defence, without submitting the particulars, in order that the Court may determine whether it be in truth what it is called; and for this defect, the affidavit is palpably insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Cited, by Counsel, 6 Wharton, 471; 6 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 222 ; 2 Barr, 348 ; 1 Wright, 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Cited by the Court, 4 Casey, 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">As to when an endorsee must show that he is a <em>bona fide </em>holder, see 2 Wharton, 265 ; 4 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 447 ; 7 Barr, 477; 5 Casey, 367.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
