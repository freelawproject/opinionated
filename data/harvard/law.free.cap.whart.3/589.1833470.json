Smith, for the use of Richard S. Field, against Samuel Sillyman, John Sillyman, and William 'F. Dean, to recover the amount of a bond for two thousand dollars conditioned for the payment of one thousand dollars on the 8th of November, 1830, without interest. The writ was served on S. Sillyman only; he alone has been proceeded against by the plaintiff, and now stands as the only defendant on the record. By his plea, the defendant admits the execution of the bond, and rests his defence on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>' failure of the, consideration, alleging that it was *given for part of the consideration money of a tract of one hundred acres of coal land in Schuylkill county, and that the title to the land having been proved to be defective and void, the consideration of the bond has failed, and he is not bound to pay it. Articles of agreement were entered into on the 27th of January, 1830, between Burckhart Moser of the one part, and Samuel Bassett and Edward Smith, for the sale and purchase of one hundred acres of coal land. [Here his Honour read the contract.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-6\">By this contract, the equitable title to this land, so far as it was in B. Moser and those whose agent or attorney he may have been, passed to Smith and Bassett, subject to their complying with their part of the contract; and, they complying with their part and their assigns, could maintain ejectment against B. Moser, and those owners who had authorized him to act for them; or an action for damages might have been sustained against B. Moser, had he dishonestly or unlawfully refused to comply with his agreement, or failed to procure the conveyance he contracted to obtain, if the Moser title had been a good one, (Sug. 174.) On this contract Bassett and Smith, and their assigns, if they should succeed in proving the Moser title a bad one, could obtain ho damages for the loss of their bargain, if they had sued for the recovery of the money paid-in assumpsit, and if they had affirmed the agreement by bringing an action for damag\u00f3s for the nonperformance of it, they could only obtain nominal damages for the loss of their bargain, if the Moser title be a bad one, because a purchaser is not entitled to any compensation for the fancied goodness of his bargain, which he may suppose he had lost, where the vendor is, without fraud, incapable' of making a title. B. Moser, and the heirs of his father who authorized him to contract, became trustees of their respective interests for Smith and Bassett and their assigns. All the heirs, with the exception of minors, representing one-sixth, subsequently ratified the contract, by executing the deed to the defendant Sillyman, and may therefore be supposed, in the absence of proof to the contrary, to have authorized B. Moser to contract. The guardians of the minors also, so far as they were able, approved his acts, and executed the deed given in evidence, with their hands and seals, relating to that one-sixth. On the 8th of February, 1830, Bassett and Smith paid B. Moser the $50, and he extended the time f\u00f3r taking the deed, from the 8th of AprU to the 8th of May. \u201c A title to land, under an agreement for its purchase, is a title to the estate in fee simple in possession, subject to the decision of a Court of equity upon the right to a specific performance. It is a devisable interest, and not a mere pretended right or title.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Sug. on Vend. 348. The purchaser, fyom the time of the contract, is in equity the owner of 'the estate, and. may sell, devise arid dispose of it in the same manner as if the fee were actually conveyed to him; although, if ultimately a Court of equity refuse a specific performance, the devise, *sale, or other disposition, necessarily falls to the ground. Upon a sale of an interest under a contract, the seller becomes a trustee for the second purchaser, and the second purchaser is, without entering in a covenant, bound to indemnify him against all costs incurred in proceedings for his benefit. The Court not only consider it not unlawful, but compels him to'permit his name to be used for the benefit of the second purchaser. In Pennsylvania, on such articles, there being no Court of equity, ejectment may be sustained, and the land recovered from the person having. the legal title, if he refuse to convey. When the party intended to convey, and the other expected to receive a good title, it is but equity that the purchaser should have relief in case of any defect in title, although there was no express agreement to that purpose. Where the intent was that the purchaser should run the risk of the title, there is not a word to be said for him. Such intent may be fairly inferred, when he knew of the defect at the time of purchase, and made no provision against it in his agreement. <em>Mart </em>v. <em>Executors of </em>Porter, (per Tilgbman, C. J. 5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 204, 205). A purchaser not having paid his money, may defend himself under a defect of title, when part of his purchase has been evicted, although he has accepted a conveyance with no more than a special warranty, and when there has been no eviction, and the title is defective also. Id. 206. On the 23d of April, 1830, John K. Smith executed articles of agreement with S. and J. Sillyman and W. F. Dean, for three-fourths of these one hundred acres or contract. (Here his Honour read the contract.) By this instrument, three-fourths of all the instrument of Bassett and. Smith and Field, who had become interested, (whether J. K. Smith was their agent, or the principal, as asserted, of their interest,) passed to the Sillymans and Dean. They became owners of the three-fourths of the land as fully as Bassett and Smith would, subject to their complying with their contract; and the bond in question, or money received by it, is proved and admitted to be part of the consideration of this contract, or assignment, or agreement, by which the land did pass, if the Mosers owned it originally ; but the-plaintiff denies it to be the consideration for the land, and alleges that it was only for the title, good or bad, of J. K. Smith, or those he represented. Now, by the law, a man may sell a mere right to land; he may sell all his right, title and interest, whether he has a title or no title; and where the parties agree to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>buy or sell such a title, the purchaser cannot set up a defect in the title which he purchased with his eyes open intentionally, against the payment of the purchase-money. No Court would relieve him or aid him in resisting the payment of his bond, or other security for the purchase-money. Is such a contract given in evidence ? If there he any ambiguity in this contract, it principally arises from the language where J. K. Smith is said to have and sold \u201c three and undivided fourth a cei4ain contract for the sale of 100 *acres of coal land.\u201d The question is, therefore, whether on the face of the contract, as unexplained by other evidence, or from it and the other testimony, the parties agreed to sell and purchase a mere right, and the purchaser to run the risk of the title. On the face of the contract, I am \u25a0 of opinion, it does not clearly appear that the risk af the title was to be run by the purchaser, either as to the $6000 paid or secured to the Mosers, or as to the $3000 for which the bonds were given to J. K. Smith, and assigned by him to Bassett and Howell Smith. Whether such appears from the evidence and explanation of the contract to have been the understanding or agreement of the parties, must he judged of arid determined by the jury, under the direction of the Court, as to the matters of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-5\">I have been requested to charge upon the different points presented by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-6\">1. I have answered the first point already in my general charge. The doctrine of this point is applicable to a sale of land, the equitable title to which is only in the vendor, under articles for the purchase and sale of land, the legal title remaining in the original vendor, who agreed to sell, but executed no deed of conveyance of the legal title: to such an instrument as is described in this proposition, it may not extend ; but to the contract given in evidence, dated the 23d April, 1830, for which the bond in suit was part of the consideration, it does extend, unless by the terms of the instrument, or evidence in explanation of it, it should appear it was the intention of the parties to sell and buy a mere right, and the purchaser undertakes to run the risk of the title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-7\">2. Although the conveyance does contain a good and .available warranty of title, yet the doctrine referred to in this proposition does apply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-8\">3. The third proposition I have answered in my general charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-9\">4. On this point I-agree with the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-10\">5. On this point I agree with the plaintiff. If J. K. Smith agreed to investigate the title, it must have been in his new character as a partner of Sillyman and others, and not as the agent of Field. It contradicts the written contracts, and does not ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>plain any ambiguity; but as fraud is not alleged, I do not deem it very material.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-6\">6. If J. K. Smith assigned the bond on which this suit is founded, on or before the 27th May, 1830, (the assignment having ho date,) his declarations alleged to have been made subsequently to that time, should be disregarded by the jury, as in such case they would not be evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-7\">The plaintiff excepted to this charge, and the jury found for the defendant; when the plaintiff took a writ of error, and filed the following specifications.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-8\">\u201c 1. Because the Court below admitted William F. Dean, one of the co-obligors in the bond, as a witness, by virtue of the deposit by *the defendant of $1300 with the prothonotary, upon stipulation to be returned to him in case of judgment being rendered for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-9\"><em>2. </em>Because the Court below refused to let the plaintiff take the sum of $1300 out of Court thus paid in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-10\">3. Because the Court below admitted in evidence a survey of an adjoining tract made by strangers to this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-11\">4. Because the Court below admitted the record of the ejectment of The Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company <em>v '. </em>Samuel Sillyman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-12\">(a) Because S. Sillyman, the defendant, gave no notice to the plaintiff of the existence of said suit, or opportunity to take defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-14\">(b) That the record itself is incomplete, inasmuch as it contains no final judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-16\">5. Because the Court, in their charge to the jury, said that the doctrine of resisting the payment of purchase money in consequence of a defect of title, was applicable to the agreement of the 23d April, 1830.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-17\">6. Because the Court also said, that this doctrine was applicable to a deed with general warranty where there was a good and available warranty of title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-18\">7. Because the Court, iii declaring wdiat was the intention of the parties to the contract of the 23d of April, 1830, divided the question into two divisions, one including the documentary evidence, the effect of which they decided as a question of law, the other of parol testimony, which they left to the jury; whereas,' in such case, the Court should have left the whole documentary and parol testimony to the jury, as a question of fact, to be by them determined.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b609-19\">Mr. <em>Randall, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-20\">1. Dean was not a competent witness.

Tbe witness was directly liable, since a verdict for the plaintiff would leave him open to a future suit, and a verdict for the defendant would be conclusive. So the judge below thought; and .the idea was then suggested of paying the money in. None of the cases have gone so far. <em>Steele </em>v. <em>The Ph\u0153nix, </em>(3 Binn. 306,) and <em>Willing </em>v. <em>Consequa, </em>(1 Peters\u2019s C. C. Rep. 308,) which have been much regretted, certainly do not countenance this. In <em>Clement </em>v. <em>Bixler, </em>(3 Watts, 248,) it is said, that costs paid in on such an occasion are not recoverable back. If a co-obligor can by this method be made a witness, why may not the actual defendant do the same. In <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Connell, </em>(2 Whart. 542,) the Court said that a co-defendant not made a party could not be a witness, though every avenue to interest was closed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b610-5\">2-. The case of <em>Steinhauer </em>v. <em>Witman, </em>(1 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 447,) introduced a new doctrine in the law of vendors and purchasers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"pANBq\">*In that case, however, there was a special warranty, and no to the vendee to examine the title. It is said there, nevertheless, that when it appears that the vendee meant to take the risk of the title, he must pay the money; and the later authorities have not carried the doctrine any farther. <em>Dorsey </em>v. <em>Jackman, </em>(1 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 42); <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Porter, (5 </em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, 204);' <em>Friedly </em>v. <em>Sheetz, </em>(9 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 161); <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>(Addison, 9); <em>Poke </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>(13 Serg. &amp; Rawle, <em>165); Chrystie </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>(10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 258); <em>Lighty </em>v. <em>Shorb, </em>(3 Penn. Rep. 447). Here the terms of the contract prove distinctly, that nothing was contemplated but an assignment of a previous contract. There was also an available general warranty for the defendants, which they may resort to, as Moser was solvent, and liable to them. The parties who assigned to Sillyman entered into no covenant of title. The only defect applicable to the plaintiff would be his inability to assign his interest, by reason of a judgment binding it, or other difficulty of that kind, or fraud on the part of the plaintiff, which is not alleged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b610-6\">(The 3d, 4th, and 7th errors were abandoned.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b610-7\">Mr. <em>Mallery, </em>(with whom was Mr. Kittera,) for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b610-8\">1.

Field, against Samuel Sillyman, John Sillyman and William F. Dean. The sheriff returns, \u201csummoned,\u201d as to Samuel <em>Sillyman </em>\u2014 11 <em>nil habent,\u201d </em>as to John Sillyman and William F. Dean. This raises the question on the exception to the admission of William F. Dean, one of the obligors, as a witness. Without the deposit of the money with the prothonotary, upon the stipulation, to be returned, in case of judgment being rendered for the defendant, the witness would clearly be incompetent. By the act of the 6th April, 1830, whatever doubts may have existed before, judgment against the defendant Avould be no bar to a in another suit the though *not served with process. The witness was therefore directly interested in procuring a judgment for the defendant; for this would be a bar to a recovery against him, in a subsequent suit. And this would seem to have been the opinion of the Court; for the witness was rejected, in the first instance, and was afterwards admitted, solely, on the ground of the deposit of the amount claimed in Court. But, how does the deposit remove the objection taken on the score of interest? It is an additional security for the money, it is true, but still it does not amount to payment. It diminishes the risk, but the liability remains; and the amount of interest is nothing, so far as the question of competency is involved. The deposit does not extinguish the debt, and the witness was as obnoxious to suit as before. In this respect it differs from <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>(14 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 449). At this trial it was discovered, that a witness for the defence was one of the bail, and therefore incompetent: the judge, on the defendants depositing a sufficient sum in Court, made an order for striking the witness\u2019s name out of the bail-piece, so as to render him a competent witness. All power in relation to special bail is under the entire control of the contract, and the effect of the order was in this case to substitute one security for another, and in most .cases, affording a better indemnity to the plaintiff. It must be observed, that the bail, in <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>were discharged from all liability. The name of \u25a0 the bail being stricken out of the bail-piece, removes all objection to his competency. But here, Dean, the co-obligor, is bound for the money, as one of the principals, and I am yet to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>learn what right the Court has to discharge him from responsibility on the bond, without the consent of the obligees. We are of opinion, that the Court erred in admitting Dean as a witness.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The next question arises on the construction of the contract of the 23d of April, 1830, whether the parties agreed to sell and purchase a mere right, and the purchaser to run the risk of the title. The Court decided, that it did not appear on the face of the contract that the risk of the title was to be run by the purchaser. Of this the plaintiff complains. In a contract for the sale' of lands, a failure of consideration in an action for the recovery of the purchase-money is a good defence, in whole or in part, whether there be a general or special warranty. <em>Steinhauer </em>v. <em>Witman, Adm. of Myers, </em>(1 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 438); <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Porter\u2019s Exr. </em>(5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 201). These decisions, as is clearly shown in <em>Lighty </em>v. <em>Shorb, </em>(3 Penn. Rep. 450,) are not founded on authority, but are supported only by long. and uninterrupted usage. They are, however, too well settled to be open to argument; but whilst we recognise the principle, yet we have never felt inclined to extend them to cases to which they do not legitimately belong. Thus in <em>Friedly </em>v. <em>Sheetz, </em>(9 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 156,) it was ruled, that a sheriff\u2019s sale cannot be objected to by the purchaser, on 'the ground of defect of title. <em>Lighty </em>v. <em>Shorb, </em>is in further restraint of the operation of this principle. Justice *Duncan, observes, that <em>\u201c </em>the case of <em>Steinhauer </em>v. <em>Witman, </em>is not Avell understood. It does not go to the whole length, as some have supposed, that a man who purchases a title, with all its defects and imperfections, and whose conveyance contains no covenant of warranty, is not bound to pay the bonds he has given for it.\u201d Mr. Justice Yeates, the great advocate for the departure from the general rule, both of law and equity, of <em>caveat emptor, </em>on the sale of lands, yet restrains its operation. He puts it On the principle, what was the true meaning of the contracting parties ? was it contemplated mutually, that the purchaser should hold the lands under a good title, or that he should run his chance of getting a title, and be exposed to all hazards ? What then -was the nature of this contract ? \u2014 for the' intention of the parties must govern its construction. John K. Smith, who, together with others, had purchased from Moser one hundred acres of coal land, (the contract for the sale being <em>in fieri,) </em>agrees to sell the contract so made, to the defendant, or in other words, for a consideration therein stipulated, agrees that the defendant shall take their place as the purchasers from Moser. From the very nature of the agreement, in the absence of any express stipulation to the contrary, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>would seem, that the vendor did not intend to warrant the title to the premises, but that the vendees took the risk, relying on their own judgment as to the soundness of the title, and for indemnity on the original vendor. That this was the understanding, is further shown from the agreement, and the conduct of the parties. It is expressly agreed, (and the security of the vendees is said to be the-object,) that the first payment shall not be made until the vendees are fully satisfied, as to the title to the land. This shows, that for this purpose they depended on their own judgment. When the title is fully established to their satisfaction, (for so I read the contract,) the vendees bind themselves to take the deed. By the agreement a reasonable time is allowed them to investigate the title for themselves. Until then, a defect of title would undoubtedly be a good defence: but after, having examined it for themselves, and accepted the title, they are foreclosed from taking any defence, on the ground of a failure of consideration, so far as the present plaintiff is concerned. This construction is necessary for the protection of the plaintiffs, as they would have no remedy on the warranty. The deed was made to Samuel Sillyman, with general' warranty: he, therefore, would alone have remedy on the covenant against Moser. If, therefore, Smith or Field had paid part of the purchase-money to Moser, they would be without remedy, unless a recovery can be had on this contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The remaining exceptions have not been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Cited by Counsel, 9 Watts, 308 ; 8 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 35: 3 Barr, 155, 361; 6 Id. 84; 9 Id. 112; 10 Id. 74; 1 Harris, 342; 4 Casey, 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Cited by the Court, 6 Barr, 324; 9 Id. 497.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b612-5\"> See 1 Wharton, 398.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
