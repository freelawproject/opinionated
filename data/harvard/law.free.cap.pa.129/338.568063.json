On June 20, 1888, the said corporation filed in the court below its appeal from this appraisement, specifying as the grounds thereof that the real estate in question, being situate outside the limits' of Pennsylvania, was not liable to a collateral inheritance tax in this state, and if such tax were imposed thereon by the act of May 6,1887, P. L. 79, the imposition thereof by said act was unconstitutional.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-4\">On January 26, 1889, a hearing was had when the following facts were shown by the evidence :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">William Bittinger, the decedent, was a resident of Adams county, Pennsylvania, and died therein March 8,1888, leaving a will duly admitted to probate on March 9, 1888, by which he devised to the corporation appellant a farm, with the mills, stone house and improvements thereon, situate in Frederick county, Maryland, to be applied to the endowment of a.professorship in said college.

The act of May 6, 1887, P. L. 79, specifically taxes all estates, real, personal and mixed, situated in another state and passing to collaterals by will, when the person dying seised thereof was domiciled in this commonwealth at the time of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>death. It is objected by the college that the title of this act, which is, \u201c An act to provide for the better collection of collateral inheritance taxes,\u201d is defective, in not giving notice of an intention to impose the tax upon estates not within the terms of previous acts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-5\">2. To this objection we reply that if it read simply, \u201c An act to provide for the collection of collateral inheritance taxes,\u201d the title would undoubtedly be sufficient to comprehend all collateral inheritances, and that the insertion of the word \u201c better \u201d cannot impair what would be sufficient without it. And it is submitted that, even if we read the act in connection with previous legislation, the title gives notice of an intent not only to provide more effectual machinery for collection, but also a better definition of the subject matter of the tax.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-6\">8. It is, however, incorrect to read this statute in connection with previous legislation, as defining the subjects of taxation. \u25a0The constitutionality of an act must be tested by what appears upon the face of it, independently of other legislation, and the same rule undoubtedly applies to the title. The title and subject matter of this act are properly connected, and the former fairly gives notice of the latter, the act embracing nothing not relating to or cognate with the subject matter stated in the title: Airy Street, 113 Pa. 281; Frederick v. Canal Co., 109 Pa. 50; Myers v. Commonwealth, 110 Pa. 217 ; Blood v. Mercelliott, 53 Pa. 391; Esling\u2019s App., 89 Pa. 210 ; Mauch Chunk v. McGee, 81 Pa. 433; Allegheny Co. Home\u2019s Case, 77 Pa. 77; Dorsey\u2019s App., 72 Pa. 192.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-7\">4. The tax in question is not a property tax, but a tax upon a civil right or privilege, to wit, the right to take property by inheritance or devise: Strode v. Commonwealth, 52 Pa. 181; Orcutt\u2019s App., 97 Pa. 179, 185; Scholey v. Rew, 23 Wall. 331; Eyre v. Jacob, 14 Gratt. 422 (73 Am. Dec. 367) ; Miller v. Commonwealth, 27 Gratt. 110; Commonwealth v. Herman, 16 W. N. 210. Hence the nature and situs of the property are immaterial, for the right, which is taxed, depends upon the laws of Pennsylvania. Her citizens, whether natural or artificial, are incompetent to enjoy the right to take in succession except under her laws, and this right may therefore be burdened by a tax.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-8\">5. The act of April 7,1826, P. L. 146, differed from that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>1887, in not including any express provision as to property lying outside the state. In Commonwealth v. Smith, 5 Pa. 142, the phrase \u201c being within this commonwealth,\u201d in the former, was held to qualify the word \u201c estate.\u201d The act of March 11, 1850, P. L. 170, subsequently construing these words as relating to persons, was held in Short\u2019s Est.,16 Pa. 68, to operate by way of addition, so that under the act of 1826, as thus construed, both person and estate must be within the commonwealth. Cases dealing with the question of situs, like Commonwealth v. Coleman, 52 Pa. 468; Orcutt\u2019s App., 97 Pa. 179; Hood\u2019s Est., 21 Pa. 106; Drayton\u2019s App., 61 Pa. 172, and Commonwealth\u2019s App., 11 W. N. 492, are governed by the act of 1826 and have no application here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-5\">6. It may be objected that the right of succession to realty in Maryland is a right depending upon the laws of that state. This is true, and it may be admitted that the Pennsylvania collegers incompetent to take under this devise except as permitted by the laws of that state, and that those laws might impose a tax upon the right of succession there enjoyed. But Pennsylvania has the power to enact, as a matter of policy, that her citizens. shall be incompetent to hold lands within a foreign sovereignty. Aliens may be debarred from taking land by devolution: Scholey v. Rew, 23 Wall. 331. And this college owes its power to hold lands to the express legislation of this state: Act of April 7, 1832, P. L. 365.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-6\">7. Nor does the act practically fail for want of jurisdiction over the property devised. Under \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5, 8 and 12, of the act of 1887, the college in this very proceeding is made subject to a personal decree, adjudging its liability and the amount payable, and its right of appeal is enjojmd upon condition of giving a bond, upon which there would be an undoubted remedy. Moreover, being a statutory obligation, the liability to the tax can be enforced in Maryland against the very land in question. Whenever, by either the common or statutory law of a state, a legal liability has been incurred, it may be enforced in any court which has jurisdiction of such subject matter and of the parties: Knight v. Railroad Co., 108 Pa. 350; Dennick v. Railroad Co., 103 U. S. 11.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-7\"><em>Mr. David Wills </em>(with him <em>Mr. John M.

Neither the first law passed on the subject of collateral inheritances, that of April 7, 1826, P. L. 146, nor any of its various supplements prior to - 1887, imposed any tax upon estates not within the commonwealth. In taxing real estate situated in another state, the act of 1887 makes that subject to tax which was not so under previous acts; whereas its title, in using the phrase \u201c better collection,\u201d simply implies that a better method was to be provided for collecting tax upon a subject-matter already taxable. Under such a title a tax could not constitutionally be imposed upon anything not taxable before. The title of an act is now deemed a part of it: Penna. B. Co. v. Biblet, 66 Pa. 164; Eby\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 811. An act is unconstitutional if the title do not clearly indicate its subject-matter: Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim., 177, et seq.; Dorsey\u2019s App., 72 Pa. 192; Beckert v. Allegheny, 86 Pa. 191; Craig v. First P. Church, 88 Pa. 42; Dewhurst v. Allegheny, 95 Pa. 437; Union Pass. Ry. Co.\u2019s App., 81* Pa. 91; Phoenixville Road, 109 Pa. 44; Sewickley Bor. v. Sholes, 118 Pa. 165.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-4\">2. Tax laws are to be construed most strongly against the government: Dwarris on Stat., 742, 749; and their meaning is not to be extended beyond the clear import of the words used: United States v. Watts, 1 Bond 580. The practial difficulties in the way of enforcing the imposition and collection of the tax against this real estate, are almost insurmountable and render the law inoperative. The provisions creating a lien upon the real estate charged, and providing for a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court to enforce payment out of such real estate, in the same manner as payment of legacies is enforced, can have no extraterritorial operation and are impossible of execution against this real estate. That would be an invasion of Maryland\u2019s sovereignty. These things show that the act throughout contemplates taxing only such property as can be reached and subjected to the tax by decree of court. Clearly, this could not include land outside the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-5\">3. The taxing power cannot be exercised against persons not amenable to or protected by the laws of the state: Pittsburgh etc. Ry. Co. v. Commonwealth, 66 Pa. 73. To be taxed, the person must have a domicile in the state, and the thing must have a situs therein: Hays v. Pac. Mail Steamship Co., 17 How. 596; Morgan v. Parham, 16 Wall. 471, cited'with approval in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Commonwealth, v. Standard Oil Co., 101 Pa. 119. Property out of the state cannot be taxed; Pennsylvania\u2019s tax laws can have no extra-territorial operation: State Tax on Foreign Bonds, 15 Wall. 300. The commonwealth\u2019s counsel however, laboriously argue that this tax is not upon the.property, but upon the right of succession to it; yet the portions of the act of 1887 already referred to show that it is a property tax; the first section makes it so in so many words, and our view is sustained by Commonwealth v. Smith, 5 Pa. 142, and Short\u2019s Est., 16 Pa. 63. Hence the real question is the situs of the real estate: Commonwealth\u2019s App., 11 W. N. 492. In Del Busto\u2019s Est., 23' W. N. Ill, is an exhaustive review of all the collateral inheritance acts and an opinion confirmatory of our position.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AT\">Mb. Chief Justice Paxson:</author>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">. The facts of this case, as we gather them from the paper books, are substantially as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">William Bittinger resided in Adams county, Pennsylvania, and died there March 3, 1888, testate. He left a widow, but no children. His will was made October 6,1886, and probated by the register of wills of Adams county, March 9, 1888. He died seised of a farm and mill property, situated in Frederick county, Maryland, which by his will, he devised to the corporation of \u201c The Trustees of Pennsylvania College of Gettysburg, in the county of Adams.\u201d The college accepted the devise. The commonwealth of Pennsylvania caused an appraisement to be made of this real estate for taxation, under the provisions of the act of assembly of May 6,1887, entitled, \u201c An act to provide for the better collection of collateral inheritance -taxes: \u201d P. L. 79. It was valued at $15,000, from which the appraiser deducted $5,000, as the value of the widow\u2019s dower. From this appraisement the college appealed to the Orphans\u2019 Court, which court sustained the appeal. The commonwealth then appealed to this court, and assigned as \u25a0 error the ruling of the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">It was contended by the appellee, upon the argument at bar, that the act of 1887 is unconstitutional in this, that the title of said act does not clearly indicate its subject matter. The title is as follows : \u201cAn act to provide for the better collection of collateral inheritance taxes.\u201d The title of an act of assembly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>is now deemed a part of the act. This has been the law since the amendments to the constitution of 1864: Penna. R. Co. v. Riblet, 66 Pa. 164; Eby\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 311. If the title of an act does not clearly indicate its subject matter it is unconstitutional: Dorsey\u2019s App., 72 Pa. 192; Craig v. First P. Church, 88 Pa. 42; Dewhurst v, Allegheny, 95 Pa. 437; Beckert v. Allegheny, 85 Pa. 191; Phoenixville Bor. Road, 109 Pa. 44; Sewickley Borough v. Sholes, 118 Pa. 165. The title of the act of 1887 refers solely to the collection of collateral inheritance taxes. This presupposes that an estate had previously been made subject to such tax, whereas it was contended that said act imposed a tax upon property not theretofore subject thereto. The act of 1826, P. L. 146, the first upon this subject, imposed a collateral inheritance tax upon \u201call estates, real, personal, and mixed, of every kind whatsoever, passing from any person .who may die seised or possessed of such estate, being within this commonwealth, either by will or under the intestate laws thereof, or any part of such estate or estates, or interest therein,\u201d etc. None of the supplements to the act of 1826, or subsequent legislation upon this subject, attempted to bring real estate situate-outside of the state within the operation of the collateral inheritance laws, until the passage of the act of 1887, the first section of which enacts, \u201c that all estates, real, personal and mixed, of every kind whatsoever, situated within this state, whether the person or persons dying seised thereof be domiciled within or out of this state, and all such estates situated in another state, territory, or country, when the person or persons dying seised thereof shall have their domicile within this commonwealth, passing from any person who may die seised or possessed of such estates, either by will, or under the intestate laws of this state, or any part of such estate or estates, or interest therein, transferred by deed, grant, bargain, or sale, made or intended to take effect,\u201d etc., shall be subject to a tax, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The collateral inheritance tax imposed by the act of 1887, upon real estate, is a tax upon the property itself. This clearly' appears from the second proviso in the third section of the act, which is as follows: \u201c And provided further, That the tax on real estate shall remain a lien on the real estate on which the same is chargeable until paid.\u201d It has not been made to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>pear how the state of Pennsylvania can impose a tax upon real estate situate in Maryland; and not only impose a tax upon it, but also charge it with a lien for such unpaid tax. While it is conceded that the powers of the state for taxing purposes are very great, they are necessarily limited to either property or persons within her borders. All property of the citizen within the state may be taxed, and all such property outside the state as is drawn to or follows in law the person or domicile of the owner, such as bonds and mortgages, moneys at interest, etc., no matter where situate. But real estate is not drawn to the person or domicile of the owner, for taxation or any other purpose, and hence cannot be taxed outside of the jurisdiction where it is situate. The taxation of property involves the reciprocal duty of protection on the part of the state levying such tax. This real estate, as before said, is situate in the state of Maryland, and is subject to taxation by the laws of that state. If it had been devised to a citizen of Maryland, it could not have been seriously contended that the act of 1887 could have been enforced against him. Does it make any difference that the devisee is a Pennsylvania corporation? We think not. It may be that the state might impose a succession tax upon every citizen of the state who succeeds to either real or personal estate, from whatever source received. This is not such tax, however: Commonwealth v. Smith, 5 Pa. 142. It is a direct tax upon the thing devised in the hands of the devisee, a tax which the state is powerless to enforce. The executor cannot, as in the case of the legacy, deduct it from the legacy. He has nothing to do with it, and the state itself cannot exercise extra-territorial taxing power as to real estate, and carry into another state, and enforce there, its remedies for the collection of taxes. Without further discussion, we are of opinion that this act of 1887, so far as it imposes a collateral inheritance tax upon real estate situate in Maryland, transcends the power of the state and cannot be enforced. The constitutional question raised by its title is, therefore, unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
