N. Sharp; that, since said laying out, the land had been entered upon and possession thereof taken for the purpose of constructing said way, the same having been laid out two rods in width; that the selectmen of the town awarded the petitioners the sum of thirty dollars only for their damages occasioned by the laying out of said way, \u201c which sum is wholly inadequate as payment for their damages in that behalf sustained; \u201d and prayed that a jury might be summoned to determine the matter of the complaint, and award to the petitioners such damages as they were entitled to receive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-7\">At the trial, before a sheriff\u2019s jury, before any evidence was offered, the respondent filed the following objections to the proceedings : \u201c And now the respondent comes and objects to any hearing on the question of damages. Because it is not alleged that the petitioners, or either of them, are aggrieved by the assessment of damages by the selectmen of said town of Heath in the matter of laying out said way; and because no sufficient description of the cause of the damage claimed is given, or the manner in which the petitioners have been injured by the laying out of said way, and because it is not alleged that the laying out of said way has injured the property of the petitioners.\u201d The sheriff overruled the objections.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-8\">The petitioners offered evidence to show the cost of making fences on each side of said way. The respondent objected, because the cost of making and maintaining fences was no part of the land damages, and because no allegation of damages on account of fencing the road was alleged in the petition. The sheriff overruled the objections.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>The jury returned a verdict for a larger sum than that awarded by the selectmen.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A10a\">1. The application was sufficient in form. In <em>Perry </em>v. Sherborn, 11 Cush. 388, relied on by the respondent, an application for a jury to determine the damages sustained by reason of the discontinuance of a town way was held insufficient, because it did not show that the applicants\u2019 land abutted on the way. But in the present case it was alleged that the way was laid out across the applicants\u2019 land, and that the land had been entered upon and possession thereof taken for the purpose of constructing the way, the same having been laid out two rods in width. It sufficiently appeared that they were injured in their property, and aggrieved by the assessment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">2. It was not necessary to set forth in detail all the elements . of the damages claimed; and it was proper to admit evidence of the cost of fencing, to aid the jury in determining the damages. <em>Commonwealth </em>v.
