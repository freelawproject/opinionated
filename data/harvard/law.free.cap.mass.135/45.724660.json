At the trial in the Superior Court, before Knowlton, J., without a jury, the following facts were proved:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-7\">On or about April 20, 1881, George T. Clark, the defendant in this action, was the plaintiff in a writ of replevin against one Holt for the goods in controversy. The evidence tended to show that Clark had no lawful right to interfere with said goods in the possession of Holt, and that the plaintiff had a title whereby he could properly control them. On that writ, the goods were duly replevied from Holt and delivered to Clark, and remained in the possession of Clark until taken from him on the plaintiff\u2019s writ. No demand for said goods was made by the plaintiff before service of his writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-8\">On this evidence, the defendant contended that the taking by him was not unlawful, and that the plaintiff should have made a demand for the goods before service of his writ; and asked the judge to rule that the action could not be maintained, for want of such demand. The judge refused so to rule, but ruled that no demand by the plaintiff was necessary; and found for the plaintiff. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-9\">G. <em>H. </em>Kingsbury, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-10\"><em>N.
