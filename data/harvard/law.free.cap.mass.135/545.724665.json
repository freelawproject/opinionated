It was admitted that the Mrs. Clark referred to was Ellen H. Clark, and that she owned a barn in Eoyalston at the time referred to. There was other evidence* for the government, corroborating the testimony of Stafford in particulars tending to connect the defendant with the crime, and material to the issue. There was also evidence of threats by the defendant against Mrs. Clark and her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-5\">The government relied on the above testimony of Stafford, thus corroborated, to support the indictment. The defendant denied the statements of Stafford, so far as they concerned any conversation by him relating to the burning of Mrs. Clark\u2019s barn, or payment of money therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-6\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that, upon the evidence, the jury would not be authorized to convict him upon either count of the indictment. The judge refused so to rule, and left the question to the jury, directing them not to return a verdict of guilty upon the third and fourth counts, unless they found that money was paid by the defendant to Stafford to induce him to fire the barn; but that if they found that money was paid by the defendant to induce Stafford to fire the barn, as contended by the government, to return a general verdict of guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-7\">The jury returned a general verdict of guilty; and the questions of law arising upon the motion to dismiss and upon the request of the defendant for a ruling that the evidence would not warrant a conviction, being in the opinion of the judge so important and doubtful as to require the decision of this court, were reported, with the defendant\u2019s consent, for its determination. If the ruling was correct, and the conviction upon either count could be sustained on the evidence, the verdict was to stand; otherwise, a new trial to be granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atv\">It is an indictable offence at common law for one to counsel and solicit another to commit a felony or other aggravated offence, although the solicitation is of no effect, and the crime counselled is not in fact committed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Willard, 22 Pick. 476. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>2 East, 5. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>6 East, 464. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Ransford, </em>13 Cox C. C. 9. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>7 Conn. 266. The first and second counts of the indictment in the case at bar allege with sufficient certainty that the defendant solicited one Thomas Stafford to burn the barn of one Ellen H. Clark, and set out an offence at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The evidence clearly tended to support these counts, and therefore the court properly refused to quash the indictment, and also properly refused the defendant\u2019s request for an instruction that, upon the evidence, the jury would not be authorized to convict him upon either count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">It is not necessary to consider whether the evidence at the trial proved the offences charged in the third and fourth counts of the indictment. The jury were instructed that they could not convict upon them, unless they found that the defendant paid the money to Stafford to induce him to fire the barn. This supported and proved the first and second counts, and therefore a general verdict of guilty was properly rendered, as the indictment alleges that the different counts are different descriptions of the same act. Upon such a verdict, a judgment is a conviction of but a single offence, and is deemed to be upon that count which is good, and to which the evidence is applicable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Railroad, </em>120 Mass. 372. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>133 Mass. 383. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>134 Mass. 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
