On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>March 31, 1882, the steamship Achilles came into Ipswich Bay, and within a marine league of the shore, bound for Hewburyport, which was her port of destination. The plaintiff boarded her first, and tendered his services to pilot her into Hewburyport; but the master of the steamship refused the plaintiff\u2019s services, on the ground that he had been ordered not to recognize the old pilots.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-4\">The Achilles jvas owned by the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, one of the defendants, but had been chartered for that voyage by the Philadelphia' and Reading Coal and Iron Company, to transport a cargo of coal from its depot in Philadelphia to its depot in Hewburyport, for sale at Hewburyport in the regular course of its business, which was the selling of coal at Philadelphia, Hewburyport, and other ports on the coast; and the steamship was not engaged in any other business whatever on that voyage. She was regularly and properly documented with bills of lading signed and delivered, and was a vessel of the United States, not sailing under a register, but under a coasting license, and had been continuously, for about seven years, employed in carrying coal for various persons from Philadelphia to Hew York, Boston, Hewburyport, and other ports along the coast of the United States, chiefly, however, in carrying coal of the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company from its depot in Philadelphia to various depots of that company, as in the present voyage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-5\">The master of the Achilles was licensed as a United States pilot by the local inspectors of steamboats for the district of Philadelphia; and there was no other pilot on board, either licensed by state or United States authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-6\">It was not admitted that the vessel was regularly employed in the coasting trade, unless the above facts showed that, as matter of law, she was a vessel so employed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-7\">It was admitted that the plaintiff informed the master of the Achilles that she would be held to pay the regular fees for pilot-age, whether his services were accepted or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-8\">It was not contended that the steamship was exempt from the payment of compulsory pilotage under the laws of this Commonwealth, unless she was regularly employed in the coasting trade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Upon these facts, the judge ruled that the plaintiff could not maintain this action; and directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendants.
