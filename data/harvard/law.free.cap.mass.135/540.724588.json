Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Brigham, </em>C. J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-7\">Albert Holt, the paymaster of the Boston and Albany Railroad Company, testified for the government, among other things, as follows: \u201c There are four buildings in Springfield bwned by said corporation other than the one which was broken into, the other buildings having in them rooms used as offices for business done in the buildings. One of the other office buildings is situated about four hundred feet, one about one thousand feet, and one about'fifteen hundred feet, from the one alleged to have been broken into. The one broken into was the paymaster\u2019s room in a building used for the general office of the company; the corporation had other general offices, but no other in Springfield.\u201d Upon this evidence, the defendant asked the judge to rule that the indictment did not contain a sufficient description of the building alleged to have been broken; but the judge refused so to rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-8\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-9\"><em>E. </em>H. <em>Lathrop, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-10\"><em>E.
