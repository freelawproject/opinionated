But there was also evidence tending to show that the breach of condition was known to the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>at the same time; and the plaintiff argues that he was at least entitled to ask the jury to find that the breach had been waived. However the law may be elsewhere, it is settled the other way in Massachusetts. A breach of condition, happening after a policy is issued, may be waived, no doubt; but when the breach exists at the moment when, if ever, the contract comes into existence, it must be waived at that moment, if ever, and at that very instant the writing purports to establish and insist upon the condition. We must follow the decisions that paroi evidence of such a waiver as is relied on in this case would contradict the written instrument upon which the suit is brought. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Union Ins.
