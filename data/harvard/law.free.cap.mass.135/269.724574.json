Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Mason, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-4\">Thomas Lowell, a police officer, was called as a witness for the government, and testified that the defendant, at the time alleged in the indictment, was a police officer, whose route included the building named in the indictment; that, in consequence of orders from his superior officer, the witness, on the night in question, by means of a key, entered said building and sat in a chair in a shop therein, in a position to watch, and for the purpose of watching; that said piece of bacon was then a part of the stock in trade in the shop, and was then hanging near a window opened at the top; that about one o\u2019clock in the morning the defendant came along, put his hand in the opened window, and took the piece of bacon therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-5\">On cross-examination, the witness testified that he did not see the defendant\u2019s face very well, and did not see it so as to identify him, but saw his form and uniform; that he let him go, and about fifteen minutes afterwards met the defendant on the street with the bacon in his hand; that he said, \u201c Where did you get that, Jim ? \u201d to which the defendant replied, \u201c I found it on the street; \u201d that the witness then suggested that he take it to the police station, to which the defendant readily assented, and, on arriving there, repeated the same statement to Lieutenant Johnson, the officer in charge; that thereupon the witness said, \u201c Now, Jim, you had better own up. I was in the place when you took it. We have got you down fine. This is not the first you have taken. We have got other things against you nearly as good as this;\u201d \u2014 that then the defendant \u201c weakened,\u201d- and asked the witness to drop it, and said he would resign, and the witness and the lieutenant could have the credit of catching him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\">Lieutenant Johnson, the officer in charge, testified that he was present when the defendant came into the station with Lowell; that after the defendant\u2019s talk with Lowell he appeared broken down, and he, Johnson, then asked the defendant if he took the bacon out of the store, and the defendant said, \u201c Yes, lieutenant, I did.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-7\">This witness also testified that he could not say that Lowell said, \u201cYou had better own up, Jim;\u201d but, on cross-examinatian, testified that Lowell might have so said; that he did hear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Lowell say, \u201cWe have got other things against you nearly as good as this.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-4\">So much of this testimony as related to the confession was admitted against the objection of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-5\">Aaron Kimball, another witness for the government, on cross-examination, was shown, and identified as his signature to the bottom thereof, the following paper: \u201c Boston, Sept. 24, 1882. In the matter of the prosecution of James J. Nott, I, the person from whom the bacon was taken that he is charged with taking, am content not to have the matter further prosecuted. The amount taken was small, and I sympathize with his family. A. Kimball.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-6\">The defendant then offered this paper, and sought to read it to the jury, for the purpose of examining the witness in relation thereto; but the judge excluded the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-7\">While the witness Lowell was on the stand, his attention, on cross-examination, was called to the fact that the original complaint in the Municipal Court was sworn to by one Honey, a police officer, who, Lowell testified, was not present at the time of the alleged larceny, nor at either of the interviews with the defendant in reference thereto; and thereupon the defendant asked Lowell this question, \u201c Why did you not yourself swear to the original complaint?\u201d Upon objection by the government, the question was excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-8\">The jury were instructed that the statements made by the defendant at the police station, in the nature of a confession, could not be considered by them, unless such statements were made voluntarily; that if they were induced by threats, or by any promise of favor, they were not in law voluntary; and that, upon the evidence, it was a question of fact for the jury whether these statements were so induced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-9\">The defendant contended that, upon the testimony, the of-fence, if any was committed, was simple larceny only. The judge instructed the jury that, upon the evidence, the offence, by whomsoever committed, was larceny in a building.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-10\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-11\"><em>M. Fischacher, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-12\">G. <em>Marston, </em>Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>C. Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah4E\">The words, \u201cYou had better tell the truth,\u201d have sometimes been held or said to render a subsequent confession inadmissible, because they would probably be understood to mean that it would be better to say something, and that \u201c the truth \u201d in the mind of the speaker implied a confession of guilt. <em>The Queen </em>v. Jarvis, L. R. 1 C. C. 96, 99. <em>Regina </em>v. Fennell, 14 Cox C. C. 607. <em>Regina </em>v. Doherty, 13 Cox C. C. 23. But similar words, when not implying that the speaker expected a confession, but only the truth, have been held or said not to render a subsequent confession inadmissible. <em>The Queen </em>v. Reeve, L. R. 1 C. C. 362; <em>S. C. </em>12 Cox C. C. 179. Pollock, C.B., in <em>Regina </em>v. Baldry, 5 Cox C. C. 523, 529. In the present case, the words used were, in the first place, \u201c You had better own up; \u201d and these were equivalent to saying \u201cYou had better confess.\u201d The words which follow imply that denial would be useless, because the defendant had been seen to do the act. Finally, there was an intimation that other criminal acts could be proved against him. These words were spoken before an arrest, to be sure, but by a police officer, in the police station, and in the presence of the officer in charge, who appears to have been the common superior of the speaker and, of the defendant. They were not simply an admonition to tell the truth, but they held out an inducement to make a confession of guilt. The confession, therefore, should have been excluded; and, on this ground only, the exceptions must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The offence was properly held to be larceny in a building. The presence of Lowell in the room, for the purpose of watching, under the circumstances stated, would not have the effect to change the character of the offence, any more than if he had been in some position of observation outside of the shop. The property stolen was in the protection of the building; it belonged in the shop; it was a part of the stock in trade, and was in its own place, and was not immediately or in any special sense under the care or eye of Lowell. In this respect, this case differs from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Lester, 129 Mass. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The other exceptions contain nothing calling for any particular comment, and are overruled. <em>Exceptions </em>sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
