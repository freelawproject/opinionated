The defendant asked the judge to rule that the evidence of the witness was \u201cto be received with great caution and distrust; \u201d and that the fact that the witness did not fortify his evidence by producing the persons to whom the sales were made, to testify, if he could have done so, detracted from the weight of his testimony, and was \u201cjust ground for suspicion of unfairness and of possible corruption.\u201d The judge declined so to rule; and ruled that the matters embraced in the requests were proper to be taken into consideration by the jury in weighing the testimony of the witness. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-6\">Indictment for keeping and maintaining a common nuisance, to wit, a certain tenement in Taunton used for the illegal sale and illegal keeping of intoxicating liquors, on May 1, 1883, and on divers other days and times between that day and September 6, 1883. Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Pitman, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-7\">One Conlin and two persons named Noyes testified to seeing sales of intoxicating liquor by the defendant to four different persons, on June 8 and June 27, 1883, and one sale to Conlin on the premises; but, on cross-examination, they could give no description of the persons to whom the sales were made. The witnesses also testified that they were employed by the law and order league, an association of persons formed for the suppression of illegal liquor traffic; that one Dudley was the secretary of the league, and employed the witnesses to obtain evidence of illegal sales of intoxicating liquors; that they were paid fourteen dollars each per week, and their travelling and hotel expenses, and, when they bought liquors and cigars in the course of obtaining such evidence, they charged the money thus used as a part of their expenses, and the same was paid for out of the money furnished them by said Dudley; and that they also had their witness fees in cases where they testified. The above was all the evidence of sales. One Peck, a police officer, testified that he had seen the defendant behind the bar on the premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>several times, but could not say that he saw him there either on June 8 or June 27; that he had never been in the building, but that it was a place of common resort; and that he had seen numbers of persons go to and from the place within the time covered by the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-4\">The defendant asked the judge to instruct the jury as follows: \u201c If the witnesses Conlin and the two Noyeses were engaged in the business of procuring evidence of violation of the liquor law for hire and reward, and it is fairly inferable that the permanence of their employment was dependent upon their success in securing convictions, they are interested witnesses, and their evidence is to be received with great caution and distrust.\u201d The judge gave the instruction requested except the words, \u201c their evidence is to be received with great caution and distrust,\u201d and substituted therefor the following words: \u201c The jury are to take that fact into consideration in weighing their testimony.\u201d The defendant also asked the judge to instruct the jury, \u201cIf, by fair and reasonable diligence, the witnesses could have fortified their testimony by producing the persons whom they saw illegally buying intoxicating liquors, to testify, and they designedly omitted or failed so to do, it detracts from the weight of their testimony, and is just ground for suspicion of unfairness and of possible corruption.\u201d The judge gave the instruction requested except the words, \u201cit detracts from the weight of their testimony, and is just ground for suspicion of unfairness and of possible corruption,\u201d and substituted therefor the following words : \u201cThat is a proper matter for consideration in weighing their testimony.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-6\"><em>J.

Galligan </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEU\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Downing, </em>4 Gray, 29, a witness testified that he bought liquor of the defendant for the express purpose of prosecuting him for the sale. The defendant asked the judge to rule that such a person \u201c was not a credible witness, and the jury ought not to found a conviction upon such testimony.\u201d This was refused, and the judge commented upon the evidence. Upon overruling the exceptions, Mr. Justice Thomas said: \u201c The comments of the presiding judge upon the weight to be given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>bis testimony are not matter of legal exception. But we do not wish to be understood as expressing any concurrence with the remarks of the presiding judge. We think he might well have instructed the jury that such testimony was to be received with the greatest caution and distrust.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>2 Allen, 301, the defendant having requested an instruction that it was the duty of the jury to disregard such testimony altogether, Mr. Justice Lord instructed the jury \u201c that these considerations went to the credit of the witness, and, if the facts were true, they should look with great caution and distrust upon his evidence.\u201d On overruling the exceptions, Chief Justice Bigelow said, \u201c The instructions were clearly right, and substantially in conformity with those suggested by this court, as being appropriate to testimony coming from a person standing in the position in which it appeared that the witness in behalf of the government was placed at the trial of this cause,\u201d and cited <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Downing.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-4\">Under such circumstances, the facts having been called to the attention of the court, simply to instruct the jury \u201c to take that fact into consideration,\u201d or that it was a \u201c proper matter for consideration in weighing them testimony,\u201d was not in accordance with the reason or spirit of the rule which courts have adopted in such cases. The defendant was entitled to some instructions on the point. The statement that a fact might be weighed in considering the testimony is applicable to every fact in the case. It was equivalent to no instructions at all.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-5\"><em>E. J.
