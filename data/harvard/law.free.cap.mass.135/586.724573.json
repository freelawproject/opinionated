To the admission of this deposition the plaintiff objected. It was conceded that the deposition was taken in term time, and while the court was in session, and without any application to the court for leave to take it, as required by the ninth rule of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The deposition was taken at Ludlow, the place of residence of the defendant; and no objection was made to its admissibility other than on the ground stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-8\">The judge ruled that the deposition was not admissible, as not having been taken in compliance with said rule of the court, and rejected it as evidence; and found for the plaintiff.

Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>131, \u00a7\u00a7 17 &amp; <em>seq. </em>Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>169, \u00a7\u00a7 &amp; 23 <em>seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">It is also provided that the courts may make proper and convenient rules and regulations concerning the taking and using depositions, not inconsistent with the provisions of law. Gen. Sts. c. 131, \u00a7 31. Pub. Sts. c. 169, \u00a7 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Rules of the Supreme Judicial Court, of the Court of Common Pleas, and of the Superior Court, have existed from an early period of our history, providing, in substance, that depositions of witnesses within the Commonwealth, but out of the town in which the court is, holden, cannot be taken in term time, unless by special order of the court. General Rules of the Supreme Judicial Court, of 1820, Rule 12; 16 Mass. 374. Rules of 1836, Rule 8; 24 Pick. 386. Rules of 1860, Rule 8; 14 Gray, 342. Rules of 1870, Rule 19; 104 Mass. 562. These rules have regulated the practice of this court for many years, and have never been regarded as unreasonable or invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The ninth rule of the Superior Court, by necessary implication, prohibits the taking of the deposition of a witness within the Commonwealth, and out of the town in which the court is holden, in term time, unless by special order of the court. This construction gives meaning to the rule, which upon any other construction would be without force, and is the one which has always been adopted in practice. It follows that, as the deposition offered by the defendant was taken in violation of the rule, it was properly rejected by the presiding justice of the Superior Court. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
