The tenant pleaded <em>nul disseisin </em>as to one parcel, and disclaimed as to two parcels; and the demandants discontinued as to the fourth parcel. Trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before <em>Staples, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The demandants, who were the heirs at law of Alpheus Sanford, and their legal representatives, claimed title to the demanded premises under the will and codicil of said Sanford. By the will, which was duly proved and allowed on April 23, 1873, the testator gave to his son, A. Jones Sanford, \u201c the improvement \u201d of the lands demanded, including one half of the homestead estate (the lower part) and one half of the bam; providing that \u201c it shall be understood that the improvement of all said property shall belong to my son during the term of his natural life.

Pauli, one undivided half of his homestead (the upper part), and one half of the barn and land used by him in connection with the homestead, \u201c for her personal use, and not to lease or let.\u201d The codicil provided as follows: \u201c The homestead being given to Jones and Amelia, I change the same only by giving the same undivided to them, but for their personal occupation as set forth in my will.\u201d A. Jones Sanford died in October, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-4\">On April 23, 1873, Jones conveyed by a quitclaim deed his estate in the homestead and other real estate so devised to him to Charles A. Phillips, who on the same day, as a conduit, conveyed it to Jones\u2019s wife, the tenant in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-5\">On July 6, 1876, the collector of taxes of Taunton sold the several parcels which had been so devised to Jones, for the nonpayment of taxes, said undivided half of the homestead estate being sold to Roger Pauli, the husband of Amelia A. Pauli. The collector\u2019s notice stated that he should offer for sale \u201c said parcels of real estate, or such undivided portions of them as may be necessary.\u201d On July 8, 1876, Roger Pauli conveyed the title so acquired, and the other purchasers at the tax sale made conveyances, so that this title was acquired by the demandants, except Mary C. Sanford. On March 5, 1878, four of the demandants, including Amelia A. Pauli with her husband Roger, conveyed to the tenant by quitclaim deed all the right, title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>and interest which was conveyed to Roger, by the deeds of the collector of taxes, in said lands, \u201c meaning hereby to convey no other rights which we have in said estates than were acquired by said collector\u2019s deeds; \u201d and containing the usual covenant against incumbrances and of warranty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-4\">The tenant contended that the will, taken in connection with the codicil, gave to A. Jones Sanford a fee in an undivided half of the homestead; but the judge ruled that it gave him only a life estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-5\">The tenant also contended, and asked the judge to rule, that the deed of March 5, 1878, conveyed all the interest of these four demandants in the premises, whether as heirs at law of Alpheus Sanford or otherwise. But the judge ruled that the deed conveyed only such title as was conveyed under the sale for taxes, and that the sale and deed were invalid, and the tenant acquired no title thereby as against the demandants. The tenant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-6\"><em>B.
