Sts. <em>c. </em>112, \u00a7 169, for obstructing and occupying with cars, for more than five minutes at one time, on December 2, 1882, a certain street in Worcester, called Crescent Street. At the trial in the Superior Court, Pitman, J., directed the jury to return a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions, which appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b570-7\"><em>R. </em>Hoar, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b570-8\"><em>E.

Sts. <em>c. </em>112, \u00a7 169, which prohibits a railroad corporation from negligently obstructing or unnecessarily occupying \u201c a highway, town way, or street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">The determination of this question may be aided by ascertaining the sense in which the Legislature has used the word in other statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">As early as 1667, a committee was appointed by the General Court, \u201c to bring in an effectual order for keeping in good repair all streets and highways, for the safety and comfort of travellers and passengers.\u201d 4 Mass. Col. Rec. pt. ii. 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">In the Prov. St. of 1692-3 (5 W. &amp; M.) c. 13, \u00a7 2; 1 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 42; the justices of the peace and selectmen of Boston are authorized \u201c to state and lay out such streets, ways and passages as may be most for the conveniency and accommodation of the place.\u201d The Prov. St. of 1698 (11 W. III.) <em>c. </em>2; 1 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 311; is a statute to prevent encroachments \u201c upon the common roads, highways, and streets heretofore laid out in several towns within this Province.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">The Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>14, \u00a7 123, provide that certain troops shall have the right of way in any \u201c street or highway through which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>they may pass.\u201d Chapter 27, \u00a7 15, provides that towns may make bylaws requiring certain duties of owners of buildings near the lines of \u201c streets and public ways.\u201d Chapter 50, \u00a7 3, provides that damages for laying out sewers shall be ascertained in a city as in the laying out of \u201c highways or streets \u201d therein, and in towns as in laying out town ways; section 12 imposes a penalty upon whoever digs up the ground in \u201c a highway, street, or lane,\u201d in a town, for laying a common sewer, without the consent of the selectmen; section 20 authorizes the mayor and aldermen, or selectmen, to establish and grade sidewalks \u201c in such streets \u201d as in their judgment the public convenience may require. Chapter 51, \u00a7 1, provides for the assessment of betterments after \u201c a street, highway, or other way \u201d is laid out in a city or town. Chapter 52, \u00a7 1, requires that \u201c highways, town ways, streets, causeways, and bridges \u201d shall be kept in repair by the town, city, or place in which they are situated. Chapter 53, \u00a7\u00a7 10-13, authorizes a city or town to make by-laws regulating the use of the \u201cstreets or ways,\u201d the \u201cpublic streets, ways, causeways, and bridges,\u201d the \u201c public streets or highways,\u201d and the \u201c streets or ways for public travel \u201d therein. Chapter 54, \u00a7 1, provides when buildings or fences fronting upon a training-field, burying-place, common landing-place, \u201chighway, private way, street, lane, or alley\u201d shall be deemed the true boundaries, and when they may be presented by a grand jury as a nuisance. Section 10 prohibits the cutting down of a shade tree in a \u201c highway, town way, or street \u201d without notice. Chapter 106, \u00a775, authorizes gas-light companies under certain conditions to dig up the ground in any of the \u201c streets, lanes, and highways \u201d of a city or town. Chapter 113, \u00a7 31, authorizes cities and towns to take up \u201c streets or highways \u201d traversed by street railways.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\">We have cited a sufficient number of instances to show that the word \u201c street \u201d is commonly used in the statutes to designate a public way, \u2014 either a highway or town way, or a way which has become public by dedication or prescription. The statute in question is a penal statute, and is to be construed strictly. We see no reason to suppose that the Legislature meant to use the word \u201c street \u201d in this statute in any different sense from that in which it has obviously used it in the instances we have cited. It can hardly be supposed that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>intended to include mere private ways, in which the public has no rights except by permission of the owner, and which he may close up at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">We see nothing in the exceptions which necessarily leads to the conclusion that Crescent Street is more than a private way. At most, it could not be held, as matter of law, under the facts, to be a public way. Under our construction of the statute, unless it was a public way, the defendant was not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">\n<em>JUxeeptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
