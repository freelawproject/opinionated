In that Original Petition, Appellees alleged that part of SSOE's design included auxiliary drains intended to provide necessary drainage; the drains were allegedly two inches higher than the applicable government standards. Chapter 150 specifically requires that a claim for damages, arising out of the provision of professional services by a licensed or registered professional, be supported by a certificate of merit filed contemporaneously with the original petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

In that response, Appellees asserted the petition was filed within ten days of the expiration of the statute of limitations. In that same response, Appellees, for the first time, asserted that the certificate of merit affidavit was not filed with their original petition because of \"a combination clerical oversight based on the looming statute of limitations.\" Appellees then argued that pursuant to subsection 150.002(c), the matter was within the trial court's discretion to allow for the filing of an amended petition with the certificate of merit affidavit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12409329\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/536/487/#p494\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 150.002(c).

Because Appellees failed to establish their entitlement to a thirty-day extension to supplement the pleadings with the necessary affidavit, the trial court abused its discretion in denying Appellant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We conclude subsection 150.002(c) is triggered when: (1) the original petition is filed within ten days of the expiration of the statute of limitations\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (2) the plaintiff\n   <em>\n    alleges in the original petition\n   </em>\n   that\n   because of time constraints associated with the statute of limitations, the certificate of merit affidavit was not contemporaneously filed with the original petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE. ANN. \u00a7 150.002(c). We reverse the trial court's order and remand this cause to the trial court to determine whether the dismissal should be with or without prejudice to refiling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12409329\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/536/487/#p494\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 150.002(e) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pedernal Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12409329\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/536/487/#p494\">\n    536 S.W.3d at 494-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
