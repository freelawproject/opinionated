Their petition alleged that on June 7, 2015, Worsdale's motorcycle was traveling westbound on Reese Creek Road in Killeen when it collided with a \"large dirt mound obstructing the full width\" of the roadway; the mound was \"not marked or indicated by any traffic-control device, barricades, or other safety features.\" Both Worsdale and King were seriously injured in the accident and later died from their injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Killeen Police Department (KPD) arrived on the scene shortly after the accident and began an investigation. KPD Officer Bradley Blenden's incident report outlined observations he made at the scene the night of the accident as well as observations and conversations he had with employees from other City departments, including\n   a Deputy City Attorney, in the days following the accident. As noted in his report, some of those conversations concerned who owned the road and was responsible for its maintenance. However, the report did not make any conclusions about fault for the accident. Officer Blenden supplemented his report on June 26, 2016, noting that the case \"will be closed\" due to the death of Worsdale, \"the suspect in the case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellees' petition alleged that the dirt mound constituted a special defect on the City's property-a dangerous condition about which the City knew or should have known-and that the City had a duty to make the premises safe by eliminating the risk of harm or warning of the dangerous condition, which it failed to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 101.022(b) (noting that governmental unit has duty to warn of special defects such as excavations or obstructions on roads);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 101.025 (waiving governmental immunity for claims under TTCA). The City's plea to the jurisdiction asserted that (1) appellees did not provide the City with the required, written statutory notice of their claims within six months of the accident and (2) the City did not have \"actual notice\" of appellees' claims within that same period.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 101.101(a), (c). Appellees attached evidence to their response to the City's plea to the jurisdiction-including excerpts from the deposition testimony of Officer Blenden and his incident report-and, after a hearing, the trial court denied the plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A governmental unit, such as a city, is immune from suit and liability unless the legislature has waived immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dallas Cty.

Accordingly, we hold that appellees failed to demonstrate that the City had \"actual notice\" of their claims sufficient to waive the City's immunity under the TTCA.
