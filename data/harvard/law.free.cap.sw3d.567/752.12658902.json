(\"Regent Care\") appeals a judgment in favor of Robert Detrick and his wife, Carolyn. Detrick alleged, and the jury found, that Regent Care's nurses were negligent in failing to promptly notify Detrick's treating physicians of a significant change in his condition, resulting in delay in diagnosing and treating a spinal tumor that ultimately caused Detrick to suffer permanent paralysis and incontinence.\n </docketnumber>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Regent Care raises several issues on appeal, including challenges to (1) the admission of expert testimony; (2) the sufficiency of the evidence of causation; (3) the sufficiency of the evidence of certain components of damages; (4) the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's allocation of responsibility; (5) the trial court's application of a settlement credit in relation to its application of a statutory cap on noneconomic damages; and (6) the trial court's order that a portion of Detrick's future medical expenses be paid in periodic payments. We reverse the judgment insofar as it awards damages for loss of household services and otherwise affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Robert Detrick, a man in his late 70's, was scheduled to undergo a right hip replacement on December 2, 2013. Instead, he was admitted to Regent Care, a skilled nursing facility, on November 26, 2013, to receive care for a groin rash that was preventing his hip surgery. He left Regent Care on December 9, 2013, suffering from permanent paraplegia and incontinence. The undisputed cause of these conditions was a tumor on his thoracic spine that caused a compression fracture resulting in his neurological injury. It is also undisputed that, if the tumor and compression fracture had been diagnosed, even as late as December 6, 2013, Detrick would not have suffered these permanent injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case presents a tragic series of missed opportunities to discover and treat the tumor on, and compression fracture of, Detrick's thoracic spine. For example, Detrick was scheduled to have an MRI of his thoracic spine on November 23, 2013, but that test was canceled because Detrick did not have transportation to the facility. The night before he was to have had that MRI, Detrick fell and was admitted to Methodist Hospital, but he did not inform anyone at the hospital that he had been scheduled for an MRI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Detrick was seen by Dr. Rohan Coutinho on November 27, 2013, the day after he was admitted to Regent Care. Dr. Coutinho failed to perform a neurological exam. Also on that day, a Regent Care nurse noted by a checkmark on Detrick's chart that he was incontinent of bladder. Checkmarks on his chart for the following day indicate that Detrick was at that time incontinent of bladder and bowel. The fact that this incontinence was a change in Detrick's condition\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was not brought to\n   the attention of his treating physicians, Dr. Coutinho and Dr. Nora Cubillos. Neither Dr. Coutinho nor Dr. Cubillos correctly diagnosed Detrick's condition. Both testified that knowing of Detrick's new onset incontinence would have caused them to immediately send Detrick back to the hospital for an MRI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 1, 2013, an x-ray technician for MobilexUSA took two x-rays of Detrick's thoracic spine. One view was medically insufficient but the technician forwarded it to Dr. Elliott Wagner without retaking it. Dr. Wagner then misread Detrick's x-rays and erroneously reported that there was no fracture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Detrick sued Regent Care, Dr. Coutinho, Dr. Cubillos, Dr. Wagner, and MobilexUSA. The doctors and MobilexUSA settled before trial for a total sum of $1,850,000. The jury was asked to determine negligence as to each of the settling defendants, as well as Regent Care. Having found each defendant to have negligently caused Detrick's injury, the jury apportioned 55% of the responsibility for that injury to Regent Care. It determined Detrick's damages to be a total of $11,940,000, including $390,000 for past medical expenses and $3,000,000 for future medical expenses. The jury also awarded damages to Carolyn Detrick in the sum of $1,945,000, including $245,000 for loss of household services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court entered judgment on the verdict, after first applying a dollar-for-dollar settlement credit and then applying a statutory cap of $250,000 on non-economic damages. The court initially declined to order that any portion of future medical expenses be paid in installments. It later signed a modified judgment ordering that $256,358 of the award for Detrick's future medical expenses be paid in periodic payments.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Whether Detrick was incontinent at the time he was admitted to Regent Care was hotly disputed at trial but is not an issue on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    <strong>\n     Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Sufficiency of the evidence-causation\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    We first address Regent Care's second issue, which challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding that Regent Care's negligence was a proximate cause of Detrick's injury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    To determine the legal sufficiency of the evidence, a court must \"independently consider whether the evidence at trial would enable reasonable and fair-minded jurors to reach the verdict.\"\n    <em>\n     Gharda USA, Inc. v.

In support of this argument, it first contends that the doctors admitted at trial that Detrick's chart reflected new onset incontinence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    This contention does not accurately reflect the doctors' testimony. Rather, the doctors acknowledged that Detrick's chart, read in light of information they learned in the course of litigation, shows that the incontinence he experienced while at Regent Care was new onset. Both clearly testified that, at the time they were treating Detrick, they were not aware that he had new onset incontinence,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , that there was a significant\n    <em>\n     change\n    </em>\n    in his condition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Regent Care next relies on expert testimony opining that Dr. Coutinho and Dr. Cubillos would not have correctly diagnosed Detrick's condition even if they had been aware of his new onset incontinence.

Rather, they testified in definite terms about what they would have done and why. For example, Dr. Cubillos testified that the fact of new onset incontinence, coupled with symptoms such as numbness in the legs and back pain, \"could very well point to there being a more serious issue going on, such as like spinal cord compression.\" If she had known of Detrick's new onset incontinence on December 4, it would have been a red flag that \"definitely\" would have figured into her differential diagnosis, and she \"very likely\" would have sent him to the hospital for an immediate MRI to see if there was any spinal cord compression. Dr. Cubillos also explained why, in the absence of this information, she did not suspect spinal cord compression.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Dr. Coutinho testified that, if he had known about Detrick's new onset incontinence, there is no doubt in his mind that he would have sent Detrick back to the hospital on November 28 or 29 for an MRI. Like Dr. Cubillos, he explained why he thought this additional evidence was a red flag for possible spinal cord injury and\n    why, without it, he did not investigate the possibility of such an injury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    In addition to the more pointed terms noted above (\"definitely,\" \"very likely,\" \"no doubt\"), Dr. Cubillos and Dr. Coutinho at some points in their testimony used the term \"probably.\" Regent Care, relying on\n    <em>\n     Columbia Medical Center v.

Regent Care contends that this testimony should have been excluded as unreliable because it was based on summaries prepared by Detrick's trial counsel. The record, however, reveals that Dr. Grodzin's opinions were based on far more than these attorney-compiled summaries.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Dr. Grodzin testified that he reviewed Detrick's medical records predating his December 2013 neurological injury and familiarized himself with Detrick's preexisting conditions. He reviewed Methodist Hospital's records from November 2013, immediately prior to Detrick's placement at Regent Care, as well as the hospital's records from the later surgery to remove Detrick's tumor. In addition, Dr. Grodzin reviewed records from Detrick's current primary care physician, ambulance services, and various care facilities where Detrick has resided since his injury. Dr. Grodzin also personally spoke to Detrick's daughter and current primary care physician, and reviewed the deposition testimony of Detrick's daughter and wife.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The attorney-compiled summaries about which Regent Care complains were created in accordance with specific instructions from Dr. Grodzin following his review of extensive Humana \"SmartSummary\" Monthly Reports detailing Detrick's medical expenses for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Dr. Grodzin testified that these underlying billing records are a reliable source for determining medical costs and are the types of records that would be relied on to determine reasonable and necessary costs associated with a particular injury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Dr. Grodzin also testified that he reviewed the Humana SmartSummaries to determine who Detrick's providers were and what services were provided. He then asked Detrick's attorneys to prepare a month-by-month summary including the types of medical care, date, provider, facility, and services. He further requested that the summaries be segregated between related and unrelated expenses. He testified that he gave specific direction concerning this latter task:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    I was very specific. I listed the specific types of problems, services, physicians, imaging, lab work, etc., in a very specific fashion. And I also said that if it wasn't clear that something - despite the fact that I may have listed it as related, if it was - for whatever reason, couldn't clearly be shown and it was thought to be unrelated, that it be excluded so that we didn't, you know, include things that were unnecessary or questionably related.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Dr. Grodzin further testified that he looked at the summaries provided by counsel and was \"very satisfied\" that his instructions had been followed. He did not think it was necessary to compare the summaries with the underlying billing records to ensure that his instructions had been implemented correctly because those instructions were \"very clear.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Dr. Grodzin's methodology included personal review of extensive medical records, personal interviews and review of relevant deposition testimony, application of his professional experience and training, detailed instruction to Detrick's attorneys concerning how to segregate related and\n    unrelated medical expenses, and personal review of the resulting summaries to satisfy himself that his instructions had been followed. Regent Care argues, in essence, that this methodology is deficient because it does not include the additional step of comparing each summary with the underlying billing records. We disagree. Dr. Grodzin's failure to take the additional step advocated by Regent Care goes only to the weight of his opinions, not their admissibility.\n    <em>\n     Christus Health v.

Regent Care specifically complains of charges for treatment for pneumonia, chest x-rays, back pain, and a renal function panel. But the record reflects that Dr. Grodzin did explain why he considered these charges to be related to Detrick's neurological injury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    For example, Detrick suffered repeated urinary tract infections because he had a catheter, which was required because of permanent incontinence resulting from his neurological injury. Detrick would present with a fever, which would require a chest x-ray to determine whether other causes of fever exist, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Dr. Grodzin opined that these x-rays would not be necessary but for Detrick's catheter-related urinary tract infections because Detrick would probably not be in the same clinical circumstances and the \"infectious issue\" would not come to light. The doctor went on to explain that a urinary tract infection may enter the bloodstream and spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs, causing pneumonia. Further, if a patient suffers multiple infections, the bacteria generally become resistant to antibiotics, making the patient susceptible to infection at other sites in the body. This testimony provides a basis for including charges for pneumonia and chest x-rays in assessing Detrick's past medical expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Dr. Grodzin also testified that some of Detrick's preexisting conditions were aggravated by his neurological injury, particularly his back pain. While he did not specifically identify his basis for this conclusion, this testimony immediately followed his description of his qualifications, experience, review of Detrick's medical records, and conversations with Detrick's daughter and primary care physician. Failure to expressly tie the doctor's opinion concerning back pain to his training, experience, and factual review of Detrick's condition goes to the weight to be given his testimony. It does not render that testimony conclusory or speculative.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Justiss\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093098\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/397/150/#p156\">\n     397 S.W.3d at 156\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (defining conclusory and speculative testimony).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Regent Care also asserts that Dr. Grodzin included a $11.82 charge for a renal function panel without explaining why he believed it to be related to Detrick's neurological injury, given Detrick's history of kidney disease. The record shows, however, that counsel for Regent Care asked Dr. Grodzin whether the charge was included or excluded, and whether the doctor had reviewed the specific physician progress note for that charge. The doctor responded that the charge was included and that he was sure he had seen the progress note because he had been through Detrick's medical records. He simply could not specifically recall that progress note. He was never asked\n    <em>\n     why\n    </em>\n    the charge was included or\n    <em>\n     why\n    </em>\n    he believed it to be related to Detrick's neurological injury. Without such an inquiry, Dr. Grodzin's prior testimony that he reviewed Detrick's medical records and gave specific instructions concerning the types of services and providers to be included as related charges provides sufficient basis for his inclusion of the disputed renal function panel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Regent Care also challenges as conclusory Dr. Grodzin's opinion that Detrick would not have needed nursing care but for the neurological injury. It is uncontested that, as a result of Detrick's neurological injury, he is paraplegic and has permanently lost bladder and bowel function. There can be no serious dispute that these conditions require him to have nursing home care. On the other hand, there is no evidence that any of Detrick's preexisting conditions required him to have nursing home care. Rather, the evidence is that Detrick was mobile, continent, and living independently prior to the neurological injury, and that he planned to undergo a hip replacement and then return to his home. That Detrick required nursing home care because of his neurological injury is amply supported in the record. Any assumption that he would have required such care at some point in the future because of preexisting conditions would be speculative.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The only preexisting condition Regent Care identifies as potentially requiring nursing home care is the groin rash that caused postponement of his hip replacement surgery. Regent Care argues that there is evidence that Detrick's rash persisted and, therefore, he would have needed nursing home care even without the neurological injury because the rash would have precluded hip surgery. It asserts that Dr. Grodzin was therefore required to exclude the costs of nursing home care for the period during which the rash may have persisted. The record does not establish, however, whether Detrick's rash persisted for any significant period of time. It shows only that he suffered from\n    <em>\n     a\n    </em>\n    rash in June 2014, not necessarily the same rash. Regent Care's inquiry concerning Detrick's 2014 rash does not negate Dr. Grodzin's testimony that Detrick's need for full-time care at a nursing home facility is a result of his neurological injury and is not related to his preexisting conditions. It also does not render that testimony conclusory or speculative.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Finally, Regent Care challenges Dr. Grodzin's opinion concerning ambulance charges because he did not review the actual ambulance\n    <em>\n     invoices\n    </em>\n    from United Ambulance. The doctor testified, though, that he did review United Ambulance's\n    <em>\n     records\n    </em>\n    and related entries in Detrick's billing records. He testified that, from these sources, he was able to ascertain the reasonable and necessary cost of ambulance services related to Detrick's neurological injury. The failure to additionally review ambulance\n    <em>\n     invoices\n    </em>\n    goes to the weight of his testimony and does not render that testimony conclusory or speculative.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Justiss\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093098\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/397/150/#p156\">\n     397 S.W.3d at 156\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (defining conclusory and speculative testimony).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Regent Care did not demonstrate that Dr. Grodzin's testimony was conclusory or speculative.

But the record reveals otherwise. Dr. Grodzin testified that Detrick's life expectancy is six to eight years. He based this opinion on his review of Detrick's medical records, Detrick's family history, discussions with Detrick's daughter and current treating physician, and his own extensive experience with geriatric patients. Another expert, Dr. Scott Shapiro, testified that Detrick's life expectancy is three to four years, or \"at least four to five more years.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The testimony of Dr. Grodzin and Dr. Shapiro constitutes some evidence of Detrick's life expectancy.

Dr. Grodzin opined that Detrick would incur $250,000 per year for future medical expenses (in addition to stating a range of $150,000 to $300,000, or even as high as $500,000, per year), and an additional $75,000 to $100,000 per year for a private nurse. Regent Care contends that these opinions lack any explanation or basis. However, Dr. Grodzin testified that he based his opinion on his review of Detrick's medical history and his expectation that Detrick will require such care in the future. Indeed, it is undisputed that Detrick's paralysis and incontinence are catastrophic and permanent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The jury's award of $3,000,000 for future medical expenses is within the range of figures provided by Dr. Grodzin. In any event, Dr. Grodzin's expert testimony is not critical to affirming the jury's award.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Aguirre\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205922777\">\n     2016 WL 5922777\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6.

The record reflects that the cost of Carolyn's independent/assisted living arrangement, rather than the value of any household services as defined in the charge, provided the basis for the jury's award for loss of household services.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Dr. Grodzin testified that, due to her amnesia, it was unsafe for Carolyn to live at home without the domestic support and household services of her husband. He did not, however, identify what any of those services were. Rather, it appears he considered the mere fact that Detrick was no longer in the home. Similarly, he opined that Carolyn's need to be in an assisted living facility was directly related to Detrick's inability to \"provide that support of service at home as he was previously.\" But he again failed to identify any service Detrick previously provided. In fact, Dr. Grodzin was not aware of the definition of\n    \"loss of household services\" provided to the jury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Instead of being guided by the charge definition of \"household services,\" Dr. Grodzin valued the loss of those services using the cost of Carolyn's current living arrangements. He began his analysis with $63,281, the charges incurred by Carolyn in the past to live at Independence Hill. He then deducted from that amount $1000 per month to account for savings related to Carolyn not living at home. He did not, however, know the basis for that $1000 figure.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Dr. Grodzin concluded that $44,281 ($63,281 minus $19,000) is a reasonable and fair amount for loss of household services in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Again relying on the cost of living at Independence Hill, Dr. Grodzin opined that Carolyn will incur approximately $24,000 per year in the future. He did not testify concerning Carolyn's life expectancy and the jury was not provided with any other evidence to determine for how many years Carolyn is likely to incur these costs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    In his closing statement, Detrick's attorney urged the jury to award $44,000 in past loss of household services because that is the amount Carolyn has paid to live at Independence Hill (less the $1000 per month reduction noted above). Counsel urged an award of $150,000 for future loss of household services so that Carolyn can live in such a facility for the rest of her life. The jury awarded $45,000 for loss of household services in the past and $200,000 for loss of those services in the future, and judgment was entered for those amounts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    A jury is entitled to apply its own collective knowledge and experience to estimate the value of household services.\n    <em>\n     Excel Corp. v.

There is simply no evidence to support awards of $45,000 in the past and $200,000 in the future for loss of those household services.

Regent Care does not challenge the trial court's calculation of prejudgment interest, so the concerns raised in\n    <em>\n     Battaglia\n    </em>\n    are not present here. The trial court's failure to apply the settlement credit to past damages before applying any portion to future damages is of no consequence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Periodic payment of future medical expenses\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    In its seventh and final issue on appeal, Regent Care challenges the trial\n    court's order that only a portion of Detrick's future medical expenses be paid in periodic payments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Section 74.503 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code directs that, at the request of a defendant health care provider, defendant physician, or claimant, \"the court\n    <em>\n     shall\n    </em>\n    order that medical, health care, or custodial services awarded in a health care liability claim be paid\n    <em>\n     in whole or in part\n    </em>\n    in periodic payments rather than by a lump-sum payment.\" TEX.

It does not, however, offer any alternative sum that it believes would have been more appropriate. Instead, it argues that the trial court was required to order the entire amount of Detrick's future medical expenses to be paid periodically. This argument is contrary to the plain language of the statute. Regent Care has failed to demonstrate an abuse of discretion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Houston\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%209304373\">\n     2015 WL 9304373\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *9.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    We reverse that portion of the trial court's Final Modified Judgment awarding damages to Carolyn Detrick for loss of household services and affirm the remainder of that judgment. This cause is remanded with instructions to the trial court to recalculate the damages to be recovered by Robert and Carolyn Detrick from Regent Care Center of San Antonio, L.P. by (1) removing $45,000 in past economic damages and $200,000 in future economic damages, and (2) employing the same calculation methodology to the reduced damage figures as it employed in the Final Modified Judgment.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-119\">\n     Regent Care's position at trial was that Detrick was incontinent when he was admitted and that his chart reflects that existing incontinence.
