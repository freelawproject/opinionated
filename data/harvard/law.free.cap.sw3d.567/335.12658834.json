Appellant and\n   Vickers were also involved in the sale of illegal drugs, including methamphetamine. Appellant provided \"protection\" to Vickers. Vickers supplied methamphetamine to Chad Cooper, Auston Welker, and Ben Smith. Vickers stated that, per transaction, she sold approximately one pound of methamphetamine to Cooper. Vickers denied that she conducted illegal drug transactions in Fort Worth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    A. Appellant's actions in Tarrant County and his subsequent convictions in that county for three offenses.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Law enforcement personnel for the City of Fort Worth arranged a \"special operation detail\" that involved Vickers. A confidential informant contacted Vickers and arranged to buy ten ounces of gamma hydroxybutyrate acid (GHB); they were to meet at a gas station on Interstate 30 in Fort Worth. Appellant accompanied Vickers to the transaction, which was to occur in Fort Worth, and he brought 100 grams of methamphetamine with him for Vickers to sell to Cooper. Vickers and Appellant arrived at the gas station in Fort Worth to complete the drug deal, but they left. Law enforcement officials pursued Appellant and Vickers in a lengthy high-speed chase on the interstate. After Vickers's rental car hit another vehicle and stopped in a grocery store parking lot, she jumped out and attempted to escape on foot. The chase ended when Vickers pointed her gun at an officer; she was shot and taken to the hospital. Appellant also fled on foot, but he was quickly caught and taken into custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellant pleaded guilty in Tarrant County to three offenses: (1) possession with intent to deliver more than four grams but less than 200 grams of methamphetamine, (2) unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, and (3) evading arrest. The trial court accepted his guilty pleas, assessed punishment at confinement for fifteen years for those three offenses, and sentenced him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    B. The grand jury in Brown County indicted Appellant for the separate offense of engaging in organized criminal activity.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After Appellant was convicted in Tarrant County, the grand jury in Brown County indicted him for the offense of engaging in organized criminal activity by conspiring to commit the offense of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver. Appellant's trial counsel moved to quash the indictment on the ground that the indictment did not contain any allegation that Appellant committed any specific act in Brown County that furthered organized criminal activity in that county. The trial court denied the motion to quash. Appellant's counsel also sought a writ of habeas corpus and claimed that the organized criminal activity statute was unconstitutional as applied to Appellant. The trial court denied the relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At trial, after the State rested, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict in which he alleged that the State had failed to produce evidence of any overt act committed by Appellant in Brown County that furthered the conspiracy. The trial court denied Appellant's motion. At the end of trial, Appellant requested a jury charge instruction that an overt act must have been committed by Appellant, but the trial court overruled that request. In addition, the trial court denied Appellant's request for a limiting instruction on extraneous offenses and bad acts. The jury found Appellant guilty of engaging in organized criminal activity as charged in the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In his first issue, Appellant claims that the trial court violated his rights to due\n   process and due course of law when it denied his motion to quash, denied his writ of habeas corpus, and denied his motion for directed verdict. Subsumed within that same issue, he also complains about jury charge error and improper closing arguments, and he also asserts a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. In his second and final issue, Appellant complains that the trial court violated his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause when he was convicted twice of the same offense and that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to quash and his writ of habeas corpus. Also within that second issue, Appellant complains that the trial court erred when it ordered the sentence in this case to be served consecutively to the fifteen-year sentence that the trial court in Tarrant County imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We will first note the issues that Appellant has waived due to inadequate briefing. We will then address his sufficiency challenge followed by his constitutional, double jeopardy, and consecutive sentencing complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    A. Appellant waived his complaints regarding the refused jury charge instructions and alleged improper closing arguments because he failed to adequately brief those issues.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In his brief, Appellant mentioned a complaint about jury instructions that he requested, but that the trial court denied, and also mentioned improper closing arguments by the State.

When an appellant challenges the trial court's denial of a motion for a directed verdict, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

In this case, Appellant asserts that the State must prove that he agreed to participate in the conspiracy in Brown County and committed an overt act in Brown County in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under Section 71.02, a person commits the offense of engaging in organized criminal activity, if he intended and conspired, as part of a criminal street gang or as part of a combination of three or more people, to establish, maintain, or participate in a combination of profits from the delivery or distribution of a controlled substance.

Appellant is mistaken when he asserts that the State had a burden to show that he agreed to the conspiracy while in Brown County and that he also took action in Brown County to further that conspiracy. In this case, the State only needed to prove that Appellant intended to further the sale of illegal drugs in Brown County, and we hold that the State did so with sufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Issue One, Part Two\n    </em>\n    : The trial court did not violate Appellant's due process rights because Sections 71.01 and 71.02 of the Texas Penal Code and Article 13.21 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure are not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As part of his first issue, Appellant argues that the trial court denied him due process and due course of law when it denied his motion to quash and writ of habeas corpus. In particular, Appellant argues that Sections 71.01 and 71.02 of the Texas Penal Code and Article 13.21, a special venue provision of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, violated his due process and due course of law rights under the federal and Texas constitutions, respectively, because the laws are vague, both facially and as applied to him. PENAL \u00a7\u00a7 71.01, .02; CRIM. PROC . art. 13.21. As we explain below, we disagree with Appellant's contentions that the trial court violated his due process rights because Sections 71.01 and 71.02 of the Texas Penal Code and Article 13.21 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure are not unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We initially note that the due course of law provision in the Texas constitution provides no greater level of protection than the federal due process clause. Therefore, we will address Appellant's complaints as a due process claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salazar v.

Judge Price noted that double jeopardy \"protects against repeated prosecutions for the same offense (whether following conviction or acquittal at the conclusion of the first prosecution) and against multiple punishments for the same offense stemming from a single prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316075\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/369/880/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chaddock\n   </em>\n   , as is the case now before this court, is a multiple prosecutions case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Judge Price wrote that the question before the court in\n   <em>\n    Chaddock\n   </em>\n   was \"whether [ Section 71.03(3) of the Penal Code ] may operate constitutionally to authorize multiple prosecutions for the same offense as determined by a\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316075\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/369/880/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316075\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/369/880/\">\n    at 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the latter, even if the offenses are the \"same offenses\" under\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   , the legislature may lawfully provide for multiple punishments. As an example, Judge Price cites to\n   <em>\n    Garza v.

There, the court held \"that a defendant who had been indicted both for engaging in organized criminal activity by committing capital murder and also for the underlying capital murder itself could be punished at the conclusion of a single prosecution for both offenses\" regardless of the fact that they are the \"same offense\" under\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Chaddock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316075\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/369/880/\">\n    369 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   883 (citing\n   <em>\n    Garza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8332183\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/213/338/#p351\">\n    213 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   351-52 ).
