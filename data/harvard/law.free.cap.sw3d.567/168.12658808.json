(\"Imerys\" or, collectively, \"Relators\") seek writs of prohibition to prevent the circuit court from taking any further action other than to sever Michael Blaes' claims from the separate claims made by multiple plaintiffs in the underlying case pending in St. Louis City and to transfer Blaes' claims to St. Louis County, where Blaes' wife was first injured. This Court holds the circuit court abused its discretion in overruling Relators' motions to sever Blaes' claims and transfer them to St. Louis County, where venue is proper. The preliminary writs of prohibition are made permanent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   J&amp;J manufactures and sells personal care products, including body powders containing talc. J&amp;J's corporate headquarters are in New Jersey, and its registered agent is in St. Louis County. Imerys is a Delaware corporation that mines and supplies raw talc for use in J&amp;J products, and its registered agent is in Cole County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In July 2014, St. Louis city resident Valerie Swann, along with dozens of non-Missouri plaintiffs, filed suit against Relators in St. Louis city alleging they, or their decedents, developed ovarian cancer from using talc-based products J&amp;J manufactured and sold with talc provided by Imerys. The plaintiffs' petition asserted theories of strict liability for failure to warn, negligence, breach of express and implied warranty, civil conspiracy, concert of action, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, and wrongful death. The plaintiffs alleged their separate claims were a direct and proximate result of Relators' negligent,\n   willful, and wrongful conduct in connection with the design, development, manufacture, testing, packaging, promoting, marketing, distribution, labeling and/or sale of the products known as Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Powder and Shower to Shower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Relators filed motions to sever and to transfer venue. Relators argued because Swann was the only St. Louis city resident plaintiff, the remaining non-Missouri plaintiffs' claims were joined improperly, and their separate claims should be severed and transferred to St. Louis County, where J&amp;J's registered agent is located, or to their home states. The circuit court overruled the motions, finding all of the plaintiffs' claims were joined properly pursuant to Rule 52.05(a) and severance was not required. The circuit court further found venue was appropriate in St. Louis city because Swann alleged she was first injured there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Blaes joined the Swann action in May 2016, when he was named as a plaintiff in the first amended petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Blaes alleged his wife purchased and applied Relators' products in St. Louis County, developed ovarian cancer, and subsequently died. Relators renewed their motions to sever and transfer venue and reincorporated their previous arguments. The circuit court overruled these motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Swann petition was amended twice more. Each time the petition was amended, Relators renewed and reincorporated their objections to joinder and venue. The circuit court overruled all of these motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In August 2017, the plaintiffs were granted leave to file a fourth amended petition. Shortly thereafter, this Court issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Barron v.

In\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   , multiple plaintiffs, many non-Missourians, filed a single claim against Abbott Laboratories, alleging in utero exposure to Depakote, an antiepileptic drug manufactured and marketed by Abbott, caused birth defects. Abbott challenged joinder and venue, seeking to sever all of the plaintiffs' individual claims, and the circuit court overruled Abbott's motion. The first non-Missouri plaintiff, whose claim was designated for a separate trial but not severed from the other plaintiffs, received a multi-million-dollar jury verdict.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387095\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/529/795/#p797\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387095\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/529/795/#p797\">\n    at 797-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, Abbott argued the circuit court erred in overruling its pretrial motion to sever and transfer venue of all the separate, individual claims because joinder and venue of the separate claims was improper for the non-Missouri plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387095\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/529/795/#p797\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387095\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/529/795/#p797\">\n    at 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The circuit court overruled Relators' motions. Relators sought writs of prohibition\n   from the court of appeals, which denied relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Relators then sought writs of prohibition from this Court arguing venue in St. Louis City is improper and seeking to compel the circuit court to transfer Blaes' separate claims to the proper venue in St. Louis County. On October 13, 2017, this Court issued preliminary writs of prohibition and commanded the circuit court to take no further action in this matter, other than to show cause as to the reasons this writ should not issue, until ordered to do so by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction to issue original remedial writs.

It cannot and does not. This is evidenced not only by our Court's rules but also nearly 40 years of this Court's precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Relators contend venue in St. Louis city is improper and seek writs prohibiting the circuit court from taking any further action in this case other than severing Blaes' claims and transferring them to the proper venue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, Blaes contends venue for his separate and independent claims\n   may be pursued in St. Louis city because his claims are properly joined with other plaintiffs who were alleged to be first injured inside and outside Missouri. Blaes concludes the governing venue statute, \u00a7 508.010,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not dictate one specific venue in circumstances in which multiple joined plaintiffs claim their injuries occurred both inside and outside Missouri, causing venue under the facts of this case to be proper in both St. Louis county and city. Therefore, Blaes contends he and the other plaintiffs are able to choose between the city and the county and control where venue lies. However, this position is contingent on the joinder of Blaes' claims with those of the other plaintiffs and, therefore, conflicts with Rule 51.01 and\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Turnbough v.

This Court noted, although Rule 52.05(a) allows \"two or more separate causes of action\" to be joined in a single petition, Rule 51.01 expressly states the rules of civil procedure, including Rule 52.05(a), \"\n   <strong>\n    shall not be construed to extend\n   </strong>\n   or limit the jurisdiction of the Courts of Missouri or\n   <strong>\n    the venue of civil actions therein.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Turnbough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9933921\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/589/290/#p292\">\n    589 S.W.2d at 291-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Relators filed renewed motions to sever and transfer for improper venue, relying\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence to support their arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   J&amp;J acknowledged at the hearing on its motion to sever it never requested to sever the other plaintiffs whose claims were designated for a separate trial. When the circuit court questioned J&amp;J about this change in approach for Blaes' claims, J&amp;J stated it was following the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In its most recent writ petitions before this Court, Relators argued even if joinder and venue were appropriate when Blaes' claims were included in the first amended petition, the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence compels the circuit court to sever Blaes' claims and transfer them to St. Louis County after designating his claims for a separate trial. To that end, Relators argued the circuit court's refusal to sever Blaes' claims and transfer them to St. Louis County constituted an abuse of discretion and violated section 508.010\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and section 508.012 because venue is proper in St. Louis County, where Blaes' decedent was first injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The principal opinion does not devote a single word to the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence and steadfastly ignores Relators' legal arguments. The principal opinion's reach to bypass the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence quagmire is understandable. Parsing the errant roadmap provided by the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence makes it virtually impossible for the principal opinion to reach its result for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, by acknowledging Relators' actual legal arguments grounded in the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence, the principal opinion would have to determine whether a concurring opinion's analysis should be adopted as a majority view. \"Except on matters showing a concurrence of a majority of the members of the court no rule or precedent binding in subsequent cases was thereby established.\"\n   <em>\n    Canary Taxicab Co. v. Terminal Ry. Ass'n of St. Louis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8735060\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/316/709/\">\n    316 Mo. 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8735060\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/316/709/\">\n    294 S.W. 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 92 (Mo. banc 1927). Second, the principal opinion would have to determine whether the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence's analysis is legally sound. I believe the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence unnecessarily complicated an already complex and evolving area of the law, as will be discussed below. Relators' claims are before this Court only because they relied on the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence as a basis to relitigate severance, joinder, and venue for the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     fifth\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   time, hence fomenting these claims. Finally, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , the principal opinion adopted the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence analysis and determined the analysis was legally sound, an examination of Relators' motion demonstrates they failed to plead sufficient facts even to be entitled to relief as posited by the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because all three of these hurdles are insurmountable, one can understand the principal opinion's preference to take no notice of the pleadings as presented and focus instead on venue. However, because this Court should not act as an advocate for the parties and, instead, address the issues as presented, a discussion of the actual arguments Relators raise as they relate to the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    The Barron Concurrence, Designation for Separate Trial, and Severance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Relators' arguments are based on the premise that, once Blaes' claims were designated for a separate trial, his case was severed for all practical purposes because there are \"no further gains in efficiency or expeditiousness to be had\" as stated in the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence.\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387095\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/529/795/#p797\">\n    529 S.W.3d at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, Blaes' claims have not been presented at trial. There is no way to know at this juncture whether either party will seek a Rule 74.01(b) certification after a verdict is rendered or whether the circuit court will grant such a request. It would be inappropriate to speculate whether the claims resolved at Blaes' trial would otherwise impact the other plaintiffs, potentially precluding a Rule 74.01(b) certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Nor should this Court grant extraordinary relief based on Relators' speculative\n   argument the circuit court intends to try each individual plaintiff's claims seriatim, which is not borne out by the record. The record refutes the notion the circuit court had \"an established practice of ordering separate trials of individual claims.\" At a pretrial hearing held in May 2016, the circuit court was cognizant that \"it's incumbent upon us to try to figure out if we can try more than one [claim] at a time,\" but \"we haven't parsed this down sufficiently to determine whether or not we've got enough sufficient categories of similarity that it would be fair to try like that.\" The circuit court also expressed the desire to \"start a process to start looking at whether or not we can get into multi plaintiffs here.\" Moreover, in May 2017, the circuit court demonstrated it was amenable to trying multiple plaintiffs' claims in a single trial when it ordered Blaes, along with two other plaintiffs, to have their claims designated for a single, separate trial, which commenced in June 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Relators maintain section 508.012 requires venue to be reevaluated once a claim is designated for a separate trial and a party files a motion to sever. This is not so. Rule 52.06 provides, \"Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 21 (\"On motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just terms, add or drop a party.\"). When parties are added or removed from a petition, section 508.012 contemplates the potential for reevaluating whether venue is proper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence stated, \"A decision to\n   <em>\n    sever\n   </em>\n   each plaintiff's claims in a multi-plaintiff case 'removes' a plaintiff for purposes of section 508.012 and, therefore, doing so will require the trial court (on application of a party) to determine the proper venue for the various actions resulting from that severance.\"\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387095\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/529/795/#p797\">\n    529 S.W.3d at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This language, positing that interpretation, does not aid Relators' argument because designating Blaes' claims for separate trial did not result in a severance, as discussed previously. Had Blaes' claims actually been severed, it may well have resulted in an independent action, requiring a reevaluation of venue pursuant to section 508.012. However, designating Blaes' claims for a separate trial keeps the petition and parties intact, obviating the need to reevaluate venue. Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence did not cite-nor have I found-any Missouri cases equating designation of a plaintiff's claim for separate trial as \"removing\" or \"dropping\" that plaintiff from the pending cause of action. Hence, section 508.012 does not apply to the pending action and is not helpful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Insufficient Pleadings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Even if Relators properly relied on the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence as binding authority, its mere citation to such does not demonstrate Relators are entitled to relief. The\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence posits at least two elements a party must demonstrate to have a renewed severance motion sustained. First, the circuit court must decide to try each plaintiff's claims separately. As discussed previously, the record refutes this element because Blaes' claims were joined originally with two other plaintiffs for a separate trial in June 2017 and the\n   circuit court made statements on the record about the necessity to try multiple plaintiffs' claims in a single trial. Second, Relators must demonstrate the goals of efficiency and expeditiousness underlying Rule 52.05(a) have been exhausted by the designation of Blaes' claims for a separate trial. Relators have failed to allege or prove how the efficiencies from joinder have been exhausted. As stated previously, it is purely speculative to assume any party will seek Rule 74.01(b) certification or will not resolve issues common to other plaintiffs awaiting trial. Based on the foregoing, I would hold the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in overruling Relators' motions for severance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    Joinder and Venue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because I believe the\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   concurrence does not constitute controlling Missouri law and no severance occurred in this case, the circuit court was not required to reevaluate venue when it designated Blaes' claims for a separate trial. However, I am compelled to address the principal opinion's analysis regarding joinder and venue because its reliance on this Court's \"nearly 40 years\" of precedent rests upon cases that contain distinguishable facts and predate the 2005 amendments, calling into question their applicability here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Rule 52.05(a), the permissive joinder rule, provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   All persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all of them will arise in the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This rule's purpose is \"to promote judicial economy, expedite final disposition of litigation and prevent inconsistent results due to multiple separate lawsuits.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The petition alleged Relators were negligent in the design, development, manufacture, testing, packaging, promoting, marketing, distribution, labeling and/or sale of these products, and all plaintiffs suffered damages as a result. These claims present at least one common question of law or fact that will arise during the action. Joinder of the plaintiffs' claims against Relators was proper under Rule 52.05(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Despite proper joinder, the principal opinion contends the proper venue for Blaes' claim is St. Louis County, the location where Blaes' decedent was first injured.

This was a sudden, unexpected, and - in my view - unjustified turn in venue jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Today, the Court announces a second sudden, unexpected, and - in my view - unjustified detour in venue law. For the first time, the Court holds that no plaintiff or claim can be joined with any other plaintiff or claim unless venue can be established independently for each claim. In the future, numerous claims that previously could have been filed together in one action - and in one venue - must now be filed separately, wasting judicial resources and the time and money of all parties\n   involved. The only support for this sudden and expected change in the law offered in the principal opinion is cases dealing with the joinder of defendants when a single plaintiff was involved in successive and unrelated car accidents. Without explanation, the principal opinion extends these wholly irrelevant decisions to all cases, including cases dealing with the joinder of plaintiffs who all are asserting substantially similar claims against the same defendants. For the reasons set forth below, I respectfully dissent and would quash the preliminary writs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   This is not an unusual or complicated case. Each of the various plaintiff's claims were properly joined in a single action under Rule 52.05(a) because these plaintiffs \"assert [a] right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences and ... [a] question of law or fact common to all of them will arise in the action.\" There is no serious dispute over whether the criteria of Rule 52.05(a) were satisfied in this multi-plaintiff action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Venue in St. Louis City is proper for this action under section 508.010.4\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in all actions in which there is any count alleging a tort and in which the plaintiff was first injured in the state of Missouri, venue shall be in the county where the plaintiff was first injured by the wrongful acts or negligent conduct alleged in the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The language in this statute is clear and unambiguous, and it reflects the legislature's understanding that an \"action\" can - and usually will - include many \"counts.\" This is true particularly where - as here - an \"action\" is brought by multiple plaintiffs with claims \"arising out of the same ... series of transactions or occurrences\" and raising at least one \"question of law or fact common to all of them\" under Rule 52.05(a). If the legislature had meant to require every \"count\" in an \"action\" to separately establish the chosen venue as proper, it could and would have said so. Instead, it said the opposite: venue is proper over an entire \"action\" under section 508.010.4 so long as there is \"any count\" in that \"action\" alleging a tort in which the plaintiff in that count was first injured in that county.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Accordingly, under section 508.010.4, the only question is whether this multi-plaintiff \"action\" contains \"any count alleging a tort ... in which the plaintiff was first injured in the state of Missouri.\" \u00a7 508.010.4. If so, venue is proper in the county in which the plaintiff in that count was first injured. Here, Plaintiff Swann asserts at least one count in which she alleges a tort in which she was first injured in Missouri. Under the plain language of section 508.010.4, therefore, venue for the entire \"action\" - not just for that \"count\" - is proper where Plaintiff Swann was first injured, i.e., in St. Louis City. Unless and until the legislature amends section 508.010.4, this result is compelled by that section and this Court has no business imposing any outcome other than the one the legislature's language envisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The principal opinion ignores the plain language of section 508.010.4 and holds, for the first time, that properly joined plaintiffs under the first sentence of Rule 52.05(a) nevertheless must independently establish venue for each of their joined claims. This is no small change. Going forward, practically speaking, tort plaintiffs will be able to join their claims in a single lawsuit with other plaintiffs asserting\n   similar claims against the same defendants only if all plaintiffs were first injured in the same county. But the changes will not stop there. For non-tort suits, or for suits involving tort and non-tort claims, both single and multiple plaintiff cases cannot be filed against multiple defendants in a venue unless that venue is proper for each claim against each defendant. Finally, notwithstanding Rule 55.06,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the principal opinion's holding also means a single plaintiff will no longer be able to join together two (or more) claims against a single defendant unless those two separate claims could have been filed independently in the same venue. That this creates a conflict with prior cases,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Ormerod v. Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9276576\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/130/571/#p573\">\n    130 S.W.3d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 573 (Mo. banc 2004) (\"Because Rule 55.06(a) allows joinder of tort and contract claims, and because there is only one defendant, venue with respect to either the tort or contract claims would be appropriate to the remaining claims joined.\"), seems not to deter the result reached in the principal opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   What compels the principal opinion to wreak such havoc? First, running\n   <em>\n    sub silentio\n   </em>\n   throughout the principal opinion is the suggestion that this Court's Rule 52.05(a) somehow was intended to circumvent the legislature's prerogative to enact venue statutes. This suggestion is incorrect. Rule 52.05(a) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   All persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all of them will arise in the action. All persons may be joined in one action as defendants if there is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative, any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrences or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all of them will arise in the action. A plaintiff or defendant need not be interested in obtaining or defending against all the relief demanded. Judgment may be given for one or more of the plaintiffs according to their respective rights to relief, and against one or more defendants according to their respective liabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The language of this rule is taken,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     word for word\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , from section 507.040.1, RSMo 2000, which for more than 75 years has provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   All persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all of them will arise in the action. All persons may be joined in one action as defendants if there is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative, any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all of them will arise in the action. A plaintiff or defendant need not be interested in obtaining or defending against all the relief demanded. Judgment may be given for one or more of the plaintiffs according to their respective rights to relief, and against one or more defendants according to their respective liabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Accordingly, there is no tug-of-war between Rule 52.05(a) and section 507.040.1 that must, under Rule 51.01, be settled in favor of the legislature's determination of the proper venue. Instead, section 508.010.4 - like all venue statutes - must be read in light of the legislature's long-standing understanding of permissive joinder as set forth in section 507.040.1 and, now, Rule 52.05(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   This mistake has been made before, in different and far less dramatic circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sperry Corp. v.

When Abbott sought a writ in this Court prior to its doomed appeal (where, ironically, it was told that disputes over venue were better reviewed by petition for extraordinary writ), it specifically argued Rule 51.01 prohibited a plaintiff from using \"permissive joinder under Rule 52.05 to piggyback on the venue of another plaintiff with whom she is joined.\" This argument was reasserted in its appeal. Neither time was it deemed to be grounds for relief. And, lest Abbott conclude incorrectly that this whipsaw is reserved solely for it, this Court declined to grant relief based on the interplay of Rules 51.01 and 52.05(a) in\n    <em>\n     State ex rel. GlaxoSmithKline, LLC, v. Neill\n    </em>\n    , SC91374, and\n    <em>\n     State ex rel. Monsanto v.
