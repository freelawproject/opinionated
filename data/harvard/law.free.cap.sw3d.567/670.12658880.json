Peete (Movant) appeals the judgment denying without an evidentiary hearing his Rule 24.035 motion for post-conviction relief. Movant argues that the motion court clearly erred because his convictions for sixteen counts of stealing and concurrent seven-year sentences were unlawful under the Missouri Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Bazell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182019\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/263/\">\n    497 S.W.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2016). An extended opinion would have no precedential value. The parties have been provided with a memorandum for their information only, setting forth the reasons for this order. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
