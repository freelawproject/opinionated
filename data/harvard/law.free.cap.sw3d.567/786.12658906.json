Derosa received information from the owner of a cell phone that his phone had been stolen. The owner of the cell phone showed Detective Derosa, via the cloud, that said cell phone was shown to be located at Memorial High School. Detective Derosa obtained photographs of respondent on the said reportedly stolen cell phone, also via the cloud.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Detective Derosa went to Memorial High School to locate the reportedly stolen phone and to determine if respondent was also at Memorial High School. Respondent was found to be at Memorial High School. The reportedly stolen phone was also found at Memorial High School (in the custody of one of respondent's teachers). Respondent was identified as having been in possession of the said reportedly stolen cell phone by said teacher.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-14\">\n   Respondent was in the Vice-Principal's office at Memorial High School. Respondent was questioned in the Vice-Principal's office by Detective Derosa and school personnel. Following the questioning, Detective Derosa placed respondent under arrest for theft.

Magistrate Oliver then consulted with Detective Derosa concerning the questioning of respondent. Detective Derosa gave Magistrate Oliver a list of questions Detective Derosa was interested in having answered by respondent.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n    Magistrate Oliver questioned respondent based on the list of questions from Detective Derosa and instructed respondent to think about those questions prior to writing his statement. Respondent provided a written statement to Magistrate Oliver, who then shared it with Detective Derosa. Detective Derosa asked Magistrate Oliver to ask the respondent some additional questions.

App.-El Paso 1977, no writ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Given the magistrate's role under section 51.095 and the need to strictly comply with the detailed and explicit procedures set forth in section 51.095, we hold the questioning by the magistrate in this case violated section 51.095 for two reasons. First, section 51.095 only provides for questioning by peace officers or attorneys representing the state for purposes of obtaining the juvenile's statement and only after the juvenile is warned about the right to have an attorney appointed to counsel with the juvenile before and during questioning. Second, the magistrate failed to maintain the requisite neutrality required by the statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    With regard to the first reason for our holding, one of the warnings a magistrate is required to give a juvenile under section 51.095 is that \"if the [juvenile] is unable to employ an attorney, the [juvenile] has the right to have an attorney appointed to counsel with the [juvenile] before or\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      during any interviews with peace officers or attorneys representing the state.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    \" TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 51.0095(a)(1)(A)(iii) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Thus, the warning only refers to questioning by \"peace officers or attorneys representing the state\" for purposes of obtaining a juvenile's statement. TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 51.095(a)(1)(A)(iii). Since strict compliance with the statute is required, and section 51.095 only refers to questioning by \"peace officers or attorneys representing the state,\" section 51.095 necessarily precludes questioning by a magistrate for purposes of obtaining a statement. Otherwise, the juvenile would need to be warned that he or she \"has the right to have an attorney appointed to counsel with the juvenile before or during any interviews with\" a magistrate which involve the magistrate questioning the juvenile like a peace officer or attorney representing the state for purposes of obtaining a statement.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9955862\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/553/827/#p828\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    With regard to the magistrate failing to maintain the requisite neutrality, this court has previously addressed this concern.

App.-San Antonio Apr. 4, 2001, pet. ref'd) (not designated for publication), the appellant contended his statement should have been suppressed because \"the magistrate was not fair and impartial as required by\" section 51.095. The appellant asserted \"the magistrate acted as a law enforcement officer or prosecutor by interviewing him and taking his confession.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%20322166\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    In rejecting the argument, this court held, \"Moorhead fails to cite to any testimony or evidence indicating the magistrate acted as a law enforcement officer or prosecutor.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%20322166\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Therefore, \"[b]ased on the record and lack of controverting evidence or arguments, we overrule[d] Moorhead's [ ] issue.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Implicit in this court's holding in\n    <em>\n     Moorhead\n    </em>\n    is the premise that this court might have held differently if Moorhead had cited to testimony or evidence indicating the magistrate acted as a law enforcement officer or prosecutor.

And, a magistrate might have a more difficult time finding a juvenile's statement that the magistrate elicited to be involuntary, as opposed to a statement\n    elicited by law enforcement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX.

Therefore, we hold if a magistrate questions a juvenile to obtain a written statement using questions provided by a law enforcement officer and consults with the law enforcement officer before conducting additional questioning, the magistrate has violated the Family Code by failing to maintain the requisite neutrality. Furthermore, we conclude this failure to maintain the requisite neutrality necessarily impacts the voluntariness determination required by the Family Code.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pham v.
