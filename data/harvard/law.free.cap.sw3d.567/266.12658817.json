Lynn resided in his parents' home on the farm for twenty-three years. When Lynn was born, his parents owned 80 acres of farmland, and David ran a dairy farm on the land. Later, Margaret inherited a nearby 110 acres from her parents, and David used this land to grow hay and pasture livestock. When Lynn was around ten years old, he began helping David on the farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When Lynn turned fourteen years old, he began clearing pastures and milking cows located on the 110 acres belonging to Margaret's parents that Margaret later inherited in 1980. Then in 1968, David bought an additional 68 acres of land from\n   Margaret's aunt and uncle, which was located next to the original 80 acres. After this purchase, David and Margaret had a total of around 260 acres of land. In 1970, Lynn graduated high school but stayed home to work on the farm. In 1971, David bought 210 acres of land, which laid on the two sides of the 110 acres. Following this purchase, the Scott farm totaled 470 acres, and there have been no additions since then.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Scotts have sold some acres here and there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the early 1970s, David stopped working on the farm as much as he previously did as he held another job. During this time, Lynn took over most of the farm duties, including haying, tending crops and livestock, milking, and transacting farm business. Throughout this time, Lynn considered himself in a partnership with David as they shared expenses and income. Appellants married in 1975, and Lynn took over all of the day-to-day activities of running the farm due to David's age and closeness to retirement. Following their marriage, Appellants moved into an old house on the farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sometime around 1981, David retired. In 1981, Lynn signed a quitclaim deed conveying 216.5 acres of the disputed property to David and Margaret. David and Margaret had previously deeded this same land to Lynn, but they decided to place the land in a trust and \"deed it back\" later since David and Margaret were concerned about what would happen if Appellants' marriage did not last. During 1981, Appellants became solely responsible for all of the disputed property's income and expenses, and as such, reported all items on their tax returns and have continued to do so since then. While David would rake hay for Lynn approximately once a year until he died in 1983, Margaret did not help on the disputed property because she was physically unable to do so. Since 1981, Margaret has not had any involvement with the disputed property. According to Lynn, Margaret simply \"liked to get out and look at crops and look at things\" and, as such, he \"took her anywhere she wanted to go.\" None of Appellants' farming activities ever went against Margaret's wishes, and Margaret never asked Appellants to stop doing any particular activity on the disputed property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Between 1993 and 1995, Lynn wanted to raise capital in order to build himself and his family a new house near the disputed property, so he decided to sell five parcels of land. In order to sell these parcels, however, Lynn needed for Margaret to sign each of the five deeds, which she did for each sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 1999, Margaret signed a beneficiary deed conveying the disputed property to Lynn upon Margaret's death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lynn believed the reason for this beneficiary deed was so he would not have to pay taxes upon Margaret's death. Also in 1999, Margaret deeded Appellants title to approximately 10 acres of land across the road from the disputed property for Appellants to build a house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2007, due to a farming hardship, Appellants attempted to obtain a loan at the Seymour Bank secured by the disputed property (the \"2007 loan\"). Lynn informed Margaret that he \"needed\" her to sign the deed of trust (the \"2007 Deed of Trust\") because the title was in her name. Margaret complied and signed the deed of trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Lynn made all of the payments on this loan until 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2009, Lynn, Margaret, and Lynn's son, Jared Scott, filed a lawsuit against Richard, one of the Respondents, claiming that Richard's cattle had trespassed on the disputed property. Their petition alleged that Margaret was the title owner of the disputed property and Lynn and Jared worked on the disputed property. As part of this lawsuit, Margaret, Lynn, and Jared signed sworn answers to interrogatories, which included stating, \"Jared L. Scott and [Lynn] Scott use Plaintiff Margaret's [sic] Scott's land. Margaret is family, additionally, she allows us to use the property and has deeded it to us in a beneficiary deed in the event of her death.\" Margaret further swore that Lynn and Jared \"operate my family farm.\" Furthermore, in a deposition for this lawsuit, Lynn admitted that while Margaret \"owned title\" to the disputed property, he \"own[ed] possession.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2013, after trying to make a payment on the 2007 loan, Appellants learned that the disputed property had been sold. It was discovered that on February 8, 2013, Respondents received as grantees a General Warranty Deed from Margaret executed on her behalf by Jan Nunn, Margaret's attorney in fact under a power of attorney, and Lynn's sister. The deed described the disputed property in the same manner as that described in the 1999 beneficiary deed and in the 2007 Deed of Trust. Respondents paid Margaret $385,000 for the disputed property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following this discovery, Appellants and Jared and Mary Scott, husband and wife, filed this action. Their second amended petition asserted a claim that they had acquired title to the disputed property through adverse possession and a claim for undue influence. Appellants proceeded to trial on their second amended petition, wherein the trial court dismissed Jared and Mary's claims with prejudice and dismissed Appellants' alternative claim of undue influence. At the close of Appellants' evidence, Respondents moved for a directed verdict, which the trial court denied. Respondents renewed their motion for directed verdict at the close of all evidence, which the trial court also denied. After closing arguments and deliberation, the jury returned a verdict for Appellants, finding they had adversely possessed the disputed property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following the adverse jury verdict, Respondents timely moved for a JNOV, and the trial court granted the motion in its judgment, finding that Appellants did not make a submissible case for adverse possession of the disputed property by failing to present substantial evidence supporting that their possession of the disputed property was hostile, open and notorious, or exclusive. Appellants timely appeal that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In their sole point on appeal, Appellants first argue the trial court erred in finding they failed to present substantial evidence supporting that their possession of the disputed property was hostile. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Adverse possession for the statutory period establishes an indefeasible legal title in the possessor, the title of the record owner is divested, and that title is not lost by abandonment, or failure to assert it after it has been perfected.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     City of South Greenfield\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     v.

The reason for this transfer of title was that David and Margaret were concerned about what would happen if Appellants' marriage did not last and Lynn agreed with them.

In order to raise funds for construction, Lynn needed to sell five parcels of the then-somewhat larger disputed property. However, in order to sell these five parcels,\n   Lynn testified that he \"needed\" Margaret's signature consenting to the sale. Thereafter, Margaret consented and repeatedly proceeded to sign, over that two-year period, all five deeds making those conveyances. Lynn conceded that Appellants would not have been able to sell the five parcels had Margaret not signed the deeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As of the first sell-off in 1993, Appellants' possession of the disputed property could not have been hostile to Margaret's legal title for the requisite ten-year period because Appellants acknowledged at that time they could not do what they wanted to do with the land; i.e., sell a part of the disputed property without Margaret's consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Weaver\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11919596\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/941/801/#p804\">\n    941 S.W.2d at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[a]n adverse possessor does not recognize the authority of the record titleholder to permit or to prevent his continued use of the property claimed.\"). Furthermore, by voluntarily, knowingly, and intentionally seeking Margaret's permission, in the form of her signature as grantor on the deeds, Appellants recognized and deferred to her legal title to the disputed property at that time. This action establishes that their claim by possession at that time was in subordination of, not in defiance of, Margaret's title.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Weaver\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11919596\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/941/801/#p804\">\n    941 S.W.2d at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Lynn testified that a beneficiary deed was \"a way of conveying ownership from one person to another upon death.\" Lynn further testified that he did not file an adverse possession lawsuit against Margaret because he \"[saw] no purpose in that\" since he \"already owned [the disputed property]\" and that \"[the disputed property] was in a beneficiary deed to me.\" Lynn believed that he \"earned\" the disputed property and that it would pass to him upon Margaret's death. Lynn stated that he was fine with this arrangement as he did not want to take title to the disputed property because he wanted to avoid paying capital gains taxes. Appellants' knowing and intentional acquiescence in and support of Margaret's actions at that time and her title right to direct the disposition of the disputed property upon her death, in order to secure for themselves a financial tax benefit, is Appellants' recognition of Margaret's legal title to the disputed property at that time and the subservience of their possessory rights to her legal title.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Reinheimer\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10177250\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/327/823/#p830\">\n    327 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   831 ;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Weaver\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11919596\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/941/801/#p804\">\n    941 S.W.2d at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Appellants needed a loan in order to pay off another loan that was past due. In applying for this loan, the application asked Appellants to list their assets under a column titled \"ASSETS[.]\" Under the \"Real Estate Owned\" section of the \"ASSETS\" column, Appellants listed they owned a market value of $170,000 in real estate. Lynn testified that this $170,000 valuation was based solely on Appellants' home and the ten acres upon which it was located. For Appellants to receive the desired loan, however, Lynn testified that he \"needed\" Margaret to\n   pledge the disputed property that was titled in her name as collateral. Because of this, Margaret submitted a loan application, which also included a column titled \"ASSETS[.]\" Under the \"Real Estate Owned\" section of the \"ASSETS\" column, Margaret listed she owned a market value of $750,000 in real estate, specifically a \"farm and home[.]\" Lynn acknowledged that Margaret's loan application, specifically the real estate owned, was accurate since the disputed property was \"titled to her\" and that he had no objection to the disputed property being titled to her. Additionally, Lynn testified that Appellants would not have been able to receive a loan had Margaret not pledged her property as collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Appellants' exclusion of the disputed property in their loan application was a voluntary, knowing, and intentional recognition that their possession of the disputed property was subservient to a \"recognized, superior claim of another,\" i.e., Margaret's record legal title.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Porter v.

App. 1979). Likewise, Appellants' admitted necessity for Margaret to pledge the disputed property as collateral for their loan was a knowing and intentional acknowledgment that Margaret had not been divested of title to the disputed property as of that date and therefore, that Appellants' possession of the disputed property had not been hostile during any ten-year period on or before that date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Nutting v.

Margaret is family, additionally, she allows us to use the property and has deeded it to us in a beneficiary deed in the event of her death.\" Margaret further swore that Lynn and Jared \"operate my family farm.\" Lastly, in a deposition, Lynn admitted that Margaret\n   <em>\n    owned\n   </em>\n   about 470 acres.
