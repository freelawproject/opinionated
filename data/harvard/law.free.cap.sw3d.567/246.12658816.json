William argues that the motion court erred in denying his motion because there were substantial or continuing changes of circumstances to warrant termination or modification of maintenance, Paula Severn (\"Paula\") could meet her reasonable needs, William's employer's contributions to his 409A deferred compensation plan should not have been included in his gross income for purposes of child support calculations, and Paula's income was understated for purposes of child support calculations. William further argues that the motion court erred in awarding Paula half of her attorney fees and awarding Paula more than half of the combined disposable income. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Statement of Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   William and Paula were married on September 7, 1991, in Shawnee County, KS. On February 27, 2008, the trial court entered a Judgment Entry for Dissolution of Marriage, dissolving William and Paula's marriage. The parties settled all issues in the dissolution and the trial court approved their agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties agreed that William would pay Paula modifiable maintenance in the sum of $1,500.00 per month. In the Form 14 submitted by agreement of the parties in the dissolution, Paula's gross monthly income was $2,083.00 per month plus the $1,500.00 per month in maintenance and William's gross monthly income was $16,333.00 per month before the reduction for his maintenance obligation. The parties were awarded joint legal and physical custody of their three minor children and the parties agreed that William would be ordered to pay child support to Paula in the amount of $1,893.00 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the marriage for the ten years prior to the dissolution, Paula was not employed outside the home and was a stay-at-home mother to the parties' children. Approximately one month prior to the dissolution Paula obtained employment at a salon as a hairdresser and her income from that employment was used to determine child support and maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 29, 2016, William filed a Motion to Modify Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage as to Child Support and Spousal Maintenance seeking to terminate his maintenance obligation to Paula, to declare the emancipation of the parties' eldest child, to reduce his child support\n   obligation, and to make the child support payable directly to the parties' youngest two children. A hearing was held on August 29, 2017. At the hearing the parties stipulated that two of the children were now over the age of 18 and were emancipated. The youngest child was still subject to child support. There is no dispute among the parties that the emancipation of two of the children supported a modification of the child support obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The motion court entered a Judgment for Modification on October 3, 2017. The court rejected both parties' Form 14 child support calculations and prepared its own Form 14. The court found Paula's average monthly income to be in the amount of $3,637.00 per month and William's average monthly income to be in the amount of $20,662.00 per month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion court found the presumed child support amount to be in the sum of $1,508.00 per month and that this amount was not unjust or inappropriate and awarded child support in that amount for the remaining unemancipated minor child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The evidence at trial adduced that Paula continued to work at the same hair salon where she began working shortly before the dissolution. Her income had gradually increased over time as she obtained new customers and grew her clientele. At the time of trial she was working less than 40 hours per week and had gross earnings of $43,644.00 per year or $3,637.00 per month. William alleged at trial and on appeal that Paula should be working at least 40 hours per week and based on his calculations, gross income should be imputed to her in the amount of $6,100.00 per month for both child support and maintenance determinations. The motion court found that Paula's income had gradually increased following the dissolution because of her increase in clients over time but that this increase was foreseeable at the time of the dissolution. The court also found that there was no evidence to establish that she would have sufficient customers to earn additional income no matter how many hours she spent in the salon. The court found that she was earning a reasonable income based on her profession as a hairdresser and based on her education and experience. The court found that she was not underemployed and that her gradual increase in income over the years since the dissolution did not constitute a substantial and continuing change in circumstances to justify a termination or modification of maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court found that Paula had overstated her expenses by including amounts expended on the children in her own expenses. However, the court found that based on her reasonable needs she was still in need of maintenance and that the change in the amount of her reasonable expenses did not constitute a substantial and continuing change in circumstances so as to justify the termination of or a modification of the prior maintenance award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the time of trial, William was employed by a management company and his base salary was in the amount of $195,190.00 per year. William also received bonus income in the following years in the following amounts: 2014 = $9,000.00, 2015 = $32,000.00, and 2016 = $32,000.00. William also received dividend income in the following years in the following amounts: 2014 = $18,828.00, 2015 = $15,757.00 and 2016 = $14,175.00. The motion court found that while the bonus and dividend amounts have varied from year to year, based on\n   the evidence, it was reasonable to include the average amount received from each over the last three years and divide by twelve in determining William's gross monthly income. The court found the average monthly income to be $2,028.00 per month from bonuses and $1,355.00 per month from dividends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   William's employer also had a deferred compensation plan which the employer contributed to over the years but solely at its option. The motion court found that if these funds were not contributed into the deferred compensation plan that William would not receive these amounts but also found that because they were put into a deferred compensation plan they were not currently available to William. While the court found these funds were not available to William at this time because of the restrictions on when he could withdraw these funds from his deferred compensation account, the amounts contributed constituted a significant employment related benefit for purposes of determining William's gross income pursuant to Form 14 Line 1 comments for use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the evidence the court found that it was appropriate to include one half of the average payment William's employer contributed to his deferred compensation plan over the last three years for purposes of determining his gross income for child support purposes and his ability to pay maintenance. One half of the average amount contributed over the preceding three years constituted $12,167.00 per year or $1,013.00 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   William's ability to pay the maintenance award is not in dispute. The motion court found that William failed to establish a substantial and continuing change in circumstances sufficient to justify a modification or termination of the prior maintenance award and left the prior maintenance award of $1,500.00 per month in effect. The motion court used this amount in its Form 14 child support calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The motion court further found that due \"to the disparity of the income and the unsupported claim for the termination of maintenance, it is reasonable and necessary that [William] pay [Paula] one-half of her attorney's fees and expert witness fees in the amount of $5,585.00.\" This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   William raises six points on appeal. In Point One, William argues that the motion court erred in concluding there was no substantial or continuing change in circumstances to warrant termination or modification of maintenance because the weight of the evidence demonstrated that there was such a change in circumstances. In Point Two, William argues that the motion court erred in concluding Paula could not meet her reasonable living expenses because the weight of the evidence demonstrated that she had overstated her expenses. In his third point on appeal, William argues that the motion court erred in calculating child support because the motion court overstated his income by including his employer's contributions to his deferred compensation plan. In his fourth point on appeal, William argues that the motion court erred in calculating child support since it understated Paula's income by failing to impute to her full-time\n   employment income. In his fifth point on appeal, William argues that the motion court erred in awarding Paula half of her attorney's and expert witness fees because the weight of the evidence showed that she had more than sufficient cash assets to pay the fees. In Point Six, William argues that the motion court erred by awarding Paula more than half of the combined disposable net income of the parties because it is against public policy and fundamental fairness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis of Points One and Two\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Both Points One and Two argue that the judgment was against the weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Upon review, we will affirm the trial court's judgment unless it is not supported by substantial evidence, it is against the weight of the evidence, or it erroneously declares or applies the law.\n   <em>\n    Markowski v.

A claim that the judgment is against the weight of the evidence presupposes that there is sufficient evidence to support the judgment. In other words, 'weight of the evidence' denotes an appellate test of how much persuasive value evidence has, not just whether sufficient evidence exists that tends to prove a necessary fact. See\n   <em>\n    White v. Dir. of Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321942\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/321/298/#p309\">\n    321 S.W.3d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 309 (Mo. banc 2010) (stating that 'weight' denotes probative value, not the quantity of the evidence). The against-the-weight-of-the-evidence standard serves only as a check on a circuit\n   court's potential abuse of power in weighing the evidence, and an appellate court will reverse only in rare cases, when it has a firm belief that the decree or judgment is wrong.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   When reviewing the record in an against-the-weight-of-the-evidence challenge, this Court defers to the circuit court's findings of fact when the factual issues are contested and when the facts as found by the circuit court depend on credibility determinations. A circuit court's judgment is against the weight of the evidence only if the circuit court could not have reasonably found, from the record at trial, the existence of a fact that is necessary to sustain the judgment. When the evidence poses two reasonable but different conclusions, appellate courts must defer to the circuit court's assessment of that evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   This Court defers on credibility determinations when reviewing an against-the-weight-of-the-evidence challenge because the circuit court is in a better position to weigh the contested and conflicting evidence in the context of the whole case. The circuit court is able to judge directly not only the demeanor of witnesses, but also their sincerity and character and other trial intangibles that the record may not completely reveal. Accordingly, this standard of review takes into consideration which party has the burden of proof and that the circuit court is free to believe all, some, or none of the evidence offered to prove a contested fact, and the appellate court will not re-find facts based on credibility determinations through its own perspective. This includes facts expressly found in the written judgment or necessarily deemed found in accordance with the result reached. Rule 73.01(c). Evidence not based on a credibility determination, contrary to the circuit court's judgment, can be considered in an appellate court's review of an against-the-weight-of-the-evidence challenge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321942\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/321/298/#p309\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   These principles are reflected in the four-step analytical sequence for against-the-weight-of-the-evidence challenges set forth in\n   <em>\n    Houston v.

Instead, William presents the evidence in the light most favorable to his position and ignores the motion court's factual and credibility findings and argues his evidence was more credible and therefore the judgment should be reversed.

After the parties separated, Paula began working as a hairdresser at a salon. At the time of the dissolution Paula's gross income was $2,083.00 per month. At the time of trial in this action her gross income had increased to $3,637.00 per month. Paula has consistently maintained employment since the time of dissolution. The court found that she was earning a reasonable income based on her profession as a hairdresser and based on her education and experience. The court found that she was not underemployed and that her gradual increase in income over the years since the dissolution did not constitute a substantial and continuing change in circumstances to justify a termination or modification of maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   William argues that Paula only works 29 hours a week, while Paula claims she works at least 35 hours a week. William's calculation of Paula's work hours is based solely on her appointment book and the time she was actually performing cosmetology services for a client. The court found, due to the fact that Paula's hours as a hairdresser are based solely on the number of her clients, there is no guarantee she would have clients continuously for 40 hours per week even if she never left the salon. Both parties acknowledge that Paula's income has increased since the time of dissolution. However, the court found that \"[w]ithout the maintenance payment, Petitioner's standard of living would decrease significantly from what it was during the marriage.\" The court found that although, Paula has made good faith efforts to become self-sufficient, she remains unable to meet her reasonable needs with her own income. The court found the evidence insufficient to support the imputation of income to Paula based upon her working 40\n   hours per week. The court found based upon her current income and reasonable needs she remained in need of maintenance. William failed to establish a substantial and continuing change in circumstances on this basis under these facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eaton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9286508,9286533\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/127/690/\">\n    127 S.W.3d at 696-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

William argues that in the past nine and half years following the dissolution judgment, Paula's net cash assets increased by $67,421.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Once again on this subpoint, William's brief fails to even attempt to apply the four-step analytical sequence for an against-the-weight-of-the-evidence challenge set forth in\n   <em>\n    Schubert\n   </em>\n   to the facts of this case. Again we would be justified in rejecting this argument on that basis alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In support of this argument, William cites to\n   <em>\n    Cohen v. Cohen\n   </em>\n   , for the proposition that \"any investment income from the property awarded is to be considered in determining whether the spouse has sufficient property to provide for his or her reasonable needs because a spouse is not entitled to build an estate or accumulate capital through maintenance.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9436189\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/73/39/#p47\">\n    73 S.W.3d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47 (Mo. App. W.D. 2002). This holding is completely inapplicable to the facts of this case. William fails to point to any income producing property owned by Paula, the income from which she should be using to meet her reasonable needs. This Court in\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   was assessing whether the court below erred in calculating maintenance by not including income from retirement and IRA accounts apportioned as marital property, which is distinct from, and irrelevant to, William's argument before this Court. William does not argue that the value of the marital assets such as her home should be included in the calculation of Paula's income. Rather William attempts to simply add up the value of the assets awarded to her in the dissolution and compare that to what he claims is the total value of the assets she currently owns, to support an argument that she has used her maintenance payments to improperly increase her assets and this therefore constitutes a substantial and continual change in circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   William cites to no other authority to support his argument on this subpoint. \"Failure to cite relevant authority supporting a point or to explain the failure to do so preserves nothing for review.\"\n   <em>\n    Mansfield v.

William argues\n   that Paula's expenses were overstated because she included expenses relating to the dependent child in her own expenses and she included expenses for the extra lines on her cell phone plan she shares with the children. William further argues that all of Paula's other expenses were overestimated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Once again William completely failed to even attempt to apply the\n   <em>\n    Schubert\n   </em>\n   factors to his arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In its judgment, the motion court acknowledged that Paula's expenses were overstated due to the inclusion of the expenses for the children.

The motion court specifically noted in its judgment that Paula had overestimated some of her expenses and included improper expenses for the children in her evidence regarding her reasonable needs. The motion court also noted that while some expenses were overestimated, they were not overestimated as drastically as claimed by William. It is clear that the motion court properly excluded the improper amounts but still found that Paula's reasonable needs exceeded her reasonable income and that she remained in need of maintenance.

William argues that this Court should adopt a formula which he asserts provides a \"fairness approach.\" William asks this Court to adopt an approach to maintenance advocated by Douglas R. Beach\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   in an article entitled \"One Way To Look At Maintenance.\" William cites to no case which has adopted the use of this formula or adopted the \"fairness\" analysis discussed in the article.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Briefly the approach William requests this court to adopt is that in a dissolution the party paying child support or maintenance should always retain a minimum of 57 percent of that party's after tax net income for their own support and the receiving spouse should never receive more than 50 percent of the combined net income of the parties. William argues that to provide the receiving party more than these amounts, allows the party receiving child support and maintenance to \"coast.\" Apparently William believes that if the receiving spouse is awarded too high of an amount of child support and maintenance that that party will lose any incentive to become self-supporting and it is not fair for the paying spouse to have to pay too great of a percentage of their take home pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In attempting to apply Judge Beach's formula to the facts of this case, William uses income figures for each party that are inconsistent with the trial judge's findings and asks us to adopt income figures in the light most favorable to his own evidence. Even if we were to adopt the formula he\n   requests, which we do not, his requested application of the facts to the formula would violate our standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The area of law regarding awards of maintenance and child support is expansive and well developed, giving broad discretion to the trial court in determining the appropriate maintenance and child support awards.

The presumed child support calculation is reversed and we find William's presumed child support obligation to be $1,455.00 per month. On remand the motion court shall determine whether this presumed child support amount is unjust and inappropriate based on the evidence adduced at the trial. If it is found to be appropriate the motion court shall order William to pay support in that sum, if it is found to be unjust and inappropriate the motion court shall enter a child support amount that it finds to be just and appropriate.
