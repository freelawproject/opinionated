She asserts three points on appeal, claiming the trial court erred in finding a statutory ground for termination and that termination was in the children's best interests. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
