HCH owned property that GM used for its new-car facility, and Sachs owned property that GM used for its used-car facility. Two substantially similar lease agreements required GM to pay \"base rent\":\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-10\">\n       <strong>\n        3. Rent.\n       </strong>\n       (a)\n       <em>\n        Base Rent.\n       </em>\n       ... The Annual Base Rent shall be payable in monthly installments ... on or before the fifth (5th) day of each calendar month during the term of this Lease. Rental for the first and last months hereof shall be prorated on a daily basis.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-11\">\n       GM historically paid the base rent through two automatic transfers from its bank, Arvest, to the accounts of HCH and Sachs on the first day of each month. In the fall of 2015, the parties began negotiations to sell the real estate and car dealerships to a third party. GM agreed to sell the dealerships to LL Ark Northwest, LLC, and appellees agreed to sell the real estate to a related entity called LL Ark Properties, LLC. Two lease-termination agreements (LTAs) were executed and included the following pertinent language:\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n       <strong>\n        1.\n        <em>\n         Termination of Lease.\n        </em>\n       </strong>\n       Effective upon the Closing of the Dealership Transaction and Real Estate Transaction and provided that the Lessee has satisfied its obligations to pay Base Rent through the Termination Date to Lessor and has paid, or provided adequate funds for the payment of, 2015 property taxes and prorated 2016 property taxes (through the Termination Date) assessed against the Leased Premises (the\n       <strong>\n        \"Termination Date\"\n       </strong>\n       ), except as provided below, the Lease shall be deemed automatically terminated, null, void, and of no future effect, without any further action required on the part of Lessor or Lessee. From and after the Termination Date, neither Lessee, Lessor, any Guarantor nor any of their respective affiliates shall have any further liability, right, duty or obligation to the other party arising under the Lease....\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-13\">\n       <strong>\n        2.\n        <em>\n         Release.\n        </em>\n       </strong>\n       As additional consideration for the termination of the Lease, each party hereby releases and waives any rights, duties, claims, or obligations of the other party arising out of or in connection with the Lease from and after the effective date of this Agreement.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-14\">\n       The following footnote is included in the LTAs:\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-17\">\n       II.\n       <em>\n        Procedural History\n       </em>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-18\">\n       On June 10, 2016, GM filed a complaint against HCH, Sachs, Arvest Bank, and Arvest Bank Group, Inc., alleging causes of action for, among other things, breach of contract, conversion, and unjust enrichment.\n       <footnotemark>\n        1\n       </footnotemark>\n       The complaint was later amended to add Haynes as a defendant.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-19\">\n       Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment. Attached to their motion were the lease agreements, the LTAs, excerpts from depositions from Carla Capron and Morrand, and an affidavit signed by Haynes. Capron testified that GM had hired Capron Consulting in August 2015. She said that no one had asked her to cancel the automatic transfers to appellees and that she had done that on her own initiative based on closing procedures. Morrand testified that he understood that executing the LTAs was a condition of closing the dealership and real-estate transactions so that the properties would no longer be encumbered by the lease agreements. He further testified that GM had longstanding automatic transfers in place for the lease payments to be made directly to appellees' accounts. He disagreed with appellees' characterization that he had paid the rent, closed the deals, and then released appellees from any claims. Haynes attested in his affidavit that HCH and Sachs did not know when the LTAs would be signed or become effective because appellees were not privy to information related to the dealership transaction. He further stated that he understood that February's lease payment would be paid consistent with the terms of the LTAs and the historical practice between the parties and that the rent would therefore be paid before the LTAs were signed. Haynes stated that prior to signing the LTAs, he called his office manager to confirm that GM's lease payments to appellees had been made. He further stated that he did not hear from GM or any of its representatives until approximately a month after the LTAs had been signed. Haynes stated that he placed the funds in dispute in the court's registry pending the outcome of the litigation.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-20\">\n       In responding to appellees' motion for summary judgment, GM attached Haynes's affidavit (same as above), excerpts from depositions from Haynes and Morrand, and affidavits signed by Morrand and Philip Nichols. Haynes testified that Morrand had called him in March but that he had not returned his calls. He said that his understanding was that the closing would take place in the month of February but that he did not know when; therefore, he was paid for February's rent prior to executing the LTAs. He confirmed that he had been paid pursuant to the real-estate transaction on February 1 and that the buyer had taken possession of the property on February 1. Morrand testified that the dealership's assets were transferred to the buyer on February 1. In his affidavit, Morrand attested that the lease payments owed to appellees were due by the fifth day of each month. He disagreed with\n      appellees' contention that the transactions did not close on February 1, 2016, and he denied that appellees had any right to keep lease payments that were sent to them by mistake. Morrand stated that he would not have signed the LTAs had he known that he would have to make lease payments totaling $157,960.85 for property to which he had no access. Nichols attested that he is an attorney and represented GM with respect to its sale of assets and the termination of its leases. He stated that the initial drafts of the LTAs were prepared by the law firm representing the landlords.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-21\">\n       Appellees filed a reply to which they attached excerpts from the depositions of Haynes, Capron, and Morrand. Haynes testified that he understood that he was being paid rent for the month of February \"and that was that.\" Capron testified that GM had recurring monthly transfers to HCH and Sachs and that she had never questioned why they were sent separately. Morrand testified that GM's attorney had reviewed the dealership transactions and the LTAs and had ensured that they were appropriate for GM to sign but that Nichols did not draft them.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-22\">\n       The trial court granted summary judgment in part as to the claim for conversion, finding that the lease payments were due pursuant to the LTAs. The trial court granted summary judgment on GM's claim for unjust enrichment because it found that such claims have no application when a written agreement exists. The trial court dismissed all of GM's claims except breach of contract \"because an issue of fact remains concerning whether it is unconscionable to receive one month's rent to lease the premises for one day.\"\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-23\">\n       GM filed a motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment as it pertained to HCH and Sachs. The trial court granted GM's motion to reconsider and then granted summary judgment against GM on its claim for breach of contract because it found that the LTAs required GM to \"satisf[y] its obligations to pay Base Rent through the Termination Date\" and thus no contractual term had been violated by appellees. Also, the trial court found that the LTAs contained a release of liability; thus, after having made the full lease payments to appellees, GM signed the LTAs, which released appellees from any claims GM might have had against them, including a claim for breach of contract. GM filed this timely appeal.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-24\">\n       III.\n       <em>\n        Standard of Review\n       </em>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-25\">\n       Summary judgment is to be granted only when it is clear that there are no genuine issues of material fact to be litigated, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n       <em>\n        JMAC Farms, LLC v.

GM argues that it had two breach-of-contract claims in that (1) appellees breached the lease agreements when they refused to prorate February 2016's rent and (2) appellees breached the LTAs when they refused to release GM from its duties and obligations arising under the lease agreements after February 1, 2016.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-29\">\n       To the extent that GM argued a breach of the lease agreements below, GM did not obtain a ruling in this regard; therefore, we do not address it.\n       <em>\n        Cole v. Laws\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1513777\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/349/177/\">\n        349 Ark. 177\n       </extracted-citation>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1513777\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/349/177/\">\n        76 S.W.3d 878\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (2002). We agree, however, that in reviewing the breach-of-contract claim as it relates to the LTAs, we must look to the lease agreements for the meaning of base rent. The LTAs provide that terms not otherwise defined in the LTAs shall have the meaning assigned to them in the lease agreements. Additionally, the lease agreements were attached to the complaint(s) and made a part of the record considered in the summary-judgment proceeding.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-30\">\n       The LTAs provide that GM must have \"satisfied its obligations to pay Base Rent through the Termination Date.\" Under \"base rent\" in the lease agreements, \"rental for the first and last months hereof shall be prorated on a daily basis.\" GM argues that the release in the LTAs created an obligation on the part of appellees to release GM from its duty or obligation to pay rent from and after February 1, 2016. GM maintains that appellees breached the release provision by accepting $157,960.85 for rent for the entire month of February, as opposed to one day of February, given that the lease agreements provide that base rent for the last month shall be prorated on a daily basis. As per the LTAs, GM was required to pay base rent only through the termination date.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-31\">\n       The trial court further erred when it ruled that, as a matter of law, GM released appellees from any claims GM might have had against them, including breach of contract. The release in the LTAs only purported to release claims arising out of or in connection with the original lease agreements. Here, however, we have said that the only breach-of-contract claim that GM properly has before this court is one for breach of the LTAs. The LTAs, by their own language, provide that they represent the entire agreement between the parties and supersede any prior agreements, except to the extent they provide that undefined terms have the meaning given to them in the lease agreements. The LTAs were effectively new agreements requiring GM to satisfy its obligation to pay February 2016 base rent, which could only be determined by referring back to the lease agreements. It cannot be said that the release in the LTAs released appellees as a matter of law from a claim for breach of the LTAs themselves.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-32\">\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to GM as the party resisting the motion for summary judgment, we cannot say that appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. GM's interpretation of the LTAs is reasonable. Summary\n      judgment was improper under these circumstances.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-34\">\n       Conversion is a common-law tort action for the wrongful possession or disposition of another's property.\n       <em>\n        BBAS, Inc. v.
