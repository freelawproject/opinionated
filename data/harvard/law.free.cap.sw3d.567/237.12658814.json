The plea court suspended the execution of those sentences and placed Movant on probation for five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 29, 2016, a probation violation hearing was held. Movant's probation officer testified that since Movant was placed on probation, Movant had three law violations - shoplifted at Wal-Mart, convicted of forgery, and committed assault - and one citation for using marijuana. Finding\n   that Movant had violated the terms and conditions of his probation, the court revoked Movant's probation and ordered that his previously imposed sentences be executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On that same day, after Movant was transported back to the jail from court to await transportation to the Missouri Department of Corrections to begin serving his sentences, Movant escaped custody and fled. On September 30, 2016, the day after Movant's probation was revoked, a warrant was issued for Movant's arrest. On October 2, 2016, four days after Movant escaped, that warrant was served and Movant was recaptured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, Movant timely filed a pro se motion for post-conviction relief, which he timely amended with the assistance of appointed counsel. The motion court dismissed Movant's amended motion, finding that Movant was not entitled to postconviction relief because the \"escape rule applies in this case.\" In support of the escape rule, the motion court found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Movant's escape did adversely affect the criminal justice system. He obviously was selectively abiding by this Court's decisions, trying to determine of which laws to avail himself, law enforcement personnel had to expend countless unnecessary hours searching for Movant while he was out of custody on his escape, and he fractured the respect for the criminal justice system when he escaped, putting other jail staff as well as inmates in danger due to his careless and illegal actions. Movant is flouting the authority of the courts from which he is seeking relief; the escape rule prevents this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"We review the motion court's dismissal of a post-conviction relief motion only to determine whether the motion court's findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Patterson v.

The justifications for the escape rule include: (1) the need for a court to have control over a defendant before making a decision on appeal; (2) curtailment of administrative problems caused by the defendant's absence; (3) preventing prejudice to the State in the event of remand for a new trial; (4) preventing defendants from selectively abiding by court decisions; (5) discouraging escape; (6) encouraging voluntary surrender; (7) preserving respect for the criminal justice system; and (8) promoting the dignified operation of the appellate courts.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.

App. S.D. 1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Movant argues that because he only escaped from custody and was captured after four days, his escape could not have adversely affected the criminal justice system as Missouri courts have routinely applied the escape rule to escapes lasting longer than four days. However, Movant cites no authority for the proposition that the application of the escape rule is inappropriate following a brief escape.
