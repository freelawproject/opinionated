Respondent shall attend the Ethics and Professionalism Enhancement Program (EPEP).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The Office of Bar Counsel\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not challenge the finding of guilt, but instead argues that the waiver procedure the Board incorporated into its disciplinary recommendation is not a sanction permitted under the Supreme Court Rules, and further is not sufficiently clear to provide for proper enforcement because it does not include a time limitation for Butler to provide his supporting medical records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bar Counsel argues that the sanction is not permitted under SCR 3.380(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   , nor is it specific enough to provide for proper enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We agree that when the Board of Governors includes a filing requirement within its disciplinary recommendation it should, of course, include a time limit for filing the requested material. A fundamental element of due process is a notice requirement sufficient to inform the affected party of what he is required to do; a component of that is a specific date by which he must act to avoid further sanctions. In situations like this, the Board of Governors should include a filing deadline in its recommendation.\n   <em>\n    Department of Revenue, Finance and Admin. Cabinet v. Wade,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7116908\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/379/134/\">\n    379 S.W.3d 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 2012) (The essential requirements of due process are notice and an opportunity to respond).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   However, the issue is now moot. In the absence of a specific date, it is fundamental that a reasonable time period will be imputed as constituting the compliance deadline.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bond &amp; Mortg. Corp. v. Berry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8514590\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ky/249/610/\">\n    249 Ky. 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20S.W.2d%20293\">\n    61 S.W.2d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 1933) (Where agreement does not specify time within which promisor must comply with agreement, law implies reasonable time). But by any measure of \"reasonableness,\" Butler is in violation because he has yet to provide his medical records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case originated with a client complaint to which Butler failed to timely respond. The Inquiry Commission resolved the client complaint in Butler's favor but charged him with the failure to timely respond to the allegation. The failure to respond charge was resolved by the issuance of an Order of Private Admonition with Conditions in July 2016. Among the conditions was the requirement that Butler provide the medical records documenting the health issues that allegedly prevented\n   him from complying with the Bar Complaint response and to complete the Ethics and Professionalism Enhancement Program on April 21, 2017. Butler once again failed to respond so, the Inquiry Commission withdrew the Private Admonition and issued the present charge in February 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In summary, Butler was directed to provide the relevant medical records in July 2016. On March 23, 2018, the Board again issued its disciplinary recommendation requiring the filing of the medical records. Five more months have passed without compliance. We can only conclude that a reasonable time has passed for Butler to comply with the obligation to file his medical records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In light of Butler's failure to comply with the imposed conditions, and upon review of the record, we are persuaded that the 30-day suspension assessed in this case is reasonable and should be imposed. In reaching this conclusion, we note that Butler was also suspended from the practice of law for nonpayment of dues in January 2017.
