As to AEP, we reverse the trial court's order granting AEP's motions for traditional and no-evidence summary judgment with regard to Arredondo's claims for negligence, negligence per se, and gross negligence and remand the cause for further proceedings. As to Techserv, we affirm the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   AEP, an electric utility company, entered into a contract with T&amp;D whereby\n   T&amp;D agreed to provide \"all supervision, labor, equipment and specified materials necessary to perform underground distribution line construction and/or maintenance services (\"Construction Services\"), underground distribution line construction and/or maintenance bid projects (\"Project Services\") and storm restoration services (\"Storm Services\") to [AEP] on an as needed basis in AEP Texas service areas.\" These services included \"deteriorated pole replacements\" and \"overhead system maintenance and switching.\" AEP also entered into a contract with Techserv whereby Techserv agreed to provide \"all supervision, labor, and specified equipment and materials necessary to perform joint use engineering services to assess pole attachment construction proposal requests to attach equipment, wires, or other materials to [AEP's] poles submitted to [AEP] by third parties.\" Techserv's role was to inspect work performed by T&amp;D to ensure the work was completed according to AEP's specifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2013, AEP prepared and issued a work order to T&amp;D that included the removal of a utility pole\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   located on a municipal right of way easement\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on Arredondo's property, just outside Arredondo's fence. T&amp;D removed the pole, and T&amp;D marked the work order as completed on December 2, 2013. After T&amp;D employees removed the pole, they laid it on the ground alongside the fence. On July 30, 2014, approximately two weeks after the utility pole that had been removed by T&amp;D was picked up from the edge of Arredondo's property, Arredondo stepped into a hole where the utility pole had been located while mowing her lawn, causing her to fall and injure her knee and back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After she fell into the hole, Arredondo called AEP and informed it of the hole on her property where the utility pole had been located. AEP responded to the call by sending a service technician to investigate and take pictures of the hole, which was the size and diameter of a hole caused by the removal of a utility pole. Shortly after arriving at the property, the AEP service technician filled the hole with dirt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Arredondo sued AEP, T&amp;D, and Techserv, alleging they possessed the easement and created a defect on the easement when they removed the pole and failed to fill the hole or otherwise warn of its existence. Arredondo alleged AEP, T&amp;D, and Techserv were negligent, negligent per se, and grossly negligent. AEP, T&amp;D, and Techserv each filed motions for traditional and no-evidence summary judgment, which the trial court granted in separate orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We review a summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Travelers Ins.

T&amp;D's Motions for Summary Judgment and Arredondo's Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In its traditional motion for summary judgment, T&amp;D asserted that despite Arredondo's claims for negligence and negligence per se, Arredondo's allegations sound in premises liability, and the evidence conclusively shows T&amp;D did not have any actual or constructive knowledge of the hole on the property. T&amp;D also asserted that even if negligence is a viable cause of action in this case, the evidence conclusively shows T&amp;D did not have any legal duty to Arredondo. In its no-evidence motion for summary judgment, T&amp;D asserted Arredondo's claims all fail because Arredondo could not produce more than a scintilla of evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact as to essential elements of her claims. Specifically, T&amp;D asserted Arredondo had no evidence that T&amp;D knew or should have known of the hole on the property, that T&amp;D owed Arredondo a duty, that T&amp;D violated a statute, that T&amp;D's acts or omissions constituted an extreme risk of harm, or that T&amp;D had any actual, subjective awareness of the risk involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, as in the trial court, Arredondo contends the existence of genuine issues of material fact as to each challenged element of her claims preclude summary judgment. Arredondo argues she brought a viable negligence claim against T&amp;D, and that even if she did not, she nonetheless presented evidence raising a fact issue as to a premises liability claim. T&amp;D argues that Arredondo misunderstands the distinction between ordinary negligence and premises liability, and that Arredondo's claim sounds in premises liability, not ordinary negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In\n   <em>\n    Occidental\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court discussed the two negligence-based claims one could have against a property owner or possessor when injured on another's property:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Depending on the circumstances, a person injured on another's property may have either a negligence claim or a premises-liability claim against the property owner. When the injury is the result of a contemporaneous, negligent activity on the property, ordinary negligence\n   principles apply. When the injury is the result of the property's condition rather than an activity, premises-liability principles apply. Although premises liability is itself a branch of negligence law, it is a \"special form\" with different elements that define a property owner or occupant's duty with respect to those who enter the property. Under premises-liability principles, a property owner generally owes those invited onto the property a duty to make the premises safe or to warn of dangerous conditions as reasonably prudent under the circumstances. That duty generally runs with the ownership or control of the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6831175\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/478/640/#p644\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   However, liability for a premises condition may arise not only from ownership or control of the property, but also from one's role in creating the dangerous condition in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6831175\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/478/640/#p644\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6831175\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/478/640/#p644\">\n    at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In support of the objective element, Arredondo points to the deposition testimony of AEP employees Jose Ramirez, Daniel Garcia, and Roel Lopez. Ramirez, the service technician who responded to Arredondo's call reporting that she stepped into a hole on her property, testified utility workers and contractors have a duty to perform their jobs in a safe and reasonable manner because if they do not, there is an extreme risk of harm not only to the crew but to the general public. Ramirez testified he would never leave exposed a hole like the one Arredondo stepped in because it would be unsafe, and further affirmed that a person stepping into the hole is exactly the risk that an exposed hole poses. Ramirez further testified that, based on his years of experience, he had no explanation and could not think of any reason as to why the hole created by the removal of a utility pole was not filled in, and, based on his training and experience, considered it unacceptable for a utility worker to leave a hole like the one Arredondo stepped in without either filling it in or marking it before leaving the work site. Garcia testified that a professional utility contractor would know to fill a hole caused by the removal of a utility pole or otherwise make it safe, and that such a hole would be a fall hazard. Garcia further testified that due to the nature of utility work, there is a strong emphasis on safety to the general public because improperly performed work can be lethal. Garcia agreed that a utility contractor that performs its work in an unsafe manner creates an extreme risk to others. Lopez testified the expectation for a utility contractor when removing a utility pole is to either cover the hole caused by the pole's removal or warn of it-regardless of whether the contractor leaves the pole at the site. Lopez further testified that unsafe utility operations is very dangerous and can result in serious injuries, and that failing to provide for the safety of others on a job site is very dangerous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We acknowledge that the above testimony supports the notion that improperly performed utility work, as a general matter, can be very dangerous, can result in serious injuries or death, and can pose an extreme risk to others. This is because utility work involves a wide range of activities, including installing and maintaining electrical lines and, as here, performing underground distribution line construction. However, the testimony Arredondo points to does not state, specifically, that failing to fill in or warn of a hole caused by the removal of a utility pole from a residential yard poses an extreme risk of harm to others or can be lethal. Rather, the most that can be adduced from the above testimony is that failing to fill in or warn of a hole caused by the removal of a utility pole from a residential yard amounts to a fall hazard. However, the fact that conduct is unsafe, or even constitutes a \"serious safety hazard,\" does not necessarily establish that the conduct constitutes an extreme risk, i.e., a risk so great as to make it\n   highly probable that harm would follow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Dalhart v.

AEP's Motions for Summary Judgment and Arredondo's Contentions on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   AEP filed a traditional motion for summary judgment and a no-evidence motion for summary judgment. In its traditional motion for summary judgement, AEP asserted the evidence conclusively established it did not retain or exercise control over T&amp;D's work methods, and therefore AEP owed no legal duty to Arredondo. In its no-evidence motion for summary judgment, AEP asserted Arredondo could produce no evidence that (1) AEP owed a legal duty to Arredondo, (2) AEP breached any duty to Arredondo, or (3) Arredondo's injuries were proximately caused by any act or omission of AEP. In her response to AEP's motions for summary judgment, Arredondo argued AEP owed her a legal duty under three separate theories: (1) AEP owed a duty as an easement holder, (2) AEP had a contractual right to control T&amp;D's work, and (3) the utility work performed by T&amp;D was inherently dangerous. Arredondo further argued AEP breached its duty by allowing the hole to remain on the property and that the hole foreseeably caused her injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On appeal, Arredondo repeats the arguments made in her response to AEP's motions for summary judgment, contending AEP owed a legal duty as an easement holder, AEP owed a duty because it had a contractual right to control T&amp;D, and AEP owed a duty because the work T&amp;D performed was inherently dangerous. In response, AEP argues it did not have contractual control over T&amp;D and that removing a utility stub pole is not an inherently dangerous activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In support of her contention that AEP retained the right to control the work performed by T&amp;D, Arredondo points to the following pertinent contractual provisions in the contract between AEP and T&amp;D:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 Contractor [T&amp;D] shall have an authorized representative at the Site to whom Owner [AEP] may give instructions at all times when Work is being performed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \u2022 When work is performed on private property ...

Work performance on private property shall be done as expeditiously as possible and the premises restored immediately.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Although many of the contractual provisions cited by Arredondo do not relate to the specific condition or activity from which her injuries arose,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the provision requiring T&amp;D to \"have an authorized representative at the Site to whom [AEP] may give instructions at all times when Work is being performed\" essentially gave AEP the right and discretion to control the means, methods, and details of T&amp;D's work to the extent that T&amp;D was not entirely free to do its work in its own way. Moreover, the contractual provision that requires T&amp;D to restore the premises immediately after performing work on private property directly relates to the source of Arredondo's injuries: T&amp;D's alleged failure to fill in the hole caused by its removal of a utility pole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Victoria Elec. Co-op., Inc. v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9342695\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/100/323/#p327\">\n    100 S.W.3d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 327 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2002, pet. denied) (noting \"an employer is not liable for the negligence of an independent contractor unless the employer retains the right of control ... over the condition or activity that causes the injury\"). According to Arredondo's allegations, T&amp;D left the hole unfilled and therefore did not restore the premises immediately. Thus, AEP retained control over the method and means of T&amp;D's work as it related to removing the utility pole on Arredondo's property by specifically requiring that, when performing work on private property, the \"premises [be] restored immediately,\" and by requiring T&amp;D to have an authorized representative at the site to whom AEP could give instructions at all times while work was being performed. Accordingly, we conclude that as a matter of law, AEP had a duty arising from a contractual right to control the aspect of T&amp;D's work that allegedly caused Arredondo's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Because a fact issue exists as to whether the hole Arredondo stepped in was caused by T&amp;D's removal of a utility pole, a fact issue also exists as to whether the duty AEP owed pursuant to its contractual right of control gives rise to liability in this case. Because we conclude AEP owed a duty pursuant a contractual right of control, it is unnecessary for us to discuss Arredondo's arguments that AEP owed a duty as one with a right to control the premises or because the work performed by T&amp;D was inherently dangerous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Breach and Proximate Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In addition to asserting it owed no legal duty in its no-evidence motion for summary\n   judgment, AEP also asserted Arredondo could produce no evidence AEP breached any duty to Arredondo or that AEP's acts or omissions proximately caused Arredondo's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Arredondo attached to her response her own deposition testimony wherein she testified that utility workers removed the utility pole and laid it on the ground between her fence and the street, and that she later stepped in the hole where the pole had been while she was mowing the grass. Arredondo further testified she received several injuries from falling into the hole, including to her back and her left leg. Arredondo also presented the deposition testimony of Ramirez and Carrera. Ramirez testified the hole in Arredondo's yard looked like it was a hole caused by the removal of a utility pole and was located in the same location as the utility pole removed by T&amp;D. Ramirez also testified a hole caused by the removal of a utility pole should not be left exposed because it is unsafe. Carrera testified that to leave a hole caused by the removal of a utility pole without filling it in or warning of it would be a risk and hazard to anyone walking next to the street. Taking as true all evidence favorable to Arredondo and indulging every reasonable inference and resolving any doubts in Arredondo's favor, we conclude genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether AEP breached the duty it owed as T&amp;D's employer with a contractual right to control T&amp;P's work and whether this breach proximately caused her injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Accordingly, because Arredondo produced evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact as to each of the challenged elements in AEP's no-evidence motion for summary judgment, we conclude the trial court erred by granting Arredondo's no-evidence motion for summary judgment as to her claims for negligence and gross negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   AEP in its traditional motion for summary judgment argued the evidence established AEP did not retain a right to control T&amp;D's work and presented testimony from AEP and T&amp;D employees that no AEP employee was at the site when T&amp;D was doing work on the property, T&amp;D knew how to remove a utility pole and no one had to tell them how to do it, and it was the responsibility of the crew working the job to warn of a hole left on the property. However, as previously discussed, Arredondo presented evidence showing AEP retained a contractual right to control T&amp;D's work. Thus, we conclude the trial court erred by granting AEP's traditional motion for summary judgment. Moreover, because AEP in its motions for summary judgment did not challenge Arredondo's negligence per se claim and the summary judgment evidence does not conclusively defeat the claim or otherwise render it invalid, we conclude the trial court erred by granting summary judgment as to Arredondo's claim for negligence per se.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    G &amp; H Towing Co. v.

Techserv's Motions for Summary Judgment and Arredondo's Contentions on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In its traditional motion for summary judgment, Techserv asserted the evidence conclusively established it did not owe Arredondo a legal duty, and even if it did owe a legal duty, it did not breach any duty to Arredondo. In its no-evidence motion for summary judgment, Techserv asserted Arredondo could produce no evidence that Techserv owed a legal duty to Arredondo or that Techserv breached any duty to Arredondo. With regard to Arredondo's negligence per se claim, Techserv asserted there was no evidence it had violated a statute. With regard to Arredondo's gross negligence claim, Techserv asserted there was no evidence its acts or omissions constituted an extreme risk likely to lead to serious injury to others or that Techserv knew of any peril but demonstrated that it did not care. Techserv further asserted there was no evidence to support Arredondo's claim for exemplary damages because, in addition to there being no evidence to support gross negligence, there was no evidence Techserv's acts or omissions amounted to either fraud or malice. Arredondo filed a response to Techserv's motions for summary judgment. However, Arredondo did not request that her response be included in the clerk's record for this appeal. Included in the clerk's record is Arredondo's supplemental response to Techserv's motions for summary judgment. In the supplemental response, Arredondo presented the testimony of T&amp;D employee Robert Ramos and Techserv employee Richard Luna and asserted a genuine issue of material fact precluded summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   On appeal, Arredondo contends Techserv owed a legal and contractual duty to her, that Techserv breached its duty by failing to properly inspect the property where the pole was removed, and that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to her gross negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
