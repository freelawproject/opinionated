The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Mrs. Don Carlos's adopted daughter, Sheryl Firuccia (\"Firuccia\"), holding that Appellants' claims were barred by\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   based on a judgment entered in an earlier will contest that found Mrs. Don Carlos died intestate. This appeal follows. The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mrs. Don Carlos died in September 2009 and left behind an adopted daughter and several extended family members. In March 2010, the probate division issued letters to the public administrator to administer the estate intestate. The next week, the first publication of notice granting letters on the estate occurred. In the following months, family members presented to the probate division four last wills and testaments purportedly executed by Mrs. Don Carlos. These wills were dated in June 1991, April 2003, February 2007, and August 2007. Each will contained a provision disinheriting Mrs. Don Carlos's adopted daughter, Firuccia, and devised Mrs. Don Carlos's property to other extended family members. Those family members included nephew Donald Atkinson and his three sons, Russell Atkinson, Daniel Atkinson, and Bobby Atkinson (collectively \"the Atkinsons\"); nephew Lyle Quick, nephew Glen Riffle, and niece Lena Zvacek (collectively \"the Quicks\"); sister-in-law Mary Ella Anderson and her children, Richard Anderson and Debbie Anderson Kvasnicka (collectively \"the Andersons\"); and nephew Donald Riffle and niece Rosella Keck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The August 2007 Will was the first to be presented for probate, and it was admitted. The June 1991 Will was the next to be presented; it was rejected. Donald Riffle then filed a petition with the probate division requesting the August 2007 Will \"be declared revoked and the order admitting said purported will to probate be vacated\" and requesting the February 2007 Will be admitted to probate. Finally, Daniel Atkinson filed a petition requesting the April 2003 Will be admitted if the August 2007 Will was rejected. The probate division took no action regarding these petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Meanwhile, Firuccia and the Quicks filed separate petitions under section 473.083\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   with the circuit court contesting the validity\n   of the August 2007 Will and requesting a finding that Mrs. Don Carlos died intestate. The Atkinsons and the Andersons filed answers denying the invalidity of the August 2007 Will. The Andersons also filed a counterclaim/cross-claim requesting that the circuit court admit the previously rejected June 1991 Will or, alternatively, the April 2003 Will that was pending before the probate division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The circuit court determined that the challenge to the probate division's rejection of the June 1991 Will was untimely, rendering that rejection final. The parties then stipulated that the August 2007 Will was not \"the last will and testament of Mrs. Don Carlos.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response to the elimination of the June 1991 and August 2007 Wills, and there being no other wills before the circuit court, Firuccia moved for summary judgment on her claim that Mrs. Don Carlos died intestate. The Atkinsons opposed the motion, arguing the April 2003 and February 2007 Wills were still pending before the probate division creating a genuine issue of material fact on the question of whether Mrs. Don Carlos died intestate. The circuit court disagreed, noting that the issues presented in a will contest are framed by the petition and answer and that those wills had not been brought before the court in the will contest. The circuit court granted the motion and entered judgment finding that Mrs. Don Carlos died intestate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The circuit court's judgment was affirmed by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Quick v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176741,12176774\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/503/242/\">\n    503 S.W.3d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. W.D. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Subsequent Will Contest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following this Court's affirmance of the judgment finding that Mrs. Don Carlos died intestate, activity was re-initiated in the probate division regarding the April 2003 Will. The probate division found, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, that the April 2003 Will was destroyed at Mrs. Don Carlos's direction when she executed the February 2007 Will and that there was insufficient evidence that Mrs. Don Carlos lacked testamentary capacity or was susceptible to undue influence when she did so. As a result, the April 2003 Will was rejected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The next month, Appellants filed a new will contest in the circuit court challenging the probate division's rejection of the April 2003 Will. Firuccia (among others) answered, alleging as an affirmative defense that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   barred Appellants' claims. Firuccia moved for summary judgment arguing that Appellants were seeking a finding that Mrs. Don Carlos did not die intestate; that in the earlier will contest, Firuccia had sought a finding that Mrs. Don Carlos died intestate; that Appellants were parties to that earlier will contest; and that the earlier will contest resulted in a final judgment on the merits that Mrs. Don Carlos died intestate. Appellants replied, asserting that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   was inapplicable because this will contest concerned the validity of the timely presented April 2003 Will, a claim that had not been addressed in the earlier litigation. The circuit court denied the motion, finding that \"there [were] genuine issues of material fact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Firuccia filed a motion for reconsideration, reiterating that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   applied to \"every point properly belonging to the subject matter of the litigation and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.\" Appellants opposed the motion, arguing that the April 2003 Will could not\n   have been brought before the circuit court in the previous proceedings because, at the time, it had not yet been admitted or rejected by the probate division. The circuit court granted Firuccia's motion to reconsider and entered summary judgment against Appellants. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellants argue that the circuit court erred in granting Firuccia's motion for summary judgment.

Appellants, however, urge a more narrow approach, arguing that the first will contest only involved the validity of the June 1991 Will and August 2007 Will while the present contest involves the validity of the separate and distinct April 2003 Will. This effort to recast the initial will contest as simply an examination of two purported wills in a vacuum mischaracterizes the scope of that litigation and our holding in\n   <em>\n    Quick\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As discussed above, the first will contest specifically encompassed and, more importantly, resolved the claim that Mrs. Don Carlos died intestate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 473.083.7. Although Appellants now fervently argue the validity of the April 2003 Will, it is notable that they made no effort during the almost five-year pendency of the initial will contest to urge action by the probate division on that will or to otherwise bring that will before the circuit court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, their legal position then was that the August 2007 Will was the last will and testament of Mrs. Don Carlos but, if that will was deemed invalid, then the distribution of the estate should be governed by the February\n   1991 Will.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176741,12176774\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/503/242/\">\n    503 S.W.3d at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This strategy failed as those wills were deemed rejected or withdrawn by the parties, permitting the circuit court to adjudge that Mrs. Don Carlos died intestate as a matter of law - a judgment that was affirmed by this Court.

We are not persuaded to adopt this characterization. Acceptance of Appellants' view that the judgment of intestacy was simply a placeholder with no preclusive impact and subject to later revision would have rendered it, in effect, interlocutory and not a final judgment.
