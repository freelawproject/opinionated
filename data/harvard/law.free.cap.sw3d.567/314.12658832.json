Lee, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this interlocutory appeal, we address whether the attorney-client privilege protects communications between a corporation's legal counsel and a third-party nonemployee of the corporation. After acquiring four commercial properties, a corporation filed unlawful detainer actions against the properties' tenants. The tenants subpoenaed documents from a property management company hired by the corporation to manage its properties. The corporation and the property management company objected to producing documents containing communications between the corporation's legal counsel and the property management company, arguing that the attorney-client privilege protected the documents. The trial court held that the documents were protected because the attorney-client privilege extended to the property management company as an agent of the corporation. We hold that the attorney-client privilege applies to communications between an entity's legal counsel and a third-party nonemployee of the entity if the nonemployee is the functional equivalent of the entity's employee and when the communications relate to the subject matter of legal counsel's representation of the entity and the communications were made with the intention that they would be kept confidential. Applying this framework, we hold that the property management company was the functional equivalent of an employee of the corporation, that the communications related to the subject matter of counsel's representation of the corporation, and that the communications were made with the intention that they would be kept confidential. We affirm the ruling of the trial court and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Dialysis Clinic, Inc. (Dialysis Clinic) owned and operated dialysis centers. In addition, Dialysis Clinic owned and leased various commercial properties to third parties. Dialysis Clinic did not have in-house knowledge about or experience in the management of commercial rental properties. For that reason, Dialysis Clinic had a property management agreement with XMi Commercial Real Estate (XMi) to manage several of Dialysis Clinic's commercial properties. Under the property management agreement, XMi acted as Dialysis Clinic's agent on an exclusive basis to manage and operate properties. XMi's scope of work under the agreement included negotiating lease renewals and amendments; collecting rents and dues; canceling or terminating leases upon Dialysis Clinic's direction; and instituting, prosecuting, and defending actions involving the leases and properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   XMi handled all day-to-day operations and tenant relations and regularly communicated with Dialysis Clinic about those matters. XMi also communicated with Dialysis Clinic's in-house and outside counsel about the properties because, in XMi's role as property manager, it had information about the properties that Dialysis Clinic did not have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In July 2012, Dialysis Clinic acquired four commercial properties on Church Street in Nashville. The properties were occupied by Canvas Lounge, LLC; 3 Entertainment Group, LLC d/b/a WKND; and OutCentral, Inc. under a series of leases and sub-leases, the complicated history of which is immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October 2014, Dialysis Clinic filed unlawful detainer actions in the Davidson County General Sessions Court against Kevin Medley, individually; Kevin Medley, LLC; Canvas Lounge, LLC; 3 Entertainment Group, LLC; and OutCentral, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On motion of Kevin Medley, individually; Kevin Medley, LLC; Canvas Lounge, LLC; and 3 Entertainment Group, LLC (the Defendants), the General Sessions Court consolidated the cases and removed them to Davidson County Circuit Court (the trial court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the cases were removed to the trial court, the Defendants served a subpoena on XMi, a nonparty to the detainer action, for production of documents related to the Church Street properties. XMi withheld a number of documents from production based on the attorney-client privilege. Those documents included emails between XMi and Dialysis Clinic's in-house and outside counsel. Dialysis Clinic contends that these emails are protected by the attorney-client privilege based on the agency relationship between Dialysis Clinic and XMi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After an evidentiary hearing and in-camera review of the disputed documents, the trial court ruled that the attorney-client privilege applied to XMi's communications with Dialysis Clinic's attorneys and that XMi had properly withheld emails containing those communications from its document production. The trial court granted the Defendants' motion for an interlocutory appeal under Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 9. The Court of Appeals denied the Defendants' application. The Defendants then filed an application under Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 11 for review by this Court, which we granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This Court's review on interlocutory appeal is limited to the issue certified to it by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Wallis v.

Here, the certified issue is whether the trial court extended the attorney-client privilege beyond what Tennessee law allows by finding that XMi properly withheld certain documents from production based on attorney-client privilege because of its agency relationship with Dialysis Clinic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We review a trial court's rulings on the application of the attorney-client privilege under an abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    Boyd v.

Mass. Apr. 12, 2012) (holding that a real estate broker was not the functional equivalent of an employee because the broker's agreement contemplated that she could represent a prospective tenant while also serving as the company's real estate agent-thus defeating any assumption that she was to be a confidential representative of the company-and she had no expertise in regulatory approval and therefore would have had\n   no need to communicate with the company's attorney on that issue).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After surveying the case law from other jurisdictions, we conclude that the functional equivalent analysis is a sound approach. We have synthesized the approach taken by courts in other jurisdictions to formulate the appropriate analysis for Tennessee courts to apply when determining, under the totality of the circumstances, whether a third-party nonemployee is the functional equivalent of an entity's employee whose communications with the entity's attorneys are protected by the attorney-client privilege. As a result, under this analysis, a court may find that a third-party nonemployee is the functional equivalent of an employee after considering the following non-exclusive factors: whether the nonemployee performs a specific role on behalf of the entity; whether the nonemployee acts as a representative of the entity in interactions with other people or other entities; whether, as a result of performing its role, the nonemployee possesses information no one else has; whether the nonemployee is authorized by the entity to communicate with its attorneys on matters within the nonemployee's scope of work to facilitate the attorney's representation of the entity; and whether the nonemployee's communications with the entity's attorneys are treated as confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   If a court determines that the nonemployee's communications qualify for the attorney-client privilege because the nonemployee is the functional equivalent of an employee, then the court should use the standard already in place in Tennessee to determine whether the privilege attaches. Thus, on a case-by-case, communication-by-communication basis, the court should determine whether the communication involves the subject matter of counsel's representation of the entity and whether the communication was made with the intent that the communication be kept confidential.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Flowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8446785\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/209/602/#p615\">\n    209 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   616 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9995005\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/848/72/#p80\">\n    848 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   80 );\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9306356\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/88/203/#p211\">\n    88 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   213 (citing\n   <em>\n    Burke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20277999\">\n    1997 WL 277999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 ;\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9995005\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/848/72/#p80\">\n    848 S.W.2d at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the application of the privilege to any given communication is \"necessarily question, topic and case specific\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Applying this analysis to the facts before us, we find that the attorney-client privilege applies to communications between Dialysis Clinic's legal counsel and XMi. The witness testimony shows that Dialysis Clinic hired XMi as its agent because of XMi's experience in property management, which Dialysis Clinic did not have in-house, and that XMi had primary responsibility for the day-to-day management of Dialysis Clinic's properties in Nashville. Dialysis Clinic's in-house counsel testified that during the purchase of the properties, it became apparent that Dialysis Clinic was stepping into unfamiliar territory and needed a professional hand to help guide and advise Dialysis Clinic and to run the properties on a day-to-day basis. Likewise, the testimony shows that there was a close working relationship between XMi and Dialysis Clinic on matters related to this litigation as well as other legal matters such as lease negotiation and drafting. Finally, numerous witnesses testified that because XMi managed the properties on a day-to-day basis and was the entity that interacted directly with the tenants, XMi had information about\n   the properties that no one at Dialysis Clinic had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Thus, under the criteria set forth above, we hold that XMi is the functional equivalent of an employee of Dialysis Clinic. There is no reason to distinguish XMi's role from that of a Dialysis Clinic employee, and XMi's involvement in the management of the Church Street properties makes it precisely the sort of entity with which Dialysis Clinic's attorneys would like to communicate because XMi possesses information that the attorneys need and that Dialysis Clinic does not have. XMi's duties also include potentially serving as trial witnesses, collecting information to prosecute claims related to the properties, and lease negotiations-all essential to both in-house and outside counsel in their representation of Dialysis Clinic. For that reason, Dialysis Clinic \"could justifiably rely upon confidentiality in consultations [between XMi and] its own lawyer[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Krystal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204673616\">\n    2018 WL 4673616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We now turn to the second prong of the analysis-whether the communications related to the subject matter of legal counsel's representation of Dialysis Clinic and whether counsel made the communications with the intention that the communications be kept confidential. We presume that communications with an attorney are made for the sake of legal advice,\n   <em>\n    Bieter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531841\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/16/929/#p938\">\n    16 F.3d at 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the witness testimony shows that the communications involving XMi and counsel for Dialysis Clinic were made for the purpose of seeking legal advice on issues involving the properties, which were the subject matter of the attorneys' representation. Dialysis Clinic's general counsel testified that XMi communicated with Dialysis Clinic's outside counsel at his direction because XMi had much of the information outside counsel needed at different times on lease transactional matters as well as litigation matters, including this lawsuit. In addition, Dialysis Clinic's general counsel testified he needed XMi's expertise about what to do with matters related to the leases on a day-to-day basis, which he, as a health care regulatory attorney, did not have. Outside counsel for Dialysis Clinic explained that they needed to communicate with XMi because XMi handled the day-to-day management of the Church Street properties and had information that the attorneys needed to fully advise Dialysis Clinic and represent Dialysis Clinic in litigation and other matters related to the properties. Current and former property managers at XMi stated that they communicated with counsel for Dialysis Clinic to provide information needed by the attorneys in their representation of Dialysis Clinic for investigation and assessment of legal matters. Finally, both in-house and outside counsel, and the employees of Dialysis Clinic and XMi who communicated with them, testified that they understood and intended for their communications to be confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Under the functional equivalent test that we have now adopted, we find that XMi operated as the \"property management department\" of Dialysis Clinic and as such was the functional equivalent of an employee of Dialysis Clinic. In addition, communications between XMi and legal counsel for Dialysis Clinic related to the subject matter of counsel's representation of Dialysis Clinic and were made with the intention that the communications would be kept confidential. For that reason, we hold that the trial court did not extend the attorney-client privilege beyond what is allowed under Tennessee law and properly ruled that XMi did not have to produce certain documents because of\n   its agency relationship with Dialysis Clinic. We affirm the ruling of the trial court and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
