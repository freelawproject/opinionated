Bernard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Appellant\u2019s point that the verdict was against the evidence\u2014 that is, that the findings of fact which the jury must have made are not supported by the evidence \u2014 is not tenable. There was considerable evidence on all contested questions of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Appellant contends, also, that admitting all the facts as claimed by the prosecution, such facts do not constitute larceny; and that therefore the verdict is against law. And these facts, which the jury had the right to find, were substantially as follows: The appellant, together with said Furlong and one Lewandowsky, by false representations as to their property, financial ability, future intentions, etc., induced said Bernard to sell and deliver to them the property alleged to have been stolen. Bernard delivered the property to them at a place on the corner of Folsom and Twenty-third streets, in San Francisco, where they proposed to open and conduct a saloon and fruit store, and took from two of them a promissory note due in thirty days; but the understanding was that the property in the goods was to remain in Bernard until the note was paid. A couple of weeks afterwards, but before the maturity of the note, Bernard, hearing that there was some trouble at the place above named, went there and found the saloon closed and the property gone. Procuring a search-warrant, he went to appellant\u2019s residence and found some of the property secreted there/\u2014appellant having denied that he had it. There were other circumstances in proof not necessary to state here, \u2014 from all of which the jury might have found a felonious intent on the part of appellant and his associates from the beginning of the transaction. The contention of appellant, however, is, that as the possession of the goods was obtained by appellant and his associates under the contract, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>with the consent of their owner, and as a <em>special property </em>in them also passed, therefore there could not have been that felonious taking which is necessary to constitute larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Larceny, under the present provisions of the Penal Code, \u2014 so far, at least, as they are applicable to this case, \u2014 is substantially the same as at common law. We have examined a great many adjudicated cases, both English and American, where the question was, What is a sufficient \u201c taking \u201d within the definition of the crime of larceny? At first it was, no doubt, the rule that the element of trespass was a necessary ingredient of the crime; and that when the possession of the thing charged to have been stolen had been originally obtained by the consent of the owner, there could be no larceny. It was soon held, however, that there might be larceny where there had been in fact a delivery by the owner, but where there had been no change of property, nor of legal possession, and where there was a mere temporary custody given for a special purpose, or where the possession had been obtained fraudulently with a felonious intent. (2 Bussell on Crimes, 8th Am. ed., 21 et seq.) The most difficult phases of the question arise where a defendant charged with larceny has by false and fraudulent pretenses obtained possession of the property under the guise of a purchase and sale. It is clear that in such a case, where there has been a change both of the legal possession and the entire property of the owner in the thing delivered, there can be no larceny; otherwise where there has been a change of possession, but <em>no change </em>of property. Some doubt has been entertained, however, on the question whether or not there could be larceny where there had been a change of possession without a change of the general title, but accompanied by the creation of some sort of trust or special right in the fraudulent buyer; but with respect to that question the law is undoubtedly settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>to be that if there was a felonious intent to steal at the time possession of the goods was obtained, then there was a sufficient \u201c taking \u201d to constitute larceny. As early as the time when East\u2019s Pleas of the Crown was written, the learned author of that treatise, after an exhaustive review of the cases decided down to that date, declared the rule to be as follows: \u201c 1. That where, notwithstanding a delivery by the owner in fact, the legal possession remains exclusively in him, larceny may be committed exactly the same as if no delivery had been made; 2. That where, by the delivery, a special property, and consequently a legal possession, apart from any felonious intent, would be transferred, there, if it be found that such delivery were fraudulently procured with a felonious intent to convert the property so acquired, then, also, the taking amounts to larceny.\u201d (2 East\u2019s Pleas of the Crown, 682.) The rule thus stated was clearly the law established by the adjudicated cases reported at that time; it has not been changed, but has been recognized by subsequent cases, down to the present time, and is to-day a part of the English and American common law. The principal case noticed by text-writers as indicating a different rule is <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>State, </em>1 Port. 118; but an examination of that case will show that the <em>syllabus, </em>which does indicate a different rule, is not justified, either by the facts of the case or the text of the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The rule as above stated no doubt gives a somewhat dangerous power to a jury. As was said by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the secret intention of a defendant, and the time when that intention was formed in his mind, \u2014 whether before or after he obtained the property, \u2014 are matters about which a jury in many cases can have no certain knowledge; and their power in times of excitement might be arbitrarily exercised to satisfy their own prejudices or public expectation. <em>(Lewer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>15 Serg. &amp; R. 99.) On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>other hand, Judge Cowen regretted that the rule had not been applied to cases where the absolute title to the property passed. <em>(Ross </em>v. <em>People, </em>5 Hill, 294.) At all events, we must declare the law as we find it; and if change be desirable, the change must be made by the legislature. The general authorities on the question are too numerous to cite here. Most of them are referred to in the first pages of the second volume of Russell on Crimes, 8th Am. ed., and in East\u2019s Pleas of the Crown, under the head of \u201cLarceny and Robbery.\u201d A case precisely like the one at bar has not arisen in this state to our knowledge; but this court has recognized the rule as above stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>16 Cal. 370; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jersey, </em>18 Cal. 338; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>23 Cal. 280; and in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The point made by appellant that the goods found on his premises did not amount to more than fifty dollars, and that therefore he was not guilty of grand larceny, cannot be successfully maintained. If he was guilty of larceny at all, it was because he, with his alleged confederates in the first instance, feloniously obtained the goods from Bernard, and the goods thus obtained amounted in value to over fifty dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">We have discussed the foregoing questions because they will necessarily arise if the case be tried again; for the judgment must clearly be reversed, because the instructions to the jury were erroneous in one important and material matter. The charge of the court followed the rule hereinbefore stated with one marked exception: it did not include the element of <em>felonious intent. </em>The court, referring to the specific features of the case as presented by the evidence, told the jury several times, and in various forms of language (substantially), that if appellant, or those whom he aided and abetted, obtained possession of the goods by false representations, and the title did not pass, and that at the time possession was so obtained the party obtaining possession of the goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>intended to convert them to his own use, and did so convert them, then appellant was guilty of larceny. But nowhere in the instructions on that point were the jury told that the appellant at the time possession of the goods was obtained must have had a \u201cfelonious intent\u201d; nor was any language used which was the equivalent of felonious intent, or which conveyed the idea of <em>stealing. Of </em>course the intent to convert the property to his own use, in a certain sense, and perhaps in a popular sense as understood by the jury, is present with the buyer at every sale, \u2014 whether the sale be honest or fraudulent. But every fraudulent purchaser of property who intends to convert it to his own use is not guilty of larceny. It would hardly be contended that an insolvent merchant could be convicted of that crime, because he bought goods on credit, when he knew that he could not and would not pay for them. Persons frequently gain advantages over others in trades by false representations, without having that felonious intent to steal which actuates thieves when they commit genuine larcenies. In a case, therefore, like the one at bar, when the charge sought to be proven was in the nature of a <em>constructive </em>larceny, and where a jury might have confused mere moral delinquency with crime, it was material to the appellant\u2019s rights to have the jury instructed that the felonious intent must have existed at the time possession of the goods was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">For this reason, the judgment must he reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Judgment is reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b416-7\">Temple, J., Paterson, J., and Searls, 0.

The foregoing opinion drawn up by McFarland, J., as to the charge to the jury by the trial court, directly conflicts with <em>People </em>v. <em>Smallman, </em>55 Cal. 185, where the point passed on in this case is distinctly made, considered, and decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">The obtaining possession of personal property by artifice or fraud, where title does not pass to the taker, with an intent at the time of the taking to convert it to the taker\u2019s use, and the subsequent conversion of it to his use by the taker, is a felonious taking, and is larceny. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smallman, supra; United States </em>v. <em>Durkee, </em>1 McAll. 193-206.) I am of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
