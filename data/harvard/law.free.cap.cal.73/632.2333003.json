There is nothing in it which goes to show that in enacting and enforcing it the city authorities of Eureka exceeded their powers granted by that section of the constitution. The mere fact that the defendant was required to pay a license tax of fifty dollars per quarter, or two hundred dollars per year, does not demonstrate it. It does not otherwise appear but what that amount was necessary in order properly to regulate the business of liquor-selling, by confining it, perchance, to fewer and more responsible persons, or in some other way tending to the preservation and enforcement of good order and the general welfare of the inhabitants of that city.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Nor is there anything in the ordinance which is oppressive or unreasonable toward or prohibitory of the business of retailing spirituous liquors. <em>(Ex parte Wolters, 65 </em>Cal. 270; <em>In re Guerrero, </em>69 Cal. 88-95, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The writ should be dismissed, and the petitioner remanded to the custody of the sheriff.</p>\n<judges id=\"b666-6\">Belcher, C.
