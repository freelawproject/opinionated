Kister, Clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">\"Indorsed: Ordinance No. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">\u201c Filed and recorded in liber B, page 2, April 7, 1887.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">\u201cO. H. Kister, Clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">It is objected by petitioner that Ordinance No. 18 is void because not passed at a regular meeting of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">It appears that the board met on the sixth day of July, 1886, pursuant to its ordinance fixing the terms thereof, in accordance with the act of March 14, 1883, known as the \u201c County Government Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">Not having finished the business pending before it, the board \u201c took a recess \u201d from time to time, up to \u00bfnd including July 19th, on which last day the ordinance in question was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">The board had power to adjourn from day to day or from time to time until its business was completed. <em>(Ex parte Benninger, </em>64 Cal. 291; <em>Ex parte Benjamin, </em>65 Cal. 310.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">The fact that in adjourning from time to time the clerk used the term \u201crecess\u201d instead of \u201cadjourn,\u201d we deem unimportant. The object of an adjournment to a given time, and of a record thereof, is to give to persons having business before the board notice of the time when they may have a hearing, as well as to retain the power of the board to act during the remainder of the term by showing that jurisdiction so to do is still claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-17\">These objects are as well attained by the announcement that the board takes a recess until a specified hour or day, as by the use of the term \u201c adjourn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Nor do we think there was any irregularity in the proceedings of the board, in the fact that when it took a recess from say July 10th to July 19th, as a board of supervisors, and in the <em>interim </em>acted as a board of equalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">By the complaint defendant is charged with having committed a misdemeanor in the county of Mono between June 25,1887, and July 8,1887, by willfully being engaged in and carrying on the business of grazing, herding, and pasturing sheep in said county without taking out or providing a license therefor, in violation of ordinances of the board of supervisors of said county, known as \u201cOrdinance No. 18 \u201d and \u201c Ordinance No. 21,\u201d specifying the dates of passage and the substance of their provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">This was sufficient to give the court jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and upon the proceedings had in the cause, to authorize the entry of judgment as rendered against defendant, unless such ordinances are void.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">A writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>cannot be made the vehicle of determining mere errors, where a conviction has been had and the commitment thereon is in due form. If the court below had no jurisdiction of the offense charged, or if it affirmatively appears by the record that the prisoner was tried and sentenced for the commission of an act which, under the law, constitutes no crime, the judgment is void and the prisoner should be discharged. <em>(Ex parte Kearny, </em>55 Cal. 214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The further contention of petitioner may be summarized as follows: \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Ordinances 18 and 21 are void because unreasonable, unjust, oppressive, partial, discriminating, unfair, special, in contravention of the general policy of state legislation, and violative of article 1, section 21, of the constitution of the state of California, and of the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Sections 11 and 12 of article 11 of our state constitution provides as follows: \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u201c Sec. 11. Any county, city, town, or township may make and enforce within its limits all such local, police, sanitary, and other regulations as are not in conflict with general laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u201c Sec. 12. The legislature shall have no power to impose taxes upon counties, cities, towns, or other public or municipal corporations, or upon the inhabitants or property thereof, for county, city, town, or other municipal purposes; but may, by general laws, vest in the corporate authorities thereof the power to asses? and collect taxes for such purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>60 Cal. 153, this court had occasion to pass upon section 12 of the present constitution, and in referring to taxes imposed for county purposes, used these words: \u201cThe power to impose such taxes for such purposes, in our opinion, no longer remains with the legislature; but the constitution expressly gives it the power, by general laws, to vest in the corporate authorities of the counties, cities, towns, or other public municipal corporations the power to assess and collect taxes for those purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\u201c The taking of the power to impose such taxes from the legislature, and vesting it in the local authorities, is but another of the many evidences to be found in the new constitution of the intention to bring matters of a local concern home to the people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">This decision was rendered in March, 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">The county government act, above referred to, was enacted in March, 1883. Subdivision 27 of section 25 of said act, defining powers and duties of supervisors, reads as follows: \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">\u201c To license, for purposes of regulation and revenue, all and every kind of business not prohibited by law, and transacted or carried on in such county, and all shows, exhibitions, and lawful games carried on therein; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>to fix the rates of license tax upon the same, and to provide for the collection of the same by suit or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">In view of the judicial interpretation given to similar legislation by this court, and by the tribunals of sister states, we are unable to see wherein the ordinances under review are subject to the criticism of being unjust, excessive, oppressive, discriminating, special, unequal, and partial.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Ordinance No. 18 is general, in the sense that it applies alike to every person engaged in the business of raising, grazing, herding, or pasturing sheep in the county of Mono; and the rate of the license is left entirely to the discretion and judgment of the board of supervisors. Upon this subject, Judge Cooley says: \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\u201c A license tax cannot be deemed unequal because reaching one occupation only, if it is to reach all who follow that. Let it reach all of a class, either of persons or things, it matters not whether those included in it be one or many, or whether they reside in any particular locality or are scattered all over the state.\u201d (Cooley on Taxation, 128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\u201c If a revenue authority is what seems to be conferred, the extent of the tax, when not limited by the grant itself, must be understood to be left to the judgment and discretion of the municipal government, to be determined in the usual mode in which its legislative authority is exercised; but the grant of authority to impose fees for the purpose of revenue would not warrant their being made so heavy as to be prohibitory, thereby defeating the purpose.\u201d (Cooley on Taxation, 408.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">In the case of <em>Ex parte Frank, </em>52 Cal. 610, this court, referring to similar objections, which were made to an ordinance, said: \u201c But an ordinance will not be pronounced invalid by the courts on either of these grounds, unless in a plain case\u201d; and adopted the rule applicable to this class of cases as stated in <em>St Louis </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>44 Mo. 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>In the case of <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>4 McAr. 250, the same objections to a similar ordinance were discussed by the court. In that case, the defendant was prosecuted for selling as a produce dealer in the Washington Market without obtaining a license, as required by an ordinance of the District of Columbia. In passing upon the objections that the ordinance was unequal, unjust, discriminating, and unreasonable, the court said: \u201c It is not for the court to decide whether the act is wise, or whether the members of the court would have voted for it. The discretion on the subject has been committed to the district government. When power is given to a municipality to pass laws necessary or proper to carry the power into effect, the degree of their necessity or propriety should not be minutely scrutinized.\u201d <em>(Glenn </em>v. <em>Mayor of Baltimore, </em>5 Gill &amp; J. 424.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Also: <em>\u201c </em>But by unreasonableness the courts do not simply mean that the tax must not be larger than the judges think was wise. It would be presumed to be reasonable if laid by an authority endowed with discretion on the subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u201c The objection that the license is in restraint of trade cannot avail when the power to impose it is granted.\u201d In this case the court refer to the <em>Railroad Cases, </em>92 U. S. 612, and quote from the decision therein as follows:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u201c Perfect equality and perfect uniformity of taxation, as regards individuals and corporations, or the different classes of property subject to taxation, is a dream unrealized. It may be admitted that the system that most nearly attains this is best; but the most complete system that can be devised must be imperfect.\u201d <em>(County of Amador </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>70 Cal. 458.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">We do not deem it necessary to discuss the question as to whether the license in question is imposed for revenue purposes or for the purposes of regulation, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>reason that the board possessed authority to impose it for either or for both. <em>(Ex parte Mount, </em>66 Cal. 448.)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Herding and grazing stock is or may be a business; and it is upon such <em>business </em>that the license is imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">That the property used in any particular calling is subject to and has paid a property tax, <em>ad valorem, </em>as in this case, does not interdict the right to impose a license upon the business in which such property is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The constitutional provision in relation to uniformity of taxation does not apply to prevent such license tax for such reasons. <em>(St. Louis </em>v. <em>Green, </em>6 Mo. App. 590; Cooley on Taxation, 389, 390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We do not find that any other or greater burden is imposed upon the defendant by the ordinances in question than are imposed upon all others similarly situated, and fail to see wherein there is any violation of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States, or of section 21 of article 1 of our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The case of <em>Lassen County </em>v. <em>Cone, </em>72 Cal. 387, is clearly distinguishable from the case at bar. There, the ordinance sought to discriminate against non-residents of Lassen County, and therein was unequal, and violative alike of the state and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Upon the whole case as presented by the record, we are of opinion that the writ should be dismissed, and the prisoner remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b407-10\">Thornton, J., Temple, J., Paterson, J., McFarland, J., and McKinstry, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
