Moreover, before orphans\u2019 courts may exercise jurisdiction, \u201cthe facts necessary to clothe them with jurisdiction must affirmatively appear upon the face of their proceedings.\u201d <em>Talbot Packing Corp., </em>172 Md. at 369, 190 A. at 837. <em>See also Zulver Realty Co. v.

Measley, </em>139 Md. 598, 602, 115 A. 855, 856 (1921), citing and quoting <em>MacGill v. Hyatt, </em>80 Md. 253, 256, 30 A. 710, 711 (1894). As stated in <em>Pole v. Simmons, </em>45 Md. 246, 249-50 (1876):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">The Code [1860], Art. 93, sec. 230[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] [the predecessor of \u00a7 2-102], confers full power on the Orphans\u2019 Court to take probate of wills, grant letters testamentary and of administration, direct the conduct and settling of the accounts of executors and administrators, superintend the distribution of the estates of intestates, secure the rights of orphans and legatees, and to administer justice in all matters relative to the affairs of deceased persons. Under this section, we think it clear the Orphans\u2019 Court had jurisdiction of the matter presented by the petition, for it would be impossible to superintend and make distribution of the estate without the authority to determine what was to be distributed; and this necessarily involves the questions as to what are assets, and, when there is a will, who are the legatees, and what is given to them by the will. Having jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the controversy, the Orphans\u2019 Court has the right to hear and receive evidence in relation to it; and, if the evidence consists of written instruments, to examine and construe them, in order that it may properly apply it to the case before it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A89\">The rationale for permitting the orphans\u2019 court to exercise broad authority within the area of its express jurisdiction was explained in <em>Hagerstown Trust Co., Ex. of Mealey, </em>119 Md. 224, 232-33, 86 A. 982, 985 (App.1913):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">[T]he Orphans\u2019 Court is for most purposes the proper forum in which to settle the estate of a deceased person, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>and to say generally that it possesses no power to construe wills, would be to deny to it the power to approve an account of an executor by which payments of legacies were made, and force the estate of every person who was so unfortunate as to leave a will to the double expense of administration in the Orphans\u2019 Court, and then being taken into an Equity Court for a construction of a will and a payment of the legacies contained therein----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-5\"><em>See also Clarke, </em>291 Md. at 295, 435 A.2d at 418; <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>278 Md. 534, 537, 365 A.2d 1004, 1006-07 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">It is well settled that an orphans\u2019 court has jurisdiction to conduct judicial probate, \u00a7 2-102, which involves the appointment of a personal representative. \u00a7 5-401. Moreover, it is empowered fully to administer the estates of deceased persons. <em>Clarke, </em>291 Md. at 293, 435 A.2d at 417; <em>Wingert v. State, </em>125 Md. 536, 541, 94 A. 166, 167 (1915). <em>See Shapiro v. Ryan, </em>233 Md. 82, 87, 195 A.2d 596, 598-99 (1963). Also, such courts must entertain petitions of interested persons and resolve their questions concerning an estate or its administration. \u00a7 2-102(c). In that regard, the courts are empowered to pass orders relating to the settlement and distributions of the estate, <em>see Goldsborough v. DeWitt, </em>169 Md. at 473-74, 182 A. at 329, to determine the next of kin, <em>Longerbeam v. Iser, </em>159 Md. 244, 247, 150 A. 793, 794 (1930); <em>McComas v. Wiley, </em>132 Md. 406, 410, 104 A. 52, 53 (1918); <em>Belt v. Blackburn, </em>28 Md. 227, 243 (1868); <em>Blackburn v.

Ely, </em>157 Md. 100, 106, 145 A. 361, 363 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Also included within the court\u2019s jurisdiction is the power to resolve questions of ademption of legacy, advancement, and what constitutes the assets of the estate, <em>Pole, </em>45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Md. at 249; <em>Wilson v. McCarty, </em>55 Md. 277, 280 (1881); <em>Gallagher v.

Hagaman, </em>36 Md. 511, 517 (1872). Furthermore, orphans\u2019 courts are \u201cprimarily entrusted with the administration of decedents\u2019 estates and, thus, as a general rule the \u2018estates of deceased persons should ordinarily be administered and finally distributed in the [Orphans\u2019 courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clarke, </em>291 Md. at 293, 435 A.2d at 417, quoting <em>Knox v. Stamper, </em>186 Md. 238, 245, 46 A.2d 361, 365 (1946). <em>See also Carrier, </em>316 Md. at 724, 561 A.2d at 240, citing <em>Hagerstown Trust Co., Ex. of Mealey, </em>119 Md. at 232-33, 86 A. at 982; <em>Longerbeam, </em>159 Md. at 247, 150 A. at 794, and <em>Estate of Childs v. Hoagland, </em>181 Md. 550, 551-52, 30 A.2d 766, 767 (1943), noting the circumstances under which an orphans\u2019 court has been permitted to construe a will incidental to the performance of its legislatively prescribed function.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court, as is the case of the limitations on it, is rather more easily stated than applied. Much confusion surrounds the question of when that court may construe a written instrument, including a will. Indeed, on this point, there appear to be two, seemingly conflicting, lines of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">On the theory that it was acting simply incidentally to its express jurisdiction, orphans\u2019 courts have been permitted to construe wills and other written documents. <em>See Carrier, </em>316 Md. at 721-25, 561 A.2d at 238-40 (codicil); <em>Phillips v. Heilengenstadt, </em>173 Md. 290, 294-95, 195 A. 394, 395 (1937) (will); <em>Longerbeam, </em>159 Md. at 246-47, 150 A. at 794 (will); <em>Housman, </em>139 Md. at 601, 115 A. at 856 (settlement agreement); <em>Hagerstown Trust Co. Ex. of Mealey, </em>119 Md. at 232-33, 86 A. at 985 (will); <em>Pole, </em>45 Md. at 249-50 (a paper executed by the decedent giving her heirs certain sums of money, a release executed in her favor, and a will). In <em>Hokamp, </em>36 Md. at 517 (interpreting decree of circuit court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>agreement of counsel filed in another court and in different case); <em>Blackburn v. Craufurd, </em>22 Md. at 466 (interpreting statute), and <em>Michael v. Baker, </em>12 Md. 158, 169 (1858) (interpreting pre-nuptial agreement), the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s power to construe the written documents was not questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In other cases, stressing its limited jurisdiction, we have circumscribed an orphans\u2019 court\u2019s powers with regard to certain written documents. <em>See Jackson v. Jackson, </em>260 Md. 138, 141, 271 A.2d 690, 692 (1970) (will); <em>Myers v. Hart, </em>248 Md. 443, 448, 237 A.2d 41, 45 (1968) (same); <em>Crandall, </em>218 Md. at 600, 147 A.2d at 755 (release); <em>Tribull v. Tribull, </em>208 Md. 490, 503, 119 A.2d 399, 406 (1955) (validity of transfer of bank accounts); <em>Inasmuch Mission v. Merc. Trust Company, </em>184 Md. 231, 234, 40 A.2d 506, 508 (1945) (will); <em>Hagerstown Trust Co., Ex. of Mealey, </em>119 Md. at 235, 86 A. at 986 (trust); <em>Jones, Adm\u2019r v. Harbaugh, </em>93 Md. 269, 282, 48 A. 827, 832 (1901) (release); <em>Potts v. Potts, </em>88 Md. 640, 641, 42 A. 214, 215 (1898) (same); <em>Shafer v. Shafer, </em>85 Md. 554, 561, 37 A. 167, 169 (1897) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">It has been suggested that the line of cases typified by <em>Jones, Adm</em>'r <em>v. Harbaugh, Shafer, Crandall, </em>and <em>Tribull, </em>is irreconcilable with that typified by <em>Baker, Pole, </em>and <em>Housman. </em>This suggestion is not borne out when the cases are closely scrutinized or because the analysis employed in several of the cases, when discussing the jurisdictional issue, is no longer viable. In seeking to reconcile the cases, we first determine the end to which an orphans\u2019 court\u2019s jurisdiction is being invoked and the relationship the written document bears to the exercise of that jurisdiction. In other words, the relevant questions are: is the issue before the court one within its express powers and, if so, would construction of the subject document be incidental to the exercise of that power? <em>See Carrier, </em>316 Md. at 724-25, 561 A.2d at 239-240; <em>Jackson, </em>260 Md. at 142, 271 A.2d at 692. Another relevant consideration is whether the party seeking to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction is an interested party as defined in \u00a7 l-101(g). Once the issue before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>court and the power of the court to resolve it have been determined, the rationale underlying the cases becomes clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\"><em>Housman, Pole </em>and <em>Baker </em>illustrate when an orphans\u2019 court may construe written documents; they represent cases in which an orphans\u2019 court, in the exercise of its express powers to resolve issues properly before it, incidentally interpreted the subject agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">In <em>Housman, </em>the appellee, the daughter of the testatrix, entered into a settlement agreement with her cousins, the appellants, by the terms of which she agreed that, in addition to what she was left in the will, her share of the estate would be what the appellants paid her pursuant to the agreement. She later filed a caveat to her mother\u2019s will and the appellants responded with a petition which, citing the settlement agreement, alleged that she did not have any interest in the estate. The appellee argued that, because it would have \u201cto enforce a contract [the settlement agreement] or give efficacy thereto,\u201d 139 Md. at 601, 115 A. at 856, the orphans\u2019 court did not have jurisdiction over the case. The appeal from the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s refusal to receive the petition raised a single question: \u201cwhether or not it was the duty of the orphans\u2019 court to decide as a preliminary question the right of appellee to caveat the will and have issues sent to the circuit court, before sending such issues to that court for trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rejecting the jurisdictional argument, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">What the court was asked to do was to determine whether appellee has such an interest in the estate disposed of by the will as to entitle her to have issues tried as to the validity of the will; and in this were involved the questions as to the validity and effect of the agreement set out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-8\"><em>Id. </em>This Court cited <em>Pole </em>and <em>Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company, Excr. v. Devilbiss, </em>128 Md. 182, 97 A. 367 (1916) to support its holding that an orphans\u2019 court, under the circumstances, could construe the settlement agreement. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>latter ease stands for the proposition that an orphans\u2019 court has the power to determine, as a preliminary matter, whether a person challenging a will has the right to file a caveat. 128 Md. at 187, 97 A. at 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">In <em>Pole, </em>the decedent executed a paper \u201cby which she gave to her children therein named, the sums of money there mentioned for the purpose of putting them upon an equality with [one of them, a] Mrs. Worthington.\u201d 45 Md. at 247-48. Her sons, at the same time, \u201cexecuted a release to her of their claim to a certain proportion of purchase money of lands in which they had an interest, and which she had sold and received the proceeds of the sale.\u201d 45 Md. at 248. Thereafter, she advanced money to several of her children and made a will. By the terms of the will, the children to whom advancements were made were charged interest so as to equalize the sums given to each child. Following the decedent\u2019s death, one of the daughters filed a petition asking the orphans\u2019 court to open and restate an account to include the sums she claimed were advances as part of the assets of the estate. The appellees denied that the orphans\u2019 court had jurisdiction because, to determine the question presented by the petition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">\u201cit had to construe the language and legal effect of the paper executed by Mrs. Simmons on the 3rd of March, 1866, as well as the release of the same date executed by her sons, also Mrs. Simmons\u2019 will, and from them to decide what is an advancement; whether the sums of money given by the Exhibit No. 3, were advancements or absolute gifts, and whether in any event, they were assets of Mrs. Simmons\u2019 estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">45 Md. at 249. Rejecting that argument, we reversed the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s dismissal of the petition, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">[W]e think it clear the Orphans\u2019 Court had jurisdiction of the matter presented by the petition, for it would be impossible to superintend and make distribution of the estate without the authority to determine what was to be distributed; and this necessarily involves the questions as to what are assets, and when there is a will, who are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>legatees, and what is given to them by the will. Having jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the controversy, the Orphans\u2019 Court has the right to hear and receive evidence in relation to it; and if the evidence consists of written instruments, to examine and construe them, in order that it may properly apply it to the case before it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">45 Md. at 249-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">At issue in <em>Baker </em>was whether a paper purporting to be the last will of the decedent, a married woman, should be submitted to probate. That paper had not been \u201cmade and attested in conformity with\u201d state law governing married women\u2019s disposition of property by will; however, the decedent and her husband had entered into an antenuptial agreement, which by its terms, empowered her to make a will. 12 Md. at 168. The appellee, the decedent\u2019s daughter, offered the paper and antenuptial agreement for probate. The decedent\u2019s husband, the appellant, filed a caveat to the will, contending that it was not executed with his permission or in conformity with state law. This Court affirmed the judgment of the orphans\u2019 court admitting the paper to probate. Although observing that \u201cthe extent to which the powers vested in [a married woman] under the agreement, may have been executed by her will\u201d is among the questions that \u201cbelong properly to the courts of law and equity, which are vested with ample jurisdiction to hear and determine them,\u201d 12 Md. at 169, we noted (at 169-70):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">In this case the ante-nuptial agreement, which was produced before the Orphans\u2019 Court, the execution of which was admitted, abundantly showed that Mrs. Michael was empowered to make a will notwithstanding her coverture. Besides it appears from the agreement, that she was entitled to receive and hold absolutely to her sole and separate use, free from the marital rights of the husband, certain funds specified in the agreement. Under her will, such funds would pass, although the power of disposing of them may not be expressly conferred upon her by the agreement____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The agreement also shows, that Mrs. Michael had a power to dispose, by will, of certain real estate therein mentioned. Whether the will is a sufficient execution of that power, is not a question which the Orphans\u2019 Court was called upon to decide. The form and attestation of the will are sufficient to pass such real estate, provided it is to be construed as an execution of the power. Without expressing any opinion on that question, we think the Orphans\u2019 Court decided correctly, in admitting the will to probate, as a valid testamentary paper, to pass real and personal estate; but they were not required to decide what extent of property would pass under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><em>Jones, Adm\u2019r v. Harbaugh </em>is not to the contrary. There, an orphans\u2019 court granted letters of administration to the appellant, the coroner, who was not related to the decedent. The appellee, the decedent\u2019s brother, did not challenge the appointment. Instead, he executed a release in connection with a partial accounting of the assets of the estate, which was approved by the orphans\u2019 court. Sometime later, the appellee filed a petition in the orphans\u2019 court, alleging that his attorneys and the appellant had conspired to defraud him and requesting, among other relief, the appellant\u2019s removal as administrator. The appellant appealed his removal and this Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">While stating that an orphans\u2019 court did not have the power to set aside the release signed by the appellee, 93 Md. at 282, 48 A. at 832, the Court nevertheless noted that an orphans\u2019 court\u2019s jurisdiction over estates of deceased persons, and, in particular, its responsibility for superintending their distribution, required it, under some circumstances, to make inquiries in connection with releases. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">Under the construction placed on it by this Court in <em>Carey v. Reed, </em>82 Md. 38[3, 33 A. 633 (1896)], if the administrator had been guilty of taking part in the fraud charged by the appellee against his attorneys, or had <em>fraudulently </em>withheld from him money to which he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>entitled, that section [Art. 93, \u00a7 230<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ], it may be conceded, is broad enough to confer jurisdiction on the Orphans\u2019 Court. For although it has not the power to set aside the release executed by the appellee, as that is vested in Courts of equity, <em>[Shafer v. Shafer, </em>85 Md. 554, 37 A. 167 (1897)], yet if the administrator had <em>fraudulently </em>obtained that release and refused to pay the money distributed to the appellee, it would have been such conduct as would have authorized the Orphans\u2019 Court to remove the administrator from the further administration of the estate. There is a wide difference between setting aside a release, so that it can no longer be a bar to recovery of the amount affected by it, and inquiring into alleged fraud connected with it, so that the fraud, if proven, may be used to show that the party guilty of it is not a suitable person to be continued as administrator. If the administrator had imposed on the appellee and obtained the release by fraud, the Orphans\u2019 Court would not be so helpless in its supervision over one of its appointees, as to be precluded from such inquiries for the purpose of determining whether he should be permitted to continue in his position, (emphasis in original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The express powers implicated in <em>Jones, Adm\u2019r v. Harbaugh </em>were those enabling the court to \u201csuperintend the distribution of the estate of intestates, secure the rights of orphans and legatees, and to administer justice in all matters relative to the affairs of a deceased persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Determining the validity <em>vel non </em>of a release is not directly or explicitly connected with the exercise of those powers. But examining the facts surrounding a release\u2019s execution to determine whether it was fraudulently obtained or the distribution to a legatee fraudulently withheld is, however. Consequently, we acknowledged that an orphans\u2019 court could properly decide the issue presented, notwithstanding that deciding the issue may have had implications as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>validity <em>vel non </em>of the release, an issue it ordinarily may not decide. We held the proof insufficient to prove fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\"><em>Shafer, </em>the case upon which the <em>Harbaugh </em>court relied for the proposition that the power to set aside releases is vested in the equity courts, and <em>Crandall, </em>which also relied on <em>Shafer, </em>are somewhat different. The executor in <em>Shafer </em>passed, and settled, his first account, which was approved by the orphans\u2019 court. Thereafter, certain of the distributees of the estate, whose receipt of their shares was reflected in that account and evidenced by releases they had signed, petitioned the court to correct errors they alleged in the account. The petition did not allege that the releases had been acquired by fraud. After pleadings had been filed and testimony taken, the court rescinded its order insofar as it approved the executor\u2019s claim for services rendered the testator in his lifetime and a sum paid for professional services rendered in settlement of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">On appeal, this Court observed, as to an essential element of the distributees\u2019 contention, that it had \u201cfound no satisfactory legal proof which sustains the allegations of the petition____ [TJhere is a total absence of any proof which legally tends to show that any item of the administration account was unjust, false, or fraudulent or improperly allowed.\u201d 85 Md. at 558, 37 A. at 168. Noting the \u201cspecial limited jurisdiction\u201d of orphans\u2019 courts and the necessity that the facts upon which it is based must \u201caffirmatively appear on the face of their proceedings,\u201d not simply inferred or presumed, <em>id., </em>we acknowledged that the correctness of an executor\u2019s account is a question for such courts. 85 Md. at 559, 37 A. at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">Addressing the legal effect of the releases and their relationship to the question before the orphans\u2019 court, the Court recognized that the releases, which referred specifically to the first account and \u201crelease[d], exonerate[d], acquitted] and forever discharged the executor] from all claim or demand whatsoever on account of said settlement as aforesaid, either in law or equity,\u201d 85 Md. at 560, 37 A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>at 169, \u201care absolute and operate as estoppels <em>in pais.\u201d </em>85 Md. at 561, 37 A. at 169. We then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-4\">\u201cThe Court below had no jurisdiction to inquire into their consideration, nor to pass upon or determine their validity. That duty belongs to another jurisdiction, and was no part of the jurisdiction which the Court below sought to exercise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In <em>Crandall, </em>the question presented was whether the orphans\u2019 court had jurisdiction to determine the validity of the release the decedent\u2019s widow gave the executor of the estate and the residuary beneficiaries under the decedent\u2019s will. The widow signed the release after the decedent\u2019s death and, later, filed an election to take her statutory share. When the executor filed an account as if the election had not been made, the widow \u201cfiled a petition in the Orphans\u2019 Court in which she alleged the invalidity of the release that she had given the executor and the residuary legatees.\u201d 218 Md. at 599-600,147 A.2d at 755. It was upon this factual pattern that we said, reversing the orphans\u2019 court, that it \u201ccannot, under pretext of incidental or constructive authority, exercise jurisdiction not expressly conferred by law.\u201d 218 Md. at 600, 147 A.2d at 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In both <em>Shafer </em>and <em>Crandall, </em>separate and apart from the construction of the releases, the issue before the orphans\u2019 court was within that court\u2019s express power: in <em>Shafer, </em>it was the accuracy of the executor\u2019s account, while in <em>Crandall, </em>it was the entitlement of the widow to share in her deceased husband\u2019s estate. Moreover, in each case, construction of the release was related, even if not directly so, to resolution of that issue. Indeed, in each case construction of the release was arguably but an incident of the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s exercise of power expressly given it. Nevertheless, this Court held in each case that the orphans\u2019 court had no \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to construe the release, meaning, apparently, that it had no \u201cpower\u201d to do so. For the reasons that will appear in part C., <em>infra, </em>the <em>Shafer </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number><em>Crandall </em>analysis pertaining to an orphans\u2019 court\u2019s power to construe releases, in particular, and other written documents, in general, is expressly disapproved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The issue in <em>Tribull </em>was \u201cwhether a legatee may sue in equity to enforce a claim on behalf of the estate or may only take proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court to require the executor to sue.\u201d 208 Md. at 493, 119 A.2d at 401. At the center of the controversy, however, was, rather than construction of a written instrument, the validity of a transfer of title to a bank account, effected shortly before her death, from the sole name of the decedent to a trust account with one of her sons. The appellant sued his brother in the circuit court, asking that court to set aside the transfer of title to the bank account. This Court recognized that \u201cadministration of a decedent\u2019s estate is committed to the Orphans\u2019 Court.\u201d 208 Md. at 499, 119 A.2d at 404. It also reiterated the power of that court to superintend the executor of such estates. 208 Md. at 500, 119 A.2d at 404. The Court noted, on the other hand, that, because the orphans\u2019 court is not empowered to try \u201ca question of title as between an administrator and a separate [non-interested] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>claimant,\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>id., </em>119 A.2d at 405, citing <em>Talbot Packing Co. v. Wheatley, </em>172 Md. at 369-70, 190 A. at 835, the only remedy it could have given, had the case been filed initially in the orphans\u2019 court, would have been to direct the executor to bring suit. 208 Md. at 503, 119 A.2d at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">We therefore reiterate: whether the orphans\u2019 court has the power to construe a written document, be it a release, a will, or another instrument, <em>is </em>dependent on what the party is asking the court to do and whether, when the court construes that document, it does so consistent with, and in furtherance of, an express grant of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Even after the jurisdictional issue has been resolved, the answer to the first two certified questions still may not be obvious. In <em>Clarke, </em>while generally recognizing the power of the orphans\u2019 court to construe wills incidental to administration and final distribution of a decedent\u2019s estate, we also acknowledged that there are instances in which construction of a will more appropriately should be done by the circuit court. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-8\">Turning to the matter of will construction, there are circumstances when equity should exercise jurisdiction. If a substantial issue as to the meaning of a will exists, involving ambiguous or intricate provisions, construction of the will is generally for the equity court and beyond the authority of the orphans\u2019 court. As Judge Delaplaine said for the Court in <em>Inasmuch Mission v. Merc. Tr. Co., supra, </em>184 Md. at 234 [, 40 A.2d at 508]: \u201cThe jurisdiction of equity in the construction of wills ... arises from the difficulty of understanding the meaning of complicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>provisions in a will, or the uncertainty as to the rights and interests of the parties claiming under them.\u201d <em>See Jackson v. Jackson, supra, </em>260 Md. at 141 [, 271 A.2d at 692]; <em>Legge v. Canty </em>[, 176 Md. 283, 286, 4 A.2d 465, 467 (1939)]; 1 P. Sykes, <em>Probate Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 271 (1956).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-4\">However, it is settled that some issues of construction are for the orphans\u2019 court. Where the language of the will is such \u201cas to permit no reasonable doubt of its meaning ...[,] a court of equity will refuse to construe it,\u201d and construction is for the orphans\u2019 court. <em>Legge v. Canty, supra, </em>176 Md. at 286[, 4 A.2d at 466].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">291 Md. at 294, 435 A.2d at 418. In that case, the decedent\u2019s will provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">In the Name of God, Amen I, Helen Marie Clarke being of sound and disposing mind and memory, and considering the uncertainty of this life, do make, publish and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, as follows: First, after my lawful debts are paid, I give George Francis Clarke the authority to be the administrator of my entire estate, I give Ignatius Benedict Clarke and Catherine Mae Clarke, permission to farm the land for a period of five (5) years, if they so desire. At the end of that time if my sons and daughters so desire, the farm is to be sold and the money equally divided among the surviving sons and daughters of my marriage to Joseph George Clarke. If any of my children want to buy the farm, they will have the right to do so at not more than Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000) per acre.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 290, 435 A.2d at 416. The orphans\u2019 court had ordered the decedent\u2019s property sold by public or private sale to pay her debts and administration expenses and denied the petitioner\u2019s motion to cancel that sale and, instead, allow him to purchase the property at the $2,000.00 per acre price. This prompted the petitioner to file an action in the circuit court to enjoin the public sale and to have the court construe his mother\u2019s will. We expressed the view that, were construction of the provisions necessary, it \u201cprobably [would] be for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the equity court under our decisions____\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 291 Md. at 295, 435 A.2d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Application of the <em>Clarke </em>complexity test does not resolve whether, when the circuit court exercises jurisdiction in a complicated construction matter, the orphans\u2019 court is divested of jurisdiction or is simply precluded from acting by virtue of the superior jurisdiction of the circuit court. Stated differently, does the determination that a construction matter is \u201ccomplicated\u201d affect the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s <em>power </em>to resolve the issue or merely the <em>propriety </em>of its doing so? This issue was not directly addressed by <em>Clarke. </em>Nevertheless, we think it clear both from the circumstances and a fair reading of <em>Clarke, </em>that it affects only the propriety of the orphans\u2019 court acting.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">When jurisdiction in a sense other than fundamental is involved, the issue is \u201cthe propriety of granting the relief sought,\u201d <em>Moore v. McAllister, </em>216 Md. 497, 507, 141 A.2d 176, 182 (1958), quoting <em>1 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence </em>(5th ed. 1941), \u00a7\u00a7 129-31, an issue that \u201cmerges into the final [judgment] and cannot therefore be successfully assailed for that reason once enrolled.\u201d <em>First Federated Com. Tr. v. Commissioner, </em>272 Md. 329, 334, 322 A.2d 539, 543 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Whether a court has fundamental jurisdiction, <em>i.e., </em>the power, to decide a matter, must be determined by looking to \u201cthe applicable constitutional and statutory pronouncements,\u201d <em>First Federated Com. Tr., </em>272 Md. at 335, 322 A.2d at 543, because fundamental jurisdiction involves the power, or authority, of a court to render a valid final judgment. <em>Stewart v. State, </em>287 Md. 524, 526, 413 A.2d 1337, 1338 (1980). It is a court\u2019s \u201cpower to act with regard to a subject matter ... \u2018conferred by the sovereign authority which organizes the court, and is to be sought for in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>general nature of its powers, or in authorities specially conferred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pulley v. State, </em>287 Md. 406, 416, 412 A.2d 1244, 1249 (1980), quoting <em>Cooper v. Reynolds\u2019 Lessee, </em>77 U.S. (10 Wall), 308, 316, 19 L.Ed. 931 (1870). <em>See First Federated Com. Tr., </em>272 Md. at 335, 322 A.2d at 543 (\u201cIf by that law which defines the authority of the court, a judicial body is given the power to render a judgment over that class of cases within which a particular one falls, then its action cannot be assailed for want of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>Medical Examiners v. Steward, </em>207 Md. 108, 111, 113 A.2d 426, 427 (1955) (Fundamental jurisdiction exists when the court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties.); <em>Moore v. McAllister, </em>216 Md. at 507-08, 141 A.2d at 182 (\u201c[Jjurisdiction over the person and the subject matter goes to the very basic <em>power </em>of the equity court.\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">An orphans\u2019 court has express power to conduct judicial probate, to direct the conduct of personal representatives and to pass orders incidental thereto. It also has jurisdiction over interested persons and creditors, who invoke the court\u2019s power to determine issues within its express powers. There is no dispute, <em>see e.g., Clarke, </em>an orphans\u2019 court, incidental to these powers, may have to interpret written documents. It is not, however, the fact that it interprets a particular document that determines whether it has fundamental jurisdiction; rather, it is the issue upon which the interpretation of the document bears that has that effect; that which is incidental does not divest the court of jurisdiction. Accordingly, once it is determined that the subject matter, incident to which a document must be construed, is within the jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court, that court is empowered to interpret that written document. Simply because an equity court may deem the document to be sufficiently ambiguous or complex to require it to exercise jurisdiction affects only the propriety of the orphans\u2019 court acting, not its jurisdiction, <em>i.e., </em>its power to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Jurisdiction, in its fundamental sense, may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, even at the appellate. level. <em>See Berlinsky v. Eisenberg, </em>190 Md. 636, 640, 59 A.2d 327, 328 (1948); <em>Webb v. Oxley, </em>226 Md. 339, 343-44, 173 A.2d 358, 360 (1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>369 U.S. 803, 82 S.Ct. 642, 7 L.Ed.2d 550 (1962). Therefore, because the issue whether the orphans\u2019 court should construe an ambiguous and complex instrument goes not to that court\u2019s power to act with regard to a decedent\u2019s estate, generally it is waived and ordinarily cannot be raised thereafter on appeal, unless it is raised in that court. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Appellee Cynthia Kaouris married Nikolaos D. Kaouris, the decedent, in 1983. Approximately 16 months before their separation in November, 1988, while both were represented by counsel, they entered into a marital settlement agreement. That agreement, <em>inter alia, </em>provided that: (1) \u201cThe parties have agreed to separate and to live separate and apart without any cohabitation, and they have so lived continuously since the date of this agreement first above written.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; (2) they would have joint custody of the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>born to the marriage; (3) the decedent would pay appellee $100.00 per week child support, $50.00 per week alimony, and provide health insurance coverage for the minor child; and (4) the parties would transfer certain personal and real property between themselves. The agreement also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">14. Except as otherwise provided herein, each party hereby waives, releases and relinquishes unto the other all rights or claims of dower, curtesy, descent, inheritance, distribution and all other rights or claims growing out of said marriage between them and each shall be forever barred from any and all right in the estate of the other, whether real, personal or mixed and whether now or hereafter acquired, and each will, upon request of the other party, execute good and sufficient release of dower or curtesy to the other spouse, her or his heirs, assigns or personal representatives or will join with the spouse or her or his assigns in executing any deed to any real property now or hereafter acquired or owned by the other spouse, all at the expense of the spouse so requesting. This paragraph includes, but is not limited to, rights and claims under the Property Disposition Act, section 8-201 et. seq., Family Law Art., Ann.Code of Maryland, and all amendments thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The decedent died, leaving a will appointing appellant, Yasilios D. Kaouris, personal representative of his estate. Appellee did not contest his appointment; rather, she filed a claim for a family allowance<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and an election to take her intestate share.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant opposed both claims, raising, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>by way of defense, the marital settlement agreement and, in particular, appellee\u2019s waiver of rights in the decedent\u2019s estate. Relying on \u00a7 3-205,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> he argued that, by executing the marital separation agreement, appellee forfeited her right to take an elective share. Following an evidentiary hearing, the orphans\u2019 court ruled against appellant as to the surviving spouse\u2019s allowance; it did not decide the propriety of appellee\u2019s spousal election. Appellant appealed directly to the Court of Special Appeals, pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-501 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Inasmuch as the parties had never been divorced, at issue before the orphans\u2019 court was whether, by virtue of her execution of the marital property agreement, appellee had waived her right to the spousal allowance and/or elective share. It was for that purpose\u2014its bearing on the answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>to that question\u2014that appellant offered the marital property agreement in the orphans\u2019 court. That court determined, presumably after it, construing the agreement, concluded that the provisions of the agreement were interrelated,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that the agreement was void because appellee and the decedent had never separated as the agreement contemplated. The question presented, therefore, is whether the orphans\u2019 court had the power to construe the agreement? Necessarily involved in this determination is appellee\u2019s entitlement, notwithstanding her execution of the marital settlement agreement, to receive a share of her husband\u2019s estate, an issue clearly within the jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court. <em>See Hokamp v. Hagaman, </em>36 Md. at 518. Appellant does not contend that construction of the agreement is irrelevant and immaterial to the court\u2019s decision on this point; rather, he argues that, due to the complexity involved in the construction of the agreement, the circuit court is the appropriate court to construe it.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">We hold that where it is incident to the fulfillment of the court\u2019s jurisdiction\u2014in this case, the determination of the appellee\u2019s interest in the subject estate\u2014the orphans\u2019 court may construe a marital settlement agreement, for the purpose of deciding whether the agreement is valid or void, including determining whether the parties have actually separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">As previously noted, the critical focus is on the court\u2019s power to act, which, in turn, depends upon the relief being sought. Here, appellee asked the court to grant her the marital allowance and her elective share, matters within the express powers of the orphans\u2019 court. But whether the relief should be granted depends upon how the court construes the agreement\u2014whether the court decides that it is valid. Construction of the agreement is merely incidental to the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over, and rendition of a judgment as to appellee\u2019s entitlement to share in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>estate, the issue before it. The court acted within its power in construing the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">As we have seen, appeals from the judgment of an orphans\u2019 court may go directly to the Court of Special Appeals. Courts Article, \u00a7 12-501. The judgment may also be appealed to the circuit court, in which event, the appeal is heard <em>de novo. </em>Courts Article, \u00a7 12-502. That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">(a) <em>In general; exception in Harford and Montgomery </em>counties.\u2014(1) Instead of a direct appeal to the Court of Special Appeals pursuant to \u00a7 12-501 of this subtitle, a party may appeal to the circuit court for the county from a final judgment of an orphans\u2019 court. The appeal shall be heard de novo by the circuit court. The de novo appeal shall be treated as if it were a new proceeding and as if there had never been, a prior hearing or judgment by the orphans court. The circuit court shall give judgment according to the equity of the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Thus, by its express terms, \u00a7 12-502 contemplates that, when a case has been appealed from an orphans\u2019 court to the circuit court, the Court of Special Appeals will review the judgment of the circuit court, and not that of the orphans\u2019 court.\u2019 <em>See also Rome v. Lowenthal, </em>290 Md. 33, 42, 428 A.2d 75, 80 (1981) (\u201cIn a proceeding such as this a circuit court ... is not engaged in appellate review of whether the orphans\u2019 court made the proper determination upon the basis of what was before it, but is expected to make its own determination on the evidence brought before it.\u201d); <em>Soothcage v. King, </em>227 Md. 142, 152, 176 A.2d 221, 227 (1961) (\u201cThis means that the Circuit Court is to consider the evidence adduced before it and that the case goes on and is decided as if no judgment had been rendered.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"ApT\">The <em>King </em>court further elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\">We think that in giving judgment \u201caccording to the equity of the case,\u201d the Circuit Court may enter any judgment which the Orphans\u2019 Court might properly have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>entered on the same evidence; and we deem it pertinent, therefore, to consider the powers of the Orphans\u2019 Court with regard to these last two questions [under review].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar3\">227 Md. at 153, 176 A.2d at 227. We find this significant because it suggests that, notwithstanding the proceedings are appellate in nature, the circuit court, although expected to make its own determination, is limited to those that could properly have been made by the orphans\u2019 court; the circuit court does not exercise <em>its </em>plenary jurisdiction over the matter. Consequently, we hold that a circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an orphans\u2019 court <em>de novo </em>depends upon whether the orphans\u2019 court had jurisdiction over the case in the first place.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Whether, in cases that have been appealed first to a circuit court, the Court of Special Appeals should entertain a motion questioning the jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court, or should raise the issue on its own motion, is dependent upon whether it is the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s fundamental jurisdiction that is being questioned.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As we have already discussed, see part 1,C., <em>supra, </em>only the power of a court to act can be challenged at any stage of the proceedings. A party is foreclosed from challenging, for the first time on appeal, the propriety of the exercise by a court of its power to act. Where, however, the appeal is from an orphans\u2019 court to a circuit court, pursuant to Courts Article \u00a7 12-502, the exercise of that orphans\u2019 court\u2019s power may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>be challenged in the circuit court even though the issue was not raised in the orphans\u2019 court. This is so because the matter is heard <em>de novo. </em>On the other hand, if the challenge is to the power of an orphans\u2019 court to decide an issue, it may be raised for the first time in the circuit court, or, for that matter, at any point in the litigation process prior to its termination. For the latter challenge to be successful, it must appear that the issue decided by the orphans\u2019 court was neither within its express grant of power nor incidental thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the interpretation of the marital separation agreement was incidental to the court\u2019s exercise of an express power; hence, the issues raised by the Court of Special Appeals on its own motion affect the propriety of the court\u2019s ruling, not its power to have made it.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">CERTIFIED QUESTIONS ANSWERED AS HEREIN SET FORTH; CASE REMANDED TO COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. COSTS TO ABIDE THE RESULT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-11\">. The certification order addressed two appeals, one of which has since been dismissed. By Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, filed October 30, 1991, counsel informed the Court that the case of <em>Catherine Ann Ardakani </em>v. <em>Haidi Saidfar </em>has been settled and, thus, the Court dismissed that appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-14\">. Unless otherwise indicated, all references are to the Estates &amp; Trusts Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\">. That section provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The court shall have full power to take probate of wills, grant letters testamentary and of administration; direct the conduct and settling of the accounts of executors and administrators, superintend the distribution of the estates of intestates, secure the rights of orphans and legatees, and to administer justice in all matters relative to the affairs of deceased persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b760-6\">. <em>See </em>note 3 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\">. It is at least plausible that <em>Shafer v. Shafer, </em>85 Md. 554, 37 A. 167 (1897) and <em>Crandall v. Crandall, 218 </em>Md. 598, 147 A.2d 754 (1959) may be distinguished on another basis. Because the basis for jurisdiction must \u201caffirmatively appear on the face of the proceedings,\u201d <em>Shafer, </em>85 Md. at 558, 37 A. at 168, and not inferred or presumed, the manner in which the construction issue is raised is critical. Thus, in <em>Shafer, </em>it is arguable that because petitioners failed to allege and prove that they had been fraudulently induced to give the executor the releases, the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction had to be inferred or presumed. Similarly, in <em>Crandall, </em>validity of the release was raised in the context of a challenge to the executor\u2019s statement of account. Notwithstanding the previous filing in the court, by the widow, of an election to take her intestate share, an orphans\u2019 court\u2019s superintendence of an executor and the accounts he or she may pass does not permit it, as an incidental matter, to interpret releases when there is no explicit connection between the validity of the release and the executor\u2019s acts in administration of the estate. In other words, in order to reach the result it did, the orphans\u2019 court must have inferred that the challenge to the validity of the release related to the widow\u2019s election to take an intestate share of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\">. It is true that the appellee was a legatee under his mother\u2019s will; however, he was a non-interested party insofar as the bank account was concerned. <em>See Talbot Packing Co. v.

Section 2-105(b) permits the orphans\u2019 court upon an issue of fact to transmit a request of an interested party to a court of law for determination. It may do so, however, only if it has jurisdiction of the subject, the question is properly before it, and it is relevant and material to the question before the court. <em>Kao v.
