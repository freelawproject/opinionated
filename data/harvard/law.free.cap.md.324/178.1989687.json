That court certified the following question for our determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-13\">\u201cIf a corporation fails to pay over to the Comptroller income taxes which have been withheld from its employees, and if the Comptroller imposes personal liability for those income taxes upon an officer of the corporation who exercises direct control over its fiscal management, pursuant to \u00a7 10-906 of the Maryland Tax Code, does that corporate officer have a right to seek contribution from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>other corporate officers who are alleged by the corporate officer on whom personal liability was imposed to have also exercised direct control of the corporation\u2019s fiscal management?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">John W. Lyon and Larry A. Campbell, parties to the federal court litigation, are the sole shareholders of I.C.E., Inc., a Nevada corporation which was the parent of several companies including Excavation-Construction, Inc. (Excavation). Lyon and Campbell, as officers of Excavation, allegedly exercised direct control over its fiscal affairs and were required to withhold Maryland income taxes from the corporation\u2019s employees and to remit those taxes to the Comptroller of the Treasury. In or about September, 1979, Excavation filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Prior to its bankruptcy, Excavation had failed to pay over $415,000 in withheld taxes to the State of Maryland. The Comptroller of the Treasury filed liens to collect the unpaid withholding taxes from Lyon pursuant to Maryland Code (1988, 1991 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-906(d) of the Tax-General Article, which imposes personal liability for failure to withhold taxes on any corporate officer who exercises direct control over the corporation\u2019s fiscal management. On or about June 28, 1990, Lyon paid $150,000 to the Comptroller, which was accepted in full satisfaction of the liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">On October 11, 1990, Lyon and his wife filed a complaint against Campbell and his wife in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. The complaint contained three counts, only one of which, Count Three, is relevant to the certified question of law before us. In Count Three, Lyon sought contribution of $75,000 from Campbell, alleging that both he and Campbell were liable for Excavation\u2019s unpaid withholding taxes and that $75,000 represented Campbell\u2019s pro rata share of the sum that Lyon had paid to settle the State tax claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The Campbells removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441 (1988) because of the diversity of citizenship between themselves and the Lyons. Thereafter, Campbell moved to dismiss Count Three pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on the ground that it did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted, asserting that there was no right to contribution for unpaid taxes under Maryland law. After the arguments on the motion were fully briefed, the United States District Court certified the question set forth above to this Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Campbell presents two alternative arguments in support of his position that no right to contribution exists between persons jointly obligated under Md.Code (1988, 1991 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-906(d) of the Tax-General Article. First, relying principally on several cases which have denied a right of contribution under the similar provision of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672(a) (1988),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Campbell argues that Md.Code (1988), \u00a7 10-107 of the Tax-General Article requires that \u00a7 10-906(d) be interpreted consistently with its federal counterpart. Alternatively, Campbell contends that even if \u00a7 10-107 does not require that \u00a7 10-906(d) be construed consistently with \u00a7 6672(a), Lyon has no common law basis for his claimed right of contribution. We are not persuaded by either of these propositions for the reasons we now explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">It is firmly established in Maryland that one debtor may claim contribution from another equally obligated for discharging their mutual obligation. <em>See, e.g., Jackson v. Cupples, </em>239 Md. 637, 639-40, 212 A.2d 273, 274 (1965) (\u201cWe have many times held that one joint obligor may claim contribution from another such obligor for having discharged their mutual obligation.\u201d); <em>Mallis v. Faraclas, </em>235 Md. 109, 115-16, 200 A.2d 676, 680 (1964) (\u201cIt is well-settled law that one joint obligor may claim contribution from another obligor for having discharged their mutual obligation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The doctrine of contribution originated in courts of equity, and at first was available only in those courts, as contribution actions were based upon principles of equity and natural justice. <em>Craig et al. v. Ankeney, </em>4 Gill 225, 231 (1846) (\u201cThe doctrine of contribution is not founded in contract; but is an implied equity, resting upon the plainest principles of moral and natural justice. For, in the language of Justice Story, \u2018as all are equally bound, and are equally relieved, it seems but just, that in such a case, all shall contribute in proportion, towards a benefit obtained by all____\u2019 \u201d). <em>See also Smith v. Anderson, </em>18 Md. 520, 527 (1862) (\u201cIt has been very correctly said, that the rights to contribution, as between sureties, arise out of the principles of equity and justice which grow out of the relations of the parties to each other.\u201d). These principles require that persons under a common burden shall bear responsibility in equal proportions. It is equally true that the doctrine of contribution is founded on morality, since no one ought to profit by another person\u2019s loss where he or she has incurred a like responsibility. <em>See Craig et al. v. Ankeney, </em>4 Gill at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The right to contribution is frequently exercised in cases of co-guarantors of a debt. For example, in <em>Jackson v. Cupples, supra, </em>endorsers on a note brought a suit for contribution because some of the endorsers refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>contribute their pro rata share in satisfaction of the joint obligation. The Court held that a trustee who paid the defaulted note on behalf of all endorsers of the note could maintain a suit in equity against the endorsers who had not contributed their pro rata shares. 239 Md. at 639-40, 212 A.2d at 274-75. Similarly, in <em>Hooper v. Hooper, </em>81 Md. 155, 31 A. 508 (1895), three persons guaranteed a debt owed by another. When the debtor became insolvent, two of the guarantors paid the debt and proceeded in equity against the third guarantor for contribution. The Court held that they were entitled to recover one-third of the whole debt, that is, the third guarantor\u2019s pro rata share of the debt. <em>Id. </em>at 174, 31 A. at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">According to the factual predicate of the certified question posed to us, Lyon and Campbell were both officers of Excavation with direct control over its fiscal management and were required to pay to the Comptroller income taxes that were withheld from Excavation\u2019s employees. Maryland\u2019s income tax withholding statute provides in relevant part that if a corporate employer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">\u201cnegligently fails to withhold or to pay income tax ... personal liability for that income tax extends ... to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">(i) any officer of the corporation who exercises direct control over its fiscal management; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">(ii) any agent of the corporation who is required to withhold and pay the income tax.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Md.Code (1988, 1991 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-906(d) of the Tax-General Article. Thus, Lyon and Campbell allegedly were jointly and severally liable for any failure to withhold under \u00a7 10-906(d). Because the right to contribution arises where the parties are under a common obligation or liability, there is no just reason why the general equitable principles of Maryland law should be ignored in this case so as to exempt Campbell from responsibility for his share of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">Indeed, we agree with Lyon\u2019s argument that this case is analogous to the debt surety cases which present the model for equitable contribution. Under \u00a7 10-906(d), corporate officers who exercise direct control of the corporation\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>fiscal management are effectively made guarantors of the corporate tax obligation by imposing personal liability on them for that tax. As our predecessors observed many years ago in <em>Craig et al. v. Ankeney, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\"><em>\u201cA </em>payment thereof, by one of them, redounded with equal benefit, to the discharge of the other. Upon every principle, therefore, of morality, equity, and common justice, if one of them paid the whole debt, he had a right, by way of contribution, as well in a Court of law, as in Chancery, to recover, from the other security, a moiety of the sum paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">4 Gill at 231. If, as alleged, Lyon\u2019s payment to the Comptroller afforded equal benefit to Campbell by relieving him of personal liability for the taxes, under Maryland common law Lyon is entitled to contribution of Campbell\u2019s pro rata share of the amount Lyon paid to satisfy their joint obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Despite this well established principle of Maryland law, Campbell argues that there is no right of contribution between persons jointly obligated under \u00a7 10-906(d). Campbell contends that Md.Code (1988), \u00a7 10-107 of the Tax-General Article requires that Maryland\u2019s income tax withholding provision, \u00a7 10-906(d), be interpreted consistently with its federal counterpart, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672(a), of the Internal Revenue Code. Campbell asserts that since there is no right of contribution under \u00a7 6672(a), there should be no right of contribution under 10-906(d). We reject that notion on several grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Section 10-107 of Md.Code (1988), Tax-General Article provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">\u201cTo the extent practicable, the Comptroller shall apply the administrative and judicial interpretations of the federal income tax law to the administration of the income tax laws of this State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1e\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Campbell posits that \u00a7 10-107 requires that this Court in interpreting \u00a7 10-906(d) adopt the interpretation by federal courts of \u00a7 6672(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">We observe that the issue presented by the certified question concerns the collateral right between two private parties to allocate the burden of a joint tax obligation, not the \u201cadministration of the income tax laws.\u201d Indeed, as discussed in Section D, <em>infra, </em>the equitable state law right to contribution exists regardless of whether such a right exists under federal law. In addition, \u00a7 10-107 does not require Maryland courts to follow federal precedent regardless of differences between the relevant state and federal statutes; where the Maryland and Internal Revenue Codes are not exactly comparable, as in this case, interpretations under the Internal Revenue Code can offer guidance but need not be relied upon by Maryland courts in interpreting the Maryland tax code. <em>See, e.g., Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. v. Comptroller, </em>86 Md.App. 258, 265-67, 586 A.2d 752, 755-56 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Section 10-107 applies where the Maryland tax code is \u201c \u2018inextricably keyed\u2019 \u201d to the federal tax code \u201cby virtue of its adoption of the federal law.\u201d <em>Comptroller v. Chesapeake Corp., </em>54 Md.App. 208, 213-14, 458 A.2d 459, 463 (1983). It avoids the \u201canomalous result\u201d of the taxpayer achieving a different result regarding payment of Maryland tax where the Maryland tax provision incorporates the federal tax provision. <em>See Comptroller v. Diebold, Inc., </em>279 Md. 401, 409, 369 A.2d 77, 82 (1977) (holding that where the Maryland tax code incorporates a federal tax code provision, the interpretation of the Maryland and federal tax provisions should be consistent).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Here, however, \u00a7 10-906(d) of the Tax-General Article, neither is keyed to nor adopts 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672(a); rather, the two statutes merely address the same subject\u2014liability for failure to pay withholding taxes. There, the similarity begins and ends. <em>See </em>Section C, <em>infra. </em>Importantly, the General Assembly could have, but did not, incorporate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>language of \u00a7 6672(a) in \u00a7 10-906(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The policy in favor of interpreting state tax law identically to federal tax law is considerably weaker where, as here, there is no linkage between state and federal statutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No \u201canomalous result\u201d will be reached in this case by allowing a right to seek contribution because the Maryland provision does not incorporate federal law and the computation of state tax is in no way dependent upon the computation of federal tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Lyon readily admits that there is no federal right of contribution under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672(a). The vast majority of federal courts have held that a responsible corporate official, who has been required to pay federal withholding taxes for failure of his corporation to do so, has no right to claim contribution pursuant to \u00a7 6672(a) from either the corporation or any other corporate official. <em>See, e.g.,,Sinder v. United States, </em>655 F.2d 729, 732 (6th Cir.1981); <em>Seachrist v. Riggs, </em>91-1 U.S.Tax Cas. (CCH) \u00b6 50,019, 1990 WL 260538 (N.D.W.Va.1990); <em>Rice v. Pearce, </em>574 F.Supp. 23, 26 (S.D.Iowa 1983); <em>Geiger v. United States, </em>78-1 U.S.Tax Cas. (CCH) \u00b6 9395, 1978 WL 1206 (D.Md.1978); <em>DiBenedetto v. United States, </em>75-1 U.S.Tax Cas. (CCH) \u00b6 9503, 1974 WL 791 (D.R.I.1974). Section 6672(a) imposes this personal liability upon \u201cany person required to collect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>truthfully account for, and pay over any [withholding] tax ... who willfully fails to collect such tax____\u201d The persons liable under \u00a7 6672(a) are described in the case law as \u201cresponsible persons.\u201d While there may be more than one responsible person in a given case, <em>Braden v. United States, </em>442 F.2d 342, 343 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 912, 92 S.Ct. 229, 30 L.Ed.2d 185 (1971); <em>Krueger v. United States, </em>326 F.Supp. 231, 233 (E.D.Wis.1971); <em>Abrams v. United States, </em>333 F.Supp. 1134, 1146 (S.D.W.Va.1971), each such person is individually liable for the entire amount of a \u00a7 6672(a) assessment which has been separately assessed against him or her. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. United States, </em>591 F.2d 1136, 1142 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Kelly v. Lethert, </em>362 F.2d 629, 635 (8th Cir.1966). Thus, the statute serves as a collection device for the government, and not as a source of a right to contribution between \u201cresponsible persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We agree with Campbell that the seminal case on lack of entitlement to contribution under \u00a7 6672(a) is <em>DiBenedetto v. United States, supra. </em>In reaching its conclusion, the district court in that case observed that in the absence of specific statutory authority, no federal common law right of contribution exists, and that the Internal Revenue Code fails to provide for any right to contribution in its penalty provisions. Furthermore, the court remarked that liability under \u00a7 6672(a) can be imposed only for <em>willful </em>failures to collect or truthfully account for and pay over such taxes. The court drew a distinction between the willful conduct required under \u00a7 6672(a) and mere negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">\u201c[T]he statute imposes joint and several liability only if the act is voluntary, conscious and intentional as opposed to merely accidental or inadvertent____ If the Corwins are found to have acted willfully, and are thus held liable under \u00a7 6672, the Court fails to see how the mere negligence of others should work to diminish such liability or create an independent cause of action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Finally, the court remarked that a right of contribution would effectively thwart the essentially penal nature of \u00a7 6672(a) liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Thus, in ruling that no federal right to contribution exists for payment of a penalty imposed pursuant to \u00a7 6672(a), federal courts have stressed the absence of a federal common law right to contribution, the \u201cwillfulness\u201d intent requirement of \u00a7 6672(a), and the severe civil penalty provided in the federal statute. <em>See, e.g., Rebelle v. United States, </em>588 F.Supp. 49, 51-52 (M.D.La.1984). Section 10-906(d) shares none of these attributes, and therefore, we conclude that the federal cases which have rejected a state law right to contribution under the Internal Revenue Code rest upon principles that are inapposite here. The reasons advanced by federal courts for denying contribution under \u00a7 6672(a) are unpersuasive when applied to the markedly different Maryland statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">There are controlling differences between \u00a7 10-906(d) of the Tax-General Article and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672(a) that dictate the application of the general principles of equitable contribution to joint obligations imposed by \u00a7 10-906(d). First, the federal statute imposes liability only upon a person who acts \u201cwillfully,\u201d whereas \u00a7 10-906(d) imposes liability on certain officers and agents of a corporate employer who <em>\u201cnegligently </em>fail to withhold or to pay income tax.\u201d (emphasis added). Section 10-906(d) thus has a broader scope than \u00a7 6672(a), holding many persons liable who have engaged in conduct that would not be penalized under \u00a7 6672(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Second, in contrast to \u00a7 6672(a), \u00a7 10-906(d) does not impose a \u201cpenalty\u201d on the employer for failure to withhold or pay income tax. Rather, \u00a7 10-906(b) provides that the corporate employer holds income tax withheld from its employees \u201cin trust\u201d for the State, and based on a negligence standard provides for the collection of that tax from \u201cany officer of the corporation who exercises direct control over its fiscal management; or any agent of the corporation who is required to withhold and pay the income tax.\u201d \u00a7 10-906(d). In contrast, \u00a7 6672(a) permits the Internal Revenue Service to collect both the deficient withholding tax and a 100% penalty over and above that tax from the responsible parties. <em>See, e.g., Levit v. Ingersoll Rand Financial Corp., </em>874 F.2d 1186, 1191 (7th Cir.1989) (\u201c[NJothing in the text of \u00a7 6672(a) prevents the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from collecting both the taxes withheld by the employer and the penalty from the responsible person.\u201d). Imposing a penalty in addition to recovering the deficient tax is not an option available to the Comptroller under \u00a7 10-906(d). The General Assembly could have written \u00a7 10-906(d) to mirror the provisions of \u00a7 6672(a), but it did not. Instead it enacted a substantially different statute with a different scope, creating a different liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Whether a right to contribution exists for liability imposed pursuant to \u00a7 10-906(d) is determined by Maryland law. Other courts have recognized that state law can provide a right of contribution for one who pays more than his pro rata share under \u00a7 6672(a). <em>See Schoot v. United</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>States, </em>664 F.Supp. 293, 297 (N.D.Ill.1987) (Illinois law); <em>Swift v. Levesque, </em>614 F.Supp. 172, 177 (D.Conn.1985) (Connecticut law); <em>Reid v. United States, </em>558 F.Supp. 686, 688-89 (N.D.Miss.1983) (right to indemnification under Mississippi law); <em>Esstman v. Boyd, </em>605 S.W.2d 237, 241-42 (Tenn.Ct. App.1980) (state law right to contribution under both the federal and state tax codes). For example, the Tennessee Court of Appeals in <em>Esstman v. Boyd, supra, </em>allowed a corporate officer who had paid a penalty under \u00a7 6672(a) contribution from another corporate officer. The Tennessee Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\u201cAs a matter of substantive law, the principle of contribution is founded not upon contract but upon principles of equity and natural justice, which require that those under a common obligation or burden shall bear it in equal proportions and one party shall not be subject- to the advantage of his co-obligor. The basic elements are that both parties be under a common obligation and that the parties [sic] seeking contribution has paid more than his proper share of the obligation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">605 S.W.2d at 241 (quoting <em>Huggins v. Graves, </em>337 F.2d 486, 489 (6th Cir.1964)). That a number of federal and state courts have recognized that a state law right to contribution exists under \u00a7 6672(a) confirms our conclusion that a right to contribution should be available under Maryland common law for liability imposed pursuant to \u00a7 10-906(d) of the Tax-General Article. Where, as in Maryland, a tradition of granting the equitable remedy of contribution exists, there is no good reason to shunt it aside when dealing with a payment of corporate withholding taxes pursuant to \u00a7 10-906(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Campbell argues that recognizing a right to contribution will create time-consuming delays that will interfere with the efforts of the Comptroller to collect the taxes due. In this case, the Comptroller has received payment and is in no way prejudiced by Lyon\u2019s efforts to secure contribution in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>this entirely separate action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the right to contribution only arises after a party has paid more than his pro rata share of a joint obligation, the Comptroller\u2019s right to receive payment is not impeded by the collateral right to contribution. Furthermore, there is no indication that suits for contribution for payment pursuant to \u00a7 10-906(d) will be any more complex or time-consuming than other contribution cases routinely heard by our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that a corporate officer who discharges a corporate tax liability under \u00a7 10-906(d) has a right to seek contribution from other officers who have also exercised direct control of the corporation\u2019s fiscal management and consequently share a common burden under \u00a7 10-906(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">QUESTION OF LAW ANSWERED AS HEREIN SET FORTH; COSTS TO BE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE PARTIES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\">.
