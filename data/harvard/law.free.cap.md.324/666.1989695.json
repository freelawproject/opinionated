Supp.), Title 14, Subtitle 8, Part III, entitled \u201cTax Sales,\u201d of the Tax-Property Article, and presents the question whether the holder of a right of first refusal in a recorded deed is entitled to actual notice of a proceeding by a tax sale purchaser to foreclose the right of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">The Tax-Property Article requires, in \u00a7 14-832, that provisions relating to tax sales \u201cshall be liberally construed as remedial legislation to encourage the foreclosure of rights of redemption by suits in the circuit courts and for the decreeing of marketable titles to property sold by the collector.\u201d Section 14-836(b)(l) provides, insofar as here pertinent, that the defendants in any action to foreclose the right of redemption shall be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>\u201c(i) the record title holder of the property as disclosed by a search performed in accordance with generally accepted standards of title examination of the land records of the county, of the records of the register of wills of the county, and of the records of the circuit court for the county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Other pertinent provisions of this section delineate, as additional parties entitled to actual notice (a) any mortgagee of the property or any assignee of the mortgagee of record, (b) the trustee under any deed of trust or any holder of a beneficial interest in a deed of trust who files notice of the interest, and (c) the county where the property is located and, if appropriate, the State. Section 14\u2014836(b)(3) makes it unnecessary to name as a defendant \u201cany other person that has or claims to have any right, title, interest, claim, lien or equity of redemption in the property sold by the collector.\u201d As to these persons, the subsection states that they are included as defendants by the designation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">\u201c \u2018all persons that have or claim to have any interest in property........(giving a description of the property in substantially the same form as the description that appears on the Collector\u2019s certificate of tax sale).\u2019 Any of these persons may be designated throughout the proceeding by the above designation and the cause may proceed against them by publication under order of court as provided in this subtitle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Section 14-839(a)(2) provides that the plaintiff need not \u201cmake any investigations or ... search any other records or sources of information other than those stated.\u201d Section 14-840 provides for notice by publication of the pending tax sale action.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">John Townsend acquired a parcel of ground from his mother who also conveyed an adjoining parcel to Townsend\u2019s sister, Virginia Lee Amato. A confirmatory deed was executed between John Townsend and Amato on June 25, 1982, which, <em>inter alia, </em>corrected certain irregularities in the description of the parcels conveyed by their mother. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>In the confirmatory deed, Townsend and Amato granted unto each other and their respective personal representatives and assigns the \u201cright of first refusal in the event of the proposed sale of all or any part of any of the lands herein described.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Townsend became delinquent in the payment of taxes, and on May 19, 1986, his parcel was purchased by Diane Ayres from the Director of Finance and Collector of State and County Taxes of Baltimore County. Subsequently, Ayres instituted proceedings in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to foreclose all rights of redemption; she named as defendants, Townsend, Baltimore County, Maryland, any unknown owner, and \u201call persons having or claiming to have any interest in the described property.\u201d Amato was not specifically named as a defendant, nor did she have actual notice of the sale or of the foreclosure proceedings. A notice by publication of the proceeding was published in a Baltimore County newspaper, as required by \u00a7 14-840 of the Tax-Property Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">A decree foreclosing all rights of redemption was signed by the court on September 7, 1988 and in due course the Collector conveyed the Townsend parcel to Ayres. Upon discovering that Ayres had acquired the Townsend parcel, Amato moved to set aside the judgment foreclosing the rights of redemption and requested that the court allow her, as the holder of the first refusal right, to redeem the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Finding that Amato was entitled to actual notice under \u00a7 14-836(b)(l)(i), the court on August 15, 1990 ordered that the judgment foreclosing rights of redemption of the subject property be set aside and granted Amato the right to redeem. Ayres appealed. We granted certiorari before consideration of the appeal by the intermediate appellate court to address the important issue presented in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Ayres argues that in a proceeding by a tax sale purchaser to foreclose the equity of redemption, the owner, of a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>of first refusal is not required by \u00a7 14-836(b)(l) to be named as a defendant. First, she asserts that Amato was not \u201cthe record title holder of the property,\u201d as disclosed by a search of the land records, and thus was not required by the statute to be named as a defendant. She claims that the definition of record title holder should be narrowly construed to include only the owner of the fee simple interest in the subject property, namely, Townsend, who was given notice thirty days before the property was first advertised for sale in the foreclosure proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Secondly, Ayres argues that a covenant between a landowner and a holder of a right of first refusal is a personal contract between the parties. She says that the contract merely requires the landowner, when and if the landowner decides to sell, to offer the property first to the holder of the right of first refusal. Because it was not Townsend\u2019s decision to sell his property, Ayres suggests that the sale was not voluntary on his part but made simply to satisfy his tax arrearage. Thus, according to Ayres, Amato was not entitled to exercise her first refusal right to acquire the property since that right does not extend to foreclosure or other involuntary proceedings instituted to satisfy delinquent tax obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Finally, Ayres argues that \u00a7 14-832, relating to tax sales, requires a liberal construction to encourage the foreclosure of rights of redemption and for the decreeing of marketable titles of property sold by the collector. As to this, she cites <em>Thomas v. Kolker, </em>195 Md. 470, 73 A.2d 886 (1950), for the proposition that the legislature has declared that the public interest in marketable titles to property purchased at tax sales outweighs considerations of individual hardship, except upon a showing of lack of jurisdiction or fraud in the conduct of the foreclosure. Since there were no fraud or jurisdictional issues involved in the proceedings, Ayres asserts that Amato\u2019s right of first refusal should not be permitted to defeat the tax sale in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Amato responds that the trial court acted properly when it ruled that the owner of a right of first refusal is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>\u201crecord title holder\u201d entitled to be named as a defendant within the contemplation of the statute. She urges that we give a broad interpretation to this term to include a holder of a right of first refusal because (1) her interest in the parcel was ascertainable through a search of the land records and (2) Townsend could not convey good title to the parcel without her prior assent. In support of her position, Amato relies upon <em>Brashears v. Collison, </em>207 Md. 339, 115 A.2d 289 (1955), which held that a life tenant and remainder-men of property were entitled to notice of a tax sale purchaser\u2019s action to foreclose the rights of redemption. Amato contends that \u00a7 14-836(b)(l)(i) guarantees, to the extent possible, that those persons with recorded interests in the subject property, including persons holding a right of first refusal, are identified and made party defendants, thereby entitling them to summons and actual notice, as well as notice by publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Whether the actual notice requirements of \u00a7 14-836(b)(l)(i) encompass a holder of a right of first refusal is essentially a matter of statutory construction. In interpreting the statute\u2019s provisions, our goal is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature. Our focus is, therefore, centered upon the statute\u2019s purpose or policy. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628 (1987). Where statutory language is unambiguous, and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, the words will be accorded their ordinary meaning. <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Burke, </em>321 Md. 699, 706, 584 A.2d 702 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Section 14-836(b)(l), prior to its amendment by ch. 825 of the Acts of 1986 (HB 1828), provided that, among others, the \u201cowner\u201d of the property was required to be given actual notice in any action to foreclose the right of redemption. The word \u201cowner\u201d was deleted by the 1986 amendment; in its place the term \u201crecord title holder\u201d was used. Chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>825 made numerous other amendments to the tax sales provisions of Title 14, Subtitle 8, Part III, of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"AdY\">The title to HB 1828 stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was for the purpose of altering the laws concerning tax sales, including \u201cwho may be a defendant in a suit to foreclose the right of redemption.\u201d The bill was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means which gave it a favorable report, without amendments; the report of that committee stated that the bill alters the law concerning tax sales, including \u201callowing all parties with interests in properties (not only the owner of record) to put that interest on record so that they will be identified in title searches of tax sale properties.\u201d The bill, after its passage through the House of Delegates, was substantially amended by the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee; the report of that committee said that the bill contained a redefinition of defendants under \u00a7 14-836(b)(l)(i) \u201cto include the record title holder.\u201d The bill was intended, according to the Senate committee\u2019s report, \u201cto address due process concerns about notice provided in tax sales of property,\u201d in order to provide \u201cgreater protection for due process by facilitating notice of tax sales of property in the State.\u201d The bill was enacted after the House concurred in the Senate amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">During oral argument before us (but not in her brief), Amato suggested that the 1986 amendments to \u00a7 14-836(b)(l)(i), which substituted \u201crecord title holder\u201d for \u201cowner,\u201d were inspired by the Supreme Court\u2019s 1983 holding in <em>Mennonite Bd. of Missions v. Adams, </em>462 U.S. 791, 103 S.Ct. 2706, 77 L.Ed.2d 180. The issue in that case was whether the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment was violated by an Indiana statute which required only that notice by publication, rather than actual notice, be given to a mortgagee of real property sold to a purchaser for nonpayment of taxes. The Court, in finding a due process violation, cited <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>(1950), for the proposition that, in an action affecting an interest in property, a State must require notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. In <em>Mullane, </em>the Court held that published notice of an action to settle the accounts of a common trust fund was not sufficient to inform beneficiaries of the trust whose names and addresses were known. The Court explained in that case that notice by publication was not reasonably calculated to provide actual notice of the pending proceeding and was therefore inadequate to inform those who could be notified by more effective means, such as personal service or mailed notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The Court concluded in <em>Mennonite </em>that a mortgagee possesses a substantial property interest that is significantly affected by a tax sale, and therefore due process considerations required that a mortgagee of property sought to be sold at a tax sale must be afforded notice reasonably calculated to apprise him of the pending sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The Maryland statute, well before enactment of the 1986 amendments to \u00a7 14-836(b), provided for actual notice of a tax sale to a mortgagee of real property. Thus, at the time of passage of the 1986 amendments, the specific holding in <em>Mennonite </em>did not require any change in the Maryland statute, as it then existed. There is no mention in the legislative committee reports that the principle espoused in <em>Mennonite </em>was the catalyst for changing \u201cowner\u201d to \u201crecord title holder\u201d in \u00a7 14-836(b)(l)(i). But even if it was, we conclude that this change was not intended by the legislature to include a right of first refusal within the term \u201crecord title holder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">As Judge Eldridge said for the Court in <em>Ferrero Constr. v. Dennis Rourke Corp., </em>311 Md. 560, 565, 536 A.2d 1137 (1988), a right of first refusal to purchase property is commonly known as a \u201cpreemptive right.\u201d It is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>interest in property, and not merely a contractual right, whereby the preemptioner acquires an equitable right in the property, which vests only when the property owner decides to sell. <em>Id. </em>We there characterized the right as one \u201c \u2018in the nature of a springing executory interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. See also Dorado v. Broadneck, </em>317 Md. 148, 562 A.2d 757 (1989); <em>Straley v. Osborne, </em>262 Md. 514, 522, 278 A.2d 64 (1971) (right of first refusal is a \u201cconditional option, or first privilege of purchase\u201d); <em>Westpark, Inc. v. Seaton Land Co., </em>225 Md. 433, 449, 171 A.2d 736 (1960) (the right is an equitable one, which requires the owners of the property to give the holder of the right notice if the owner decides to sell the property).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">It is clear that Amato\u2019s interest in the property was delineated in the deed and, therefore, was ascertainable through a search of the land records. That, of course, does not elevate her interest to that of a \u201crecord title holder,\u201d within the contemplation of \u00a7 14\u2014836(b)(l)(i); rather, her right to notification of the tax sale was by publication under the provisions of \u00a7 14-836(b)(3) as a person having an interest in the property, but not specifically required to be named as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">There is a presumption of the constitutionality of a statute; to overcome the presumption, there must be a clear and convincing showing by the party assailing the statute that it does not rest upon any reasonable constitutional basis but is essentially arbitrary. <em>See Hornbeck v. Somerset Co. Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 597, and cases cited at 657, 458 A.2d 758 (1983). Amato made no showing that the statutory classification of those entitled to actual notice of the tax sale, as opposed to constructive notice, was constitutionally defective. We, therefore, hold that a right of first refusal, while a valuable interest in property, does not, in common parlance, come within the ambit of a \u201crecord title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>holder.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-13\">. Independent of our reasons for concluding that notice by publication was constitutionally adequate in this case, we note the existence of a line of cases holding that a right of first refusal may not attach when the sale of the property is an involuntary one, such as in tax sale proceedings. <em>See Henderson v. Millis, </em>373 N.W.2d 497 (Iowa 1985); <em>Nu-Way Service Stations v. Vanderberg Bros. Oil Co., </em>283 Mich. 551, 278 N.W. 683 (1938); <em>Draper v. Gochman, </em>400 S.W.2d 545 (Texas 1966); Annotation, <em>Rights of Holder of \u201cFirst Refusal\" Option on Real Property in Event of Sale at Foreclosure or Other Involuntary Sale, </em>17 A.L.R.3d 962 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">We also note that a right of first refusal is subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities. <em>See Ferrero Constr. v. Dennis Rourke Corp., </em>311 Md. 560, 565-67, 536 A.2d 1137 (1988). The language creating the first refusal right in this case granted the right unto Amato, \"her ... personal representatives and assigns\" without limit as to duration. As <em>Ferrero </em>makes clear, in some circumstances where the right is not limited to a term of years, it might vest well beyond the period of some life in being plus twenty-one years, and hence be unenforceable as in violation of the Rule Against Perpetuities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
