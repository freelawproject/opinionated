BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">The issue to be decided in this case is whether dual convictions for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and for use of drug paraphernalia lie when the latter conviction is based solely on the possession of the vial containing the cocaine on which the former conviction is based. The Court of Special Appeals, reasoning that, because they are separate offenses, they do not merge, answered \u201cYes.\u201d We granted the Writ of Certiorari requested by petitioner James E. Dickerson and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">The facts out of which this case arose are simple and straightforward. Petitioner was a passenger in a car that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>was stopped by the police after it had been clocked, by radar, proceeding at a speed in excess of the posted limit. When a Crown Royal bag containing a vial of crack cocaine was discovered between the front seats, he and the driver were arrested. Based solely on the vial which contained the cocaine, petitioner was charged with violation of Maryland Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 287A(c) (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), use of drug paraphernalia,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and art. 27, \u00a7 286(a)(1), (1990 Cum. Supp.), possession of the cocaine in the vial with intent to distribute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was convicted of both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Petitioner argued in the Court of Special Appeals that the Legislature did not intend to permit dual convictions when the drug paraphernalia conviction is premised solely on the use of the container in which the cocaine forming the basis for the distribution offense was found. In addition, he urged that, if the legislative intent is not clear\u2014there is an ambiguity\u2014, then the rule of lenity requires the court to resolve the ambiguity in his favor. In affirming the judgment of the lower court, the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">The paraphernalia involved in this case is limited to the vial containing the cocaine. The sentence was suspended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>generally and we conclude that the $500.00 fine was not imposed. Md. Code, article 27, sec. 287(d)(2), relating to drug paraphernalia, refers to \u201cgelatin capsules, glassine envelopes, or any other container suitable for packaging of individual quantities of controlled dangerous substances ____\u201d A vial is no different. Under the required evidence test for merger, appellant\u2019s argument for merger of the drug paraphernalia charge into the possession with intent to distribute charge fails. Each offense contains an element which the other does not. Concerning paraphernalia, the State must prove possession with an intent to use the paraphernalia. In possession with intent to distribute, the State must prove an intent to circulate some or all of the drug. Each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not. There is no merger____ (Citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">Section 287A(a) defines \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">[A]ll equipment, products, and materials of any kind which are used, intended for use, or designed for use, in planting, propagating, cultivating, growing, harvesting, manufacturing, compounding, converting, producing, processing, preparing, testing, analyzing, packaging, repackaging, storing, containing, concealing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled dangerous substance in violation of this subheading____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">By way of example, that section lists 12 categories of items included in the definition. Two of them are relevant to the case <em>sub judice:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">(9) Capsules, balloons, envelopes and other containers used, intended for use, or designed for use in packaging small quantities of controlled dangerous substances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">(10) Containers and other objects used, intended for use, or designed for use in storing or concealing controlled dangerous substances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">Section (b) recognizes that objects which are not necessarily drug paraphernalia may nevertheless be drug parapher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>nalia, by virtue of their use or the surrounding circumstances; therefore, as an aid to the trier of fact, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8g\">(b) <em>Factors in determining whether object is drug para</em>phernalia.\u2014In determining whether an object is drug paraphernalia, a court or other authority should consider, in addition to all other logically relevant factors, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">(1) Statements by an owner or by anyone in control of the object concerning its use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">(2) Prior convictions, if any, of an owner, or of anyone in control of the object, under any State or federal law relating to any controlled dangerous substance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">(3) The proximity of the object, in time and space, to a direct violation of this section or to a controlled dangerous substance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">(4) The existence of any residue of controlled dangerous substances on the object;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">(5) Direct or circumstantial evidence of the intent of the owner, or of anyone in control of the object, to deliver it to persons whom he knows, or should reasonably know, intend to use the object to facilitate a violation of this section; the innocence of an owner, or of anyone in control of the object, as to a direct violation of this section shall not prevent a finding that the object is intended for use, or designed for use as drug paraphernalia;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">(6) Instructions, oral or written, provided with the object concerning its use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">(7) Descriptive materials accompanying the object which explain or depict its use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">(8) National and local advertising concerning its use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">(9) The manner in which the object is displayed for sale;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-14\">(10) Whether the owner, or anyone in control of the object, is a legitimate supplier of like or related items to the community, such as a licensed distributor or dealer of tobacco products;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>(11) Direct or circumstantial evidence of the ratio of sales of the object or objects to the total sales of the business enterprise;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">(12) The existence and scope of legitimate uses of the object in the community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">(13) Expert testimony concerning its use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Focusing on the definition of drug paraphernalia, petitioner argues that \u00a7 287A \u201cis aimed at the possession of items whose purpose goes beyond merely containing the drugs that a defendant possesses.\u201d And, given the definition of paraphernalia<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, he continues, interpreting \u00a7 287A as permitting a conviction based solely on the use of the container for the drugs gives the statute a \u201cstrained interpretation\u201d; under such interpretation, two convictions <em>must </em>lie whenever one possesses a controlled dangerous substance. He reasons: \u201c[ujnless it is in the form of smoke, a controlled dangerous substance must always be contained in or on some object. \u2018Drug paraphernalia\u2019 could include a shirt pocket, underwear, an automobile seat, or a human hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Petitioner also relies upon <em>State v. Owens, </em>320 Md. 682, 688, 579 A.2d 766, 768 (1990), and <em>Davis v. State, </em>319 Md. 56, 62, 570 A.2d 855, 858 (1990). In <em>Owens, </em>we held that the General Assembly did not intend \u201cseparate prosecutions and punishments for possession of PCP and possession of marijuana where the two substances have been, for all practical purposes, irrevocably joined as one.\u201d In <em>Davis, </em>we rejected the State\u2019s argument that a glass jar and other items used to coat parsley with PCP constituted a device adopted for the production of PCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Not surprisingly, the State takes the opposite view, arguing \u201cthe vial at issue in this case is clearly an item of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>paraphernalia, as defined in \u00a7 287A, since it is a container used to store and conceal cocaine.\u201d It recommends that we make <em>\u201ca </em>common sense reading of \u00a7 287A, in light of the Legislature\u2019s declared intent in \u00a7 276,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which would support the trial court\u2019s decision and mandate the conclusion that the Legislature intended separate prosecutions and penalties for violations of both \u00a7 287A and \u00a7 286(a)(1) notwithstanding that both, especially under these circumstances, address closely related conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The State also argues that <em>Owens </em>and <em>Davis </em>are inapposite. Unlike <em>Owens, </em>it reminds us, the cocaine and the vial which contained it are not \u201cirrevocably joined as one.\u201d <em>Davis </em>is distinguished on the basis that, at issue there was the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction, while here, that issue is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Petitioner was charged and convicted under two separate statutes, \u00a7 286 and \u00a7 287A, each addressing different conduct. Focusing on what the State must minimally prove to sustain a conviction under each statute makes clear that</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>this is so. <em>See Thomas v. State, </em>277 Md. 257, 267, 353 A.2d 240, 246-47 (1976). Section 286(a)(1) proscribes possession of a controlled dangerous substance in sufficient quantity reasonably to indicate under all circumstances an intent to distribute it. On the other hand, \u00a7 287A(c), as relevant to the case <em>sub judice, </em>prohibits the use of drug paraphernalia to \u201ccontain\u201d, \u201cstore\u201d or \u201cconceal\u201d a controlled dangerous substance. Proof that drug paraphernalia was used in connection with the possession of a controlled dangerous substance is not necessary when the charge is possession of that controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute it. Similarly, although its presence in at least a trace amount may be probative of the item\u2019s nature, <em>see </em>\u00a7 287A(b)(4), proof that the accused possessed a controlled dangerous substance, with or without the intent to distribute, is not required to prove use of drug paraphernalia. Particularly is this the case where the possession is constructive,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> not actual, and is under circumstances, unlike those <em>sub judice, </em>where the controlled dangerous substance <em>is not </em>in a container.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">We are here concerned with multiple convictions, and punishment, imposed after a single trial and in respect of conduct, <em>i.e., </em>the possession of a single vial containing cocaine, which, though different, is also closely related. Consequently, the issue that we must address is whether, when it enacted \u00a7 287A, the Legislature intended that two convictions result whenever a container is used to contain, store or conceal a controlled dangerous substance. <em>See Randall Book Corp. v. State, </em>316 Md. 315, 323-24, 558 A.2d 715, 719-20 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">To determine legislative intent, \u201cwe look first to the words of the statute, read in light of the full context in which they appear, and in light of external manifestations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>of intent or general purpose available through other evidence.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>318 Md. 182, 185, 567 A.2d 126, 127 (1989). <em>See also State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 92, 581 A.2d 9, 12 (1990); <em>Davis, </em>319 Md. at 60, 570 A.2d at 857; <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628, 632 (1987). In so doing, we give the language of the statute its ordinary and common meaning. <em>Bricker, </em>321 Md. at 92, 581 A.2d at 12; <em>Harford County v. University, </em>318 Md. 525, 529, 569 A.2d 649, 651 (1990); <em>NCR Corp. v. Comptroller, </em>313 Md. 118, 124-25, 544 A.2d 764, 767 (1988); <em>Comptroller v.

Moreover, we approach the analysis of the language from a commonsensical, rather than a technical, perspective, <em>see United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., </em>344 U.S. 218, 221, 73 S.Ct. 227, 229, 97 L.Ed. 260, 264 (1952); <em>Owens, </em>320 Md. at 688, 579 A.2d at 768, always seeking to avoid giving the statute a strained interpretation or one that reaches an absurd result. <em>Baltimore Cty. C.A.U.T. v. Baltimore Cty., </em>321 Md. 184, 203, 582 A.2d 510, 519 (1990); <em>Bricker, </em>321 Md. at 92, 581 A.2d at 12; <em>D &amp; Y, Inc. v.

In fact, \u201cunreasonableness of the result produced by one among alternative possible interpretations of a statute is reason for rejecting that interpretation in favor of another which would produce a reasonable result.\u201d <em>D &amp; Y, Inc., </em>320 Md. at 538, 578 A.2d at 1179-80, quoting 2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 45.12 (4th ed.1984). When the language is clearly consistent with the apparent purpose of the statute and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>result is not absurd, no further research is required. <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 515, 525 A.2d at 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">When a statute is interpreted \u201cin context\u201d, its \u201cgeneral history and [the] prevailing mood of the legislative body with respect to the type of criminal conduct involved,\u201d are considered. <em>Randall Book, </em>316 Md. at 327, 558 A.2d at 721. <em>See also Cunningham, </em>318 Md. at 185, 567 A.2d at 127. Thus, it is relevant that Maryland has strict drug laws, which are to be liberally construed to accomplish their purpose. <em>Davis, </em>319 Md. at 61, 570 A.2d at 858; <em>Owens, </em>320 Md. at 687, 579 A.2d at 768; <em>Randall Book, </em>316 Md. at 327, 558 A.2d at 721. But it is also relevant that \u00a7 287A is a penal statute. Such statutes are to be strictly construed, <em>Wynn v. State, </em>313 Md. 533, 539, 546 A.2d 465, 468 (1988); <em>Jones, </em>304 Md. at 220, 498 A.2d at 624, so that only punishment contemplated by the language of the statute is meted out. <em>Davis, </em>319 Md. at 61, 570 A.2d at 858; <em>State v. Archer, </em>73 Md. 44, 57, 20 A. 172, 173 (1890); <em>Cearfoss v. State, </em>42 Md. 403, 407 (1875).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Neither the language of \u00a7 287A nor its legislative history indicates that the General Assembly intended, by its enactment, that two convictions and, hence, double punishment, result whenever, under circumstances like those <em>sub judice, </em>both \u00a7\u00a7 287A and 286 are violated. Moreover, there is no intent evident in those sources, or in this Court\u2019s opinions, that a purpose of \u00a7 287A is to enhance the punishment for possessing a controlled dangerous substance. <em>Williams v. State, </em>323 Md. 312, 322-23, 593 A.2d 671, 676 (1991). Section 287A provides another front on which to fight the war on drugs; by outlawing the implements which are designed primarily for use with, or to facilitate, drug use, and prosecuting those who violate those laws, it makes more effective the war against the drugs themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Here, the only conceivable purpose of the vial was to contain, store, or conceal the cocaine which formed the basis for petitioner\u2019s conviction for possession with intent to distribute. Because it was used for that purpose in contra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>vention of \u00a7 287A, the vial was drug paraphernalia. Of that, there can be no question. The issue is not thereby resolved, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">The definition of drug paraphernalia is extremely broad; within it are included virtually everything in, or on, which something may be contained, stored, concealed or packaged. Given the breadth of the drug paraphernalia definition and the characteristics of many illegal drugs, it is clear that some of those drugs may only be possessed through the use of drug paraphernalia. That is certainly true of cocaine; unless held in the hand,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> cocaine, be it in the form of crack, as in this case, or a powder, may be possessed only with the aid of some kind of equipment, product, and/or material. In this case, the vial was used as drug paraphernalia, of course, which use as such was also incidental and necessary to petitioner\u2019s possession of the cocaine which it contained. Under the circumstances here presented, then, since the use of the vial had no purpose other than to contain the cocaine, for the possession of which petitioner has been convicted and sentenced, the possession of cocaine necessarily involved the use of drug paraphernalia. We do not believe the Legislature intended separate punishment for possession of the vial, which contained the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Although the cocaine petitioner possessed and the vial he used to possess it are not \u201cfor all practical purposes, irrevocably joined as one\u201d, <em>Owens, </em>320 Md. at 688, 579 A.2d at 768, the facts of this case place it closer to that end of the spectrum than to the other, where, for all practical purposes, there is no necessary connection between the two acts. Viewing the matter from a common sense perspective, we are persuaded that the Legislature did not intend, by enactment of \u00a7 287A, to sanction dual convictions under the circumstances <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>It is the State\u2019s position that, in most instances,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> dual convictions are not only permitted, but were contemplated, and intended, by the Legislature. This position represents a strained interpretation of \u00a7 287A, which is productive of results that are illogical and unreasonable. For example, under this view, possession of a single marijuana cigarette would produce two convictions: one for possession of marijuana and, because the cigarette paper is a \u201ccontainer\u201d for the marijuana, another for use of drug paraphernalia.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Similarly, because cocaine must be contained in something, the concealment of a single piece of crack cocaine in an accused\u2019s shirt pocket, or even in an ordinary paper bag, would also give rise to two convictions\u2014for the possession and, the shirt pocket and paper bag being containers, for use of drug paraphernalia. Indeed, because drug paraphernalia may be, by virtue of use, almost anything, even items with no special characteristics making them suitable for use in connection with drug use, the State\u2019s position, as petitioner argues, would authorize two convictions for virtually every possession charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We hold that, when there is no other drug paraphernalia, a defendant may only be convicted of possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute, even though the cocaine possessed is in a vial, which is thereby being used as drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART AND THE CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE DRUG PARAPHERNALIA CONVICTION.

Later, however, recognizing the consistency of that position with its argument, the State seemed to accept the proposition that the possession of a marijuana cigarette does give rise to two convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b233-5\">McAULIFFE, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Amz\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">I agree with the Court of Special Appeals that separate convictions and sentences are permitted for the crimes of possession of a controlled dangerous substance (or possession with intent to distribute) and use of drug paraphernalia, even when the paraphernalia is the container in which the controlled dangerous substance (CDS) is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">As the majority concedes, the canister<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> involved in this case is drug paraphernalia within the meaning of Article 27, \u00a7 287A(a). The possession or use of that paraphernalia is not the \u201csame offense\u201d as possession with the intent to distribute a CDS because each offense requires proof of an element that the other does not. <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932); <em>Snowden v. State, </em>321 Md. 612, 616-17, 583 A.2d 1056 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">If this case is viewed as one involving the \u201cunit of prosecution\u201d intended by the legislature, I believe it is more closely akin to <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>318 Md. 182, 567 A.2d 126 (1989) (simultaneous possession of heroin and cocaine justified separate convictions and penalties) and <em>Randall Book Corp. v. State, </em>316 Md. 315, 558 A.2d 715 (1989) (simultaneous display for sale of 116 different pornographic magazines supports 116 convictions and sentences) than to <em>State v. Owens, </em>320 Md. 682, 579 A.2d 766 (1990) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>(possession of marijuana and phencyclidine not separate offenses when the two substances are for all practical purposes irrevocably joined as one).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Determining the correct unit of prosecution is largely a matter of divining the legislative intent. In this instance, the legislature has made its intent indelibly clear\u2014the use of this container to store, contain, or conceal a CDS is a crime. Art. 27, \u00a7 287A(c) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">It is unlawful for any person to use ... drug paraphernalia to ... store, contain or conceal a controlled dangerous substance in violation of this subheading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Section 287A(a) defines drug paraphernalia to include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9J\">all equipment, products, and materials of any kind which are used ... in ... storing, containing, [or] concealing ... a controlled dangerous substance in violation of this subheading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s belief that the legislature could not have intended that a container actually used to store a CDS be considered drug paraphernalia, the legislature spoke directly to the question, and said that was precisely what it meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">The majority is concerned with a result that it considers illogical and unreasonable. I consider it no more logical or reasonable to hold, as the majority does, that a defendant may be convicted of possession of CDS and possession of paraphernalia when a container with trace amounts of CDS is found next, to the CDS that has just been poured from it, but cannot be convicted of both offenses when the CDS is found in the container.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">I may personally agree that charging a person with the use of paraphernalia under the circumstances of the instant case may be overkill, somewhat akin to adding to a murder indictment a charge of violating a county ordinance by discharging a firearm in an urban area when the defendant shoots his victim in a public place. That problem, however, is ordinarily avoided by the use of prosecutorial discretion, or alleviated, as here, by sound judicial discretion in sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>tencing. In any event, when the legislature has specifically spoken on the subject, the personal view of a judge is of no moment. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">KARWACKI, J., joins in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\">. The container is referred to in the transcript as a \"black vial.\u201d It is a small canister made of black, opaque plastic, with a snap-on plastic top. It is identical to, or may in fact be, a film canister for 35 millimeter film. These film canisters, or \u201ccans\u201d have long been containers of choice for certain contraband drugs. In the case of crack cocaine, small plastic or glass vials of the type used for perfume samples enjoy popularity as containers for street sales to users. For purposes of clarity, I refer to the container in this case as a canister.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
