The specific issue is whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for loss of services are subject to the \u201cper person\u201d or the \u201cper occurrence\u201d limitation of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">In November 1984, Thomas Valliere was killed in an automobile accident caused by the alleged negligence of Susan Mattei. Mattei was insured under an automobile liability insurance policy issued by Allstate Insurance Company. Thomas Valliere\u2019s wife, Lynn, in her capacity as the personal representative of the estate of her husband, personally, and on behalf of Nicholas Valliere, the minor child of Thomas Valliere, filed wrongful death and survival actions against Susan Mattei. In the survival action, Lynn, as personal representative of the estate, sought to recover for Thomas Valliere\u2019s conscious pain and suffering. In the wrongful death action, she sought to recover damages for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the loss of her husband\u2019s services which she and her son had suffered on account of Mattei\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">While the tort action was pending,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lynn Valliere filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City this declaratory judgment action against Allstate, seeking a determination that Allstate\u2019s policy defined \u201closs of services\u201d as a type of \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Such a declaration would mean that three persons had sustained \u201cbodily injury\u201d under the terms of the policy and that the \u201cper occurrence\u201d rather than the \u201cper person\u201d limit on coverage would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The declarations page of Susan Mattei\u2019s policy with Allstate limited Mattei\u2019s bodily injury coverage to $50,000.00 for each person and $100,000.00 for each occurrence. Allstate\u2019s policy provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">\u201cAllstate will pay for all damages an insured person is legally obligated to pay\u2014because of bodily injury or property damage meaning:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">1. bodily injury, sickness, disease or death to any person, including loss of services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">2. damage to or destruction of property, including loss of use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Under the heading \u201cLimits of Liability\u201d the policy provided (emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">\u201cThe limits shown on the declarations page are the maximum we [Allstate] will pay for any single auto accident. The limit stated for each person for bodily injury applies to all damages arising from bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death sustained by one person in any one occurrence. Subject to the limit for each person, the occurrence limit is our [Allstate\u2019s] total limit of liability for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>legal damages for bodily injury sustained by two or more persons in any one occurrence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Based on the first passage, the plaintiff argued that \u201closs of services\u201d had been defined in the policy as a type of \u201cbodily injury\u201d and that the \u201cper occurrence\u201d limitation of $100,000.00 applied. Allstate argued that an incorporeal injury, such as loss of services, does not constitute \u201cbodily injury\u201d within the meaning of the policy. Instead, the argument continued, only those who suffered physical injury in the accident, here Thomas Valliere, have sustained \u201cbodily injury\u201d within the meaning of the policy. According to Allstate, because only one person had sustained \u201cbodily injury,\u201d the \u201cper person\u201d limit of $50,000.00 applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The circuit court granted summary judgment in Allstate\u2019s favor, and declared that the \u201cper person\u201d limit was applicable and that the amount of coverage available under the policy was $50,000.00. The plaintiff noted an appeal, and, prior to argument in the Court of Special Appeals, this Court issued a writ of certiorari to consider the policy interpretation issue. We conclude that, in light of the specific language in Allstate\u2019s policy, \u201closs of services\u201d is defined as a type of \u201cbodily injury\u201d and, therefore, the $100,000.00 \u201cper occurrence\u201d limit of the Allstate policy applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">It is settled that in construing insurance contracts, words are to be given their customary and normal meaning, <em>Pacific Indem. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>302 Md. 383, 388, 488 A.2d 486, 488 (1985); <em>C &amp; H Plumbing v. Employers Mut., </em>264 Md. 510, 511, 287 A.2d 238, 239 (1972), unless there is evidence that the parties intended to employ the language in a special sense. <em>Cheney v. Bell National Life, </em>315 Md. 761, 766, 556 A.2d 1135, 1138 (1989). When a policy defines a term in a manner which differs from the ordinary understanding of that term, the policy definition controls. <em>See Women\u2019s Hospital v. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>177 Md. 615, 623, 11 A.2d 457, 461 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Loss of consortium or other service is not a bodily injury within the meaning of usual insurance policy language, but is a consequential damage resulting from bodily injury to another person. <em>Daley v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>312 Md. 550, 553-560, 541 A.2d 632, 633-636 (1988); <em>Pacific Indent, v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas. Co., supra, </em>302 Md. at 403 n. 3, 488 A.2d at 496 n. 3; <em>Travelers Indent. Co. v. Cornelsen, </em>272 Md. 48, 51, 321 A.2d 149, 150 (1974). We continue to agree with this interpretation of normal insurance policy language and with the great number of opinions taking this position.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the insurance policy involved in the present case, however, the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d is specifically defined to include \u201closs of services.\u201d The insurer is bound by that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>An appellate court in Oregon has interpreted the identical Allstate policy language and determined that the policy defined \u201cbodily injury\u201d to include \u201closs of services.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Handegard, </em>70 Or.App. 262, 265-266, 688 P.2d 1387, 1389 (1984), <em>rev. denied, </em>298 Or. 704, 695 P.2d 1371 (1985). In <em>Handegard, </em>the plaintiff was permitted to recover for her loss of consortium claim under the \u201cper occurrence\u201d rather than the \u201cper person\u201d limit. The Court stated (70 Or.App. at 266, 688 P.2d at 1389):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">\u201cWhen a policy of insurance defines terms in a manner which differs from the ordinary understanding of those terms, the policy definition controls____ This policy does just that when it defines loss of services as a form of bodily injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\"><em>Handegard </em>is apparently the only case where the court\u2019s holding is based on the identical Allstate policy language. Other courts, however, have construed very similar language as including \u201closs of services\u201d within the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d and have upheld coverage under the \u201cper occurrence\u201d limitation of the respective policies. <em>See, e.g., Giardino v. Fierke, </em>160 Ill.App.3d 648, 655, 112 Ill.Dec. 559, 613, 513 N.E.2d 1168, 1172 (2d Dist.1987), <em>app. denied, </em>119 Ill.2d 556, 119 Ill.Dec. 384, 522 N.E.2d 1243 (1988) (bodily injury means bodily injury to any person and included sickness, disease, death or loss of services which result from it); <em>Worcester Ins. v. Fells Acres Day School, </em>408 Mass. 393, 558 N.E.2d 958, 971 (1990) (\u201cpolicy defines \u2018bodily injury\u2019 as \u2018bodily injury, sickness or disease, including care, loss of services and death resulting therefrom\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Moreover, several appellate opinions have discussed <em>Handegard </em>and distinguished it from the cases before them on the ground that the language of the Allstate policy in <em>Handegard </em>defined \u201cbodily injury\u201d to include \u201closs of services.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Campbell v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Ariz., </em>155 Ariz. 102, 107, 745 P.2d 160, 165 (App.1987); <em>Filip v. North River Ins. Co., </em>201 Ill.App.3d 351, 147 Ill.Dec. 17,19, 559 N.E;2d 17, 19 (1990); <em>Sicoli v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>464 N.W.2d 300, 302 (Minn.App.1990); <em>Bain v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>Gleason, </em>223 Mont. 442, 447, 726 P.2d 1153, 1158 (1986); <em>Viking Ins. of Wisconsin v. Popken, </em>102 Or.App. 660, 663, 795 P.2d 1091, 1092, <em>rev. denied, </em>310 Or. 547, 800 P.2d 789 (1990); <em>McGovern v. Williams, </em>741 S.W.2d 373, 376 (Tex. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Consequently, the appellate opinions in our sister states, with apparent unanimity, have viewed policy language like that in the present case as treating loss of services as a bodily injury. What we said in <em>Pacific Indem. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas., supra, </em>302 Md. at 401, 488 A.2d at 495, quoting <em>Fisher v. Tyler, </em>284 Md. 100, 106, 394 A.2d 1199, 1203 (1978), is applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">\u201c[T]he application of this policy provision in a factual posture similar to that presented here has been before the courts of our sister states. The decisions of these jurisdictions have special significance in this context because heretofore this Court has recognized that \u2018like a state which adopts, by copying, a foreign statute, ... parties who adopt an insurance policy, which apparently has had nationwide use and has been judicially construed in five or six states, adopt with it the uniform judicial construction that it has received in other states.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Allstate argues that the words \u201cto any person\u201d in the phrase \u201c(1) bodily injury, sickness, disease or death to any person, including loss of services ...,\u201d are significant because they separate \u201closs of services\u201d from the definition of \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Allstate asserts that the phrase \u201cincluding loss of services\u201d qualifies the word \u201cdamages\u201d in the preceding paragraph and that this, coupled with the absence of \u201closs of services\u201d from the Limitations of Liability section, evidences an intent to provide coverage for consequential damages under the \u201cper person\u201d limit when those damages arise from a single bodily injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Allstate\u2019s position is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>grammatically incorrect. To reiterate, the Allstate policy states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">\u201cAllstate will pay for all damages an insured person is legally obligated to pay\u2014because of bodily injury or property damage meaning:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">1. bodily injury, sickness, disease or death to any person, including loss of services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">2. damage to or destruction of property, including loss of use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Clearly the colon following the word \u201cmeaning\u201d indicates that the series which follow define the words \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cproperty damages\u201d respectively. The effect is that \u201cbodily injury\u201d means \u201cbodily injury, sickness, disease or death to any person, including loss of services.\u201d The plaintiff correctly argues that the language \u201cincluding loss of services\u201d modifies \u201cbodily injury.\u201d The policy unambiguously defines \u201closs of services\u201d as a type of \u201cbodily injury,\u201d and the language is not reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Even assuming arguendo that the policy were ambiguous, the ambiguity would be resolved against the insurance company which prepared the policy and in favor of the insured. As this Court stated in <em>Haynes v. Am. Cas. Co., </em>228 Md. 394, 400, 179 A.2d 900, 904 (1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">\u201cWe have made it clear that where an insurance company, in attempting to limit coverage, employs ambiguous language, the ambiguity will be resolved against it as the one who drafted the instrument____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Mar.
