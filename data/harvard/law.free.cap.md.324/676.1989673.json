The court imposed ten conditions of probation, one of which, Rule 2, required that Baldwin \u201c[w]ork or attend school regularly as directed by his Probation Agent.\u201d Rule 9 required that Baldwin pay court costs of $70 and an attorney fee to the Office of the Public Defender, later fixed in the amount of $3,000. The Rule 9 condition of probation also specified that, as to count 5 only, Baldwin must pay a $15,000 fine. A special condition imposed by Rule 10 required that Baldwin reimburse the Public Defender for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>services rendered, and pay the fine, within four years of his release from confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Baldwin was released on probation on August 21, 1985. Subsequently, on October 24, 1989, he was charged with a violation of the probationary conditions imposed upon him by Rule 9. He was not charged with violating Rule 2, which required that he work or attend school regularly. In a narrative portion of the probation agent\u2019s report to the court, it was stated that Baldwin had chosen to remain unemployed throughout his probationary period. The report further opined that Baldwin could have obtained employment had he tried, and thereby gained the resources needed to comply with the requirements of Rule 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">At the hearing, the probation agent testified that Baldwin was not employed \u201cthroughout his probation period, nor has he sought employment.\u201d The agent said that Baldwin believed that he was unemployable because of his bad reputation and always gave excuses for not applying for employment. The agent testified that Baldwin reported to her on a monthly basis, as required, and except for his failure to pay the money which he owed, which totalled $18,070, and to work regularly or attend school, he was in compliance with the conditions of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Baldwin testified that he was a self-employed photographer and handyman; that when released on probation, he tried to work five days a week but earned less than $1,000 a year; and that he was unable to satisfy the conditions of Rule 9 in view of his paltry income. He also testified that he owed the state and federal government over $9,000,000 in delinquent taxes and penalties. The evidence showed that Baldwin had not made any of the payments ordered by the court when it placed him on probation. Asked about his \u201cnet worth,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI\u2019m not worth anything ... don\u2019t own a car, don\u2019t own a truck. I don\u2019t have any tangible valuables.\u201d He also said that he was living with his parents and tried to pay $100 a month to them for rent, if he could.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Upon questioning Baldwin, the court ascertained that he held a college degree in social services; that he was thirty-six years of age; that before his convictions, he worked as an automotive parts supply clerk; and that upon his release from confinement, he had filed applications for employment but, because of his bad reputation, was not employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">In closing argument, the State\u2019s Attorney said that payment of the $15,000 fine was a condition of probation only as to count 5, while the Public Defender and court costs obligations applied to all three counts. The prosecutor urged the court to find that Baldwin had violated his probation as to each of the three counts because he had made no payments. Moreover, the State argued that there was no evidence that Baldwin \u201csought employment making use of his degree in ... social studies,\u201d and he thereby failed to comply with the conditions of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Baldwin argued that he was indigent and could not, therefore, satisfy the monetary payment conditions of Rule 9.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He said that he maintained regular employment to the extent that he could find employment. He also spoke of a physical disability, from which he suffered, which m\u00e1de it difficult for him to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The court found that \u201cthe monetary conditions\u201d of the probation order applied only to payment of the $15,000 fine imposed under count 5 and the $3,000 reimbursement to the Public Defender. It next said that the Rule 2 condition of probation that Baldwin \u201cremain employed or go to school\u201d applied to all counts and that Baldwin had not complied with this condition. The court remarked that Baldwin had no job during the probationary period, \u201cno regular income, and made not one penny in payment, that is as deliberate and complete a violation of the conditions of probation as I can envision.\u201d Upon this foundation, the court next said that it had no difficulty in finding Baldwin in violation of the conditions of probation as to all three counts. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>the court concluded that Baldwin violated \u201cthe monetary payment provisions as respects count 5, and also a violation of the remaining employed and/or going to school provision.\u201d As to counts 7 and 8, the court stated that there was \u201cno monetary requirement attached to the probation periods in these counts, that violation of probation is failure to be employed or go to school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">The court revoked Baldwin\u2019s probation on all three counts. It reimposed the one-year suspended sentence as to each count, to run consecutively, for a total of three years. At this juncture, Baldwin interjected that the court was revoking his probation, notwithstanding his inability to pay. The court made no finding as to Baldwin\u2019s indigency. It stated its belief that Baldwin was capable of working and paying the obligations but chose not to do so. The court\u2019s revocation of Baldwin\u2019s probation, based in part on the uncharged violation of Rule 2, was not challenged at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Baldwin appealed, arguing before the Court of Special Appeals that the trial court abused its discretion by revoking his probation on the basis of an uncharged violation, namely, that he failed to work regularly or attend school. The intermediate appellate court concluded, in an unreported opinion, that because Baldwin failed to object at the trial, the issue was waived and thus was not preserved for appellate review under Maryland Rule 8-131(a). We granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Consistent with the trial court\u2019s findings, Baldwin asserts that the monetary payment conditions of Rule 9 applied only to count 5, and not to counts 7 or 8. Thus, he says that because the State charged a violation only of Rule 9, applicable solely to count 5, the maximum sentence that could be reimposed for violating this condition is one year. Even though the trial court made no determination as to Baldwin\u2019s claim of indigency, he does not appear to contest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>the court\u2019s revocation of his probation for nonpayment of his monetary obligations; indeed, it is likely that he has already served the one-year term for violation of this condition during the pendency of the appellate process.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Baldwin\u2019s focus is solely upon counts 7 and 8 and the reimposition of the consecutive one-year sentences on those counts. He argues that, while he voiced no objection to the court's decision revoking his probation as to those counts on the basis of the uncharged violation of Rule 2, the trial court plainly abused its discretion in so acting. He suggests that, because the petition to revoke his probation did not charge a violation of Rule 2, \u201cproceedings as to that particular condition have not been initiated, and the trial court has no authority to render judgment on a claim of violation of that condition.\u201d Baldwin contends that, in these circumstances, an objection was unnecessary to preserve his right to appellate review of the court\u2019s determination to revoke his probation on the basis of an uncharged violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The State acknowledges that it should have charged Baldwin with violations of both Rules 2 and 9. It says, however, that the narrative portion of the probation agent\u2019s report afforded actual notice to Baldwin that his employment record would be at issue at the probation revocation hearing. According to the State, Baldwin\u2019s failure to object to inquiry into his failure to be regularly employed constituted a waiver of his right to appellate review. The State likens its failure to formally charge a violation of Rule 2, in its revocation petition, to a \u201cprocedural defect\u201d in the initiation of the action which was waived by Baldwin\u2019s failure to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">A violation of probation case is firmly established as a civil action. <em>Chase v. State, </em>309 Md. 224, 239, 522 A.2d 1348 (1987). Consequently, as we said in that case, all of the panoply of rights usually associated with a criminal case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>is not an incident of a violation of probation case. <em>Id. </em>at 239, 522 A.2d 1348. On the other hand, violation of probation proceedings often involves depriving a defendant of his liberty, a result that may be accomplished, consistent with the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, only by providing \u201cmany, though not all, of the constitutional protections available to criminal defendants.\u201d <em>Hersch v. State, </em>317 Md. 200, 207, 562 A.2d 1254 (1989). Thus, the Supreme Court has said that, at a constitutional minimum, due process considerations require that a probationer be afforded \u201cwritten notice of the claimed violations of his probation.\u201d <em>Black v. Romano, </em>471 U.S. 606, 612, 105 S.Ct. 2254, 2258, 85 L.Ed.2d 636 (1985). To the same effect, <em>see Bearden v. Georgia, </em>461 U.S. 660, 103 S.Ct. 2064, 76 L.Ed.2d 221 (1983); <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 781-82, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 1759, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973); <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972); <em>Adkins v. State, </em>324 Md. 641, 655 n. 8, 598 A.2d 194, 201 n. 8 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Maryland Rule 4-347(a) requires that \u201c[proceedings for revocation of probation shall be initiated by an order directing the issuance of a summons or warrant.\u201d It also requires that the order \u201cstate each condition of probation that the defendant is charged with having violated and the nature of the violation.\u201d Rule 4-347(e) requires that the scheduling of the probation revocation hearing \u201cafford the defendant a reasonable opportunity to prepare a defense to the charges.\u201d <em>See also </em>Code (1987 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">As we see it, the probation agent\u2019s commentary in her report concerning Baldwin\u2019s failure to work is not the legal equivalent of a formal charge in the State\u2019s petition for revocation that Baldwin violated the conditions of Rule 2. In our view, due process considerations are not satisfied absent a more focused formal notification of the State\u2019s reliance on Rule 2. As stated in <em>Gagnon, supra, </em>411 U.S. at 779, 93 S.Ct. at 1758, the legality of probation revocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>proceedings \u201cis tested by fundamental fairness\u2014the touchstone of due process.\u201d Consistent with this well-settled principle, our cases hold that a decision to revoke probation cannot be based, in whole or in part, on an improper ground. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. State, </em>306 Md. 1, 7, 506 A.2d 1165 (1986); <em>Howlett v. State, </em>295 Md. 419, 427, 456 A.2d 375 (1983); <em>Dean v. State, </em>291 Md. 198, 202, 434 A.2d 552 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Maryland Rule 8-131(a) provides that an appellate court ordinarily will not decide any issue (except certain issues of jurisdiction) \u201cunless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d The rule further provides that the Court \u201cmay decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">While it is true that constitutional rights may be waived if not timely asserted, <em>see, e.g., Hardaway v. State, </em>317 Md. 160, 169, 562 A.2d 1234 (1989), the record in this case discloses that Baldwin had little opportunity to challenge the court\u2019s invocation of Rule 2 when, at the conclusion of the hearing, it revoked Baldwin\u2019s probation on Counts 7 and 8 based on that uncharged violation. It was not until after the court\u2019s decision was rendered that the court\u2019s use of Rule 2 to revoke probation became fully evident. Even though Baldwin did not object at that time, his inaction in this regard is not the equivalent of a knowing and intelligent waiver of his constitutional right to due process. We hold that the court\u2019s utilization of the uncharged violation of probation constituted error and that the issue may properly be asserted on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Indeed, the result reached by the intermediate appellate court in its unreported opinion in this case is directly contrary to its reported decision in <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>58 Md.App. 113, 472 A.2d 494 (1984). There, as here, the trial court revoked probation, based on an uncharged violation. No objection was entered at that time by the probationer. The Court of Special Appeals found no merit in the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>argument that there was a waiver. That it deemed the question properly before it for appellate review is evident from its reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment. We reach the same result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">JUDGMENT REVOKING PROBATION AS TO COUNTS 7 AND 8 VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CECIL COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.
