The facts on which the motion was based are those alleged in the complaint and those contained in several depositions. They disclose the following. At the time the events which gave rise to this action occurred, the plaintiff, Thach Le, was employed as a sales person by the defendant, Federated Department Stores, Inc., doing business as Bloomingdale\u2019s. He worked at a Federated store in Montgomery County, Maryland. On the morning of April 11, 1983, Mr. Le arrived for work and left his briefcase, containing \u201ctax papers,\u201d in the store\u2019s stockroom on top of a box. According to Mr. Le, Federated provided him \u201cwith no locker or any type of secure area where he could place his personal property while at work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>with a reasonable expectation that such personal property would be secure from interference by other employees.\u201d That same day, after returning from lunch, he was told by Clarence Rich, a Federated detective, to accompany Mr. Rich to the security office and bring his briefcase. Suzanne Spahr, the Regional Director of Security for Federated, was waiting in the security office when Mr. Le arrived with Mr. Rich.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">According to Mr. Le, Mrs. Spahr falsely told him that someone saw him steal a calculator and conceal it in his briefcase. When Mr. Le protested, Mrs. Spahr told Mr. Le that, if he did not sign a statement confessing to the theft, Federated would prosecute, and he would have to spend substantial time in jail. Mr. Le claimed that he was not allowed to leave the security office or to make a telephone call unless he signed a statement. Mr. Rich, who was physically larger than Mr. Le, blocked the exit to the security area during Mr. Le\u2019s detention. Mr. Le eventually signed a statement confessing to the theft of the calculator, although he claimed that he did not read the statement. He was then led crying out of the store through the part of the store where he had worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">As a result of the incident, Mr. Le\u2019s employment was terminated by Federated. A few days after the incident, Mr. Le told Federated\u2019s personnel office that he did not steal the calculator, and he applied for reinstatement. Federated, however, denied his application for reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"Amf\">Mr. Le further alleged that in</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">\u201can effort to ascertain who placed the calculator in his case, Mr. Le went back and talked to employees. He learned from Lynn Gunther, another sales person, that Mrs. Spahr had gotten a calculator. Mrs. Spahr told Lynn she would probably buy it, and she would bring it back to Lynn if she didn\u2019t like it. He learned from Janet Dolan that Clarence [Rich] and Mrs. Spahr went in the stockroom and she heard some noise back there. From his investigation, Le concluded that the security people had put the calculator in his briefcase.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Mr. Le subsequently instituted the present action by filing a complaint against Mrs. Spahr and Federated in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. His complaint, as amended, contained counts charging false arrest, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and defamation. According to the complaint, the injuries resulting from the incident included Mr. Le\u2019s inability to secure employment \u201cin his chosen field\u201d and his inability to obtain other employment except as a \u201cbus boy\u201d at a much lower hourly wage rate. Mr. Le also asserted that the incident \u201chas changed his whole way of dealing with people,\u201d that he finds it difficult to trust people, that he \u201cis now afraid to lay anything down that someone could put something into,\u201d and that he could not \u201csleep for weeks after his discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">After considerable discovery, and after the setting and postponement of numerous trial dates, Federated filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that Mr. Le\u2019s action against Federated was barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Code (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol., 1990 Cum.Supp.), Article 101, \u00a7 15, which states that the employer\u2019s liability for payment of workers\u2019 compensation provided for in the statute shall be the exclusive remedy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Federated, in its motion and accompanying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>memorandum, did not assert that Mr. Le had sustained \u201can accidental personal injury\u201d and did not explain why \u00a7 15 was involved. Instead, Federated simply made the bald assertion that \u00a7 15 was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The focus of Federated\u2019s argument for summary judgment was upon \u00a7 44 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, which preserves an employee\u2019s right to file a common law action against his employer if the employee\u2019s injury resulted \u201cfrom the deliberate intention of his employer to produce such injury____\u201d Relying on two Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinions, <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Mirabile, </em>52 Md. App. 387, 449 A.2d 1176 (1982), and <em>Schatz v. York Steak House, </em>51 Md.App. 494, 444 A.2d 1045 (1982), Federated argued that Mr. Le could opt to sue the employer at common law, as allowed under \u00a7 44, only if Mrs. Spahr was the \u201calter ego\u201d of Federated or if she acted with its express authorization when she committed the acts on which Mr. Le\u2019s suit was based. Federated went on to argue that Mrs. Spahr was not the alter ego of Federated and that her alleged acts had not been expressly authorized. Federated insisted that \u201c[t]he facts of the case at hand are substantially the same as those in <em>Continental v. Mirabile.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The plaintiff Le, in his opposition to Federated\u2019s motion for summary judgment, also did not discuss whether Art. 101, \u00a7 15, encompassed his claim. Instead, the thrust of the plaintiff\u2019s argument was to distinguish <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Mirabile, supra, </em>and <em>Schatz v. York Steak House, supra. </em>The plaintiff argued that Mrs. Spahr was in a different position than the employees involved in <em>Mirabile </em>and <em>Schatz, </em>as \u201cSpahr was the Regional Director for security for [Federated] in the Washington area, and worked at both the Tyson\u2019s and White Flint Stores____ She was the final authority for security policies of defendant [Federated] in the Washington area.\u201d The plaintiff also pointed out that, in <em>Mirabile </em>and <em>Schatz, </em>the exclusivity bar of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and the construction of the \u00a7 44 exception to exclusivity adopted in those cases, were applied only to the assault and battery counts and not to other intentional torts. The plaintiff further argued that the refusal to reinstate Mr. Le constituted ratification of Mrs. Spahr\u2019s acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The circuit court granted Federated\u2019s motion for summary judgment, stating: \u201cThe Plaintiff seeks to distinguish this case from <em>Continental Casualty Company [v. Mirabile]. </em>He didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t. For that reason I will grant the motion for summary judgment on behalf of the Federated Department Stores, trading as Bloomingdale\u2019s.\u201d The circuit judge did not discuss the applicability of Art. 101, \u00a7 15, to the plaintiff\u2019s claim; in fact, the judge made no mention of \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">When the circuit court refused the plaintiff\u2019s request to finalize the judgment pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602(b), the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his action against Mrs. Spahr, making the judgment in favor of Federated final. The plaintiff then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed, holding that because \u201c[t]here was no claim for any physical injuries\u201d to Mr. Le, his claim was not compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and that, therefore, it did not fall within the exclusivity provision of \u00a7 15. <em>Le v. Federated </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Department Stores, </em>80 Md.App. 89, 90, 560 A.2d 42 (1989). The intermediate appellate court, relying upon cases in some other states, took the position that \u201cnon-physical injury torts are [not] within the ambit of the [Workmen\u2019s Compensation] Act\u201d and that \u201ctort actions are not barred by Workers\u2019 Compensation Acts when the essence of the injury is non-physical.\u201d <em>Le v. Federated Department Stores, supra, </em>80 Md.App. at 92, 560 A.2d at 43. The court distinguished its earlier decisions in <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Mirabile, supra, </em>52 Md.App. 387, 449 A.2d 1176, and <em>Schatz v. York Steak House, supra, </em>51 Md.App. 494, 444 A.2d 1045, on the ground that <em>\u201cSehatz </em>and <em>Mirabile </em>involved physical and psychological injuries for which compensation is provided under the Act.\u201d <em>Le v. Federated Department Stores, supra, </em>80 Md.App. at 90-91, 560 A.2d at 42. The Court of Special Appeals concluded (80 Md.App. at 93, 560 A.2d at 44):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">\u201cThe quiddity of false arrest, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress is non-physical. Those torts are ordinarily outside the scope of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Since they are not within the Act, the statute does not protect the employer from actions grounded on those particular torts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Federated filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, contending that \u201c[t]he facts of the present case are indistinguishable from those in <em>Mirabile\u201d </em>and that \u201cthere appear to be only two alternatives for this Court; either overrule <em>Mirabile </em>or reverse the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision in the present case.\u201d (Petition For a Writ of Certiorari, pp. 7-8). Federated maintained that <em>Mirabile </em>involved intentional torts committed by employees whose positions were similar to that of Mrs. Spahr in the present case. Federated also insisted \u201cthat both Mirabile and Le, if believed, sustained exactly the same injuries, namely continuing emotional or psychological trauma.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 10-11). Federated argued that the injuries in this case were compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, that the <em>Mirabile </em>and <em>Sehatz </em>cases were correctly decided, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>that \u00a7 44 of the statute did not give Mr. Le the option of filing a common law tort action against the employer Federated because Mrs. Spahr was not the \u201calter ego\u201d of the employer corporation and the corporation had not expressly authorized her intentional tortious acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We granted the petition and shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. We do so, however, on different grounds than those relied upon by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">As previously discussed, neither the parties nor the trial judge dealt with the the applicability or scope of Art. 101, \u00a7 15, in connection with the motion for summary judgment and the ruling thereon. The only issue addressed in the circuit court was whether those parts of the opinions in <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Mirabile, supra, </em>and <em>Schatz v. York Steak House, supra, </em>relating to the right to sue under Art. 101, \u00a7 44, required summary judgment in favor of Federated.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Ordinarily, an appellate court should review a grant of summary judgment only on the grounds relied upon by the trial court. <em>Boyer v. State, </em>323 Md. 558, 588, 594 A.2d 121, 136 (1991); <em>Orkin v. Holy Cross Hospital, </em>318 Md. 429, 435, 569 A.2d 207, 210 (1990); <em>Three Garden v. USF &amp; G, </em>318 Md. 98, 107-108, 567 A.2d 85, 89 (1989); <em>Geisz v. Greater Baltimore Medical, </em>313 Md. 301, 314 n. 5, 545 A.2d 658, 664 n. 5 (1988). It may be that, analytically, the applicability of \u00a7 15 to the plaintiffs claim was implicitly decided by the trial court, as \u00a7 44 and its construction in <em>Mirabile </em>and <em>Schatz </em>only become relevant if the claim is encompassed by \u00a7 15. Section 44 grants to the employee the <em>option, </em>under certain circumstances, to take compensation under \u00a7 15 or to file a lawsuit against the employer; therefore, \u00a7 44 applies only to claims covered by \u00a7 15. Nevertheless, because of the failure of the parties and the trial court to address specifically the applicability of \u00a7 15 to the plaintiffs claim, and because we need not decide in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>case whether \u00a7 15 encompassed the plaintiffs claim, we shall not reach the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">It is unnecessary for us to decide whether Mr. Le\u2019s claim was or was not covered under \u00a7 15 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act for the following reasons. If Mr. Le\u2019s claim was not covered under \u00a7 15 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the exclusivity provision in \u00a7 15 of the Act would have no application and the common law tort action could be maintained. If Mr. Le\u2019s claim was covered by \u00a7 15, we believe that, under the particular circumstances of this case, \u00a7 44 grants Mr. Le the option of bringing this common law action against his employer for damages resulting from the intentional torts of false arrest, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and defamation. In our view, the construction of \u00a7 44 by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Mirabile, supra, 52 </em>Md.App. 387, 449 A.2d 1176, and <em>Schatz v. York Steak House, supra, </em>51 Md.App. 494, 444 A.2d 1045, was too narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Section 44 states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">\u201c\u00a7 44. Option to take benefits under article or sue where injury or death results from deliberate intention of employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">\u201cIf injury or death results to a workman from the deliberate intention of his employer to produce such injury or death, the employee, the widow, widower, child, children or dependents of the employee shall have the privilege either to take under this article or have cause of action against such employer, as if this article had not been passed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Long ago this Court set forth the principles governing the interpretation of Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act <em>(Frazier v. Leas, </em>127 Md. 572, 575, 96 A. 764, 765 (1916)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3\"><em>\u201cFirst </em>the intention of the Legislature as expressed in the words of the Act must be ascertained and given effect; <em>secondly, </em>\u2018the language of a statute is its most natural expositor, and where the language is susceptible of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>sensible interpretation, it is not to be controlled by any extraneous considerations\u2019 <em>{Alexander v. Worthington, </em>5 Md. 471); <em>thirdly, </em>the construction must be liberal in favor of private right, and construction which imputes an intention to deny valuable rights should be avoided; <em>fourthly, </em>statutes are presumed to be passed in full recognition of the constitutional rights of the citizen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL\"><em>See </em>53 E. Singleton, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation in Maryland </em>76, (Johns Hopkins University Historical Studies 1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">In light of these principles, \u00a7 44 would seem to cover this case. The language grants the employee the option of maintaining a \u201ccause of action against [an] employer\u201d for an injury resulting \u201cfrom the deliberate intention of his employer to. produce such injury.\u201d Mr. Le\u2019s allegations appear to be sufficient to assert an injury resulting from the deliberate intention of Mrs. Spahr to produce the injury. While Mrs. Spahr was not the \u201cemployer,\u201d \u00a7 44 goes on to provide that the employee\u2019s cause of action against his employer is \u201cas if this article had not been passed.\u201d Absent any bar to suit in Article 101, under Maryland common law an employer ordinarily can be sued for intentional tortious acts committed by one of his employees acting within the scope of employment. <em>Cox v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>296 Md. 162, 170-171, 460 A.2d 1038, 1042-1043 (1983); <em>Drug Fair v. Smith, </em>263 Md. 341, 343-351, 283 A.2d 392, 394-398 (1971); <em>Lewis v. Accelerated Express, </em>219 Md. 252, 148 A.2d 783 (1959). <em>See Sawyer v. Humphries, </em>322 Md. 247, 587 A.2d 467 (1991); <em>Ennis v. Crenca, </em>322 Md. 285, 587 A.2d 485 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">As previously mentioned, the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Continental Casualty Company v. Mirabile, supra, 52 </em>Md.App. 387, 449 A.2d 1176, and <em>Schatz v. York Steak House, supra, </em>51 Md.App. 494, 444 A.2d 1045, took the position that, for an employee to be able to maintain a \u00a7 44 action against his employer, \u201cabsent express authorization by the employer, the [employer\u2019s] agent [committing the intentional tort] must be the \u2018alter ego\u2019 of the employer in order for his intentional misconduct to be attributed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>employer.\u201d <em>Schatz v. York Steak House, supra, </em>51 Md. App. at 496-497, 444 A.2d at 1047. The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Mirabile, </em>52 Md.App. at 396-397, 449 A.2d at 1182-1183, also indicated its view that it is unfair and \u201cthere is no justification in holding the employer liable for an employee\u2019s intentional acts\u201d where \u201cit is neither the employer personally nor someone acting as the alter ego of the employer who commits the intentional tort____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The tort suit in the <em>Schatz </em>case was an assault and battery action based upon a rape. In <em>Mirabile, </em>the employee\u2019s suit against the employer contained counts asserting assault and battery, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The employee did suffer physical injury resulting from the assault and battery. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding in <em>Mirabile, </em>that the tort action was barred by the exclusivity provision in Art. 101, \u00a7 15, and that the exception in Art. 101, \u00a7 44, was inapplicable, related solely to the assault and battery count. The intermediate appellate court\u2019s rulings on the other counts were unrelated to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Consequently, the assertion by Federated and the circuit court that the present case is indistinguishable from <em>Mirabile </em>is not entirely accurate. Nonetheless, as earlier stated, we believe that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 construction of \u00a7 44 in <em>Schatz </em>and <em>Mirabile </em>is too narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Schatz </em>and <em>Mirabile </em>relied on cases from Illinois, Utah, Alaska, and Montana, and on a federal case applying Georgia law. Not one of the jurisdictions cited by the Court of Special Appeals, however, has a provision in its workers\u2019 compensation statute similar to \u00a7 44 of Maryland\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act granting employees the option of suing their employers for injuries resulting from a deliberate intent to injure. In many jurisdictions where there are no statutory provisions like \u00a7 44, the courts have created a limited exception to coverage provisions like our \u00a7 15, which provides for workers\u2019 compensation and makes the workers\u2019 compensation remedy exclusive. This judicially created exception allows a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>worker to sue his employer if the employer himself or the employer\u2019s \u201calter ego\u201d intentionally injures the worker or if the employer expressly authorized the intentional injury. <em>See e.g., Bryan v. Utah International, </em>533 P.2d 892, 894-895 (Utah 1975). <em>See also </em>2A Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 68.10 through \u00a7 68.36 (1990). Different reasons have been advanced to support the exception, such as the injury was not \u201caccidental,\u201d an injury resulting from the deliberate intention of the employer \u201cdoes not arise out of the employment,\u201d or reasons of public policy. <em>See </em>2A, Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, supra, </em>\u00a7 68.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">This judicially created exception is limited to situations where the employer himself or the employer\u2019s \u201calter ego\u201d commits the intentional tort, or the employer expressly authorizes the intentional tort. The exception, and the \u201calter ego\u201d limitation to the exception, represent interpretations of provisions comparable to Maryland\u2019s \u00a7 15. Consequently, construing \u00a7 44 as embodying the same exception, and the same \u201calter ego\u201d limitation to the exception, renders \u00a7 44 superfluous. If we were to follow the authorities relied on by the Court of Special Appeals, the exception and \u201calter ego\u201d limitation would exist absent \u00a7 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">There is another problem with construing \u00a7 44 as simply embodying the judicially-created exception to coverage provisions like our \u00a7 15. As indicated above, there are several rationales for the exception. Professor Larson states that \u201c[t]he best [legal theory supporting the exception] is that the employer will not be heard to allege that the injury was \u2018accidental\u2019 ... when he himself intentionally committed the act.\u201d Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 68.11, at 18-4. This rationale, as well as some of the other theories given, would indicate that an injury resulting from the deliberate intent to injure by the employer himself, or the employer\u2019s \u201calter ego,\u201d is not within a basic coverage provision like \u00a7 15. Section 44, however, is only applicable to injuries encompassed by \u00a7 15. Section 44 gives an employee the <em>option </em>of taking workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the statute or of suing as if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the statute had not been passed. In light of this, it makes little sense to equate \u00a7 44 with a judicially-created exception to compensation coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">There are only a handful of jurisdictions that have adopted provisions similar to \u00a7 44 in their workers\u2019 compensation statutes. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ky.Rev.Stat. (1972, 1983 Repl. Vol., 1990 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 342.610; La.Rev.Stat. (1985, 1991 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 23:1032; Mich.Comp.Laws (1985, 1991 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 418.131; N.H.Rev.Stat. (1987, 1990 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 281-A:8; NJ.Stat. (1988,1991 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 34:15-8; Or. Rev.Stat. (1989, 1990 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 656.156; S.D. Codified Laws (1978, 1991 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 62-3-2; Wash.Rev.Code (1989, 1990 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 51.24.020; W.Va.Code (1966, 1985 Repl.Vol., 1991 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 23-4-2. A majority of the decisions in the states which have adopted a provision similar to Maryland\u2019s \u00a7 44 seem to reject imposing a requirement that the employer himself or the employer\u2019s \u201calter ego\u201d commit the intentional tort in order for the employee to sue the employer. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. Thomas, </em>426 So.2d 609, 612 (La.1983); <em>Radtke v. Everett, </em>189 Mich. App. 346 n. 11, 471 N.W.2d 660, 665 n. 11 (1991); <em>Millison, v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>101 N.J. 161, 184-186, 501 A.2d 505, 517-518 (1985); <em>Hardy v. State, </em>38 Wash. App. 399, 685 P.2d 610 (1984).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In some other jurisdictions having statutes authorizing intentional tort suits against the employer, where the legislatures intended to restrict the right to sue to intentional torts committed by the employer <em>personally </em>or by the employer\u2019s \u201calter ego,\u201d specific language was included in the statutory provisions reflecting this intent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Presum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>ably, if the General Assembly of Maryland had intended this particular limitation, it would have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">This Court has previously declined to insert language into \u00a7 44 to change the scope of an employee\u2019s right to sue his employer as provided for in that section. In <em>Johnson v. Mountaire Farms, </em>305 Md. 246, 503 A.2d 708 (1986), we rejected an attempt by the plaintiff to include \u201cgross, wanton, wilful or reckless negligence\u201d within the meaning of the term \u201cdeliberate intention\u201d used in \u00a7 44. The Court stated that the General Assembly intended the language of \u00a7 44 to \u201chave its commonly understood meaning\u201d and that the employer\u2019s grossly negligent conduct in failing to provide a safe place to work, in violation of government regulations, did \u201cnot constitute an intentional tort,\u201d 305 Md. at 255, 503 A.2d at 712. Just as we refused in the <em>Johnson </em>case to expand the coverage of \u00a7 44 beyond the plain statutory language, we should not in the present case restrict the coverage of \u00a7 44 by inserting specific conditions not set forth by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">When an employee suffers an injury resulting from a deliberate intent to injure him, \u00a7 44 authorizes a suit against the employer \u201cas if this article [Art. 101] had not been passed.\u201d Absent the bar of Art. 101, in order for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>employer to be held liable for the intentional torts of an employee committed within the scope of employment, the employee need not be the \u201calter <em>ego\u201d of </em>the employer. The employee\u2019s acts need not be \u201cexpressly authorized.\u201d <em>Sawyer v. Humphries, supra, </em>322 Md. at 254-255, 587 A.2d at 470; <em>Ennis v. Crenca, supra, </em>322 Md. at 293, 587 A.2d at 489; <em>Hopkins C. Co. v. Read Drug &amp; C. Co., </em>124 Md. 210, 214, 92 A. 478, 479-480 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Furthermore, although this Court has not explicitly discussed the issue presented in this case, our decisions support an employee\u2019s right under Art. 101, \u00a7 44, to sue his or her employer for some intentional torts based on the employer\u2019s vicarious liability for the conduct of a co-employee. <em>See, e.g., Young v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity, </em>303 Md. 182, 196-201, 492 A.2d 1270, 1277-1279 (1985); <em>General Motors Corp. v. Piskor, </em>281 Md. 627, 381 A.2d 16 (1977); <em>Harris v. Jones, </em>281 Md. 560, 380 A.2d 611 (1977); <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Company, Inc. v. Keulemans, </em>275 Md. 441, 340 A.2d 705 (1975). <em>See also Gallagher v. Bituminous Fire &amp; Mar. Ins., </em>303 Md. 201, 208-210, 492 A.2d 1280, 1283-1284 (1985) (relates to the scope of \u00a7 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">We do not mean to imply, however, that an employer\u2019s tort liability to an employee under \u00a7 44 is as broad as the employer\u2019s liability to third parties for intentional torts. Although not embodying the particular restriction upheld by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Mirabile </em>and <em>Schatz, </em>\u00a7 44 is obviously a limited statute. As previously discussed, it only covers situations encompassed by \u00a7 15. Moreover, the language \u201cdeliberate intention ... to produce such injury\u201d in \u00a7 44 clearly does not embrace all tort actions which are categorized as \u201cintentional torts.\u201d Finally, it may well be that the General Assembly, by the language \u201cthe deliberate intention of <em>his employer </em>to produce such injury,\u201d intended something less than the full sweep of common law respondeat superior liability. Some jurisdictions with statutes similar to \u00a7 44, while not adopt-' ing the \u201calter ego\u201d concept of <em>Schatz </em>and <em>Mirabile, </em>have appeared to limit the class of employee-tortfeasors for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>whose intentional torts the employer is vicariously liable under the statute. <em>See, e.g., Hardy v. State, supra, </em>685 P.2d at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Except for the \u201calter ego\u201d theory of <em>Sehatz </em>and <em>Mirabile, none </em>of the above-mentioned issues relating to the scope of \u00a7 44 were briefed and argued by the parties or have ever been raised in this case. Consequently, this would be an inappropriate case for exploring the reach of \u00a7 44. We hold only that, under the facts of this case, the circuit court should not have granted Federated\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on the <em>Mirabile </em>opinion. The facts alleged by the plaintiff would appear to be sufficient to show a deliberate intention to injure the plaintiff on the part of Mrs. Spahr. Whatever might be the scope of an employer\u2019s \u00a7 44 respondeat superior liability in other contexts, we believe that an employer can be held liable under \u00a7 44, with regard to the matter alleged in this case, for the intentional tortious acts of the employer\u2019s Regional Director of Security.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
