The pertinent facts are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-16\">On <em>September </em>24, 1957, the locus was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>owned by the defendants. On that date, the Lynn City Council voted that a .common sewer be constructed along a highway which abuts the locus and an order for the construction of the sewer was recorded in the Registry of Deeds on September 30, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">By quitclaim deed dated <em>February </em>27, 1962 and recorded March 1, 1962, the defendants conveyed locus to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">On <em>March </em>11, 1963, the City of Lynn issued a sewer assessment on the locus billing both the defendants and the plaintiffs in the amount of $70.00 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cTo Francis T. Sheehan, 132 Lynnfield Street, Lynn, Massachusetts, new owner, T. Harrington, Belliveau Drive, $70.00 and further states, \u201cinterest .commences April 11, 1963.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Neither party had actual knowledge of the sewer assessment before March 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The case of <em>Engel v. Thompson, </em>336 Mass. 529 is directly in point. There it is stated at page 530:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">\"It was early decided, comparing a sewer assessment to a tax assessment, that <em>a lien attaches to the land as soon as the order for the construction of the sewer is passed by the City Council </em>(emphasis supplied) and to follow those authorities holding that a grantor who conveys free from all incumbrances after the; order and the actual construction but prior to the assessment is liable for a breach of covenant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">The date of the actual construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>sewer in question is not contained in the report. However, we do not consider this essential. The order for the construction of the sewer constituted an incumbrance \u201csuffered\u201d by the defendants. The quitclaim deed of the defendants carried the covenant that the locus was free from incumbrances made or \u201csuffered\u201d by them. Since this covenant was breached, the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs for the amount of the assessment.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b92-5\">Arthur J.
