Fellows of Peabody, Massachusetts, a certain parcel of real estate situate in said Middleton, bounded and described as follows: [description.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-10\">\u201c It is hereby agreed and covenanted between the said Catherine Peabody and the said William H.

Fellows the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars ($150) together with all other expenses or charges the said Fellows may pay out for necessary repair, improvement or preservation of said property together with interest thereon from the date of any such payments, the said Fellows shall reconvey the said property to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the said Catherine Peabody and fully release said property from all claims, charges against, and interest he may have therein. And it is further agreed, understood and covenanted between the said Catherine Peabody and the said William H.

F. </em>Quinn, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-12\"><em>F. E.

The second count, after reciting the terms of the agreement, avers that the \u201c defendant further agreed to give a writing to said effect.\u201d The first count avers that the defendant \u201c agreed to execute and sign a certain instrument, a copy of which is hereto annexed,\u201d as a consideration for the land sold, and afterwards refused to sign or execute it. This construction of these counts is in accordance with the averments of the defendant\u2019s answer in which he pleads the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">Construing the first part of the declaration in this way, the principle of law on which the action is founded is, that if one has received money or other property as the consideration of an executory contract which cannot be enforced by reason of the statute of frauds, and if he then refuses to perform the contract, he is liable to the other party under an implied promise to return the money or pay for the property. <em>Basford </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>9 Allen, 387. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bemis, </em>108 Mass. 91. <em>White </em>v. <em>Wieland, </em>109 Mass. 291. <em>Dix </em>v. Marcy, 116 Mass. 416. <em>Root </em>v. Burt, 118 Mass. 521. <em>Parker </em>v. Tainter, 123 Mass. 185. <em>Twomey </em>v. Crowley, 137 Mass. 184. O\u2019 <em>Grady </em>v. O\u2019 <em>Grady, </em>162 Mass. 290. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>169 Mass. 134. This principle has often been applied when one who has received a conveyance of real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>estate refuses to perform his oral contract which was the consideration for the transfer. These counts of the declaration bring the case within this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The fourth count, considered apart from the others, is in the usual form of declaring on the common counts. Whether it will be sustained by the evidence is a question which is not now before us. It seems to state a good cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed ; demurrer overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
