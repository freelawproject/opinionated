The first count was under St. 1886, c. 140, allowing recovery for the loss of life of a passenger by reason of the gross negligence or carelessness of the servants or agents of a street railway company while engaged in its business. The second count was at common law to recover damages for conscious suffering. Writ dated March 9,1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2j\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Pierce, </em>J., the evidence tended to show that the intestate boarded a closed car of the defendant company in Lynn at about ten o\u2019clock \"in the evening of January <em>21,1899; </em>that it was a short car; that there were no gates on the car; that all of the seats inside the ear were taken, and that people were standing, both inside the car and on the platforms; that there were six or seven on the rear platform; that the intestate took a position on the rear platform of the car, between the step and the door on the right-hand side of the car as it proceeded; that he stood with his back to the body of the car, and it did not appear whether or not he had hold of anything in order to steady himself; that the car proceeded without incident until it came to the turnout or switch in front of the Corbett Schoolhouse on Franklin Street; that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>passed over the first frog and went to the right along the siding, and then turned to the left on to the main track again; that as it was passing over this second frog there was a swing or jar, and the plaintiff\u2019s intestate fell or was thrown from the car; that the car was stopped and the intestate was found unconscious beside the track; that he was taken to the Lynn Hospital, where he died within twenty-four hours.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-5\">Different witnesses described the cause of the accident as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-6\">\u201c As the car came to the main line it gave a kind of a swing and a jar and shake, and I probably would have been thrown off myself if I had n\u2019t held on.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-7\">\u201c I was leaning back to the railing, and caught the railing myself.

The car'was a short one running upon a single track, and had no gates upon the platforms. But such cars are common. There is no statute which forbids their use or requires them to be equipped with gates. The use of such a car was not negligence. The plaintiff\u2019s intestate was thrown to the ground by a swaying, or jolt, or lurch of the car, as it returned to the main track from a siding. Such motions of street cars are of common and frequent occurrence, and are to be expected to a greater or lesser degree whenever the car passes from one track to another, and so are of the class of usual and unavoidable incidents in the use of cars upon the streets. <em>Holland </em>v. <em>West End Street Railway, </em>155 Mass. 387. <em>Mc Cauley </em>v. <em>Springfield Street Railway, </em>169 Mass. 301. Unless they are unusual in degree and caused by some defect in the car or the track or by some unusual or dangerous rate of speed, they furnish no evidence of negligence on the part of the carrier or of its serv\u00e1nts. See <em>Baltimore &amp; Yorktown Turnpike Road </em>v. <em>Cason, </em>72 Md. 377; <em>Francisco </em>v. <em>Troy &amp; Lansingburgh Railroad, </em>78 Hun, 13. There was no evidence that the jolt was due to any defect in the car or in the track, or that the car was proceeding at an extraordinary speed. The witnesses who gave an estimate of the speed placed it at from three and one half to four miles an hour, and there was no one who testified that the rate was either unusual or dangerous. The jar felt by the different witnesses was not so great as to be unusual, or as to justify a finding that it was due to negligence of the defendant or of its servants.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
