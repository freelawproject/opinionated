Writ dated June 26, 1899. The case came up on appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court, rendered by <em>Braley, </em>J., sustaining the defendants\u2019 demurrer to the plaintiffs\u2019 amended declaration. The plaintiffs\u2019 amended declaration was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-4\">\u201c And the plaintiffs say that in the month of April, 1899, they were general contractors; that by chapter 449 of the Acts of the year 1897 the county commissioners of the county of Worcester were authorized to build and equip a new court house for said county in the city of Worcester in said county, and that by said act it was provided that all contracts should be made by means of proposals for bids on the part of the county, which were to be advertised in certain newspapers, and that said contracts must be given to the lowest responsible bidder; that said act gave to ' the commissioners authority to reject any and all bids, but did not give them the right to reject any or all bids.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">\u201c That in the year 1899 the defendants were the county commissioners of the county of Worcester, and in said month of April, 1899, or about that time, the said county commissioners, acting under said statute and the subsequent acts in addition thereto, advertised for proposals for furnishing wooden furniture for said court house, the notices or propositions, on the part of the county commissioners, consisting of a 1 Notice to Contractors,\u2019 a copy of which is hereto annexed and marked <em>\u2018 </em>A,\u2019 a form of 6 Proposal \u2019 to be signed by bidders, a copy of which is hereto annexed and marked \u2018 B,\u2019 and a blank form of contract containing in full all the requirements, conditions and specifications of said contract; that the plaintiffs duly signed and submitted to the said commissioners a bid for said contract, on one of said forms, wherein they offered to perform said contract for the sum of eleven thousand two hundred and thirty dollars, and the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>bid was accompanied by a certified check, as required by the commissioners, and all the requirements of the commissioners\u2019 \u2018 Notice to Contractors \u2019 were duly observed by the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs were the lowest responsible bidders for said contract, and they were always ready and willing to execute a formal contract and to perform said contract, and to comply with all just requirements of the said commissioners, and the plaintiffs were entitled to said contract, but the defendants, wrongfully, unlawfully, contrary to their duties as county commissioners, and to the provisions of chapter 449 of the Acts of 1897, rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 bid and refused to allow them to perform said contract, and awarded the said contract to another of those persons who bid for said contract when the plaintiffs did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-4\">\u201c And the plaintiffs were damaged by the refusal of the defendants to award to them said contract, in the sum of seven thousand dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\">The \u201c Notice to Contractors \u201d referred to in the declaration as marked \u201c A \u201d ended with the sentence \u201c The right is reserved to reject any or all proposals.\u201d The language of exhibits A and B was not otherwise material.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-6\">The defendants\u2019 demurrer was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-7\">\u201c Now come the defendants in the above-entitled action and demur to the plaintiffs\u2019 amended declaration, and assign specifically as causes of demurrer the following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-8\">\u201c First. That the defendants, in whatever they did relating to the erection of a new court house in the city of Worcester, and in furnishing the same with wooden furniture, were engaged in the performance of a public duty imposed by law, and in consequence thereof are not answerable to this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-9\">\u201c Second. That the defendants, in furnishing said court house with wooden furniture, were not acting under the provisions of &gt; chapter 449 of the Acts of the year 1897, as alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration, but were acting under the provisions of chapter 137 of the Acts of the year 1897, and of chapter 214 of the Acts of the year 1899, and that said chapters 137 and 214 did not require the defendants to award contracts to the \u2018 lowest responsible bidder,\u2019 and that consequently the defendants were under no obligation to award any contract to the plaintiffs, s. \u201c Third. If the defendants, in furnishing said court house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>with wooden furniture, were acting under said chapter 449, as alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration, then that under the terms of said act it was in the discretion of the county commissioners to reject any and all bids offered, and that consequently the plaintiffs, if their bid was rejected, have no cause of action therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-3\">\u201c Fourth. If the defendants, in furnishing wooden furniture for said court house, were acting under the provisions of said chapter 449, as alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration, then that under the advertisements for proposals required by said act, the county commissioners reserved the right to reject any or all proposals, and consequently .that the plaintiffs, if their bid was rejected, have no cause of action therefor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWL\">St. 1899, c. 214, \u00a7 1, is as follows: \u201c The county commissioners of the county of Worcester are hereby authorized to expend a sum not exceeding seventy thousand dollars for the purpose of completing, equipping and furnishing the court house now in process of erection at Worcester, under the authority of chapter four hundred and forty-nine of the acts of the year eighteen</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">hundred and ninety-seven, and also for the improvement of the grounds and approaches connected with said court house.

Their acts with reference to court houses may be under statutes of general application, or under special enactments by which they are designated to perform particular services, in which latter case they do not act as agents of the county. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>167 Mass. 599. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Norfolk, </em>170 Mass. 555. Pub. Sts. c. 22, \u00a7 20, cl. 1, \u00a7 22. St. 1897, c. 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The county commissioners of Worcester were given special authority-to provide additional accommodations for the courts of the county sitting at Worcester by several special statutes. The first authorized them to erect an addition to the court house. St. 1896, c. 350. When this act was passed there were upon the land of the county on Main Street in Worcester two court houses, one of granite and one of brick. The second statute authorized the commissioners to sell and remove the brick court house and to erect a building which should provide additional accommodations for the courts of the county sitting at Worcester. St. 1897, c. 449. In the first act the limit of $350,000 was fixed for the expense to be incurred in building the addition including the cost of additional land and in the second act, which repealed the first, the same limit was fixed for the expense which might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>be incurred in connection with the removal of the brick court house and in the erection of the new building, and to meet these expenses the commissioners were authorized to borrow on the credit of the county a sum not exceeding $350,000. St. 1896, c. 350, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 8. St. 1897, c. 449, \u00a7\u00a7 1,9. Under the second statute the new building was erected. The third special statute took effect on March 30, 1899. St. 1899, c. 214. By it the county commissioners were authorized to expend a sum not exceeding $70,000 \u201c for the purpose of completing, equipping and furnishing the court house now [then] in process of erection at Worcester, under the authority of chapter four hundred and forty-nine of the acts of the year eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, and also for the' improvement of the grounds and approaches connected with said court house.\u201d Of this sum the act provided that an amount not exceeding $5,000 should \u201c be expended in completing the construction of said court house,\u201d and it authorized the commissioners to borrow \u201c a sum or sums not exceeding seventy thousand dollars in addition to the sums provided for in said act.\u201d St. 1899, c. 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\">After the passage of the act of 1899, the defendants, as county commissioners, issued a notice inviting proposals for wooden furniture for the court house, which notice reserved the right \u201c to reject any or all proposals.\u201d On April 25, 1899, the plaintiffs submitted a proposal which complied with the requirements of the defendants\u2019 notice. We assume in deciding whether the demurrer was sustained rightly that the plaintiffs were responsible bidders and their proposal the lowest bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">In the special statute of 1897 was a provision with reference to the contracts for the construction and equipment of the new building, expressed in these words: \u201c The contracts for said work shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, said commissioners having the right to reject any and all bids.\u201d St. 1897, c. 449, \u00a7 3. The plaintiffs contend that this provision was binding upon the defendants in awarding the contract for wooden furniture for which the plaintiffs bid,' and found this contention upon the reference in the statute of 1899 to the statute of 1897.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">But the provisions of the earlier statute, as to the making of contracts, dealt only with contracts for the \u201c construction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>equipment\u201d of the new building, while by the later act the commissioners were authorized to expend money for furnishing, as well as for completing and equipping the new building, and for the improvement of the grounds and approaches. We think the reference to the former act in the first section of the later one was merely to identify the court house which the commissioners were authorized to complete, equip and furnish, as the one then in process of erection at Worcester under the former act. The work of construction and equipment must, under the provisions of the earlier act, have been entirely provided for originally by contracts entered into before the passage of the act of 1899. It was not intended by the act of 1899 to place the restrictions provided for by the act of 1897 upon the making' of contracts for furnishing the court house, or for the improvement of its grounds and approaches. If it had been intended to provide that all the restrictions of the earlier act should govern the commissioners in executing the authority given by the later one a specific statement to that effect would have been inserted, or at least the reference to the former act would have been placed at the end of the sentence, after the enumeration of all the purposes for which authority was given, and not in a position where its grammatical construction is merely further to identify the court house mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\">We are therefore of opinion that the defendants, in contracting for the wooden furniture of the new court house under the authority given them by St. 1899, c. 214, were restricted only by the general enactments defining the powers and duties of county commissioners. These did not require them to award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder. Pub. Sts. c. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 22. St. 1897, c. 187, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">As the defendants were governed by no such statutory requirement as that for which the plaintiffs contend, and as there is no allegation that in rejecting their proposal the defendants acted corruptly or from malice, the demurrer was sustained rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">This result makes it unnecessary to consider the other grounds to which the arguments of counsel were addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\n<em>Order sustaining the demurrer affirmed; judgment for the defendants affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
