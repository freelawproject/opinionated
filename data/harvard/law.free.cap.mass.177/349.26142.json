Tuttle, was six years of age in March, 1900. She was offered as a witness, and the defendant objected to the reception of her testimony. At the request of the defendant, the witness was examined <em>voir dire </em>by the judge in the absence of the jury, and against the objection of the defendant the judge ruled that she was competent to testify and allowed her to do so. The examination upon the <em>voir dire </em>was reported in the bill of exceptions and disclosed no unusual mental condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-11\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-12\"><em>M.

Tuttle, on the ground that she was incompetent to testify by reason of infancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">In the opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>165 Mass. 426, we find the following language: \u201c The law fixes no limit of age which children must have reached in order to be competent as witnesses; and unless for manifest error we cannot revise the decision of the presiding justice that the little girl in this case had sufficient intelligence and sufficient sense of the duty of telling the truth to enable her to testify. No such error appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>in the present case, although there is a certain incongruity in administering an oath to one who cannot be convicted of perjury. Nevertheless, the fact that the child was- too young to be convicted of perjury is not decisive against her competency.\u201d The girl'who was permitted to testify in that case was younger than the witness in this case, and the decision covers the question now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reagan, </em>175 Mass. 335, it was decided that the presiding justice must in the first instance determine whether a child is competent -to testify. In <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 159 U. S. 523, a child younger than this witness was permitted to testify, and it was held that there was no error in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
