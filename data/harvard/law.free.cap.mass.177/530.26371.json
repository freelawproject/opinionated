Writ dated August 17, 1898.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-10\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Sherman, </em>J., there was evidence in regard to the collision which is sufficiently described in the opinion of the court. In the course of the trial, the defendant put upon the stand one Cooper, its master of transportation, and proposed to show by him all the routes of the express wagons of the company in Boston, and what men were employed upon them, and where it was the duty of each to go on the day of the accident, for the purpose of showing that none of them was authorized to go by- the corner of Dedham Street and Harrison Avenue on the day of the accident, and that no driver of the defendant if there with liis team was in the course of his employment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-11\">The judge excluded the evidence, ruling that the defendant might show that its men were not there, but could not show where they ought to have been, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>At the close of the evidence, the defendant requested the judge to give the following instructions to the jury: 1.

The plaintiff introduced testimony that he himself was driving on the right hand side of Harrison Avenue, close to the sidewalk, and it tended to show that he was in the exercise of due care. The driver of the other team was driving \u201cvery fast\u201d in the opposite direction, and collided with the plaintiff. This was evidence that he was acting in violation of the statute which requires, persons meeting each other as these persons were, to drive \u201c to the right of the middle of the travelled part \u201d of the road, and unexplained it indicated negligence. Pub. Sts. c. 93, \u00a7 1. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Hanrahan, </em>100 Mass. 313. <em>Young </em>v. <em>South Boston Ice Co. </em>150 Mass. 527. <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>O\u2019 Riordan, </em>155 Mass. 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">There was evidence tending to show that there was no collision, but that the accident was caused by the running of the plaintiff\u2019s horse, and there was other evidence that none of the defendant\u2019s teams was in the vicinity at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">The judge rightly ruled that the witness, Cooper, could not be permitted to testify as to the routes of the drivers of the defendant company on the morning of the accident, for the purpose of showing that the wagon referred to was not one of the defendant\u2019s wagons.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">But it was a part of the plaintiff\u2019s case to prove that the negligent driver was a servant of the defendant, acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident. To prove this he relied upon the inference that a person driving such a team as was described, the wagon being marked \u201cAmerican <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Express Company,\u201d was one of the defendant\u2019s servants then engaged in the defendant\u2019s business. If the routes prescribed for the defendant\u2019s servants were such that at this time none of them could be driving through that part of Harrison Avenue without, for the time, abandoning the service in which he was engaged and going off for some purpose of his own, the defendant would not be liable, even if the team which is said to have caused the collision was one of its teams, and was driven by a person who was regularly employed in its service. The question for the jury was not whether the defendant owned the team, but whether the person who was driving it negligently was then acting for the defendant in doing the work which he was directed to do. If the servant was not then acting in the course of his employment, but was off \u201con a frolic of his own,\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the master would not be liable. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Newmarch, </em>12 Allen, 49. <em>Bowler </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>162 Mass. 319. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Jarvis Engineering Co. </em>166 Mass. 75. <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>165 Mass. 348. <em>Bard </em>v. <em>Yohn, </em>26 Penn: St. 482. <em>Storey </em>v. <em>Ashton, </em>L. R. 4 Q. B. 476, 479. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>6 Q. B. D. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">As bearing upon this question the defendant offered to show by the person who had charge of the drivers and helpers, the team service in Boston, that no driver of an express team of the defendant had a right to be there that morning in the course of his employment. We are of opinion that the evidence was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b552-11\"> Parke, B., in <em>Joel </em>v. <em>Morison, </em>6 C. &amp; P. 501, 503.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
