At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Stevens, </em>J., the defendant was found guilty, and, after verdict, filed a motion in arrest of judgment, \u201c on the ground that the complaint does not charge the defendant with any offence punishable by law.\u201d This motion was overruled; and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-12\">Pub. Sts. c. 209, \u00a7 1, provides that \u201c Whoever sets up or pro,motes a lottery for money, or by way of lottery disposes of any property of value, real or personal,\u201d etc., shall be punished as therein provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-13\">It was contended for the defendant that no offence was alleged, as it was not stated that the lottery was kept or promoted for money or other thing of value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-14\">The language of the complaint was as follows : \u201c That Lawrence J. Mackay of said Boston, on the ninth day of February, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred, at said Boston, and within the judicial district of said Court, with force and arms, did keep, set up, and promote a certain lottery in a certain building situated and numbered eighty-two in Cabot Street in said city and district, against the peace of said Commonwealth, and the form of the statute in such case made and provided.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-5\"><em>T.

Sts. c. 209, \u00a7 1, forbids the setting up of a lottery for money, or other thing of value, and while the complaint may be defective in form in not saying that the lottery was for money or other thing of value, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Horton, 2 Gray, 69, the term is broad enough to include such a lottery, and, after trial and conviction, it is to be assumed that the evidence warranted a conviction of setting up an illegal lottery within the terms of the statute. Such an offence was witiiin the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">The defendant, having gone to trial upon the defective complaint, cannot now take advantage of the defect by motion in arrest of judgment. Pub. Sts. c. 214, \u00a7 27. For further legislation as to lotteries, see St. 1892, c. 409 ; St. 1895, c. 419, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 3, 8, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">\n<em>Motion in arrest of judgment overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
