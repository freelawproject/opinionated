The words \u201c brick work \u201d and \u201c fireplace \u201d were in capital letters as above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-12\">A catalogue was produced at the trial entitled \u201c Sketch Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>of the Philadelphia &amp; Boston Face Brick Co.,\u201d and the design or representation of a fireplace therein, entitled \u201c Sketch No. 12,\u201d together with the drawings of ornamental brick for the same, and description, were introduced in evidence, and it was agreed that this was the fireplace intended in the specifications.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-3\">Both parties agreed, and it was in evidence, that the method of obtaining the fireplace in question was to order it by its number from the Philadelphia and Boston Face Brick Company, and that that company would send all the parts complete, the pieces in special shapes, and ornamental pieces numbered to fit in their proper places, and a sufficient quantity of face brick to be laid with them to complete the fireplace; and that said Philadelphia and Boston Face Brick Company had on hand the parts so going to make up the fireplace, ready for shipment when ordered by its number.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-4\">It appeared in evidence that the plaintiffs built the core of this fireplace including the flues, that is, the rough brick work for the interior, around and upon which the fireplace as designed was to be put. When afterwards the fireplace -was put up, the core had to be trimmed somewhat to make it fit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\">At the trial, the plaintiffs contended that the contract entered into between the parties did not require the plaintiffs to furnish and set the No. 12 Philadelphia and Boston fireplace, but the defendant contended that this was included under the term \u201c brick work \u201d in the agreement and specifications.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-6\">The plaintiffs, to support their contention, offered evidence of conversations between one of the plaintiffs and the defendant, before and at the time the plaintiffs made their bid, tending to show that the words \u201cbrick work\u201d as used in the specifications and agreement were not intended to include the fireplace subsequently mentioned in the specifications; and also evidence that according to custom and usage, among those in the trade and business of brick masons, builders, and contractors in Lawrence, the words \u201c brick work \u201d do not include a No. 12 Philadelphia and Boston Face Brick Company\u2019s fireplace such as named in the specifications.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-7\">The defendant objected to this evidence and asked the judge to rule and instruct the jury, that the term \u201cbrick work\u201d as used in the specifications and agreement included the fireplace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>in question, and that upon the proper construction of the instruments the defendant was as matter of law entitled to a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-3\">The judge ruled that the specifications were ambiguous, and did not clearly show whether the words \u201cbrick work\u201d included the term \u201c fireplace,\u201d and the No. 12 fireplace therein subsequently mentioned, or not; that evidence was admissible to apply the contract to the subject matter, and to show and ascertain the thing meant by the language used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-4\">The defendant excepted to this ruling.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-5\">Maurice Daly testified, that he applied to the defendant to bid upon the brick work, that the defendant gave him the specifications and told him to do so, leaving out the fireplace, saying that the defendant had ordered that, that the next day he went to the defendant and told him that they would do the brick work without the fireplace for $950, and that after some conversation the price was reduced to $900, and the defendant told him to write the paper above printed dated August 19,1898, which he did, and that he brought the paper back to the defendant, and said as he handed it to him that that did not include the fireplace..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-6\">The plaintiff further introduced the evidence of masons, contractors, and builders, who testified that there was a custom and usage in the business that such a fireplace as the one in question, when specified in building specifications in the manner adopted in this case, is not included under the term \u201c brick work,\u201d and that an agreement to do the brick work under such specifications does not according to such usage include such a fireplace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-7\">The defendant introduced evidence tending to contradict the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence as to what took place at the time of the agreement, and also to contradict the evidence introduced by the plaintiffs as to custom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-8\">The judge left it to the jury upon this evidence, to say whether the fireplace was brick work within the meaning and contemplation of the agreement, which the plaintiffs made, to put in and construct the brick work of the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-9\">The jury found for the plaintiffs for the amount in controversy, and, at the request of the parties, the judge reported the case for the determination of this court. If the ruling given was erroneous, and the ruling requested by the defendant should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>given, and the evidence rejected, the verdict was to be set aside, and judgment entered for the defendant; otherwise judgment was to be entered upon the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-4\"><em>C.

I, the undersigned, do hereby agree to complete brick work, lathing and plastering, as prescribed in plans and specification, on house of John J. Cummings at Lawrence St. Cor. Chestnut, for \u00a7900. Maurice Daly.\u201d We are of opinion that it should have been so ruled. The specifications under the head \u201c Brick Work \u201d contain eight paragraphs, the first two relate to the chimneys, then comes the word \u201c fireplace \u201d in large letters, with six paragraphs, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u201c Provide proper foundation for and furnish and set in position as shown on plan a No. 12 Phila. &amp; Boston Face Brick Co.\u2019s Red Pressed brick. fireplace. To be provided with Murdock Cast Iron thwat and ash dump.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u201c The bricks to be laid in dark red mortar, 1-2 cement, laid to very close straight joints and in a thoroughly workmanlike manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">\u201c Start chimneys on stone levellers which Stone mason will leave in cellar.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">\u201c The chimneys and piers connected with them to be laid up in pure cement mortar from cellar bottom to level of first floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">\u201c All partitions enclosing stairways leading to upper floors must be filled in between studs with bricks and mortar and plastered on both sides on metal lathing, according to Article 7 of Form No. 60 State Inspector\u2019s Spec. Blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">\u201c Where floor timbers rest on partition caps the spaces between them from cap to top of timbers must be filled in solid with good light bricks laid in lime mortar, and all joints flushed full.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The fireplace mentioned in the first paragraph is described and pictured in a catalogue of the Philadelphia and Boston Face Brick Company, and the method of obtaining it was to order it by its number from this company, who would send the parts complete, with pieces in special shape, and a sufficient quantity of face brick to be laid with them to complete the fireplace. \u201c The plaintiffs completed core of this fireplace including the flues, that is, the rough brick work for the interior, around and upon which the fireplace as designed was to be put. When afterwards the fireplace was put up, the core had to be trimmed somewhat to make it fit.\u201d It is plain that the last four paragraphs relate to brick work included in the plaintiffs\u2019 contract. It is almost as plain that the paragraph which immediately precedes these, and which prescribes the kind of mortar to be used and the manner of laying the bricks, describes brick work within the meaning of the plaintiffs\u2019 agreement. The front of the fireplace differs from the rest only in the requirement that the material must be of a certain kind which can be procured of only one manufacturer. This material is ornamental brick work which is to be connected with the other brick work. In the general specifications for brick work it is included with specifications for other brick work immediately before and after it. We think, under the admitted facts, that the court should have ruled as a matter of law that the fireplace was included as a part of the brick work referred to in the plaintiffs\u2019 agreement, and that the paroi \u00bfvidence to show that it was not, was incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\">According to the terms of the report the verdict must be set aside, and there must be</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><em>Judgment for the </em>defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
