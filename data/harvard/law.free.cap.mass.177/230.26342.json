Hearing before Bell, J., who sustained the demurrer and found for the defendants on the merits; and the plaintiff appealed. The judge reported the case for the consideration of this court. If either the order sustaining the demurrer or the finding for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>defendants was correct, the bill was to be dismissed. If the demurrer should be overruled, and the case was one requiring a remedy in equity, a decree was to be entered for the plaintiff, and an injunction was to issue.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-4\"><em>C. A. DeCourcy, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-5\"><em>J.

The facts show that the defendants have been guilty of trespasses, which they propose to continue. The ownership of the plaintiff is admitted, and no question of title is involved. Nor is any claim to a right of way over the plaintiff\u2019s land set up in the answer of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">It seems to us clear that the bill in this case may be maintained. If the plaintiff were to sue at law, the amount recoverable could not be large in comparison with the amount expended in litigation, and every trespass would give a new right of action. Hence there would arise a great multiplicity of suits. At some time the plaintiff would be entitled to the protection of a court of equity, and there is no reason why, on the facts of this case, the remedy by injunction should not be granted at once. This court has now full jurisdiction in equity, and can put in force the remedies appropriate to that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The language of Sir W. M. James, L. J., in the case of <em>Goodson </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>L. R. 9 Ch. 221, 226, is very appropriate to this case: \u201c The defendant in this case is admittedly a trespasser. He has committed a trespass upon the plaintiff\u2019s land without any legal justification or any legal excuse whatever ; and he proposes to continue that trespass from day to day . . . for the purpose of making a profit of a trade which he proposes to set up in rivalry to a trade which the owner of the land upon which he is so committing the trespass is interested in. It is said that we ought to allow this to be done, that we ought, in fact, to dismiss the plaintiff from this court, and tell him to find his way to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>another court, in which he is to bring an action for the wrong for which there is no defence whatever. He is to bring that action at his own cost, and having succeeded in one action, he is to bring a second. I do not know whether more than one will be required \u2014 and then, having succeeded in one action, or two actions, or perhaps three actions, all of which, on the facts proved in this case, would necessarily result in verdicts for him, he is to come back to this court and obtain a perpetual injunction on the ground of repeated vexation and repeated actions. I do not think that there is any principle in this court which will compel us to drive the plaintiff to go through all that litigation before he is entitled to that relief which he would ultimately get when he had gone through it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\">In the same case it was said by Lord Chancellor Selborne: \u201c I cannot look upon this case otherwise than as a deliberate and unlawful invasion by one man of another man\u2019s land for the purpose of a continuing trespass, which is in law a series of trespasses from time to time, to the gain and profit of the trespasser, without the consent of the owner of the land ; and it appears to me, as such, to be a proper subject for an injunction.\u201d See also <em>Allen </em>v. Martin, L. R. 20 Eq. 462; <em>Lembeck </em>v. <em>Nye, </em>47 Ohio St. 336; <em>Warren Mills </em>v. <em>New Orleans Seed Co. </em>65 Miss. 391; <em>United States Freehold Land &amp; Emigration Co. </em>v. <em>Gallegos, </em>89 Fed. Rep. 769, 773; <em>Canastota Knife Co. </em>v. <em>Newington Tramway Co. </em>69 Conn. 146, 161; <em>Musselman </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>1 Bush, 463; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Wren, </em>84 Ky. 254; 3 Pom. Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1357; 1 Spell, on Extraordinary Relief, \u00a7 342; 1 Beach on Injunctions, \u00a7 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The case at bar is distinguishable from <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>117 Mass. 376. There, a question arose as to the plaintiff\u2019s right to the way in question, as against the defendant. Here, no question of title arises. There, the trespasses had been committed and were not continuing trespasses. Here, the trespasses are continuing. It is also to be noticed that that case was decided in 1875, when the Gen. Sts. c. 113, were in force. Section 2 of that chapter, after setting forth certain cases in which the court should have jurisdiction, and not mentioning trespasses, concluded as follows: \u201c And shall have full equity jurisdiction, according to the usage and practice of courts of equity, in all other cases where there is not a plain, adequate and complete remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>at law.\u201d This clause was repealed by the St. of 1877, c. 178, \u00a7 2, and a much broader law enacted. This gives to this court \u201c\u2019jurisdiction in equity of all cases and matters of equity, cognizable under the general principles of equity jurisprudence \u201d ; and it is further declared, \u201c and in respect of all such cases and matters, shall be a court of general equity jurisdiction.\u201d See Pub. Sts. c. 151, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\">The cases., we have cited above and the text writers show that a court having general equity powers may issue an injunction in a case like the present, where the trespasses are continuing. The fact that the defendant is solvent in such a case is not of importance, although his insolvency may be an additional reason for sustaining the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The bill in this case sets forth all the facts necessary to give the court jurisdiction. Damage to the plaintiff is the necessary result of the facts set forth ; and when that appears it is no ground of demurrer that the bill does not set forth that the plaintiff has been injured. 2 Beach on Injunctions, \u00a7 1397.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The only other defence relied upon is that the person with whom the plaintiff made the contract was not duly licensed in accordance with an ordinance of the city of Lawrence. Some question is made as to the validity of this ordinance, but we do not deem it necessary to consider this point, as we are of opinion that if the facts are as the defendants contend they afford no excuse for their trespasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The result is that the demurrer should be overruled and an injunction issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
