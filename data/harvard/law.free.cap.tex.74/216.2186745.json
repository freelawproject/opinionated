The defendant had bought of one Graves, and the deed (which was a quit claim) was made by Graves and wife to the plaintiff, he paying the agreed purchase money. The facts were that the purchase had been annulled for the non-payment of interest, etc., and the\u201d plaintiff took no title by his purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-12\">Damages were asked, the purchase money, value of improvements, exemplary damages, and attorney fees for prosecuting the suit. Exceptions were sustained to all the items except the consideration, which Avas below the jurisdiction of the court, and the case was dismissed for the want of jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-13\">Further facts are given in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b234-14\"><em>Sims &amp; Snodgrass, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApH\">Plaintiff's petition shows a good cause of action .against defendant and should not have been dismissed on a general exception or the special exception sustained.

The court sustained the exceptions and dismiss\u00e9d-the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The petition discloses enough to show that the condition of the title was misrepresented to plaintiff in a manner calculated to deceive and influence him, and that relying upon the representations he purchased and' paid for the property, improved it, and subsequently lost it by reason of the untruthfulness of the representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">The deed to the property (a quit claim) was not made by the defendant, but by a third party at his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">The petition does not state that the purchase was made with the purpose of improving the property by plaintiff or that his intention to do so was discussed or known to defendant at the time of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">We think the petition discloses a good cause of action for the purchase money and interest, but not for the other damages claimed. The exceptions to the petition, properly sustained, reduced plaintiff\u2019s demand to a sum below the jurisdiction of the District Court, and his suit was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">In such cases as this the vendor is responsible for all injuries which are the direct and natural results of the purchaser acting on the faith of his representation. Wood\u2019s Mayne on Dam., 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">The case of Peyton v. Bailey, 3 Haywood, 141, was a sale of land U which the vendor had no title. The purchaser placed improvements on the land, and sued for the return of the consideration paid by him and the value of the improvements. It was held that his claim for expenses incurred in erecting the improvements could not be allowed because they were no part of the contract, and were made by the purchaser by his own choice in consequence of the bargain. The court say: \u201cTf we allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>damages upon the first consequence, then also upon the second, third, and thousandth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\">The case of Moreland v. Atchison, 19 Texas, 312, arose upon a state of facts similar to this one, and the purchaser sued for the return of the purchase money and for damages; this court said the plaintiff had stated a- case <em>\u201c </em>which entitled him to recover back his property (paid for the land) or its value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">We do not think the plaintiff\u2019s petition shows a good cause of action for exemplary damages or attorney fees. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"ACc\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Delivered June 4, 1889.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
