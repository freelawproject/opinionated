The notes were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>not returned or demanded, although one of them was not yet due. A statement of the indebtedness was presented to defendants shortly after the execution of the papers of November 26, 1883, and not receipted. Calhoun v. Lumpkin, 60 Texas, 188, 189; Stephen v. Cushman, 35 Ill., 196, 197; Ennor v. Thompson, 46 Ill., 223; Babcock v. Wyman, 19 How., 296, 298; Bridges v. Linder, 14 N. W. Rep., 217.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-5\">3. The sale and contract .to resell within six months was obviously intended as a security and means of paying the indebtedness of $8897.08 with ten per cent interest from November 26, 1883, because in any event plaintiffs were to get that amount and no more. Any surplus above that amount was to go to defendants. Nat. Bank of Texas v. Lovenberg, 63 Texas, 506; Stephens v. Allen, 11 Ore., 188.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-6\">4.

Delivery of possession of the goods and accounts was not unconditional, but for the special purpose of reducing or paying the indebtedness, as shown by the stipulation that defendants were to put two clerks in the store to see that the business was fairly done and correct accounts kept.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-9\">7. There was no stipulation that in case the proceeds of the business should fall short of the stipulated sum that the notes of defendants should be canceled or returned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-10\">8. On March 7, 1884, defendants agreed in writing with plaintiffs that the business should be sold to third persons and the proceeds credited on their indebtedness to plaintiffs. Budd v.

On the 26th day of November, 1883, appellees executed to appellants an instrument in the form of a bill of sale, reciting the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>sideration to be \u00a78897.08, and containing the following recitations: \u201cAnd whereas said Lessing, Solomon <em>&amp; </em>Rosenthal have signed a certain article of agreement wherein they bind themselves to resell to said Grim-land &amp; Co. all goods, wares, and merchandise, and choses in action re^ maining uncollected and unsold within six months from the 26th of November, 1883, upon said Grimland &amp; Co. giving good and ample security: Now, be it agreed, that should said Grimland <em>&amp; </em>Co. be unable to make satisfactory security within the aforesaid time for the repurchase of said goods and choses in action, then at the expiration of said time the said Lessing, Solomon &amp; Rosenthal shall invoice at a cash value all such goods, wares, and merchandise as shall remain unsold; and in event the said goods, wares, and merchandise shall be of value to an amount in excess of the sum agreed upon between the said Grimland &amp; Co. and the said Lessing, Solomon &amp; Rosenthal for the repurchase of said goods, wares, and merchandise, and choses in action, then the said Lessing, Solomon &amp; Rosenthal shall pay to Grimland &amp; Co. all such excess of amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVf\">Of the same date and at the same time Lessing, Solomon &amp; Rosenthal executed and delivered to appellees an instrument reciting that Grimland <em>&amp; </em>Co. had sold to them the stock of merchandise, fixtures, and choses in action for the sum of \u00a78897.08, and \u201cnow we herein agree to resell the same to said Grimland &amp; Co., upon the following terms and conditions, at any time within six months from this date; that is to say: We have taken possession of our said stock of goods, etc., and choses in action so purchased of Grimland &amp; Co., and opened business in the old store house at the old stand of said firm, and will carry on business therein in the usual way, keeping books so as to show the transactions and business done, and cash received and paid out, and the said Grimland &amp; Co. may put two clerks in the store to see that the business is fairly done and correct accounts kept; and should the said firm of Grimland &amp; Co. at any time within the said six months desire to repurchase the goods, etc., and choses in action, they shall have the right to do so upon paying to us the said sum of \u00a78897.08, and ten per cent interest thereon from this date, and in making such payments to us they shall first be credited with all the net cash received by us over and above expenses and purchases to keep up stock and all net collections on the notes and accounts from this date to date of repurchase, and the balance of said money to make said repurchase as aforesaid shall be paid to us in cash, or secured to our satisfaction, and upon such payment being made to us we agree to reconvey to said Grimland &amp; Co. all of the goods, etc., and choses in action then unsold and uncollected. In the matter of expenses it is understood that all of the expenses of carrying on the business is to be deducted from the cash received, including taxes, insurance, clerk hire, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AeT\">Under these instruments appellants took possession of the goods, etc., and choses in action without taking an inventory. An inventory taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>a few days thereafter amounted to $12,538.26.' Two of the members of the firm of Grimland &amp; Co. remained in the store as clerks and assisted appellants in carrying on the business and 'collecting the choses in action. About the time that appellants took possession of the assets and business at the request of appellees <em>they paid </em>debts due other creditors to the amount of about $1200. The business was carried on until the 7th of March, 1884, all net receipts being credited on appellees indebtedness to appellants, When the stock of goods, etc., and choses in action were disposed of by appellants in conformity with the following agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-3\"><em>\u201c Bosque County, State of </em>Texas.\u2014The following articles of agreement entered into this day by Lessing, Solomon &amp; Rosenthal, of Waco, McLennan County, State aforesaid, parties of the first part, and Peter Pierson and Y.

And this is the basis of the sale of said stock and fixtures from the parties of the first part to the parties of the second part; and the parties of the first part hereby agree that they will transfer and turn over to the parties of the second part the said stock and fixtures as per inventory, which said inventory is to be commenced immediately, and the parties of the second part hereby agree to receive and take possession of the same and become liable to the parties of the first part.

Grimland &amp; Co. were present and approved the foregoing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">This suit was brought by appellants on two notes amounting to $2184.12. Appellees answered that on November 26, 1883, they owed appellants $8897.08, including the notes sued on, and on that day paid off the entire indebtedness by a sale and delivery to appellants of their stock of goods and notes and accounts of the value of $12,538.26. By supplemental petition appellants denied that the goods and choses in action were taken in payment of their debt, and alleged that they were received simply as security for the debt, and disposed of in accordance with the agreement and understanding with appellees, and the proceeds applied as a credit on appellees\u2019 indebtedness to them, leaving the notes sued on unpaid. There was verdict and judgment for appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">It is contended by appellants that the two instruments of November 26, 1883, constitute a mortgage or security for the debt due by appellees to them, and were not made in satisfaction of the debt, and that the verdict is therefore contrary to the law and tlie evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">It is not claimed that appellants did not credit appellees with the net proceeds of the sales of the stock of goods and the money collected on the notes and accounts. The question of controlling importance, and the only one which we think it necessary to consider, is whether or not the stock of goods and choses in action were turned over to appellants as security for the debt due to them by appellees, or whether the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>was turned over to them and received by them in payment and full satisfaction of the debt. This question must be determined from the intent of the parties at the time of the transaction, and that intent must be arrived at from the language employed in the two instruments of writing executed by the parties respectively at the time the goods and choses in action were turned over to the possession and control of appellants. The two instruments executed contemporaneously must be considered together and construed one with reference to the other. The parties having undertaken to express their intent in writing, we must look to the written instruments to discover their purpose and intent in entering into the contract and agreement, and unless the instruments themselves are ambiguous the intent of the parties must be determined from the language of the instruments alone. Walker v. McDonald, 49 Texas, 462.</p>\n<p id=\"AnQ\">If the language of the instruments of writing is ambiguous then parol evidence may be heard to determine the intent of the parties, but in the absence of ambiguity it devolves upon the court to construe the instruments and declare the intent of the parties from the language which they have employed to express their meaning. If the stock of goods and clios\u00e9s in action were delivered to appellants as security merely for the debt and not in payment of it, then it is clear that the verdict is contrary to the law and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">We think the instruments of writing are not ambiguous and admit of but one construction, and that is that appellants received the goods and choses in action as security for and not in payment of the debt due to them from appellees. It was expressly stipulated that appellees should be charged with interest on their debt at ten per cent per annum from the date of the instruments, and it was further expressly stipulated that in the event appellees were unable to repurchase at the expiration of the six months appellants were to credit them with net cash receipts, the goods undisposed of were to be inventoried at their cash value, and appellants were to pay to appellees the excess in value over the balance due from appellees. It is not stated in either instrument that the debt due to appellants was discharged and satisfied by the transaction, but as we have said the language employed evinces conclusively to our mind that such was not the intent of the parties. Bank v. Lovenberg, 63 Texas, 506. But if the intent of the parties was not clear from the instruments alone, we think the parol evidence adduced upon the trial conclusively shows that the transaction was regarded by both parties at the time it was made as a security.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">If the transaction was an absolute sale in payment of the debt due to appellants, we are unable to discover any reason why appellees should have been at all concerned about the subsequent disposition of the goods and choses in action, or why they should have endorsed their approval on the agreement for the sale of the goods and choses in action entered into between appellants and P. Pierson and T. Grimland on the 7th of March, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>1884, more than three months after the goods and choses in action had gone into the possession of appellants under the terms and conditions stated in the written instruments of November 26, 1883. The agreement for sale entered into between appellants and Pierson and Y. Grim-land recites: \u201cThe parties of the first part (appellants) agree that they will credit Y. C. Grimland &amp; C\u00f3.\u2019s account with the amount that the stock and fixtures will amount to as cash the day said stock is turned over.\u201d -Following this agreement is a written statement signed by appellees containing the following language: \u201c We the undersigned have read the above agreement * * * and we give our consent to the above entire transaction as therein stated.\u201d Appellees testified that they consented to the sale to Y. Grimland and Pierson because they were convinced that they would not be able to settle with appellants and repurchase the goods and choses in action.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">AVe think it too clear to require further discussion that upon a proper construction of the two instruments, as well as upon the other evidence adduced upon the trial, the transaction was nothing more than a security for and not a payment of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">AVe are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">Adopted June 4, 1889.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
