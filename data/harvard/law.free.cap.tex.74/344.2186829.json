The petition having declared upon the notes <em>in Imc verba, </em>when offered in evidence they should have corresponded in every material particular. As they differed in a material particular they should have been excluded upon objection made. One of the notes sued on was set out in the petition <em>in lime verba </em>as a note signed by H. C. Dillahunty; the note offered in evidence under this allegation was signed H. C. Dillaunty. The other note sued on was alleged to have been one signed by H. C. Dillahunty; the note offered in evidence was signed H. C. Dillahinty. The notes being set out <em>in Imc verba </em>and there being no allegation that they were signed by Dillahunty and by mistake written Dillaunty and Dillahinty, they should have been excluded on objection made.

The petition having declared upon the notes <em>in liceo verba, </em>and the notes offered in evidence varying from those declared upon, the judgment is unsupported by the petition and should be set aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-6\">3. When a party has no interest in and is not to be benefited by the original contract, but signs a note simply as an accommodation for an original contractor, he is but a surety and not a joint obligor, and a judgment rendered against him as a joint obligor is erroneous. Brandt on Surety., sec. 1; Smith v. Shelden, 35 Mich., 42; Rev. Stats., arts. 3662, 3663.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-7\">4. Where one signs a note as a surety upon condition that a certain other person is to sign it also as a surety otherwise the same is to be an escrow and in no way binding upon the one signing, and such condition is known to the payee, unless such condition is fulfilled the surety signing is not bound by his signature. Brandt on Surety., secs. 348, 349, 350, and notes; Smith v. Doak, 3 Texas, 215; Loving v. Dixon, 56 Texas, 75.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-8\">5. The court erred in finding due diligence was used by appellee, and that appellant was not released by want of diligence on appellee\u2019s part. The first note became due January 1,1887. Suit was filed August 26, 1887. County Court was held in February, May, and August of that year. The said note was within the jurisdiction of said court, and District Court was held in April of that year. Gen. Laws 19th Leg., p. 110; Gen.

He further pleaded that at the time said notes matured his codefendants, who are the principals in said notes, were solvent, and that plaintiff failed to exercise ordinary diligence to collect them until said principals became insolvent, wherefore he prays to be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">The court properly sustained an exception to the last plea and gave plaintiff judgment for the amount of the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>The name of defendant was signed to the notes produced in evidence as follows: To one, H.
