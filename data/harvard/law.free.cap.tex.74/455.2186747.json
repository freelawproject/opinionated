After arrest appellees confined appellant in jail and there detained him four days without having carried him before a magistrate or giving him an opportunity to give bail for his appearance. There was no warrant or order for the arrest, but the same was made apparently on the strength of a telephone message from Honey Grove sent to Boothe, and at his request, by one Smith, hotel keeper; and four days later one Kelso, who lost a coat at Smith\u2019s hotel about October, 1884, came to Paris and refusing to claim the coat alleged to have been stolen, appellant ivas discharged by the sheriff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-11\">Appellant brought suit for damages for false imprisonment, alleging that he was arrested by the appellees without warrant, order, or legal authority, and without having any examination was confined in jail by appellees for four days during extremely cold weather, and that said confinement seriously injured his health, and that he suffered in his good name, and his feelings were much hurt, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-12\">Appellees answered by way of confession and avoidance, admitting the truth of plaintiff\u2019s allegations, but sought to. justify themselves for the' arrest by alleging <em>\u201c </em>that on the day the arrest was made these defendants were itiformed by one P. G.

But in all the cases enumerated the person making the arrest is required to immediately take the person arrested before the magistrate who may have ordered the arrest, or before the nearest magistrate where the arrest was made without an order. Title 5, ch. 1, Code Crim. Proc.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Heither the allegations of the answer nor the evidence adduced upon the trial show any defense to the case made by the allegations of the petition, and we think the first assignment, that the judgment is contrary to the law and the evidence, is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">We are therefore of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">Adopted June 25, 1889.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
