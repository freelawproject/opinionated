On appeal, appellant contends (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the State did not prove appellant entered the habitation; (2) he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the State did not prove that the garage was a habitation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-30\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b400-31\">Lucille Laughlin, complainant, testified that she has known appellant for five years. Appellant performed various repair and maintenance jobs for Laughlin. On the morning of December 12, 1994, Laughlin left her home to run some errands. When she left, her home and garage were locked and secured. On the way home, Laughlin passed appellant in his truck. Laughlin noticed two people in the truck. Laughlin returned home at approximately noon. When she went to put her car back in the garage several hours later, she noticed that the back door of her garage was unlocked. She also noticed that a makeshift lock<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>front garage doors had been tampered with. Laughlin looked around the garage and saw that her toolbox was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Laughlin reported the missing toolbox to the sheriffs department. Three days later, Detective Bradley Moon recovered the toolbox from a pawnshop and returned the toolbox, which had been emptied, to her. John Deaton, the manager of the pawnshop, testified that appellant pawned a toolbox on December 12, 1994. The pawn ticket was admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">When Laughlin talked to appellant about the toolbox, appellant told her his roommate and his roommate\u2019s girlfriend took the toolbox. They gained entry to the garage by shaking the garage door until it opened wide enough for the woman to crawl underneath the garage door. According to Laughlin, appellant was too large to be able to crawl in that space underneath the garage door. Appellant told Laughlin that he was at home asleep when the toolbox was stolen. However, appellant admitted he pawned the toolbox.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">David Boem, whose office is near Laugh-lin\u2019s home, testified that at approximately 11:30 a.m. on December 12,1994, he noticed an old, dark green Ford truck pull into Laughlin\u2019s driveway and stop in front of the garage. \u2022 Appellant drove a dark green Ford truck. When Boem returned from lunch at 12:30 p.m., the track was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Tammy Wood, who lives down the street from Laughlin, testified that between 11:00 a.m. and noon that day she was in her yard when appellant\u2019s green track drove past her. The track was travelling in a direction that was away from Laughlin\u2019s house. When asked whether she saw who was driving the track, Wood responded, \u201cI think \u2014 Mr. Darby.\u201d Later, she testified there was no doubt in her mind that the person driving the track was appellant. Another person was in the track with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">Evidence is sufficient when, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 317-318, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>Matamoros v. State, </em>901 S.W.2d 470, 474 (Tex.Crim.App.1995); <em>Green v. State, </em>891 S.W.2d 289, 297 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, pet. ref'd). If there is evidence that establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and if the trier of fact believes the evidence, we are not in a position to reverse the judgment on sufficiency of the evidence grounds. <em>Moreno v. State, </em>755 S.W.2d 866, 867 (Tex.Crim.App.1988); <em>Reece v. State, </em>878 S.W.2d 320, 325 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, no pet.).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">\n<em>Habitation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">In point of error three, appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to show that Laughlin\u2019s unattached garage was a habitation. A \u201chabitation\u201d means a structure that is adapted for the overnight accomodation of people and includes \u201c(A) each separately secured or occupied portion of the structure ...; and (B) each structure appurtenant to or connected with the structure.\u201d <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 30.01(1) (Vernon 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">Laughlin testified her unattached garage is approximately nine feet from her house and is fully enclosed. Laughlin stores all items which she cannot store in her house in her garage. She considers her garage to be part of her home. In the storage room in the back of the garage, there is a bed in which Laughlin\u2019s grandson slept for six months. Laughlin testified the garage was secured before she left to ran errands on December 12,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">It has been held that an unattached garage is a \u201cstructure appurtenant to\u201d a residence and, therefore, is within the statutory definition of \u201chabitation.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>690 S.W.2d 318, 319 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1985, pet. ref'd). In reaching this holding, the Dallas court said the unattached garage was \u201cnecessarily connected with the use and enjoyment of the house, and it [was] secondary or inci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>dent to the principal building, the house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In this case, Laugh-lin\u2019s unattached garage, which was used to store items she could not store in her house, was \u201cappurtenant to\u201d her house as the term is defined in <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">We overrule point of error three.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The discussion of the remaining points of error does not meet the criteria for publication, Tex.R.App. P. 47, and is thus ordered not published.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-21\">. Two of the prior convictions occurred on the same day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-32\">. The makeshift lock consisted of two iron bars, which when placed in two holes, secured the garage door. Laughlin noticed that one bar was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>partially out of the hole, and the other har was lying on the floor of the garage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
