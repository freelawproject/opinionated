On facts found, plaintiff had judgment, and the case is here oh defendant\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The material findings are these: On April 30, 1930, King had a \u201clegal pauper residence\u201d in Cabot; that day he moved, with his family, to Marshfield where he resided continuously to the time Mrs. King died, in December, 1933. During that time neither he nor any member of his family requested aid or assistance from Marshfield. When his wife died King was a poor person in need of assistance, and called on Marshfield to defray her burial expenses, and it did. In May, 1932, King\u2019s girl, about eight years old, injured a finger while playing in the Marshfield schoolyard. Her teacher took her to Doctor Corson in Plainfield, who found that immediate amputation of the finger was necessary. Knowing King and his ability to pay, the doctor refused to operate and take care of the case until the overseer of the poor for Marshfield agreed to pay for his services; and one Potter, Marshfield\u2019s then overseer, upon being consulted by the doctor by telephone, agreed to do so. After the amputation, King and other members of his family took the girl to the doctor\u2019s in Plainfield several times for treatment of her finger. The overseer requested King to pay the doctor\u2019s bill and he refused, saying that he would not and could not. The overseer paid the same June 7, 1932, by a town order drawn by him. In May, 1932, King was poor and in destitute circumstances, but made no request on the overseer for assistance. It is also found that the day before the overseer drew the order to pay the doctor, the selectmen of Marshfield paid King $20 \u201cin full payment for expense money paid out for Dorothy May King, injured in a swing and loss of her finger\u201d; and that during the year'1932 the town paid King $107.25 for boarding one Nunn, a town charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The plaintiff did not attempt to collect the amount expended on account of the girl\u2019s injuries from defendant, and it is not included in the judgment in this case. The only significance of that incident was to show that King had not acquired a residence in Marshfield at the'time of his wife\u2019s death, and, consequently, that Cabot was liable for Mrs. King\u2019s burial expenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>The real issue, as defendant says in its brief, '\u201cis whether the three years residence of the King family under the pauper statutes, in plaintiff town was interrupted by the transaction growing out of the King girl\u2019s injury, and the payment by the plaintiff, on account thereof. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Section 3923 of tlie Public Laws, so far as material, provides: \u201cIf a person is poor and in need of assistance for himself or family, the overseer of the poor of a town shall relieve such person or his family, when application for such assistance is made. * * * And if he has not resided in such town for three years, supporting himself and family, and is not of sufficient ability, to provide such assistance, the town so furnishing the same may recover the expense thereof in an action of contract, on this statute, from the town where he last resided for the space of three years, supporting himself and family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\"> Subject to defendant\u2019s exception, plaintiff was permitted to show by the doctor that he was paid for his services by a town order drawn by the overseer, and its date. It is claimed that this was incompetent as bearing on the pauper residence of King because the doctor\u2019s services were not authorized by King or any member of his family, nor had any member of that family applied to the overseer of Marshfield for assistance. This evidence was admissible if the doctor\u2019s services were rendered under such circumstances that Marshfield was liable therefor. We think they were. The girl required immediate attention; the doctor knew in a general way King\u2019s financial condition; so did the overseer; the doctor informed the overseer what had happened and what was necessary, and the overseer thereupon authorized his services. Nothing appears to indicate that the overseer did more, or other, than the law required of him in the circumstances. P. L. 3919 provides that: \u201cA town shall relieve and support poor and indigent persons residing or found therein, when they are in need thereof, \u2019 \u2019 etc. P. L. 3920 provides that the overseer of the poor shall have the care of such persons \u201cand shall see that they are suitably relieved, supported, \u2019 \u2019 etc. The overseer\u2019s duty to act was mandatory and ineludible when he received information, however, conveyed, that relief was required. <em>Town of Walden </em>v. <em>Town of Cabot, </em>25 Vt. 522; <em>Town of Weston </em>v. <em>Town of Wallingford, </em>52 Vt. 630; <em>Town of Waitsfield </em>v. <em>Town of Craftsbury, </em>87 Vt. 406, 89 Atl. 466, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 387; <em>Town of Hardwick </em>v. <em>Town of Barnard, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>102 Vt. 330, 148 Atl. 408; <em>Peabody </em>v. <em>Town of Holland, </em>107 Vt. 237, 178 Atl. 890. In the latter case, application for assistance for the poor person was made by a hospital located in plaintiff town. So the fact that neither King nor any member of his family applied for assistance does not avail defendant. This exception is without merit. This disposes of exceptions (a), (b), and (f). The record shows that the stub to the town order given the doctor was excluded, so exception (g) has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Subject to defendant\u2019s exception (h), plaintiff\u2019s overseer was permitted to testify that he consulted defendant\u2019s overseer regarding the girl\u2019s injury, but since he was not allowed to tell what either said this was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The remaining exceptions to the admission of evidence relate to evidence regarding King\u2019s financial status in May, 1932. Whether the overseer\u2019s determination that King\u2019s condition at that time made a proper case for relief was final and conclusive as to Marshfield (See <em>Holloway </em>v. <em>Town of Barton, </em>53 Vt. 300, a transient pauper ease), it was not as to Cabot. <em>Town of Ripton </em>v. <em>Town of Brandon, </em>80 Vt. 234, 67 Atl. 541. As to the latter town, King\u2019s then need of assistance was an open question.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">While it is said in <em>Town of Hardwick </em>v. <em>Town of Barnard, </em>following <em>Town of Bipton </em>v. <em>Town of Brandon, </em>that, when a town, <em>bona fide, </em>relieves a person apparently a pauper and actually standing in need of relief, the town in which such person has the statutory residence, if given the required notice, will be liable for the expense, although it may turn out that the person relieved had some property, in <em>Town of Cabot </em>v. <em>Town of St. Johnsbury, </em>94 Vt. 311, 317, 111 Atl. 454, this was held to apply only when, in the circumstances, what property such person has is not available for his immediate relief, or is manifestly disproportionate to his needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> Doctor Corson testified that he knew where the Kings lived, and had been in the house; that the place was on a back road, probably a mile and one-half from Marshfield village, and not in very good condition, and that King had three or four children. Subject to the objection that the evidence did not tend to show that the family were paupers, he was then permitted to testify that: \u2018 \u2018 The house was poorly furnished and the furniture that was there was very cheap and old material. \u2019 \u2019 Whether a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>son is poor and in need of assistance for himself or family within the meaning of our pauper law (P. L. 3923) does not depend alone upon the amount or value of property owned by him or his visible means of support. See cases cited above. Yet when one\u2019s need of assistance is the subject of inquiry, evidence that tends to show the surroundings or condition in which he lives, his property or lack thereof, its nature and condition, his income from whatever source,' the ability and willingness of others to aid him, etc., is admissible for what it is worth, its weight being for the trier in the circumstances disclosed. This evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\">Subject to the objection that it was immaterial and irrelevant, the doctor was allowed to testify that he saw nothing at King\u2019s house out of which he could collect a bill against King. This evidence had the same tendency as that just considered, and for the same reason was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The doctor was permitted to testify, subject to objection that it was immaterial, that he sent King statements of his bill, but as nothing further appeared concerning this, the evidence was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Burt Potter, Marshfield\u2019s overseer at the time the girl was injured, testified that he went to King\u2019s place to see him about the doctor\u2019s bill, but did not go inside the house or look around much, and that King then told him that he could not and would not pay the bill. He was then allowed to testify, subject to the objection that it was immaterial, incompetent, and irrelevant, that he did not know of any property that King had that could be used to pay the bill. While the probative value of this evidence may have been slight, the witness apparently spoke from his own knowledge, and its admission was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Archie Bullard, Marshfield\u2019s overseer at the time Mrs. King died, testified that he knew King, knew him before he, King, came to Marshfield, and subject to objection (ground not stated) testified: \u201cI know that Mr. King didn\u2019t have anything. He was having a hard time. No doubt about it,\u201d and that in May or June, 1932, King had nothing, to his knowledge, other than household furniture. This was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Earl Lamberton testified that he was tax collector for Marshfield during all the time King lived there; that in 1932, and before and after, he investigated to ascertain what property King had, and subject to the objection that it was incompetent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>and immaterial, was allowed to testify that he eonld not find any property that belonged to King. This was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\">At the close of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, defendant moved for judgment on grounds needless to state as will presently appear, and excepted to the denial of its motion. It waived this exception by proceeding with its defense. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>90 Vt. 81, 96 Atl. 697. Analogous cases are <em>Hobbs &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Grand Trunk Ry., </em>93 Vt. 392, 108 Atl. 199, and <em>Campbell et al. </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>98 Vt. 486, 129 Atl. 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In its brief defendant says that it offered to show \u201cthat in 1933 King continued to furnish board for a poor person named John Nunn, for which plaintiff town had previously paid King One Hundred Seven Dollars and Twenty-five cents, but that when Archie Bullard became plaintiff\u2019s overseer (in March, 1933) he refused to continue such payments, \u2019 \u2019 and it was excluded subject to its exception. All that is said regarding this evidence is that it was material on the question of King\u2019s financial condition. Without an offer to show how long King boarded Nunn after Bullard refused to pay, and that he did it under circumstances that made the town liable therefor, it had no tendency to show what is claimed for it. In the circumstances it was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Defendant excepted to the refusal of the court to find as requested that: \u201cTwenty dollars was paid to Oliver King on the order of the selectmen of the town of Marshfield, said order being \u2018for injury to Dorothy May King,\u2019 by check of the Treasurer of said town, June 6, 1932, and concurrently therewith said Oliver King executed a receipt for such sum and in consideration thereof a release to said town \u2018for suits, for damages losses and costs in said case, \u2019 and that the payment to Dr. Corson for attending said Dorothy was not made until the day following the securement of such release.\u201d The court found that the day preceding the date of the town order to the doctor \u201cthe selectmen of the town of Marshfield paid Mr. King twenty dollars in settlement of contingent claims regarding the injury to his-girl, and \u2018in full payment for expense money paid out for Dorothy May King, injured in a swing and loss, of her finger.\u2019 \u201d It is urged that the requested finding was material in support of defendant\u2019s claim that the payment to King and payment of the doctor\u2019s bill were made by the town officials because of the erroneous belief, on their part, that the town was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>liable for expenses and damages because the girl was injured on the school ground. The only evidence in support of such claim, called to our attention, is the receipt and release signed by King which reads as follows: \u201cKeeeived of Town of Marshfield Twenty Dollars being full payment for expense money paid out for Dorothy May King injured in a swing loss of finger in School Swing. And I hereby release said Town for suits for damages losses and costs in said case, \u2019 \u2019 and the recital in the order which the selectmen drew on the treasurer to pay King that it was \u201cfor injury to Dorothy May King.\u201d This was not sufficient to require the finding asked for. The settlement by the selectmen with King, though the result of an erroneous belief on their part as to the town\u2019s liability, could not, by reason of anything that appears, affect the town\u2019s liability for the doctor\u2019s bill which the overseer had previously incurred, nor is there anything to compel the conclusion that it was so intended. King was paid on the selectmen\u2019s order; the doctor was paid on the overseer\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Defendant requested the court to find that the doctor\u2019s services were sought and engaged by the school authorities of the Town of Marshfield because of an apprehension on their part that they, or the town, were legally liable for the injuries sustained by the child while using the swing on the school grounds; and that such services were engaged without consulting with, or authorization by, the child\u2019s parents or either of them, and excepted to its failure to do so. It is enough to say that the doctor\u2019s services were not engaged by the school authorities of Marshfield, and that the other matters embodied in the request have been disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The court properly refused to find as requested regarding board furnished by King to Nunn in 1933, since it is admitted that the evidence offered to prove this was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The court properly declined to make other findings requested by defendant for reasons already stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Defendant excepted to the finding that \u201cthe doctor knowing the girl\u2019s father and his ability to pay, refused to operate and take care of the case until the Overseer of the Poor of the Town of Marshfield had become holden for his reasonable charges,\u201d and refers to the following testimony of the teacher who went to the doctor\u2019s office with the girl: \u201cAs I remember, we were simply getting permission to remove the finger. Being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>unable to get Mr. King by telephone, we called the Town Overseer and that is all\u201d which it says was undisputed. This witness testified on cross-examination, however, \u2018 \u2018 I was in the office (Corson\u2019s) but I couldn\u2019t tell you just what he (the doctor) said.\u201d And, as has been seen, both the doctor and overseer testified that the doctor\u2019s bill was authorized by the overseer. The finding was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\">The finding that when the girl was injured King was poor and in destitute circumstances is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Defendant excepted to the finding that there was no evidence to show how much, if any, of the amount paid King for Nunn\u2019s board accrued, or was due, June 6, 1933, on the ground that the evidence showed it was all paid prior to January 31, 1933. Assuming that defendant is right about this, it is not apparent how it was harmed by the finding. The only relevancy of this evidence was on the question of King\u2019s financial status either at the time the girl was injured or when his wife died. The evidence of the overseer, Potter, that King began boarding Nunn in May, 1932, and that he paid him once a month at the rate of $3 a week was undisputed. It thus appears that King had received none of this money at the time the overseer authorized the doctor\u2019s bill; and if King received the last payment of $12 or $14 in January, 1933, it had no probative value to show that the December following he had sufficient means to pay his wife\u2019s burial expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Defendant excepted to the judgment and says that it should be reversed \u2018\u2018for the reasons given in connection with the exceptions to the evidence, to the refusal of the court to find as requested, and to the findings as made. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\"> No reason stated in connection with these exceptions requires a reversal. None other is advanced regarding the impropriety of the judgment. The findings, and such inferences as the trial court might fairly have made therefrom, which this Court, in support of the judgment, will presume it made, <em>Labor </em>v. <em>Carpenter et al., </em>102 Vt. 418, 422, 148 Atl. 867, clearly support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
