At that time the surface of the highway consisted of a new 18-foot pavement with loose gravel shoulders. The plaintiff as a guest of her husband was traveling southerly in a car driven by him, when they overtook a car operated by the defendant. After following this car for a time, Mr. Bennett sounded his horn to go by and defendant\u2019s car, which had been traveling in the center of the road, pulled over to the right of the center, whereupon Mr. Bennett turned his automobile to the left and attempted to pass on his left-hand side of the highway. When partly by, the left front end of defendant\u2019s car came into violent contact with the right running board and right rear fender of the Bennett car. The evidence was conflicting as to the cause of the collision. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that the defendant, without warning, attempted to drive back into the center of the road, and that in so doing his car hit the Bennett car while that car was well over on its left of the center of the road. Her witnesses testified to seeing a skid mark on the cement at the point of contact. This mark was described as being from one to three feet to the left of the center of the road. Her evidence tended to show that the Bennett car was thrown out of control; that the left front wheel went off the pavement onto the soft left shoulder in a little over a car\u2019s length; that the driver pulled it back and it curved partly over the center of the road, and, as a result of his trying to turn it back so as not to get in front of the other car, it again went off the pavement onto the left shoulder; and that when he again attempted to turn the car back upon the road it rolled completely over, and finally landed on its four wheels entirely off, and facing, the road, near or against a telephone pole located about 4 feet to the left of the road and about 250 feet from the point of collision with defendant\u2019s car. Verdict and judgment were for the plaintiff and the ease comes here upon defendant\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Chester Bennett, plaintiff\u2019s husband, upon cross-examination testified that he had been traveling about 25 to 30 miles per hour, and that when he turned out to pass he speeded up about five miles faster, and that after the collision he attempted to stop and put on his brake gradually, and his car was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>out of control. Then followed the following questions and answers in further cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. Assuming you had applied your brake heavily, could you have stopped your car ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">A. Why, I presume so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">Q. If that was so why didn\u2019t you do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">A. Well, my car was out of control, I was trying to keep between the road, I couldn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">Q. With your car out of control and you had pressed your brake heavily couldn\u2019t you have stopped it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">A. Well, I couldn\u2019t say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">Q. What is your judgment about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-12\">A. Well, I don\u2019t know, Jack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">Q. Were your brakes in good condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-14\">A. Why, yes, the car had been inspected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-15\">Q. At that 30 to 35 miles an hour under normal conditions, how far do you travel before you stop?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-16\">Mr. Carver: Under what condition, if the Court please ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-18\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-19\">The Court: Yes, we think you should include the conditions, it would make a difference what they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-20\">Q. You stated yesterday that you traveled anyway 160 to 180 feet, and probably more, that is so, isn\u2019t it, after the cars contacted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-21\">A. I said I didn\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t give- you the exact measurement, because I didn\u2019t take none.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-22\">Q. At 30 to 35 miles an hour, and in that distance you were on the cement most of the time, weren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-23\">A. No, I was on and off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-24\">Q. But mostly you were on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-25\">A. My left side was off three different times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-26\">Q. But just for an instant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-27\">A. I should imagine so, I don\u2019t know how long it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Q. And on these occasions when you came back on the cement, if you had applied your brake heavily you probably could have stopped, isn\u2019t that so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">Q. What do you think?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">A. I don\u2019t know what would have taken place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">Q. You didn\u2019t try to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">A. Yes, I applied my brake, but probably didn\u2019t apply it hard, I applied it, of course, naturally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">Q. If you had applied it further you would have stopped ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-11\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-12\">Q. But you didn\u2019t apply your brake hard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-13\">A. Yes, I applied it, sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-14\">Q. Not hard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-15\">A. I don\u2019t know how hard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-16\">Q. Could you have applied it harder than you did apply it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-17\">A. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-18\">Q. Traveling that distance you say you traveled, couldn\u2019t you have stopped your car if you had applied your brakes hard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-19\">Mr. Carver: I object to that question, that is the same question that was objected to before and the Court ruled on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-20\">The Court: You should have the conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-21\">Q. I amend the question, the conditions under which you were traveling at that time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-22\">Mr. Carver: I object to that question, that is'not a proper question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-23\">The Court: No, the question should state the conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-24\">Q. All right, Mr. Bennett, as you were traveling along there at the speed you state you were traveling, after your car contacted with the Robertson car and during the time you were traveling that distance from one side of the road to the other, if you had applied your brake good and stiff couldn\u2019t you have stopped ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Mr. Carver: I object to that question, I say that is not a proper question in cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">The Court: We will exclude it, and defendant may have an exception. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">It is apparent that the last question still fails to state all the conditions. Moreover, the error, if any, was harmless as the cross-examiner had already gotten substantially what his question called for. This exception is not sustained. The defendant, in contending that the plaintiff is limited to the objections made below, overlooks our frequently repeated rule, that this Court may sustain a ruling of the trial court upon any legal grounds, even though that court may have based its ruling upon other grounds. <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Rexford, </em>105 Vt. 492, 493, 494, 168 Atl. 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Because of the context we next take up an exception to the charge. The defendant excepted \u201cto the failure of the court to charge the jury that if they find that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were occasioned solely by the failure of Chester Bennett to handle his automobile properly after the contact between his automobile and the defendant\u2019s automobile, then in such ease the jury must find the defendant not guilty.\u201d Under this exception the defendant raises the question of an efficient intervening cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">A situation in many respects similar was recently before us in <em>Beatty </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>103 Vt. 340, 154 Atl. 770, 771. As the same general principles of law are applicable, we quote from page 343, omitting the authorities there cited: \u201cWhen negligence is established, liability attaches for all the injurious consequences that \u00f1ow therefrom until diverted by the intervention of some efficient cause that makes the injury its own, or until the force set in motion by the negligent act has so far spent itself as to be too small for the law\u2019s notice. The difficulty in applying this rule often lies in determining what is an \u2018intervening cause\u2019 therein referred to. The answer to this question is to be found in the character of the intervening act. * * * If this, itself, is \u2018a natural and proper result of the original negligence, it will not necessarily prevent a recovery thereon.\u2019 Otherwise it will. Such an efficient intervening cause, in order to stand as the responsible cause of the ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>result, must be a new and independent force or agency breaking tbe chain of causal connection between the original wrong and that result. If that result is merely accelerated by the new cause, the chain is not broken. Thus it is that the negligence of a third person may or may not amount to an efficient intervening cause. If it is something that, in the eye of the law, the person charged was bound to anticipate, the causal connection is not broken; otherwise .the chain of causation is broken. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We have already, by a general statement and by extended quotations from Chester Bennett\u2019s testimony, recited plaintiff\u2019s version of how the accident happened and the subsequent events. Omitting defendant\u2019s explanation of the cause of the accident, his evidence tended to show that the Bennett car stayed entirely upon the paved surface of the road for 200 feet or more beyond the point of collision, traveling from one side to the other, before it went off the left side and tipped over.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Owing to the distance traveled before the final upset, it might have been possible for the jury, under proper instructions and acting reasonably, to have decided that the force set in motion by the defendant had spent itself, and that, allowing sufficient time for Bennett to recover from the sudden peril which the collision may have thrust upon him, he would have averted the final consequences had he acted reasonably. Under such cireumst\u00e1nces the plaintiff\u2019s injuries would have been occasioned solely by the intervening negligence of her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The court charged: \u201cNegligence in order to be actionable must be the proximate cause of the injury complained of. Now by \u2018proximate cause\u2019 we mean such a cause as from which the accident naturally and reasonably followed as a result of it. It is such a cause as ought reasonably to be expected by a prudent man to cause some injury to another. It is such a cause as without which this accident would not have occurred when, where and as it did.\u201d .Also: \u201cIf in the consideration of the evidence in this' case you should believe that the driver of the Bennett car was negligent, that does not preclude the plaintiff from recovering in this action, provided that you also find the defendant was guilty of some negligence that contributed to this accident as a proximate cause of it, and that the plaintiff herself was free from contributory negligence. That is, if the driver of each of these cars was negligent, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>such circumstances the plaintiff is entitled to recover, provided you find she was free from contributory negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">This charge did not call the jury\u2019s attention sufficiently to the principles of law we have mentioned. The jury might well have understood that if the defendant negligently caused or contributed to the collision with the Bennett car he was necessarily liable for plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The defendant was, therefore, entitled to an instruction according to the tenor of his exception, since the issues made by the evidence called for it, and the failure to give it was prejudicial error. Although there was no request for this instruction, it was the duty of the trial court to instruct the jury upon every essential part of the -case; and an exception to the failure to charge as to such matters, though not requested, is well taken. <em>Clark </em>v. Demurs, 102 Vt. 147, 151, 146 Atl. 812; and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The defendant offered to read from the transcript of a former trial portions of the testimony given by the plaintiff and by her witnesses, Chester Bennett and T. E. Atkins, saying that this evidence at the former trial was evidence of the fact and that he not only offered these parts of their testimony as evidence of the fact, but also as impeaching testimony. This offer was excluded subject to exception. When his attention was called to his former testimony Bennett had admitted that he had so testified, so there was no occasion to read his former testimony. Atkins\u2019 attention had not been called to his former testimony and he had not been given an opportunity to admit or deny that he so testified. As no foundation had been laid his former testimony was inadmissible. The portion of plaintiff\u2019s testimony offered had to do with her statement at the former trial that she \u201ctook a few osteopathic treatments.\u201d At this trial she testified that she thought she took about two such treatments a week for about six months. When her attention was called to her former testimony she said: \u201cI suppose I said I took treatments, I don\u2019t know how many I said.\u201d When asked if whatever answer she gave then was true, she replied: \u201c1 guess so.\u201d If material and a proper offer had been made, this statement should have been received. Nothing has been pointed out, however, to show that this was not a collateral matter. No harm appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\"> As applicable to the foregoing, our rule is, that a witness, not a party, may be impeached by giving in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>statements made by such witness, at a former trial or elsewhere, which are inconsistent with his testimony, the foundation of such impeachment having first been laid by. calling the witness\u2019 attention to the claimed statement, and questioning him about it. Such statements are impeaching statements only, and, where the witness is not a party, are not evidence to prove the fact to be as stated. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>100 Vt. 1, 5, 134 Atl. 706; <em>In re Claflin\u2019s Will, </em>75 Vt. 19, 23, 52 Atl. 1053, 58 L. R. A. 1061; <em>Law </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>46 Vt. 425, 431. In the case of a party, however, no foundation need be laid. The statements made by such a one are evidence of the fact. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Leonard, supra; Coolidge </em>v. <em>Ayers, </em>77 Vt. 448, 453, 61 Atl. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The defendant also excepted \u201cto the failure of the court to charge that any discrepancy between the statement of witnesses at the former trial of this cause and their testimony at the present trial should be resolved in favor of their earlier testimony, the transaction being fresher in their minds, unless the testimony in the later trial is corroborated.\u201d Along the same line the defendant took a further exception to the charge as follows: \u2018 \u2018 The defendant excepts to the charge of the court in words to this effect: \u2018That the jury cannot consider evidence given by a witness at a former trial as evidence in this case.\u2019 We say the rule is that the jury can take the evidence given by a witness at a former trial which has been introduced in evidence in this case as evidence of the facts set forth in the evidence given at the former trial.\u201d These exceptions are taken care of by what we have said. This is not a case where the testimony at a former trial was offered because of the absence of the witness at the present trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\"> The court charged upon positive and negative testimony as follows: \u2018 \u2018 There is also another class of evidence introduced in this case known as positive and negative testimony. For example: Certain witnesses have testified to seeing a certain mark in the highway near the scene of this accident. Now as a general rule, positive testimony has more weight than negative testimony, that is, assuming the credibility of the witnesses testifying to be equal, because if you find that a certain witness who has testified to seeing the mark is truthful and has seen such mark, of course that convinces you that the mark was there. The mark might have been there and some witness who says he did not see it \u2014 the fact that the witness did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>see it is not conclusive as to whether the mark is there or not. But after all; gentlemen, the weight to be given to the testimony of these witnesses, this positive and negative testimony is for you to determine.\u201d The defendant excepted to this as applied to the mark, \u201cbecause we say that this rule does not apply to the testimony of witnesses who stated that they looked over the highway at the place where the mark was and saw none, as for example, Inspector Gregory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The distinction made by the court has long been recognized in this State. <em>Seviour\u2019s Admr. </em>v. <em>Rutland R. R. Co., </em>88 Vt. 107, 111, 91 Atl. 1039, 1040; <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Cilley, </em>47 Vt. 1; <em>Farmers\u2019, etc., Bank </em>v. <em>Champlain Transp. Co., </em>23 Vt. 186, 56 A. D. 68. As said in the Seviour Case: \u201cThe propriety of charging it depends upon circumstances. To give the instruction in some cases might be legal error.\u201d Wherever it can be perceived that a positive witness is guilty of perjury unless his statement is true, while a negative witness may be honestly mistaken, the issue should be found in favor of the former if the witnesses are of equal credibility. 10 R. C. L. 1010; <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Cilley, supra. </em>This is a helpful formula in determining whether the charge used should have been given. Several witnesses testified to seeing the skid mark. There was no chance here for an honest mistake. On the other hand, although Chester Bennett testified to pointing out this mark to Gregory, the latter testified that all that Bennett indicated to him was the relative point of location where the two cars came in contact, approximately on the center line of the highway, and that he didn\u2019t try to point out any-mark to the left of the center of the highway. It is apparent from Gregory\u2019s testimony as to the tracks he found in the highway leading to where the two cars left the road that he thought the cars collided in the center, or to the right of the center, of the highway. As the mark, if there, was from one to three feet to the left of the center of the highway, and possibly a little north or south of the point where he decided the cars came together, it would have been possible for him to have made an honest mistake as to the existence of the mark, although he looked for marks upon the highway in that vicinity. This exception is not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The defendant excepted \u201cto the charge of the court concerning the acts of Mr. Chester Bennett in an emergency, because there was no such emergency declared upon, and the only issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>presented by the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was that of the defendant driving to the left of the defendant\u2019s center of the highway and cansing the damages claimed.\u201d Defendant quotes from <em>Buck, Admr. </em>v. <em>Rutland R. R. Co., </em>101 Vt. 282, 284, 143 Atl. 297, 298, where it states that it is a familiar rule of pleading that the acts or omissions constituting the negligence complained of must be averred in traversable form, and that recovery can be had only for the negligence so charged. \u2018 \u2018 This rule requires one who would avail himself of the \u2018last clear chance\u2019 doctrine to allege.the facts which gave rise to the duty on the part of the defendant to act for his protection after the latter discovered, or ought to have discovered, the peril into which the former\u2019s negligence had led him.\u201d Defendant then says: \u201cThe above rule being true, we are unable to see why it should not have the same force and effect in this case with respect to the emergency doctrine so as to cause the plaintiff to aver facts which would give rise to the duty on the part, of the defendant to anticipate that his .conduct would place plaintiff\u2019s driver in a position of sudden peril and thus minimize his conduct after the contact to such an extent that he wo^d be thus excused from an act that would otherwise be negligent and wrongful. In the absence of a proper pleading of the facts required to make this issue, the defendant had no.notice that this issue was to be made and no opportunity to prepare for it before trial and was suddenly faced with this issue by the charge given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">There is a distinction between the two situations. The Buck Case simply states what is necessary to allege to constitute a charge of negligence as applied to that particular situation. Here we are talking about the result of negligence. It is well established with us that on the question of what is negligence, it is material to consider the consequences that a prudent man might reasonably have anticipated. But when negligence is once established, that consideration is wholly immaterial, on the question of how far it imposes liability. <em>Woodcock\u2019s Admr. </em>v. <em>Hallock, </em>98 Vt. 284, 290, 127 Atl. 380. If defendant negligently collided with the Bennett car, it was not necessary, in order to establish his liability for the consequences, that he should have anticipated that Mr. Bennett would have been placed, in a position of sudden peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The \u201cemergency\u201d doctrine is merely the\"application of the prudent-man rule. The law appreciates that one, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>through no fault of his own, is confronted with a sudden peril, may do some things which, after it is all over, may seem to have been improper or even foolish. It gives him a reasonable opportunity to recover from the shock naturally resulting from such a situation, and affords him a reasonable opportunity to regain control of himself and his car, before he can be charged with negligence. <em>Beatty </em>v. <em>Dunn, supra. </em>Under such circumstances he is not negligent if he does what a prudent man would or might have done. <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>96 Vt. 89, 95, 117 Atl. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Had the plaintiff been the driver of her car she would not have had to allege the facts that constituted her due care and caution. <em>Winifred Brothers\u2019 Admr. </em>v. <em>Rutland R. R. Co., </em>71 Vt. 48, 50, 42 Atl. 980. Consequently she would not have had to allege that the degree of care demanded of her was lessened by a sudden peril. But as her husband was the driver and she was his guest, she did not have to allege or prove due care on his part as to the cause of the collision; all that she had to prove was, that defendant\u2019s negligence was at least a contributing proximate cause of her injuries, and as to the latter, as we have seen, it was very material to show that her husband acted with due care after the collision. This exception is not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Several other exceptions were taken, but as it is unlikely that similar questions will be raised at another trial, we do not consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and cat\u00f3se remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
