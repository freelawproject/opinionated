' The plaintiffs are the Aetna Insurance Company and associated insurance companies, and The Pennsylvania Railroad Company. The facts upon which the claim for refund is founded are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">On July 21, 1949, Midwest Solvents Company, Inc., hereinafter referred to as Midwest, a manufacturer of alcohol, withdrew from its Industrial Alcohol Bonded Warehouse 15,280.6 proof gallons of grain alcohol for shipment to Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc., pursuant to a purchase agreement. At the time of the withdrawal of the industrial alcohol from the bonded warehouse, Mid-west paid the United States excise taxes thereon in the amount of $137,525.40. This tax-paid alcohol was loaded aboard a tank car and consigned to a point in Pennsylvania. On July 25, 1949, while being transported by one of the trains of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and on the lines of that company, the tank car containing the alcohol was derailed and overturned. As a result of this accident 11,549.57 proof gallons of alcohol were lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">Pursuant to the provisions of the uniform bill of lading, requiring payment for failure to deliver, under which the shipment was made, the carrier, Pennsylvania Railroad paid to the consignee $109,046.73 on account of the alcohol lost during shipment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Of this amount $103,954.50 represented excise taxes paid on the lost alcohol. Thereafter, the Pennsylvania Railroad requested Mid-west to file a claim for refund with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue seeking a return of taxes paid on the destroyed alcohol. This claim was rejected on August 4, 1950, by the Commissioner on the ground that \u201c[t]here is no provision of law for the refunding of tax where the spirits have been lost by casualty after the tax ascertained to be due has been paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">On or about May 19, 1953, the Pennsylvania Railroad took an assignment from Midwest and Hunter-Wilson Distilling Company, the consignee of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>alcohol shipment, of all their interest in the lost alcohol \u201cincluding any and all taxes paid thereon, and any claim against the -United States Government for a refund thereof.\u201d The Pennsylvania Railroad has been partially indemnified by collection from Aetna Insurance Company and others, also parties to this suit, under insurance contracts in the amount of $53,945.50. By the terms of the insurance policies, and by special subrogation receipts, each of the insuranc\u00e9 companies was subrogated to the rights of the Pennsylvania Railroad to the extent of the payment which each company made to the railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Suit was brought on June 4, 1952, under section 3113(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3113(a) in this court by the insurance companies and the Pennsylvania Railroad, for a refund of the tax represented by the loss of the industrial alcohol. This section reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-5\">\u201cWhenever any alcohol is lost by evaporation or other shrinkage, leakage, casualty, or unavoidable cause during distillation, redistillation, denaturation, withdrawal, piping, shipment, warehousing, storage, packing, transfer, or recovery, of any such alcohol the Commissioner may remit or refund any tax incurred under existing law upon such alcohol, provided he is satisfied that the alcohol had not been diverted to any illegal.use: <em>Provided, also, </em>That such allowance shall not be granted if the person claiming same is indemnified against such loss by a valid claim of insurance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The Government bases its defense to this action Upon three main contentions, which are: (1) No statute provides a refund of taxes paid on distilled spirits where the loss occurs after tax payment; (2) The plaintiffs not having paid the tax may not maintain an action for its refund; (3) A train wreck is not a casualty within the meaning of section 3113 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\"><em>First.\u2019 </em>The Government says that section 3113(a) does not allow a refund of tax after its payment. It points out that the tax on alcohol is an excise tax on the manufacture of the spirits and attaches at the time of production, although payment is deferred until the time it is removed from a bonded warehouse. Once it has been removed from bond and the tax paid, the Government contends, no refunds may be made due to any loss. In support of this position the Government cites sections of the Internal Revenue Code dealing with refund of taxes paid on distilled spirits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 2901 of the 1939 Code, 26 U.S. C. A. \u00a7 2901 allows refund of tax on distilled spirits, and has generally been interpreted by the courts as not allowing refund after the tax has been paid and the alcohol withdrawn from bond, see Erie Railroad Company v. United States, Ct.CL, 156 F.Supp. 908. Cf. StitzelWeller Distillery, Inc. v. United States, D. C., 82 F.Supp. 50, affirmed, 6 Cir., 180 F.2d 357. Apparently in order to make sure that such an interpretation of that section was followed by the courts and administrative offices, the Congress, after the Stitzel-Weller affirmation, quickly amended section 2901, 64 Stat. 7, in 1950 and provided in its subsection (c) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-14\">\u201c* * * Nothing in section 2901 as hereby amended, or as heretofore amended, shall be construed to authorize refund of the tax where the loss occurred after the tax was paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">This amendment restored to the Code a limitation concerning the refund of taxes on distilled spirits which had existed in prior acts. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 3221; 1939 Code \u00a7 2901(b), 53 Stat. 341. This same congressional limitation on refunds of tax paid on distilled spirits was mani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>fested in section 5011(a) (3) of the 1954 Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">We think that the Government\u2019s reliance on these sections in its attempt to show the intention of Congress with respect to refunds claimed as here under section 3113(a) is misplaced. Section 2901 of the 1939 Code was contained in Chapter 26, Subchapter A, Part IV, 53 Stat. 340. Subchapter A was headed Distilled Spirits and Part IV thereof <em>Miscellaneous Provisions Relating to Distilled Spirits. </em>On the other hand, section 3113(a) is found in Subchapter C, part II, which came under the general heading Industrial Alcohol Plants. 53 Stat. 360. Thus the two sections relating to refunds of tax on alcohol cannot be said to be so interrelated that they must be read in <em>pari materia. </em>In fact an opposite conclusion seems to be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">There was a logical distinction between refunding taxes on distilled spirits and industrial alcohol. The latter was used in industry, commonly rendered nonpotable, and was like any other article of commerce. When not drinkable it did not offer the temptations incident to production, storage, and shipment of the other alcohol. Had Congress intended to provide the same restrictions on refunds of tax paid on industrial alcohol as those applied to distilled spirits, it had ample opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">In enacting section 5011 of the 1954 Code, Congress set forth in that section the requirements for refund of tax on <em>both </em>distilled spirits and industrial alcohol. However, the rule against refund after payment of tax is expressly limited to subsection (a) of section 5011 which deals only with distilled spirits. Subsection (c) of section 5011 sets forth the requirements for refund of tax paid on alcohol produced in an industrial alcohol plant and does not forbid a refund after payment of the tax. Section 5011(c) is substantially the same as section 3113(a) of the 1939 Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The logical conclusion, therefore, would be that Congress did not intend to restrict, either in the 1939 Code or the 1954 Code, refunds of taxes on industrial alcohol to losses occurring prior to the time that the tax is paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-18\">The legislative history of the provision for refund of industrial alcohol taxes upon loss of the commodity confirms this view. The provision first appeared in the National Prohibition Act of 1919, Title III, Industrial Alcohol, \u00a7 14, 41 Stat. 321. It was inserted in the bill in the House, obviously to protect producers of industrial alcohol from losses, and agreed to there and in the Senate without significant discussion. 58 Cong. Ree. 2971; 4893, 4904. At that time, 41 Stat. 317, \u00a7 35, all tax provisions on intoxicating liquor were specifically continued in effect. The manufacture of distilled spirits largely for beverage purposes had long been closely supervised and taxed. The provisions for protection of the revenue were detailed and included provisions for recovery or abatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>of taxes on distilled spirits only while in bond.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The omission of the restrictions as to industrial alcohol can only be explained by the less likelihood of tax violations from its handling. As set out above, this difference between distilled spirits and industrial alcohol has continued down to this time. When section 5011(c), <em>supra, </em>footnote 5, the present provision, was before Congress the Committee Reports on the Internal Revenue Code said, as to the subsection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-4\">\u201cSubsection (c), \u2018Loss or destruction of alcohol/ is existing law (see sec. 3113(a)) except that the parenthetical statement \u2018(produced at an industrial alcohol plant or imported under section 5311)\u2019 has been inserted following the words \u2018Whenever any alcohol\u2019 at the beginning of the subsection, and the words \u2018under existing law\u2019 were deleted in the phrase \u2018may remit or refund any tax incurred under existing law upon such alcohol\u2019. The parenthetical insertion is made to distinguish between alcohol produced at industrial' alcohol plants or imported and high proof spirits produced at distilleries, in order that the loss provisions of the subsection may not be construed as applying to such spirits produced at registered distilleries. The deletion of the words \u2018under existing law\u2019 is made for the purpose of clarity. [U. S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, 83d Cong., 2d sess., Vol. 3, House Report \u2014 Detailed Discussion of Bill, pp. 4476-4477; Senate Report, p. 5134.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">In Erie Railroad, supra, this court had occasion to discuss refunds of tax on distilled spirits under the Revenue Code of 1939. The plaintiff in that case was seeking refund under a situation quite like the one now presented. There is, however, one major and controlling difference between that case and this. There the refund was sought with respect to alcohol <em>not </em>produced in an industrial alcohol plant. As it was stated, Congress clearly did not intend to allow a refund on those distilled spirits after payment of tax. Section 2901(c). This is not now the case before us and with respect to claims under section 3113(a) of the 1939 Code we hold that refund of the tax owed is not barred because the loss occurred after payment of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\"><em>Second. </em>The Government urges that the plaintiffs are not the correct parties to maintain suit for refund. As previously pointed out, the Pennsylvania Railroad suffered the loss because of the liability imposed upon it by its shipping contract. We think that it is a correct party before this court. As the Pennsylvania Railroad was responsible for and paid the loss, it obtained the right by section 3113, which the taxpayer had, to recover any part of the taxes in order to extinguish or mitigate its loss. This section does not limit recovery to the taxpayer as did section 2901(b) of the 1939 Code and section 5011(a) (2) of the 1954 Code. Subrogees were not excluded. Cf. Niagara Fire Ins. Co. v. United States, D.C., 76 F.Supp. 850, Instead it speaks of \u201cthe person claiming same.\u201d The railroad paid the consignee for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>loss suffered through the casualty. Therefore the railroad bore the loss instead of the owner who had paid the tax for the producer in accordance with the purchase contract. The right of the Pennsylvania arose as a result of subrogation, and the agreement executed between Pennsylvania, Midwest and Hunter-Wilson did no more than express in words what was already in effect by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The Government loses nothing by such a subrogation. It would have been liable to the taxpayer for the loss if he were still the owner and is equally liable to the railroad which bore the owner\u2019s burden. The case is much like United States v. American Tobacco Co., 166 U.S. 468, 17 S.Ct. 619, 620, 41 L.Ed. 1081. There American recovered from the United States the value of stamps destroyed by fire for the benefit of its insurance carriers. The suit was brought under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 3426, as amended, 20 Stat. 327, 349, in the name of American Tobacco, the taxpayer, because .that statute called for refund \u201cto the owner thereof.\u201d 166 U.S. at page 470, 17 S.Ct. at page 620. But the insurance carrier, because of its payment to American, was subrogated to the taxpayer\u2019s claim against the United States. \u201cThe suit is properly brought in the name of the insured for the use of the insurers, but the cause of action rests on the rights of the [insured].\u201d 166 U.S. at page 474, 17 S.Ct. at page 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\"> In the present case, the carrier, the Pennsylvania Railroad, being liable to the owner by the terms of its bill of lading, on payment thereof became subrogated to the claim against the United States of the owner of the industrial alcohol, subject to all defenses the United States had against the owner, the consignee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This subrogation is not through any statute but by virtue of the nature of the carrier\u2019s obligation under its bill of lading. When the owner is made whole, its right to salvage or recovery against third parties passes to the carrier and the carrier\u2019s insurers. This follows the general principle of subrogation that when one obligated to indemnify an obligee satisfies his contract, the rights of the obligee arising from the transaction against third parties pass to the obligor. Vermilye &amp; Co. v. Adams Express Co., 21 Wall. 138, 22 L.Ed. 609; Hardman v. Brett, C.C., 37 F. 803, 805, 2 L.R.A. 173.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It was for this reason, in these very transactions that, to protect the insurers against any claim by the railroad, the consignee\u2019s insurance policy contained a clause barring any claim by a carrier through subrogation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">We turn to consider a statutory limitation in section 3113, supra, page 3, on the right to recover for loss by casualty of industrial alcohol during \u201cshipment.\u201d This is the proviso, \u201cThat such allowance shall not be granted if the person claiming same is indemnified against such loss by a valid claim of insurance.\u201d The Government argues without specific reliance on this proviso that the plaintiffs have no standing to sue. The plaintiffs attack the proviso directly. They assert the proviso is unconstitutional in that it works an arbitrary discrimination against insured and uninsured claimants for tax refunds which violates the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>The proviso has existed since the first industrial alcohol legislation, section 14, 41 Stat. 321. A similar provision still exists in respect to distilled spirits, 1954 Code, section 5011(a) (4). It originally was passed May 27, 1872, 17 Stat. 162. It was inserted in the original refund bill concerning distilled spirits after a suggestion on the floor that if the taxpayer \u201cshould succeed in recovering from the insurance company one-half of the value of the spirits destroyed, it would be inequitable that he should not pay a portion at least of the tax on those spirits.\u201d In form it was substantially like the present wording. Instead of the original word \u201ctax,\u201d it now reads \u201closs.\u201d The meaning is the same.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">It may be that as allowance of refund is an act of grace, the tax being payable upon the manufacture or withdrawal of the alcohol, the Congress favored only taxpayers who had suffered loss when the entire transaction was taken into consideration. At any rate we do not find the limitation so arbitrary or unreasonable as to violate the Fifth Amendment. When legislating for the refund of taxes, it is reasonable to classify taxpayers according to whether they did or did not suffer loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The right on a casualty to recover a refund covered by section 3113 passed from taxpayer to purchaser to consignee (Hunter-Wilson Distilling Co., a subsidiary of Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc.). When the Pennsylvania Railroad paid Hunter-Wilson for the loss, as required by its bill of lading, it was subrogated, as we held above, to the consignee\u2019s right to tax refund. It became the \u201cperson claiming same,\u201d entitled to sue to recover, the real party in interest of Rule 17 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The amount paid by the Pennsylvania Railroad to the consignee was $109,046.-73 (finding 8). The Pennsylvania Railroad received from its own insurers, also plaintiffs here, $53,945.50. It sues for $50,000. Two issues arise as to the statutory limitation as to indemnification:</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">A. Was the owner-consignee \u201cindemnified against such loss by a valid claim of insurance\u201d ? If so, its subrogee cannot recover because a subrogee takes only the rights of the creditor. The Pennsylvania Railroad must pay the consignee the loss because of the bill of lading. It is a debtor-creditor relation akin to insurance but we do not think it is the sort of obligation covered by the statutory phrase \u2014 \u201ca valid claim of insurance.\u201d It is not the \u201cinsurance\u201d referred to on the floor of Congress at the time of its original adoption. That was a usual fire insurance policy carried by the distiller. Congress evidently did not have a bill of lading in mind when it allowed tax recovery in section 3113 for loss in \u201cshipment.\u201d Every carrier has the common law liability for \u201cfailure to transport safely goods intrusted to its <em>care.\u201d </em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Company v. Thompson Manufacturing Company, 270 U.S. 416, 422, 46 S.Ct. 318, 319, 70 L.Ed. 654. We do not think the bill of lading gave the consignee \u201ca valid claim of insurance\u201d within the meaning of the act. Therefore the Pennsylvania Railroad gained by subrogation the consignee\u2019s right to recover from the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">B. Does the same rule apply to the plaintiff companies who insured the Pennsylvania Railroad against loss and thereby on payment to the railroad in turn became subrogated to its claim against the Government? We do not think that it does. The proviso of section 3113(a), page 3, supra, says \u201csuch allowance shall not be granted if the person [Pennsylvania] claiming same is indemnified against such loss by a valid claim of insurance.\u201d The Pennsylvania Railroad, the claimant, held valid claims of insurance for $53,945.50 paid by plaintiff companies. It cannot recover this because of the section 3113 proviso so, of course, its insurance company subrogees cannot either. They have only the rights of the Pennsylvania Railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number><em>Third. </em>Finally, the Government urges that section 3113, see 159 F.Supp. 834, supra, does not cover a loss by train wreck. Proper diligence by the carrier would have avoided the loss. Therefore it was \u201cnegligence, not a casualty,\u201d which the Government urges is \u201can event which a human cannot prevent,\u201d citing Crystal Springs Distillery Co. v. Cox, 6 Cir., 49 F. 555. The statute there in question, Rev.Stat. \u00a7 3221, allowed recovery for \u201cdestruction by accidental fire or other casualty.\u201d The court refused recovery from loss by warpage and undiscoverable wormholes. He concluded such incidents were not a \u201ccasualty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">Under this statute, section 3113 with its use of shrinkage, leakage, casualty, or unavoidable cause during \u201cshipment * * * [or] transfer,\u201d we cannot but conclude that a loss by train wreck is a loss by \u201ccasualty\u201d in the ordinary meaning of the word and as covered by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Internal Revenue taxation places on producers the duty to pay certain exactions for the support of the Government. Producers must pass these heavy luxury taxes on to the consumer, the ultimate bearer. When casualty intervenes, after the tax is paid, the choice is with Congress whether to compel the producer to bear the loss or to refund the amount on terms dictated by legislation. We think the Pennsylvania Railroad has met the requirements of the Congress and should recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">It is the opinion of this court that plaintiff The Pennsylvania Railroad Company may recover the tax paid on the alcohol lost by the wreck during shipment over its lines, for which it was liable, to the extent that such loss was not indemnified by insurance. The amount of recovery under the petition, together with interest as provided by law, will be determined pursuant to Rule 38(c), 28 U.S. C.A. It is further held that plaintiff Aetna Insurance Company and the other plaintiff insurance companies may not recover, and the petition as to them will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">JONES, Chief Judge, and MADDEN, and LITTLETON, Judges, concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-11\">. Under the terras of the purchase agreement between Midwest and Seagram, the purchaser advanced an amount equal to the excise tax on the alcohol removed from bond. Seagram had consigned this shipment to Hunter-Wilson Distilling Company and it was to them that the Pennsylvania Railroad made payment for the loss caused by the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b882-8\">.

Congressional Globe, 42d Cong., 2d sess., pp. 2359 and 2385.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b887-10\">WHITAKER, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A6V\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">The correct decision in this case is not as plain as in Erie Railroad Company v. United States, Ct.Cl., 156 F.Supp. 908, but, even so, I do not think it was the intent of Congress to permit a refund of a tax on account of a casualty occurring after the alcohol had been withdrawn from bond and the tax had been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">Most of the occasions enumerated in section 3113(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, permitting a remission or refund of the tax, are things occurring before withdrawal from bond. For instance, \u201cshrinkage\u201d, \u201cleakage\u201d, \u201cunavoidable cause during distillation, redistillation, denaturation\u201d; all these of course, occur prior to withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">Then the statute mentions \u201cwithdrawal\u201d. I take it this means withdrawal from bond, and refers to a loss in this process. \u201cPiping\u201d, I suppose, refers to transmission of the alcohol by pipe from distillery to warehouse or within one or the other. \u201cStorage\u201d must mean storage in the warehouse. \u201cTransfer\u201d and \u201cshipment\u201d I would suppose mean transfer and shipment before withdrawal from Government control. After withdrawal and the payment of the tax thereon, the Government\u2019s interest in the alcohol ceases. What happens to it thereafter is no concern of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">I can conceive of no reason why the Congress should have intended to direct a refund of the tax, if the alcohol was destroyed after it had passed out of the hands of the Government and into the uncontrolled possession of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">I think section 3113(a) should be construed to refer to events happening before withdrawal from bond and payment of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-16\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
