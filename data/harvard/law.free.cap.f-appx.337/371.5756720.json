He received a sentence of forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Harris contends the district court failed to adequately consider the arguments made during sentencing regarding his ties to his family and did not adequately explain its rationale for the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-25\">We review a sentence for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This review requires appellate consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ation of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">In determining whether a sentence is procedurally reasonable, we first assess whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s advisory guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 596-97. A sentence within the properly calculated guideline range may be afforded an appellate presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We then determine whether the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors and any arguments presented by the parties, selected a sentence based on \u201cclearly erroneous facts,\u201d or failed to sufficiently explain the selected sentence. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">When rendering a sentence, the district court \u201cmust make an <em>individualized </em>assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d That is, the sentencing court must apply the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors to the specific circumstances of the case before it. Such individualized treatment is necessary \u201cto consider every convicted person as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\"><em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597-98) (internal citations omitted). Under <em>Carter, </em>the sentencing judge is required to \u201cstate in open court the particular reasons supporting its chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In so doing, the district court must \u201c \u2018set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Finally, assuming no procedural infirmity, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctaking into account the \u2018totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines, this court reviews findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>514 F.3d 377, 387 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2525, 171 L.Ed.2d 805 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">It is clear from the record that the district court correctly calculated Harris\u2019s advisory guidelines range, and Harris does not argue otherwise. However, despite the presumption of reasonableness that Harris\u2019s within-guidelines sentence may be afforded, we conclude that Harris\u2019s sentence is procedurally unreasonable. The district court failed to state the reasons supporting Harris\u2019s sentence, or otherwise indicate that it \u201cconsidered the parties\u2019 arguments and ha[d] a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468; <em>see also Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Harris\u2019s attorney gave a lengthy statement regarding Hams\u2019s close family ties and the importance of family in Harris\u2019s successful rehabilitation. Despite this, the district court\u2019s explanation for the selected sentence was wholly eonclusory: \u201cThe court has considered [the advisory guideline range] as well as other relevant factors set forth in the advisory sentencing guidelines and those set forth in 18 United States Code Section 3553(a).\u201d J.A. 33. Thus, the court failed to indicate what factors in particular supported the sentence, and the manner in which they did so. In neglecting this step, the court did not give Harris the individualized assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>ment required by <em>Carter. </em>Similarly, the judge made no reference to the arguments made by Harris\u2019s counsel during sentencing, and gave no indication that such arguments were considered. Thus, because \u201cthe record here does not demonstrate that the district court conducted ... an [individualized] assessment and so does not reveal why the district court deemed the sentence it imposed appropriate, we cannot hold the sentence procedurally reasonable.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Accordingly, while we affirm Harris\u2019s conviction, we vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and further argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
