In his asylum application and hearing testimony, Liu stated that because of his membership in an underground Christian church in China, the police arrested and detained him for 24 hours. During the detention the police beat him, causing bruises all over his body, ordered him not to return to his church, and instructed him to report weekly to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-23\">In its oral decision denying relief, the IJ stated that \u201c[f]or all practical purposes,\u201d Liu\u2019s testimony was consistent with his application. In its analysis, it stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>the first issue to be determined was Liu\u2019s credibility, which could be determined by examining his corroborating documents. It noted a lack of documentation of medical treatment after his alleged beating, and a lack of documentation from a church in the United States corroborating that he was a practicing Christian attending church here. The IJ further found that Liu \u201cfailed to present the type of detailed and specific testimony that one would expect to find\u201d from a person participating in religious activities, because his testimony about Christianity was generalized and did not exhibit \u201ceven mediocre\u201d knowledge of Christianity. The IJ also found it \u201csomewhat odd\u201d that Liu did not know whether anybody else from his church was arrested when he was. Finally, the IJ stated that Liu did not adequately explain why he belonged to this particular underground church rather than a registered church.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">However, the IJ concluded that \u201ceven if credible, [Liu] failed ... to show that he ha[d] been the victim of past persecution or that he ha[d] an objectively well-founded fear of persecution in the future.\u201d It then noted that Liu\u2019s detention was short, lasting only 24 hours, and although he claimed that he was beaten, he failed to submit corroborating documentation of his injuries, and there did not appear to be any lasting injuries. It stated that \u201cdespite its questions as to [Liu\u2019s] overall credibility, ... even if these questions are overlooked and [Liu] is found credible,\u201d he failed to demonstrate asylum eligibility. Finally, it stated that Liu\u2019s testimony and evidence were \u201cextremely vague\u201d and \u201ca more vague case on the grounds of religious persecution would be hard to come by.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, and, after Liu filed a petition for review, the government filed an unopposed motion with us to remand to the BIA to address the REAL ID Act\u2019s standards on corroboration and credibility. The motion stated that the BIA would be able \u201cto address the corroboration standard in instances, as here, where evidence is insufficient even if credible, and where any presumption of credibility may ... be rebutted on appeal when there are doubts as to an alien\u2019s credibility.\u201d We granted the motion, stating only that the motion was granted, the decision was vacated in its entirety, and the matter was remanded in full to the BIA. On remand, the BIA recited the REAL ID Act\u2019s standards, and implicitly adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning in denying relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">On petition for review, Liu first asserts that the case should again be remanded because the BIA failed to follow our instructions on remand. He contends that we remanded the case for the BIA to address two \u201cissues\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe corroboration standard\u201d and \u201cwhere any presumption of credibility may be rebutted on appeal\u201d\u2014 but the BIA simply restated the REAL ID Act provisions without applying them. He argues that the BIA failed to determine whether his presumption of credibility was rebutted, and he has a presumption of credibility on appeal. Next, Liu argues that he established eligibility for asylum by demonstrating past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution. Specifically, he asserts that the \u201ccumulative effects\u201d of the \u201cincidents of persecution\u201d that he suffered constituted persecution, and the IJ\u2019s finding that he did not suffer lasting injuries is not a basis for denying relief. Finally, he contests the IJ\u2019s discussions regarding: (1) the lack of medical records; (2) the sincerity of his religious beliefs; and (3) his failure to contact other church members.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, while the BIA added a recitation of the REAL ID Act provisions, it added no analysis and essentially adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning. Accordingly, we review the IJ\u2019s reasoning as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation omitted). Therefore, a finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc). We \u201clack jurisdiction to consider claims raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect thereto.\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if an alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-9\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. In order to establish that he is a refugee, he \u201cmust establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">We have explained that \u201c[n]ot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir. 2000). We have described persecution as an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008), we held that threats, viewed in conjunction with a brief detention and \u201cminor beating,\u201d did not compel the conclusion that a petitioner suffered persecution. Likewise, in <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290-91 (11th Cir.2006), we held that a five-day detention, during which the petitioner was forced to watch reeducation videos, stand in the sun for two hours, and sign a pledge to no longer practice Falun Gong, but during which he was not \u201churt,\u201d did not compel the conclusion that he suffered past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">We recently have held, however, that oppressive acts can collectively or cumulatively amount to persecution. <em>See De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1008 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that record compelled a finding of persecution where petitioner\u2019s life was repeatedly threatened over the course of two years, petitioner was yanked by her hair out of her vehicle, injuring her, and threatened with death if she continued her political activities, her family groundskeeper was tortured and killed for not revealing her whereabouts, and petitioner was beaten, kidnapped, and warned of her imminent murder); <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 859, 861-62 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that although individually the following incidents would not compel the conclusion that petitioners suffered past persecution, the \u201ccumulative effects\u201d of: (1) masked men pointing unloaded weapons at them and pulling the triggers; (2) the attack and severe beating of one of the petitioners; (3) continued threatening calls; and (4) the tampering with and vandalizing of one of their cars, compelled a finding of eligibility for withholding of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Regarding Liu\u2019s argument that the BIA failed to follow our remand order, while we granted the government\u2019s unopposed motion to remand to permit the BIA to discuss the REAL ID Act standards, we did not instruct the BIA to make any specific findings. Regardless, the IJ and BIA presumed credibility in finding that Liu failed to meet his burden in establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">The record does not compel reversal of the BIA\u2019s ultimate findings that, even if credible, Liu failed to demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his religion, where he was detained only once for 24 hours, during which he was beaten once (with little description or evidence of severity and with no corroboration), threatened not to return to his church, and ordered to report weekly to the police station. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">PETITION DENIED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-6\">. We lack jurisdiction to consider Liu\u2019s due process claims that he was not given notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>the IJ\u2019s demands for corroboration or permitted to explain the lack of corroboration because, by not making those specific arguments to the BIA, he did not exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. The due process arguments that he raised before the BIA were evidentiary in that they were related to an alleged lack of notice of his right to present evidence, testify, and cross-examine witnesses, but they did not mention corroboration or include the specific assertions that he was not told what corroborating documents were needed and was prevented from explaining their absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">Liu's appellate brief does not discuss his eligibility for CAT relief; therefore, he has abandoned the CAT issue on appeal. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Liu has also abandoned the issue of withholding of removal because, while he cites cases involving withholding-of-removal claims, he cites them as support for his asylum arguments and does not discuss the withholding-of-removal standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b856-18\">.
