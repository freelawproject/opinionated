(\u201cBNSF\u201d). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">This dispute arises out of contracts entered into by BNSF with two unions. The material facts are not in dispute. BNSF is an interstate railroad carrier. As part of its operations, BNSF employs engineers and ground-service personnel. UTU is the exclusive bargaining representative for BNSF ground-service employees while BNSF engineers are represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (\u201cBLET\u201d). In 2002 and 2007, BNSF entered into collective bargaining agreements with UTU and BLET, respectively. All the parties disagree as to the proper interpretation and scope of these agreements, disputing which union\u2019s members have the right to perform certain work for BNSF.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-17\">In 2007, UTU filed suit against BNSF claiming that the 2007 contract with BLET infringed upon UTU-represented employees\u2019 rights to perform duties for BNSF and unilaterally altered the 2002 agreement with UTU in violation of the Railway Labor Act (\u201cRLA\u201d), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. BLET intervened, asserting its rights under the 2007 contract and seeking to enjoin UTU from interfering with that agreement. All parties moved for summary judgment. The district court agreed with BNSF that the case could be resolved by interpreting the two existing agreements and, as a result, involved a \u201cminor dispute,\u201d making the case subject to mandatory arbitration under the RLA. Accordingly, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of BNSF. UTU appeals. BLET intervenes to clarify its position with respect to its agreement with BNSF.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-18\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b432-19\">A district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. See Richa</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>rdson v. Monitronics Int'l, Inc., </em>434 F.3d 327, 332 (5th Cir.2005). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(c). Questions of whether a dispute is \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cmajor\u201d under the RLA are legal in nature and therefore subject to de novo review. <em>See, e.g., Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, United Transp. Union, W. Md. Ry. Co. v. CSX R.R. Corp., </em>893 F.2d 584, 589 (3d Cir.1990); <em>Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n. of Machinists, Dist. Lodge No. 19 v. Soo Line R.R. Co., </em>850 F.2d 368, 374 (8th Cir.1988) (en banc); <em>Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., </em>838 F.2d 1087, 1089 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The RLA was enacted \u201cto provide a machinery to prevent strikes.\u201d <em>Texas &amp; N.O.R. Co. v. Bhd. of Ry. &amp; S.S. Clerks, </em>281 U.S. 548, 565, 50 S.Ct. 427, 74 L.Ed. 1034 (1930) (quotation marks omitted). Under the act, there a \u201ctwo distinct procedures to promote the resolution of labor disputes.\u201d <em>Bhd. of Ry. Carmen v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>894 F.2d 1463, 1466 (5th Cir.1990). \u201cMajor\u201d disputes deal with \u201cthe formation of collective agreements or efforts to secure them. They arise where there is no such agreement or where it is sought to change the terms of one, and therefore the issue is not whether an existing agreement controls the controversy.\u201d <em>Elgin, J. &amp; E. Ry. Co. v. Burley, </em>325 U.S. 711, 723, 65 S.Ct. 1282, 89 L.Ed. 1886 (1945). By contest, a dispute is \u201cminor\u201d if it \u201ccontemplates the existence of a collective agreement already concluded or, at any rate, a situation in which no effort is made to bring about a formal change in terms or to create a new one. The dispute relates either to the meaning or proper application of a particular provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In essence, \u201cmajor disputes seek to create contractual rights, minor disputes to enforce them.\u201d <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Ry. Labor Executives\u2019 Assn., </em>491 U.S. 299, 302, 109 S.Ct. 2477, 105 L.Ed.2d 250 (1989). If a dispute is major, the RLA has left \u201csettlement entirely to the processes of noncompulsory adjustment.\u201d <em>Burley, </em>325 U.S. at 724, 65 S.Ct. 1282. A minor dispute is \u201csubject to compulsory and binding arbitration before the National Railroad Adjustment Board\u201d which has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over minor disputes.\u201d <em>Bhd. of Ry. Carmen, </em>894 F.2d at 1467.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">UTU asserts that the 2002 agreement with BNSF gave ground-service employees the exclusive right to perform certain duties which BNSF unilaterally attempted to change through its 2007 contract with BLET, delegating the right to perform some of these same duties to the engineers\u2019 union. Because UTU interprets the 2007 contract as an attempt to change an existing collective bargaining agreement, it asserts that this is a \u201cmajor\u201d dispute. BNSF and BLET offer alternate interpretations of the two contracts and both assert that the dispute is \u201cminor.\u201d Both BNSF and BLET argue that the 2002 and 2007 contracts assigned to each union the duties traditionally performed by its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">UTU\u2019s arguments are without merit. The Supreme Court has noted that \u201c[i]f the disputed action of one of the parties can \u2018arguably\u2019 be justified by the existing agreement or ... if the contention that the labor contract sanctions the disputed action is not \u2018obviously insubstantial\u2019, the controversy is a minor dispute.\u201d <em>Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>491 U.S. at 306-307, 109 S.Ct. 2477 (quotation and alterations omitted). Thus, we cannot ignore the al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>ternate, credible interpretation of the contracts offered by BNSF and BLET. Furthermore, UTU, BNSF, and BLET disagree as to the proper scope of their collective bargaining agreements. There is no dispute that these agreements exist and create certain contractual rights. The parties simply disagree as to the scope of these rights and UTU\u2019s suit is an attempt to enforce its rights under the 2002 contract. This is the classic \u201cminor\u201d dispute and \u201cwithin the exclusive province of the National Railroad Adjustment Board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-12\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <em>doe </em>limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
