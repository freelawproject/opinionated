On appeal, she argues that the district court erred by enhancing her sentence for her co-conspirator\u2019s possession of a firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy. She contends that this possession was not reasonably foreseeable to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s finding that a co-conspirator\u2019s use of a weapon was reasonably foreseeable. <em>See United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Clear error occurs if \u201cwe are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005) (citation and quotation marks omitted). We have explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-16\">[t]he \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement may be applied when the firearm is possessed by a co-conspirator. The enhancement applies to a co-conspirator when the government establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the possessor of the firearm was a co-conspirator, (2) the possession was in furtherance of the conspiracy, (3) the defendant was a member of the conspiracy at the time of possession, and (4) the co-conspirator possession was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number><em>Pham, </em>463 F.3d at 1245 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">In <em>Pham, </em>the defendant\u2019s sentence was enhanced because an unloaded pistol, along with ammunition, marijuana, a scale, and other drug paraphernalia, was found in his co-conspirator\u2019s home. <em>Id. </em>at 1241. On appeal, the defendant objected to the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) firearm enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 1245. He argued that the use of a firearm by a co-conspirator was not reasonably foreseeable to the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">We rejected his argument, noting that \u201cnumerous cases have recognized that guns are a tool of the drug trade,\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is a frequent and overpowering connection between the use of firearms and narcotics traffic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1246 (citations and quotation marks omitted). We also observed that we have \u201cupheld application of the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement even where defendants claim they were unaware of the firearm possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Here, the district court did not clearly err by finding that the rifle at the drug stash house was reasonably foreseeable to Kaiser. The conspiracy involved more than 250 kilograms of cocaine and 10,000 pounds ' of marijuana. Kaiser herself picked up and transported loads of up to 17 kilograms of cocaine and more than 300 pounds of marijuana. Accordingly, the district court properly found that the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) firearm enhancement applied. We affirm Kaiser\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
