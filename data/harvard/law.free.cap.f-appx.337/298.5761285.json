In criminal cases, the defendant must file a notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of the order being appealed. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is criminal in nature and ten-day appeal period applies). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-22\">The district court entered its order denying Smithwick\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on October 17, 2008. The notice of appeal was filed November 20, 2008, after the ten-day period expired but within the thirty-day excusable neglect period. Because the notice of appeal was filed within the excusable neglect period, we remand the case to the district court for the limited purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>determining whether Smithwick has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
