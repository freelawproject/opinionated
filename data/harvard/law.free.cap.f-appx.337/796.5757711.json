Allen contends that the he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to resolve a dispute concerning his post-sentencing conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582 is a matter left to the discretion of the district court. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). So is the decision whether to conduct an evidentiary hearing. <em>United States v. Yesil, </em>991 F.2d 1527, 1531 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201c[T]he decision whether or not to grant an evidentiary hearing generally is committed to the discretion of the district court.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Byfield, </em>391 F.3d 277, 279 (D.C.Cir.2004) (\u201cWe review the court\u2019s decision not to conduct a [\u00a7 3582] hearing for an abuse of discretion.\u201d). The district court must follow a two-part analysis in a \u00a7 3582 proceeding. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). First, it must recalculate the defendant\u2019s guideline range based on his amended base offense level. <em>Id. </em>Second, it must consider whether to impose a new sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>In making that determination, the district court \u201cmust consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as well as public safety considerations, and <em>may </em>consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). \u201cThe district court is not required to articulate the applicability of each factor, as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201c[A] district court commits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">Allen contends that he was entitled to a hearing to dispute his citations for twenty-six disciplinary infractions in prison, including fighting, possessing a dangerous weapon, possessing drugs, and engaging in sexual acts. The government introduced those infractions as a public safety concerns in opposing any reduction in Allen\u2019s sentence. Allen argues, without providing any details, that he has an explanation for many of those infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">Allen\u2019s contention fails. It does not appear that Allen\u2019s post-conviction conduct was a factor in the district court\u2019s re-sentencing determination. Allen\u2019s original guidelines range was 292 to 365 months, and the district court sentenced him to 365 months. The same district judge conducted Allen\u2019s re-sentencing. After applying a two-level reduction to Allen\u2019s base offense level based on Amendment 706, which reduced Allen\u2019s guidelines range to 235 to 293 months, the district court sentenced Allen to 293 months. Once again, Allen was sentenced at the top of the guidelines range. That suggests that the district court carried its original sentencing determination \u2014 that Allen deserved the top end of the guidelines range \u2014 over to his adjusted base offense level after applying Amendment 706. Our conclusion is reenforced by the district court\u2019s statements during the original sentencing proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>I think the only appropriate sentence for Mr. Allen would be if we had some gallows right outside the courthouse here and we could hang him from them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-4\">You\u2019re a no good bum, you know that? You have spent the last eighteen years terrorizing the people on the streets of Jacksonville, beating up prison officials, law enforcement officers. You\u2019re no good. If I had my way, there wouldn\u2019t be a key to the jail that you would go into. You\u2019d stay there forever and never see the light of day. It hurts me to have to even sentence you within these guidelines because you don\u2019t deserve a sentence within the guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The district court obviously believed that Allen\u2019s original crimes justified the top end of the guideline range, and that is the sentence he received. On re-senteneing, the district court simply recalculated Allen\u2019s guideline range after taking into account Amendment 706. The record reflects that \u201cthe pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>Williams, 557 </em>F.3d at 1256. The district court <em>ma aponte </em>re-sentenced Allen and gave him the benefit of Amendment 706. That was the point of the \u00a7 3582 proceedings. The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to hold an evidentiary hearing on the subject of Allen\u2019s post-conviction infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
