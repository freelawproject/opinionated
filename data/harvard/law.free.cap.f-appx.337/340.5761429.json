The district court sentenced Hall to thirty months of imprisonment, and Hall appeals his conviction and sentence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Hall first challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his suppression motions. Hall argues that the officer who arrested him did not have reasonable suspicion to detain him. \u201cIn reviewing a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we review the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its legal conclusions de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Cain, </em>524 F.3d 477, 481 (4th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). When the district court denies a defendant\u2019s suppression motion, the court construes \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the [Gjovernment.\u201d <em>United States v. Grossman, </em>400 F.3d 212, 216 (4th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u201c[A]n officer may, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, conduct a brief, investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). The officer must have \u201cat least a minimal level of objective justification for making the stop\u201d and \u201cmust be able to articulate more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123-24, 120 S.Ct. 673 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Courts assess the legality of a <em>Terry </em>stop under the totality of the circumstances, giving \u201cdue weight to common sense judgments reached by officers in light of their experience and training.\u201d <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>363 F.3d 317, 321 (4th Cir.2004) (citations omitted). The court will \u201ccredit the \u2018practical experience of officers who observe on a daily basis what transpires on the street.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Lender, </em>985 F.2d 151, 154 (4th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">With these standards in mind, we have reviewed the record and find that the district court\u2019s conclusion that the officer had reasonable suspicion that criminal activity might have been afoot was not erroneous. We also find that Hall\u2019s reliance on the Second Amendment is misplaced, and that he failed to preserve for our review his claims based upon the state concealed weapon statute. Thus, the district court properly denied Hall\u2019s suppression motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Hall next challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a two-level reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility under the guidelines. Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. After calculating the appropriate advisory guidelines range, a district court should consider the resulting range in conjunction with the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006), and determine an appropriate sentence. <em>United States v. Abu Ali, </em>528 F.3d 210, 259-60 (4th Cir.2008), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1312, 173 L.Ed.2d 584 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">This court reviews a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Seay, </em>553 F.3d 732, 742 (4th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(May 29, 2009) (No. 08-10729). In so doing, the court first examines the sentence for \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d including: \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the [guidelines range, treating the [guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence ....\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201cIf the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>triet court decides to impose a sentence outside the [guidelines range, it must ensure that its justification supports \u2018the degree of the variance\u2019; .... \u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155, 161 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 476, 172 L.Ed.2d 341 (2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). Finally, the court then \u201c \u2018considers] the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). If the sentence is within the guidelines range, the appellate court may apply a presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 345-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness for within-guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The guidelines provide for a two-level reduction in offense level for a defendant who \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3El.l(a) (2007). The defendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to the reduction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>882 F.2d 902, 907 (4th Cir.1989). In addition, this court will review the district court\u2019s determination of acceptance of responsibility with \u201cgreat deference.\u201d <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n.5. We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not err in concluding that Hall failed to demonstrate acceptance of responsibility by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"ARG6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
