Smith appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>reduction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court concluded that Smith was not eligible for a reduction because his sentence was based on a statutory minimum term of imprisonment, such that Amendment 706, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses, had no effect on his guideline range. The court also declined to consider Smith\u2019s challenge to the validity of the government\u2019s original 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a) notice, concluding that the issue was outside the scope of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">On appeal, Smith generally argues that the district court erred in finding he was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because the government\u2019s \u00a7 851 information was invalid. First, Smith submits that the district court did not have jurisdiction in his original sentencing hearing to impose the statutory minimum because the \u00a7 851 information incorrectly provided that he was \u201cadjudged guilty and sentenced\u201d for a juvenile drug charge in 1992, when in fact he was not adjudged guilty, the adjudication was withheld, and he was not sentenced or sanctioned as an adult. Second, Smith argues that even if the \u00a7 851 information was sufficient, his prior juvenile charge could not be used to trigger the statutory minimum because the adjudication was withheld and he was not convicted or sentenced as an adult. Finally, Smith argues that the court abused its discretion in failing to consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including his post-conviction rehabilitation and the Guidelines\u2019s disparate treatment of crack and powder cocaine, and he submits that the Guidelines are advisory only after the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, state that a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if \u201can amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The commentary elaborates that a reduction is not authorized if an applicable amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The district court did not err in determining that Smith was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction because his sentence was based on the statutory minimum term of imprisonment, not his otherwise applicable range calculated under \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-42 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that the district court did not have the authority to grant Williams a reduction because Amendment 706 had no effect on his statutory minimum term of imprisonment, which had become his guideline range, even when he received a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1). Furthermore, the court properly declined to review the sufficiency of the government\u2019s \u00a7 851 information because it was outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>the scope of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000) (declining to address in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding an Eighth Amendment argument and noting that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-27\">.
