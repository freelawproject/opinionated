In calculating Taylor\u2019s advisory guidelines range on the felon-in-possession conviction, the district court applied the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A) cross reference, after determining that Taylor committed attempted murder when he shot a law enforcement officer. Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(l), Taylor had a base offense level of 33, which was increased four levels as the officer sustained permanent or life-threatening injuries. Taylor\u2019s offense level was then increased an additional six levels as his victim was a law enforcement officer. After a three level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Taylor had an advisory guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment. The district court sentenced Taylor to life imprisonment on the felon-in-possession conviction and imposed a consecutive 120-month sentence for the possession of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">On appeal, Taylor\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Taylor first suggests that the application of the \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A) cross reference violated his right to due process. We review the legal interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>59 F.3d 481, 483-84 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-17\">According to Taylor, the application of the USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A) cross reference in his case has resulted in a sentencing enhancement that is the \u201ctail which wags the dog of the substantive</p>\n<p id=\"APdd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>offense.\u201d <em>McMillan v. Pennsylvania, </em>477 U.S. 79, 88, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986). In support of his argument, Taylor invokes <em>United States v. Lombard, </em>72 F.3d 170 (1st Cir.1995). <em>Lombard, </em>though, fails to support Taylor\u2019s argument. <em>See United States v. Fenner, </em>147 F.3d 360, 366 (4th Cir.1998). Here, the district court determined, based on the law enforcement officer\u2019s testimony, that Taylor committed attempted murder in shooting the officer. Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court continues to make factual findings concerning sentencing factors by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005). Long-standing authority has permitted a sentencing court to consider any evidence at sentencing that \u201chas sufficient indicia of reliability,\u201d <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 6A1.3(a), including \u201cconduct underlying [an] acquitted charge, so long as that conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 156-57, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997)(per curiam); <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>262 F.3d 233, 249 (4th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s application of the USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(B) cross reference did not violate Taylor\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Taylor next suggests that the evidence was insufficient to support the four-level enhancement he received pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2A2.1(b)(l)(A) for permanent or life-threatening injury. A permanent or life-threatening injury is defined as an \u201cinjury involving a substantial risk of death; loss or substantial impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty that is likely to be permanent; or an obvious disfigurement that is likely to be permanent.\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.1 comment. (n.l(J)). Permanent scarring has been held sufficient to support application of the four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2A2.1(b)(l)(A). <em>See e.g., United States v. Miner, </em>345 F.3d 1004, 1006 (8th Cir.2003). We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not exr in enhancing Taylor\u2019s base offense level pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2A2.1(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Taylor\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Taylor, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Taylor requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"ARP\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-14\"> On February 18, 2009, the clerk's office mailed Taylor a notification that, if he wished to file a pro se supplemental brief, his brief was due on March 20, 2009. On March 4, 2009, the notification was returned to the clerk's office as Taylor was no longer at the Cumberland County Detention Center. Taylor's counsel filed a letter with this court on April 29, 2009, indicating that, on that date, she mailed Taylor notification of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief. Taylor has not submitted any pro se supplemental materials.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
