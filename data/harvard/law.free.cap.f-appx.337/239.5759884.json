For the following reasons, we will dismiss this appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-25\">In June 2008, Brown, an inmate currently incarcerated at SCI-Huntingdon, filed a pro se complaint alleging that guards at that institution ordered other inmates to verbally abuse <em>him in </em>order to induce him to commit suicide. Brown alleged that the defendants\u2019 actions violated the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Brown also appeared to allege a violation of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. Upon the recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, and over Brown\u2019s objections, the District Court dismissed the complaint for failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>to state a claim. Brown filed a timely notice of appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. An appeal must be dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\"> The District Court correctly determined that the CAT is not self-executing, and, therefore, does not create judicially-enforceable rights unless it is first given effect by implementing legislation. <em>Auguste v. Ridge, </em>395 F.3d 123, 132 n. 7 (3d Cir.2005). Brown, however, does not point to legislation which would provide him with a cause of action and cannot do so inasmuch as the domestic laws implementing the treaty do not provide civil redress for torture within the United States. <em>See Renkel v. United States, </em>456 F.3d 640, 644-45 (6th Cir.2006). To the extent that Brown alleged that the inmates\u2019 actions constituted cruel and unusual punishment, that claim is meritless as verbal abuse alone cannot be the basis for an Eighth Amendment claim. <em>See DeWalt v. Carter, </em>224 F.3d 607, 612 (7th Cir.2000). Finally, the District Court properly dismissed the complaint without giving Brown an opportunity to amend since allowing Brown to amend his complaint would have been futile. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">In sum, because Brown\u2019s appeal lacks arguable legal merit, <em>we </em>will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
