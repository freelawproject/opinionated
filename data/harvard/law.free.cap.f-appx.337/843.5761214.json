For the reasons set forth below, we affirm Akel\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-17\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b869-18\">A. <em>Motion to Suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-19\">Akel filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a search and seizure conducted at his residence on November 3, 2007. He asserted that the search warrant affidavit incorrectly described the vehicle used during a controlled buy on May 31, 2007 and contained stale evidence obtained during two controlled buys that occurred well over 30 days prior to the execution of the search warrant. In a memorandum in support of his motion, Akel argued that the two controlled buys could not support the search of his residence, because the buys were not conducted at his residence. He asserted that the search warrant was obtained by false pretenses, because the officer in charge swore that Akel drove a maroon Dodge Charger to the first controlled buy, even though video of the transaction showed a different type of vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-20\">The search warrant affidavit set forth the following facts: A Cl informed detectives that he could purchase several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>MDMA pills from Akel. On May 31, 2007, agents searched the Cl for money and contraband and then equipped him with an electronic recording device and supplied him with investigative funds. The Cl then called Akel and made arrangements to meet Akel to purchase MDMA. Shortly thereafter, agents observed Akel leaving his residence. Officers watched Akel as he drove directly to meet the CL The Cl provided Akel with the investigative funds in exchange for MDMA. The Cl then drove to meet officers and turned over the MDMA. A search of the Cl and the Cl\u2019s vehicle revealed no money or narcotics. During a second controlled buy, on July 18, 2007, the Cl was again searched, equipped with an electronic recording device, and provided with investigative funds. The Cl called Akel and made arrangements to purchase MDMA and cocaine. Akel was observed leaving his residence and driving directly to meet with the Cl. The Cl provided Akel with investigative funds in exchange for MDMA and cocaine. The Cl toned over the MDMA and cocaine and a search of the Cl and the Cl\u2019s vehicle revealed no contraband or money.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">The affidavit also described a trash pull conducted no more than 10 days prior to the filing of the affidavit. The trash pull revealed the following items:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJl\">flight itinerary for Delta Airlines (in Akel\u2019s name); owe sheets showing amounts of over $28,000.00; several empty large Zip-Loc food storage bags with one bag having the words \u201csour diesel\u201d written on the side (through research \u201csour diesel\u201d is a potent strain of cannabis that has very high levels of THC); numerous heat sealed storage bags, emanating a very strong odor of marijuana, containing marijuana residue; several dryer sheets which are commonly used to mask the odor of marijuana; loose tobacco which was purposely removed from a \u201cblunt\u201d cigar ... loose marijuana which field tested with presumptive positive results for THC; several marijuana \u201cblunt roaches\u201d and miscellaneous documents containing the address of 9518 Pouder Lane, Akel\u2019s name and Akel\u2019s live in girlfriend Danielle Rudinsky\u2019s name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Based on the affidavit, the state court issued a search warrant on November 2, 2007, authorizing officers to search Akel\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">B. <em>Suppression Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">At the suppression hearing, Royce Eric Hanson, an Okaloosa County Sheriffs Office Investigator, testified that on May 31, 2007, he conducted surveillance on Akel\u2019s residence. Hanson saw Akel leave his residence and return approximately 12 minutes later. A DVD of the surveillance footage depicted Akel getting into a maroon Chevrolet Malibu parked in the residence\u2019s driveway, driving away from the residence, and then returning to the residence in the same vehicle. Hanson said it was his understanding that after Akel left the residence, other officers observed him drive to a Dippin\u2019 Dots store, approximately 1.3 miles from Akel\u2019s residence, where the Cl had arranged to meet him.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Hanson testified that he also conducted surveillance on Akel\u2019s home on July 18, 2007. A DVD of the surveillance showed Akel\u2019s garage door opening and Akel leaving the residence in a red Dodge Charger. The Charger soon returned to the house and Hanson again recognized Akel driving the vehicle. The vehicle pulled into Akel\u2019s residence and other officers notified Hanson that Akel had just left the Dippin\u2019 Dots location after meeting with the Cl.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">A1 McDonough, an investigator with the Okaloosa County Sheriffs Office, testified that he conducted surveillance at the Dip-pin\u2019 Dots store where officers had ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>ranged to conduct a controlled purchase of MDMA. Around 1:00 pm on May 31, Hanson notified him that Akel had left his residence and, \u201cshortly thereafter,\u201d Mc-Donough observed Akel arriving at the Dippin\u2019 Dots parking lot. McDonough testified that, prior to May 31, Akel had agreed to sell the Cl a hundred MDMA tablets. Officers searched the Cl and the Cl\u2019s vehicle before the controlled buy and, from the time the Cl was searched until the time he met with Akel, the Cl was under constant observation by law enforcement. A DVD of surveillance showed Akel\u2019s vehicle arriving at the Dippin\u2019 Dots, the Cl leaving his vehicle and entering Akel\u2019s vehicle, and the Cl sitting in the front passenger seat of Akel\u2019s vehicle. Akel gave the Cl approximately 100 MDMA pills in exchange for the Cl\u2019s buy money. Akel was driving a maroon Chevy Malibu. According to communications with Hanson, Akel had traveled directly from his residence to the Dippin\u2019 Dots. After Akel left, other officers observed Akel travel directly back to his residence. Immediately after the transaction, McDonough met with the Cl, and took custody of the 98 MDMA pills he had just purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">McDonough testified that, on July 18, 2007, he conducted surveillance at the same Dippin\u2019 Dots. After Hanson observed Akel leave his home, McDonough observed Akel drive into the Dippin\u2019 Dots parking lot. The Cl got out of his vehicle and entered Akel\u2019s vehicle, where the drug transaction occurred. Officers had searched the Cl and his vehicle prior to the transaction. Akel drove a red Dodge Charger during this transaction. Afterward the Cl provided officers with the 150 MDMA pills and the gram of cocaine he had purchased. After leaving the Dippin\u2019 Dots, Akel traveled directly home. From the transaction until the officers met with the Cl, the Cl was under constant surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">McDonough also participated in a trash rip at Akel\u2019s residence on November 1, 2007. He testified that officers found airline tickets and receipts in Akel\u2019s name, as well as mail addressed to Akel and a flight itinerary in Akel\u2019s name. They also found a document that appeared to \u201cstart[ ] out as a legitimate shopping list,\u201d but contained numbers that did not appear to \u201ccorrespond with any kind of ... purchases you would ... make in a supermarket.\u201d Based on his training and experience, he believed this document to represent \u201cmonies that may be owed for drugs.\u201d Officers also found food storage bags, one of which had the words \u201csour diesel\u201d written on it. According to Mc-Donough, \u201csour diesel\u201d was the \u201cname of a certain strain of high grade, high potent marijuana.\u201d The bags contained a very strong smell of marijuana, as well as small amounts of marijuana residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">On cross-examination, McDonough acknowledged that an affidavit in support of an arrest warrant incorrectly indicated that Akel was observed leaving his residence in a maroon 2006 Dodge Charger on May 31. Officers continued surveilling Akel\u2019s home periodically from July 18 until November 1 and, to his knowledge, did not observe any criminal activity during this time. McDonough acknowledged that all of the found documents bearing Akel\u2019s name were addressed to Akel\u2019s parents\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">On redirect, McDonough stated that the Cl told him about marijuana transactions connected with Akel. Akel\u2019s taped conversations with the Cl indicated that Akel was involved in the routine sale of marijuana, MDMA, and cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Matthew John Spratt, a detective with the Santa Rosa County Sheriffs Office, testified that he prepared the search warrant affidavit. That affidavit did not de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>scribe the vehicles involved with the two controlled buys. Spratt applied for a warrant to arrest Akel on the same day that he submitted the search affidavit. The arrest affidavit did contain a faulty vehicle description, because he mistakenly \u201cput the wrong vehicle with the wrong buy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The court found that there was \u201cno manipulation or falsity ... on behalf of law enforcement\u201d and noted that the mistaken vehicle description was found in the arrest warrant affidavit, not the search warrant affidavit. The evidence contained in the affidavit was not stale, because \u201cthe trash pull brings everything up to date\u201d and \u201cthe prior two buys suggest that you can make a purchase of any kind, which is further confirmation with the trash pull.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cthe good faith exception would apply in any case\u201d and denied Akel\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">C. <em>Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Aaron Gatchell testified that he began working as an informant for law enforcement in early May 2007, after he was caught possessing MDMA and marijuana. He told officers about his past illegal drug activity and that Akel was his source of supply for MDMA and marijuana. He arranged to meet with Akel on May 31, 2007, to conduct a controlled purchase of MDMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Gatchell testified that, on May 31, 2007, he drove to a Dippin\u2019 Dots store to meet Akel and purchase 100 MDMA pills. Before meeting with Akel on May 31, law enforcement officers searched his car and person and equipped him and his vehicle with a body wire and a wire transmitter. The government played a videotape of the May 31 controlled buy and Gatchell identified Akel arriving in the Dippin\u2019 Dots parking lot in a maroon Malibu. He entered Akel\u2019s vehicle and Akel sold him MDMA. Akel gave him 100 MDMA pills and, after Akel drove away, Gatchell called law enforcement officers to meet him. He met with officers and turned over the MDMA pills immediately after the buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">Akel agreed, in a subsequent recorded conversation, to sell Gatchell 150 MDMA pills and cocaine in exchange for $1500. Gatchell explained that Akel had previously attempted to sell him cocaine, but he did not want to \u201cmess around with coke.\u201d Gatchell met with Akel on July 18, 2007, at Dippin\u2019 Dots, to purchase the MDMA and cocaine. Prior to the meeting, law enforcement searched Gatchell\u2019s vehicle. The government played the surveillance video of the July 18 transaction and Gatchell noted that Akel drove a maroon Dodge Charger. Gatchell entered Akel\u2019s vehicle, gave Akel $1,500, Akel counted the money, and Akel gave him 150 ecstacy pills and cocaine in exchange for the money. Immediately after Gatchell left the Dippin\u2019 Dots, he met with law enforcement and provided them with the 150 ecstacy pills and the gram of cocaine that Akel gave him in exchange for the $1,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Gatchell had seen Akel in the possession of a firearm: He explained that he once met Akel at his house and Akel pulled out a gun and put it on his lap. When he first started dealing with Akel, Akel \u201cwould always keep the gun out on the table.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">McDonough testified that he conducted surveillance on the Dippin\u2019 Dots store on May 31, 2007, and that officers searched Gatchell\u2019s person and his vehicle for contraband prior to the controlled buy. Once Gatchell was equipped with recording devices, officers followed him to <em>the </em>meeting location and parked in a secluded location from which they could observe the parking lot. McDonough saw Akel, driving a maroon Chevrolet Malibu, arrive at the Dip-pin\u2019 Dots shortly after Hanson observed Akel leaving his residence. Akel parked his car next to Gatchell\u2019s vehicle, Gatchell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>got out of his car and entered the passenger side of Akel\u2019s car, and a couple of minutes later, Gatchell got out of Akel\u2019s car, and both Gatchell and Akel drove away. Officers surveilled Gatchell as he left and eventually met with him about a mile down the road, searched him and his vehicle, and retrieved the MDMA from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">McDonough testified that, on July 18, 2007, officers met with Gatchell, searched him and his vehicle, and watched as Akel parked next to Gatchell in the Dippin\u2019 Dots parking lot, and Gatchell left, his vehicle and entered Akel\u2019s car. Gatchell then left Akel\u2019s vehicle, returned to his own, and both Gatchell and Akel drove away. Gatchell left the parking lot and was under constant surveillance until he met with officers and provided them with the 150 MDMA pills and the gram of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">McDonough participated in a November 1, 2007 trash pull at Akel\u2019s residence. He found evidence of marijuana distribution in the trash bags, including large Ziploc bags, numerous heat-sealed bags, marijuana cigarettes, and marijuana residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">McDonough arrived at Akel\u2019s residence shortly after the search warrant was executed on November 3, 2007. Officers seized an assault rifle and semiautomatic pistol during the search. McDonough saw marijuana individually packaged, a marijuana grove in the woods directly behind the residence, packaging materials, two firearms, and a picture on a dresser of Akel holding an assault rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Spratt testified that, on November 2, 2007, he applied for a warrant to search Akel\u2019s residence. When he and other officers entered Akel\u2019s residence on November 3, he observed Akel sitting on the couch. There was a firearm lying at Akel\u2019s feet and officers subsequently discovered a .9 millimeter pistol sticking out of a cushion on the couch. Both weapons were readily accessible and loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Behind the residence, officers discovered an outdoor grove of marijuana plants just inside the treeline. A hose ran from the marijuana plants back to the house and was hooked up to a small swimming pool-type pump. In the kitchen, Spratt found a Tupperware-type container containing individually-packaged baggies of marijuana. In the garage, Spratt found marijuana stalks located in a wheelbarrow. Officers also photographed the screen of a laptop computer, which displayed a FedEx inquiry listing the tracking number of a package that was due to be delivered at 1:30 pm on November 3, 2007. A FedEx package matching the tracking number of the computer inquiry was delivered to Akel\u2019s residence while officers were searching the home. The package was intercepted by law enforcement and found to contain a kilogram of cocaine. The contents of the package were wrapped in a heat-sealed-type wrapping, which was similar to bags found in Akel\u2019s home. Underneath this packaging, there was a layer of mustard coating that bag containing the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">On cross-examination, Spratt acknowledged that he visited Rudinsky two times at the Santa Rosa County jail, and he believed that he told Rudinsky on one occasion that she could face weapons charges if she did not cooperate and testily against Akel. Once he played for Rudinsky a recording of Akel talking to a woman named Charity Cox. He said that the telephone conversation indicated that Cox was pregnant with Akel\u2019s child. On redirect, Spratt explained that he never questioned Rudinsky, but instead instructed her to listen to what the officers had to tell her and not say anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">James Earl Thompson testified that, in 2006, Akel asked him to buy three firearms, an AR-15, a pistol, and Glock 40, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Thompson\u2019s name. Akel provided him with the money to buy the weapons, told him where to buy them, and told him the firearms to buy. Thompson stated that, after he purchased the firearms, Akel came to his home and got them.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">John Leo Rudinsky, Jr., Danielle Rudinsky\u2019s father, testified that he was the title owner of the home in which Rudinsky and Akel resided. He owned weapons, but never kept any of the weapons in his daughter\u2019s residence. To his knowledge, his daughter had never owned a firearm. The AR-15 and Ruger pistol found at his daughter\u2019s residence did not belong to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Danielle Rudinsky testified that she pled guilty to trafficking cocaine, MDMA and marijuana. She began a relationship with Akel and moved into a duplex with him in June of 2006. She stated that Akel received drugs that were shipped to the duplex via FedEx. The MDMA was sent in heat-sealed packages. Akel also had cocaine and marijuana at the duplex. The high-grade marijuana that Akel possessed between June and December 2006 came from a man in Colorado. Some of this marijuana was delivered to Akel at the duplex, where Akel packaged the marijuana and resold it. The Colorado source of marijuana also supplied Akel with acid, which Akel put on SweetTarts and sold. In February 2007, Akel began purchasing marijuana from an individual named Jeff Hebner, who Rudinsky identified as one of Akel\u2019s \u201cpartners.\u201d Akel also began purchasing cocaine from a man named \u201cStick.\u201d Akel repackaged the marijuana in the house, but Rudinsky did not help with the repackaging.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Rudinsky agreed to travel to Riverside, California with Akel, where they stayed for about 25 days. While in California, Akel met a man named \u201cKevin,\u201d who sold him medical grade marijuana. Rudinsky and Akel shipped the marijuana in a heat-sealed bag and a box back to Florida. Akel returned to California alone multiple times to buy marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Rudinsky said she knew of \u201c[ajbout five\u201d people who distributed marijuana for Akel. Rudinsky also said that, on one occasion, between September and early November 2007, Akel \u201cwas supposed to go to California and get one hundred pounds of commercial marijuana. He only got 30. And he paid a lady named Kathy to drive it back to Florida.\u201d She stated that Kathy drove the marijuana to Florida and delivered it to their home. Akel put the marijuana in separate bags and distributed it to his partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">From September through early November 2007, Akel began purchasing MDMA from a woman named Charity (\u201cCox\u201d), who lived in Atlanta. Cox was Akel\u2019s ex-girlfriend. She heard Akel and Cox talk about the transactions and Rudinsky herself deposited $5,500 in Cox\u2019s bank account at Akel\u2019s instruction. She and Akel once drove to Atlanta to pick up the pills and another time they met Cox halfway between Atlanta and them home in Florida. Akel repackaged and resold the MDMA pills he received from Cox.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">Rudinsky and Akel planted marijuana plants in their backyard in a kiddy swimming pool. She explained that there were \u201cnutrients that [the plants] got fed every other day or every third day. There was a big trash can and a pump and a water hose to feed them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">Rudinsky and Akel had just returned from California on the day that authorities raided the residence. The purpose of the California trip was to \u201cgo and get drugs.\u201d When they arrived in San Diego, she and Akel bought a heat sealer, bags, and mustard. Akel bought a kilogram of cocaine from an unnamed individual and Akel repackaged the cocaine by placing it in two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>heat-sealed bags, coating the bags with mustard, and placing the cocaine in a brown bag. Rudinsky stated that she and Akel then traveled to Corona, California, where they stayed at a Holiday Inn Express, and mailed the cocaine, via FedEx, to Florida. Rudinsky followed Akel\u2019s instructions to fill out the shipping label and address the package to \u201cMs. Ludinski\u201d at Pouder Lane. Rudinsky admitted that a video surveillance tape showed her mailing the FedEx package from a FedEx location in Corona, California. Rudinsky and Akel then flew back to Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Rudinsky testified that Akel kept a silver pistol in between the cushions of the sofa at then- house. He also kept an AR-15 assault rifle in various locations in the house. When people came to their house to buy or sell drugs, Akel would leave the weapons out in the open.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Rudinsky stated that after she was arrested, Akel told her \u201ceverything would be okay, just don\u2019t say anything, keep my mouth shut and we would both be out of trouble.\u201d She eventually agreed to cooperate with the government and tell the truth. She stated that she was not responsible for obtaining any particular result in Akel\u2019s case, but was instructed simply to tell the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">On cross-examination, Rudinsky acknowledged that two charges against her were dropped after she agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge and testify against Akel. After she had hired a lawyer, Spratt and Carrier came to the jail to talk to her, even though her attorney had told her not to speak to anyone without him being present. Spratt and Carrier told her that she would be indicted on federal charges and could face 40 years to life in prison if she did not testify against Akel. They also threatened to charge her with the firearms that were found at the house. The officers played recorded phone calls between Akel and Cox, in which Cox told Akel that she was pregnant with his child. She stated the officers told her that she \u201cneed[ed] to think about [her] decision, think about what [she\u2019s] doing because, obviously, [Akel] doesn\u2019t care.\u201d When asked if investigators told her \u201cthat Tony Akel had been having sex with [her] mom,\u201d Rudinsky replied \u201c[n]ot in so many words.\u201d When she was first arrested, Rudinsky told both investigators and her mother that Akel was doing nothing wrong. She once told her mother that authorities were trying to make her lie about Akel.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">On redirect, Rudinsky testified that no one with law enforcement ever told her to lie about Akel or anything else. She stated that no one with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office or with law enforcement told her what to say at trial. She stated that when the agents played the tape of the conversation between Akel and Cox, they instructed her not to say anything and did not ask her any questions. She stated that no one had threatened or coerced her.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">Claude Cosey, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Agency, testified that, during the grand jury proceeding, he \u201cincorrectly stated to the grand jury that MDMA was recovered inside the residence and that the marijuana plants were found under grow lights inside the house, referring to inside the house, and that was incorrect.\u201d Cosey clarified that the marijuana plants \u201cwere actually out in the edge of the woods.\u201d He explained that he \u201cthought at the time that the marijuana plants had been growing under the grow light inside as opposed to attached to the house by a hose.\u201d Cosey noted that the superseding indictment clarified that the marijuana was growing outside the residence. He said that the remainder of his grand jury testimony was accurate. On cross examination, counsel asked if Cosey recognized a photograph. Cosey said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>he recognized the photograph because he had seen it before, but did not know who took it. Defense counsel asked \u201c[d]oes [the photograph fairly and accurately represent what it purports to be, that is, a photograph of some things I\u2019ll ask you about in a minute?\u201d Cosey responded \u201c[y]es, it does.\u201d Defense counsel moved to admit the photograph into evidence and the government objected. The court noted that before the photo could be admitted, defense counsel had to establish who took the photograph, when, how the witness knows who took the photograph and \u201cthings of that nature.\u201d The court refused to admit the photograph, based on a lack of predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Both parties rested and, after having presented a very brief defense case, Akel moved for a judgment of acquittal and directed verdict of not guilty, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">On the first day of deliberations, the jurors sent a note to the court stating \u201cYour Honor, we\u2019re unable to reach a unanimous decision as to the guilty or not guilty verdict.\u201d The government requested an Allen<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charge, to which Akel did not object. The court stated that it would give the jury the standard <em>Allen </em>charge. When the jury returned, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-6\">I\u2019m going to direct that you continue your deliberations in an effort to reach agreement upon a verdict and dispose of this case. And I have a few additional comments that I want to offer for your consideration as you do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-7\">This is an important case, and the trial has been expensive and time and effort and money and emotional strain to both the defense and the prosecution. If you should fail to agree on a verdict, then this case will be left open and may have to be tried again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-9\">Obviously, another trial would only serve to increase the cost to both sides, and there is no reason to believe that the case can be tried again by either side any better or more exhaustively than it has been tried in front of you. Any future jury would have to be selected in the same manner and from the same source as you were chosen, and there is no reason to believe that the case could ever be submitted to other 12 men or women more conscientious or more competent to decide it or that more clearer evidence could be produced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-10\">If a substantial majority of your number ai*e in favor of a conviction, then those of you who disagree should reconsider whether your doubt is a reasonable one, since it appears to make no effective impression on the minds of the others. On the other hand, if a majority or even a lesser number of you are in favor of an acquittal, then the rest of you should ask yourselves, again, and more thoughtfully whether you should accept the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, which fails to convince your fellow jurors beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-11\">Now, remember that at all times no juror is ever expected to give up an honest belief that he or she may have as to the weight and/or the effect of the evidence. But after full deliberation and consideration of the evidence in this case, it is your duty to agree upon a verdict if you can do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-12\">You must also remember that if the evidence in the case fails to establish guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, then the defendant should have your unanimous verdict of not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-13\">You may be as leisurely as you require in your deliberations and take as much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>time as you might feel is necessary, but I do now ask that you again retire to the jury room and continue your deliberations with these additional comments in mind to be applied, of course, in conjunction with the instructions that I have previously given to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Later that afternoon, the jury sent a second note, stating \u201c[i]t was my hope, as foreperson of the jury, we would be able to reach a unanimous decision. I realize this communication \u2014 I assume \u2014 comes soon, but neither party will change their vote.\u201d The government reacted that \u201c[i]t appears it\u2019s a hung jury, and we just ask for the trial to be rescheduled at the appropriate time.\u201d Akel concurred with the government, but the court stated that it did not feel \u201clike they have been at it long enough\u201d or that \u201ceither side has reconsidered their position.\u201d The court instructed the jury by written message to \u201cplease continue [its] deliberations.\u201d Later, the court sent the following message to the jury: \u201cDo you feel you would have a verdict in the next few hours, or would you prefer to return tomorrow morning at 8:30 to continue your deliberations?\u201d The jury responded through the foreperson\u2019s message: \u201cIt is my belief that a verdict may be reached, hopefully, in the next few hours.\u201d The jury subsequently found Akel guilty of Counts 1, 2, and 7, and not guilty of Counts 4-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">D. <em>Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Akel\u2019s base offense level, pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1 was 32. His base offense level was increased two levels under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), because he possessed a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Akel\u2019s offense level was increased four levels under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), because he held a leadership role in a conspiracy involving five or more participants \u2014 namely, Akel, Rudinsky, Gatchell, Cox, Hebner, Rodriguez, and \u201cother referenced sources of supply for Akel.\u201d Akel received an additional two-level increase for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">Akel was an armed career criminal under \u00a7 4B1.4(a), because he was previously convicted of three counts of burglary of a dwelling with assault and battery. The three offenses were committed on separate dates. However, Akel\u2019s offense level remained 40, because the offense level calculated under Chapters 2 and 3 of the Sentencing Guidelines was greater than the enhanced career offender offense level. Akel\u2019s offense level of 40 combined with his criminal history category of VI to yield a guideline imprisonment range of 360 months to life imprisonment on Count 7. Because the statutoiy maximum term of imprisonment for Counts 1 and 2 was 40 years, the guideline range on these Counts was 360 to 480 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">The \u201cMental and Emotional Health\u201d section of the PSI indicated that Akel \u201cwas diagnosed with anxiety/depression issues as well as possible bipolar disorder at the age of 17.\u201d Dr. James Larson evaluated Akel on two occasions in April 1998 and stated in a report</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-12\">I do believe that his judgment was seriously impaired during the time frame of the incident, both by underlying Bipolar Disorder and lengthy period and alcohol consumption. I doubt that he would have engaged in the alleged criminal conduct had he been appropriately diagnosed and treated for a mental disorder prior to the alleged offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">Akel objected to the four-level leader/organizer adjustment as factually unsupported. Akel objected to the two-level firearm enhancement, because he was acquitted of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. Next, Akel ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>jected to his criminal history category being enhanced from IV to VI, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.4(c), and argued that, because he was found not guilty of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, he did not qualify for the \u00a7 4B1.4 enhancement. Akel also asserted that the application of both \u00a7 4B1.4 and \u00a7 2D1.1 was double counting. Finally, Akel argued that the court should consider evidence of his psychological problems in determining whether a downward adjustment or variance was warranted. Prior to sentencing, the government filed a motion asking the court to sentence Akel to the high end of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">E. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Akel argued that the \u00a7 4B1.4 enhancement should not apply because he was acquitted of Count 6. He also asserted that \u201cthere may be a double counting problem,\u201d because he received enhancements under both \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.4 and 2D1.1. Akel argued that his previous burglary charges should be considered one offense, even though they were committed on three separate occasions, because all three offenses were included in the same indictment. With regard to the role enhancement, Akel argued that a two-point enhancement would be more appropriate than a four-point enhancement, because he was not a leader, organizer, or manager of the individuals identified by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The coui\u2019t found that there was \u201cno question\u201d that the two-level \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) firearm enhancement was appropriate. It noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-7\">[a]ll of the evidence is clear. He\u2019s sitting on a gun, he had a gun right on the table in front of him. And there is no question about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-8\">Axxd, quite frankly, I was somewhat surprised at the return of the jury\u2019s verdict with regard to the use of a firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-9\">Could not have been more clear to me. I don\u2019t know what to think of it, other than a jury compromise, because they did struggle to come to a \u2014 a verdict. But if \u2014 if we are basing it upon the evidence, the evidence is crystal clear that the maxx is sitting there doing a dx'ug deal, or guarding from drug deals, he\u2019s got a gun tucked right beside him and sitting on it, that it\u2019s pretty much useful for that purpose in defense of his drug operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">Based on these findings, the court overruled Akel\u2019s objections to both the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement and the \u00a7 4B1.4 exxhancement. The court also overruled Akel\u2019s objection to the role enhancement, finding, based on the evidence presented at trial, that it was \u201cvery clear, that [Akel] was the leader, organizer\u2019, responsible for five or more participants acting at his direction.\u201d With regard to Akel\u2019s psychological problems, the court noted that none of Akel\u2019s associates who testified at trial mentioned that Akel suffered from psychological problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">The coux't adopted the guideline calculations and factual findixxgs contained in the PSI and imposed a sentence of 480 months\u2019 imprisonments on Counts 1, 2, and 7, to run concurrently, followed by 5 years\u2019 supervised release on each count, to run concurrently. The court noted that this sentence was at the top of the guideline x-ange for Counts 1 and 2, \u201cbased upon what [the court found] to be aggravating factors, histox\u2019y and characteristics exhibited by the defendant.\u201d The court stated that it had reviewed the \u00a7 3553(a) factor\u2019s and considered the sentence to be reasonable and necessary in light of those factor\u2019s. After imposing sentence, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-12\">... it\u2019s not that I ignore or simply have not considered anything that [Akel] presented, because I certainly have, it\u2019s just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>the court\u2019s opinion that the other factors of ... 3553(a) outweigh those considerations, particularly the \u2014 the dangerousness and the need to protect society from further criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">II. Law &amp; Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">\n<em>Motion to Suppress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">A. <em>False Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">The Fourth Amendment is violated if a warrant is obtained by using a false statement made intentionally or recklessly. <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 2676, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). Where an informant is mentioned in the affidavit, the affidavit also must demonstrate the informant\u2019s \u201cveracity\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>297 F.3d 1308, 1314 (11th Cir.2002). \u201c[W]hen there is sufficient independent corroboration of an informant\u2019s information, [however,] there is no need to establish the veracity of the informant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted). Hearsay may be the basis for a search warrant. <em>Rugendorf v. United States, </em>376 U.S. 528, 533, 84 S.Ct. 825, 828, 11 L.Ed.2d 887 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Akel has failed to show that any statement contained in the search warrant affidavit is false. Even if he had made such a showing, he failed to establish that the false statements were made intentionally or recklessly. <em>See Martin, </em>297 F.3d at 1314. Furthermore, the search warrant is not invalidated because it contained hearsay, because probable cause may be based on hearsay. <em>See Rugendorf, </em>376 U.S. at 533, 84 S.Ct. at 828. Finally, the officers\u2019 surveillance of the two controlled buys sufficiently corroborated the information received from the Cl.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">B. <em>Staleness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">Under the staleness doctrine, \u201cinformation supporting the government\u2019s application for a warrant must show that probable cause exists at the time the warrant issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1264 (11th Cir.2000). However, there is no fixed time limit \u2014 staleness must be judged on the particular facts of each case. <em>Id. </em>at 1265. \u201cIn addition to the length of time, courts should consider the nature of the suspected crime (discrete crimes or ongoing conspiracy), habits of the accused, character of the items sought, and nature and function of the premises to be searched.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Stale information \u201cis not fatal where the government\u2019s affidavit updates, substantiates, or corroborates the stale material.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>40 F.3d 1167, 1172 (11th Cir.1994) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">The fact that the two controlled buys were conducted a month-and-a-half apart indicates that Akel\u2019s drug trafficking conduct was ongoing. Moreover, even if the evidence obtained from the controlled buys was somewhat stale, the evidence obtained through the trash pull refreshed it and arguably established probable cause on its own. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the search warrant affidavit was not stale.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">C. <em>Probable Cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">We review the district court\u2019s determination that an affidavit contains probable cause <em>de novo </em>and the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000). To establish probable cause, the search warrant affidavit must state facts \u201csufficient to justify a conclusion that evidence or contraband will probably be found at the premises to be searched.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>297 F.3d at 1314. Information in the affidavit should \u201cestablish a connection between the defendant and the residence to be searched and a link <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>between the residence and any criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The search warrant affidavit was sufficient to establish that evidence or contraband would be found at the residence. <em>See Martin, </em>297 F.3d at 1314. The fact that Akel traveled directly from the residence to the controlled buys and immediately returned to the residence afterward indicates that the narcotics he sold to the Cl were being stored in the home. The fact that large plastic bags containing marijuana residue, one bag labeled \u201csour diesel,\u201d were found during the trash pull supports the conclusion that narcotics were presently being stored in the home and would be found during a search. The affidavit was also sufficient to establish a link between Akel and the residence. <em>See id. </em>The affidavit indicated that documents in Akel\u2019s name were found in the trash pull. That fact, coupled with the fact that authorities observed Akel leave and return to the residence on two occasions, establishes a link between Akel and the residence. Accordingly, the search warrant was valid and we-need not address whether the good faith exception applies. <em>See Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d at 1249 n. 1 (declining to address applicability of the good faith exception where probable cause supported the search warrant).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">\n<em>Validity of the Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">\u201c[T]he possibility that a witness may have given false testimony before the grand jury does not automatically vitiate an indictment based on that testimony; to dismiss an indictment the district court must also find an abuse of the grand jury process such as perjury or government misconduct.\u201d <em>United States v. DiBernardo, </em>775 F.2d 1470, 1475 (11th Cir.1985). To make out a claim of prosecutorial misconduct regarding the use of false testimony, a defendant must establish that the prosecutor \u201cknowingly used perjured testimony, or failed to correct what he subsequently learned was false testimony, and that the falsehood was material.\u201d <em>United States v. Woodruff, </em>296 F.3d 1041, 1043 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002). Perjury is defined as testimony \u201cgiven with the willful intent to provide false testimony and not as a result of a mistake, confusion, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1277 n. 34 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also, United States v. Singh, </em>291 F.3d 756, 763 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cConviction beyond a reasonable doubt without the use of the tainted testimony or alleged misconduct at trial makes it highly improbable that the grand jury indictment was based on insufficient probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Garate-Vergara, </em>942 F.2d 1543, 1550 (11th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">As an initial matter, the fact that hearsay testimony was presented at the grand jury proceeding does not invalidate the indictment. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>504 U.S. 36, 50, 112 S.Ct. 1735, 1744, 118 L.Ed.2d 352 (1992) (noting that the presentation of hearsay evidence is permissible in grand jury proceedings). With regard to Cosey\u2019s grand jury testimony, there is no evidence that Cosey committed perjury, because Cosey testified at trial that his false statements to the grand jury were inadvertent and Akel has presented no evidence to the contrary. The government corrected the false statement at trial by questioning Cosey about the misstatements. Additionally, Cosey\u2019s statement that the marijuana plants were found inside the residence was immaterial to the return of the indictment because, regardless of whether the plants were found inside or outside of the home, they still were found near the premises and supplied with hose water from the house. Moreover, because the jury, after hearing Cosey\u2019s corrections, convicted Akel of Counts 1, 2, and 7, it is \u201chighly improbable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>that the grand jury indictment was based on insufficient probable cause.\u201d <em>See Garate-Vergara, </em>942 F.2d at 1550. Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in failing to dismiss the indictment. <em>Voluntanness and Credibility of Radinsky's Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The district court\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial based on the government\u2019s knowingly presenting perjured testimony at trial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>316 F.3d 1215, 1248-49 (11th Cir.2003). However, an issue raised for the first time on appeal is reviewed for plain error, and requires a showing of (1) error; (2) that is plain and obvious; and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We will correct such an error only if the error seriously affects the \u201cfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154-55, 92 S.Ct. 763, 766, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972), the Supreme Court ordered a new trial when the government knew or should have known that one of its witnesses committed perjury. <em>Id. </em>We have held that, to succeed on a <em>Giglio </em>claim, a defendant must show that the government \u201cknowingly used perjured testimony, or failed to correct what he subsequently learned was false testimony, and that the falsehood was material.\u201d <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d 1036, 1041 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">In <em>Wilcox v. Ford, </em>813 F.2d 1140, 1148 (11th Cir.1987), we held that a defendant\u2019s due process rights were not violated by the introduction of allegedly coerced witness testimony, because the defendant was aware of the nature of the interrogation, had access to the tapes and transcripts of the interrogation prior to trial, and was able to cross-examine both witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 1148-49; <em>see also Brown v. Jones, </em>255 F.3d 1273, 1281-82 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that the district court did not err in admitting evidence of an allegedly coerced interrogation where the taped interrogation was played for jurors and the defendant cross-examined the witness at length about the interrogation).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Here, there is no evidence that Rudinsky testified falsely. Rudinsky stated that authorities or representatives of the government instructed her to tell the truth at trial. She stated that she was, in fact, telling the truth and that no one had coerced her to testify a certain way. Akel has failed to show that Rudinsky testified falsely or that the government \u201cknowingly used perjured testimony.\u201d <em>Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d at 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">Furthermore, although investigators allegedly forced Rudinsky to listen to a taped conversation between Akel and Cox, they specifically instructed her not to speak, This conduct does not rise to the level of the investigators\u2019 conduct in <em>Wilcox. </em>In addition, Akel knew about the investigative methods prior to trial and cross-examined Rudinsky extensively about those matters. Thus, the jury was able to draw its own conclusions as to the reliability of the testimony. Based on these facts, the district court did not plainly err by allowing Rudinsky to testify without first determining whether her testimony was coerced. <em>See Wilcox, </em>813 F.2d at 1149; <em>Brown, </em>255 F.3d at 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">\n<em>Refusal to Admit Photograph</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion and will only reverse if an error has affected a defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[W]hen employing an abuse-of-discretion standard, we must affirm unless we find that the district court has made a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe decision of whether or not a particular piece of evidence has been appropriately identified falls within the discretionary function of the district court, and that determination will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing that there is no competent evidence in the record to support it.\u201d <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>776 F.2d 989, 1001 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Rule 901 provides that the requirement of authentication or identification for admissibility of evidence \u201cis satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 901(a). \u201cA witness qualifying a photograph need not be the photographer or see the picture taken; it is sufficient if he recognizes and identifies the object depicted and testifies that the photograph fairly and correctly represents it.\u201d <em>United States v. Clayton, </em>643 F.2d 1071, 1074 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">At trial, Cosey never indicated that he was familiar with the items depicted in the photograph, which were not identified either by Cosey or by defense counsel\u2019s questioning. Defense counsel also failed to make a proffer or some other showing about the substance of the evidence that he sought to admit. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(2). Thus, the court reasonably determined that Akel failed to provide a sufficient foundation for admitting the photograph. <em>See Clayton, </em>643 F.2d at 1074. Moreover, Akel could have pursued further questions or other efforts to lay a sufficient foundation or explore the subject matter, but he chose to desist. Based on this record, the district court did not abuse its discretion or cause substantial prejudice to Akel\u2019s defense in ruling that the photograph was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">\n<em>Allen Charge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">\u201c[Our] inquiry on appeal of a district court\u2019s decision to give an <em>Allen </em>charge is limited to evaluating the coercive impact of the charge.... The question we address is whether under the circumstances and language of the <em>Allen </em>charge the jury was unduly coerced into reaching a verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Elkins, </em>885 F.2d 775, 783 (11th Cir.1989). If a jury is not polled prior to giving the <em>Allen </em>charge, as here, we will reverse only if we find under the totality of the circumstances that the charge was inherently coercive. <em>United States v. Prosperi, </em>201 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">A charge that \u201cencouraged jurors to reach a unanimous verdict, but also instructed jurors not to give up honestly held beliefs and to return a not guilty verdict if the evidence did not show guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is not inherently coercive. <em>United States v. Kramer, </em>73 F.3d 1067, 1072 (11th Cir.1996). We have approved of an <em>Allen </em>charge which included a request that jurors reconsider their positions, cautioned that no juror should give up an honest belief, and did not explain the mistrial option. <em>United States v. Chigbo, </em>38 F.3d 543, 544-45 (11th Cir.1994). A judge\u2019s request that a jury continue deliberating, without polling the jury or suggesting that an outcome is desired or required, is not inherently coercive. <em>Prosperi, </em>201 F.3d at 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">With regard to the district court\u2019s initial <em>Allen </em>charge to the jury, the fact that the court \u201cdirected\u201d the jurors to continue deliberating, rather than \u201casking\u201d them to do so does not render the <em>Allen </em>charge coercive, because, regardless of that language, jurors are expected to continue deliberating after the charge is read. Furthermore, the court specifically stated that the case would have to be tried again if jurors did not reach a unanimous verdict. It also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>explained that no juror was expected to give up an honest belief that the defendant was guilty or not guilty. Thus, the instructions as a whole made it clear that a hung jury was legally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The second instruction given by the court was not a full <em>Allen </em>charge, but, instead, a simple request to continue deliberating. Because the court\u2019s request did not indicate that an ultimate outcome was desired or required, it was not unduly coercive and does not constitute reversible error. <em>See Prosperi, </em>201 F.3d at 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Finally, Akel asserts that the court erred when it asked jurors whether they wished to continue deliberating or return in the morning. This message was not unduly coercive, because jurors were told that they would be given an opportunity to continue deliberating the next day. This question actually had an effect the opposite from imposing a time constraint, because the question necessarily implied that jurors could take as much time as they needed to reach a unanimous verdict, even if it was necessary to return the next day. Accordingly, the jury was not coerced into reaching a verdict and the district court committed no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">Whether the record contains sufficient evidence to support a jury\u2019s verdict is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1327 (11th Cir.2005). We review \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences and making all credibility choices in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">To convict a defendant of conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, \u201cthe government must prove that there is an agreement by two or more persons to violate the narcotics laws.\u201d <em>United States v. Parrado, </em>911 F.2d 1567, 1570 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cThe government must prove knowledge, intent and participation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA defendant\u2019s knowing participation in a conspiracy may be established through proof of surrounding circumstances such as acts committed by the defendant which furthered the purpose of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">The evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict that Akel was guilty of conspiring to distribute cocaine, MDMA, and marijuana. Rudinsky testified that she helped Akel tend to marijuana plants growing in their backyard. She and Akel traveled to California to purchase cocaine, which they then shipped to their residence in Florida, where Akel would repackage the cocaine and resell it. Rudinsky stated that Akel instructed her to fill out the shipping form and express the package of cocaine from California. Furthermore, Rudinsky allowed Akel to receive, repackage, and distribute cocaine, MDMA, and marijuana from their home. Accordingly, the evidence supports Akel\u2019s conviction for conspiring with Rudinsky to distribute cocaine, MDMA, and marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">\n<em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SB1.1 Role Enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">\u201cA district court\u2019s upward adjustment of a defendant\u2019s Guidelines offense level due to his status as a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 is a finding of fact reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>287 F.3d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir.2002). Clear error is present if we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005). At sentencing \u201c[t]he government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>The Sentencing Guidelines provide for an increase in offense level based on the defendant\u2019s aggravating role in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. A four-level increase is applied if the defendant \u201cwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 361.1(a). In distinguishing between a leader or organizer and a mere manager or supervisor, the district court should consider several factors, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6j\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4). A mere \u201cbuyer/seller relationship\u201d is insufficient to justify even a three-level enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1(a). <em>United States v. Glinton, </em>154 F.3d 1245, 1260 (11th Cir.1998) (also holding that \u201ca role enhancement is inappropriate absent evidence the defendant actively recruited buyers or directed them activities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A5_\">The district court heard the evidence, considered the argument of counsel on this question and found that \u201cits clear from the evidence, judging the credibility of the witnesses and such at the same time, that the role enhancement is also very clear, that he was the leader, organizer, responsible for five or more participants acting at his direction.\u201d Sentencing Tr. at 12-13, June 19, 2008. The sentencing judge reviewed the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), found it accurate and accepted its findings of fact. In the PSI there are specific facts set forth as to James Thompson, Danielle Rudinsky, Cathy Rodriguez, Aaron Gatehell and Jeff Hebner and the activities they were involved in at the direction of the appellant. PSI at 14-15. The trial transcript reveals additional testimony as to these individuals and others. Thus, there exists no clear error and the four-level enhancement is fully supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">\n<em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 hBl.H and 2D 1.1 Enhancements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">A. <em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>but accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>447 F.3d 1365, 1368 (11th Cir.2006). Section 2D1.1(b)(1) provides that a defendant\u2019s base offense level should be increased by 2 levels \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon was possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). The enhancement is to be applied if a firearm was possessed \u201cduring the offense of conviction or during related relevant conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>127 F.3d 1388, 1390 (11th Cir.1997). The weapon enhancement should be applied if a weapon was present, unless it was clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">The fact that Akel was acquitted of Count 6 does not bar the application of \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), because the court\u2019s sentencing findings need meet only the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard, rather than the more substantial \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard required for conviction. <em>See United States v. Faust, </em>456 F.3d 1342, 1347 (11th Cir.2006). Furthermore, the facts support the application of \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). Gatehell testified that Akel, on numerous occasions, brandished both the Ruger and the Glock handguns during drug transactions, and Rudinsky stated that Akel routinely kept the weapons in plain view during drug transactions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>When authorities first entered the residence, they observed Akel sitting on the couch with an assault rifle at his feet and another firearm stashed underneath the couch cushion. Inside, authorities also found drugs packaged for distribution and, based on their prior surveillance, determined that the residence was used as the \u201cbase of operations\u201d for the drug conspiracy. Thus, the district court did not err in applying the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">B. <em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 \u00cdB14</em></p>\n<p id=\"AU9\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether multiple crimes constitute a single criminal episode for purposes of \u00a7 924(e). <em>United States v. Spears, </em>443 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir.2006). We also review <em>de novo </em>interpretations of guideline provisions. <em>United States v. Wilks, </em>464 F.3d 1240, 1242 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Section 924(e) states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0k\">[i]n the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent felony ... committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be ... imprisoned not less than fifteen years....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Separate offenses must be committed on separate occasions, but the convictions need not be obtained on separate days. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>57 F.3d 1012, 1018 (11th Cir.1995). Offenses will be considered separate if they were committed on separate days, even if the legal consequences were imposed on the same day and the sentences were to be served concurrently. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">The relevant inquiry under \u00a7 924(e)(1) is whether the prior offenses were committed on separate days, not whether the convictions were obtained or the sentences were imposed on separate days. <em>See id. </em>Here, Akel committed the burglary offenses on three separate days. Furthermore, the fact that Akel was acquitted on Count 6 is irrelevant, because all that \u00a7 924(e) requires is that (1) the defendant be convicted of a \u00a7 922(g) offense and (2) the defendant have three previous convictions for violent felonies. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Akel met these requirements. Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">C. <em>Double Counting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a claim of double counting. <em>United States v. Naves, </em>252 F.3d 1166, 1168 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cImpermissible double counting occurs only when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment on account of a kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by application of another part of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Matos-Rodriguez, </em>188 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir.1999). Double counting is permissible where (1) the Sentencing Commission intended the result, and (2) each guideline section in question concerns a conceptually separate notion related to sentencing. <em>See id. </em>at 1310. We presume the Sentencing Commission intended to apply separate guideline sections cumulatively, unless specifically directed otherwise. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">The application of both \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) and 4B1.4 did not constitute impermissible double counting, because each provision addresses different kinds of harm. <em>See id. </em>at 1309. Section 2D1.1(b)(l) addresses the danger associated with possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug offense, regardless of a defendant\u2019s criminal history, whereas \u00a7 4B1.4 addresses the recidivist harm associated with an armed career offender committing an additional firearm offense, regardless of whether the firearm was possessed in connection with a drug offense. Moreover, we assume that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>sections are to be applied cumulatively, because the Guidelines do not state otherwise. <em>See id. </em>at 1310. Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying both enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">\n<em>Diminished Capacity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">As an initial matter, we decline to review the denial of a downward departure under \u00a7 5K2.13, because Akel does not allege and the record does not show that the district court mistakenly believed that it lacked the authority to grant a downward departure based on reduced mental capacity. <em>See United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1256 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that we \u201cmay not review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure unless the court mistakenly believed that it lacked the authority to grant such a departure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Specifically, the district court must impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court failed to consider the appropriate statutory factors. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008). A sentencing court need not state on the record that it has considered each \u00a7 3553(a) factor and need not discuss each factor; rather, an acknowledgment by the district judge that he or she had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Akel\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable because the district court stated at sentencing that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and found, in light of these factors, that a 480-month sentence was both reasonable and necessary. Akel\u2019s sentence was also substantively reasonable. The court acknowledged Akel\u2019s argument regarding his diminished mental capacity, but found that other aggravating factors \u2014 namely, the need to protect the public from future crimes and the need to deter others from committing similar crimes \u2014 outweighed any mitigating factors. In light of the record, specifically, the extent and the ongoing nature of the drug trafficking conspiracy, Akel\u2019s prior violent offenses, and Akel\u2019s attempts to obstruct justice, his sentence does not appear to be unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm Akel\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-8\">. <em>Allen v.
