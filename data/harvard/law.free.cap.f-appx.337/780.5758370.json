On appeal, Quinn argues that the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because it failed to address the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and treated \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.10 and 2D1.1 as mandatory, thus violating Quinn\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He argues that his original <em>pre-Booker </em>sentence had violated his Sixth Amendment rights, and the court erred in imposing his amended sentence by failing to consider the mistakes made in his original sentence, or his post-sentence basis for relief. Quinn also asserts the court\u2019s failure to apply his amended guideline range in an advisory fashion violated his equal protection and due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-16\">We review a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). However, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, we review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We also review <em>\u201cde novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-17\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). This authority is limited to those guideline amendments listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) that \u201chave the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2) (Supp. May 1, 2008). Amendment 706 is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008). Effective November 1, 2007, Amendment 706 adjusted downward by two levels the base offense level assigned to each threshold quantity of crack cocaine listed in the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 706 (2007). Therefore, a district court has discretion to reduce the sentence of a defendant whose sentencing range has been lowered by Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-18\">Any sentencing reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements direct that a defendant is not entitled to a full resentencing during \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1331.10(a)(3) (Supp. May 1, 2008). The Commission has instructed district courts to determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the subsequently amended provision had been in effect at the time the defendant was originally sentenced. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1131.10(b)(1) (Supp. May 1, 2008). This is achieved by substituting the amended provision for the corresponding guideline provision that was applied when the defendant was sentenced, while \u201cleaving] all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, a court may not reconsider any of its original sentencing determinations other than the provision subject to the amendment. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"Ar0\">After recalculating the guidelines, the court next must consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as well as public safety considerations, and may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, in evaluating whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence is warranted and the extent of any such reuction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. 1(B) (Supp. May 1, 2008). The district court is not required to articulate the applicability of each factor, \u201cas long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 762 (11th Cir.1998) (citing <em>United States v. Eggersdorf </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997)) (finding that the district court\u2019s short order, referencing the government\u2019s brief that enumerated specific elements relevant to a \u00a7 3553(a) inquiry, provided sufficient reasons for the court\u2019s sentence). While the court must undertake this two-step analysis, its decision whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, and to what extent, is discretionary. <em>Id. </em>at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Section 3582(c)(2) requires that a sentencing reduction be consistent with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, the Sentencing Commission\u2019s applicable policy statement. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Section lB1.10(b)(2) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-8\">(2) <em>Limitations and Prohibition on Extent of </em>Reduction.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-9\">(A) <em>In General.- </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subdivision (B), the court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2) (made effective on March 3, 2008, by Amendment 712).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">This Court has recently rejected Quinn\u2019s argument that the district court has the authority to apply <em>Booker </em>in a \u00a7 3582 re-sentencing. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009) (holding \u201cthat <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough [v. U.S., </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) ] do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings\u201d and that <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d). And while the district court did not explicitly state any of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that it considered, it did seek briefing from the Government, it did consider all submissions, and it did reduce Quinn\u2019s sentence to the low end of the guideline range. Therefore, there is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"ASG\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
