Kirkland\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. On appeal, Kirkland argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a sentence reduction, despite his status as a career offender. Kirkland asserts that he was eligible because, even though \u2022 the court increased his offense level under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the court derived his base offense level from U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Additionally, he contends the court should have reduced his sentence based on his post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts and because the guidelines are advisory under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He also argues that the district court had discretion to reduce his sentence because he received a departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), we held that if the defendant was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 and the range was not affected by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, then the sentence is not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\u201d 541 F.3d at 1327-28. We noted that the base offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of the career offender range for the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. Thus, even though Amendment 706 was retroactive, the district court was not authorized to reduce the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1330. We held that this result was the same when a defendant received a downward departure for his substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), stating that there was \u201cno basis for concluding that the reduction of [the defendant\u2019s] base offense level lowered the sentencing range relied upon by the district court in determining his sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Just as in <em>Moore, </em>Kirkland\u2019s sentencing range was determined by his career offender status under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and his crack cocaine base offense level played no ultimate role in his sentence. Thus, Kirkland was not sentenced under the otherwise applicable base offense level in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, and he is ineligible for relief under Amendment 706. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327, 1330; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (prohibiting reduction where \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline\u201d). This outcome is not changed by the fact that Kirkland received a departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for substantial assistance because there is no indication that the court based his sentence on the guideline range that would have applied absent the career offender designation. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Further, Kirkland could not rely solely on <em>Booker </em>or his rehabilitative efforts as an independent basis for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, \u2014\u2014 </em>U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not render a guideline range advisory in the context of a \u00a7 3582 proceeding, whether or not the guideline range is reduced by a sentencing amendment); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir .2005) (holding that <em>Booker </em>did not provide a jurisdictional basis for \u00a7 3582 relief because it was not a sentencing amendment and that \u00a7 3582 only provides a district court with the discretion to reduce a sentence following the lowering of a sentencing range by the Sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>tencing Commission). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
