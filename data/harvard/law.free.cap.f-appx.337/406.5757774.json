The district court determined that Gonzalez was a career offender based upon his prior Texas conviction for aggravated assault and his Michigan conviction for possession with intent to deliver 5 to 45 kilograms of marijuana. Based on this finding, the district court enhanced Gonzalez\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a) and sentenced him to 151 months of imprisonment. Gonzalez sought relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and was granted an out-of-time appeal in accordance with <em>United States v. West, </em>240 F.3d 456, 460 (5th Cir.2001). Gonzalez thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal following reentry of the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Gonzalez acknowledges the existence of his Michigan drug conviction under Public Health Code \u00a7 333.7401. He argues, however, that the Michigan statute is broader than the definition of a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) because the Michigan statute punishes those who \u201ccreate\u201d a controlled substance offense, as well as those who manufacture or deliver or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance. <em>See </em>Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 333.7401. Section 4B1.2(b) does not include the term \u201ccreate\u201d in its definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d Gonzalez thus argues that the Michigan statute on its face does not constitute a controlled substance offense within the meaning of Section 4B1.2(b). Gonzalez further argues that the documents submitted at sentencing failed to show that his prior conviction qualified as a controlled substance offense. He thus contends that the district court erred in applying the career offender enhancement to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">As Gonzalez acknowledges, he failed to raise the argument he now raises on appeal before the district court. As such, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339-40 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-17\">Generally, when classifying a conviction for sentencing enhancement purposes, this court employs the categorical approach set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and looks to the elements of the prior offense, rather than to the facts underlying the conviction. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273 (5th Cir.2005). However, when a defendant has violated a statute that contains multiple disjunctive sections that prohibit conduct that will support a sentence enhancement and other conduct that will not support an enhancement, courts may look to \u201ccertain conclusive records made or used in adjudicating guilt\u201d to determine which section applies to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>United States v. Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d 316, 320 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>omitted). \u201cThis court has held that the determination of whether a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d was committed falls into the narrow range of cases where the court may consider information other than the statutory definition of the offense.\u201d <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 273. A case involving the determination of whether a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d occurred is treated in the same manner, since the Guidelines\u2019 definition for \u201cdrug trafficking-offense\u201d is almost identical to the definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 718 n. 2 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">State court documents filed in the record by the district court as part of the Section 2255 proceeding reflect that Gonzalez was charged and convicted of conduct that falls within the definition of a controlled substance offense as that term is defined in Section 4B 1.2(b) of the Guidelines. According to the felony information, Gonzalez \u201cdid possess with the intent to deliver 5 kilograms or more, but less than 45 kilograms of marijuana or a mixture containing marijuana; contrary to MCL 333.7401(2)(d)(ii).\u201d According to the judgment of conviction, Gonzalez pleaded guilty to \u201cCONT SUBS-DELY/MFG 5-45 KG MJ\u201d a violation of MCL \u00a7 333.7401(2)(d)(ii). The language of both the felony information and the judgment reflect that Gonzalez\u2019s conviction involved \u201cthe manufacturing]\u201d and \u201cdistribution ... of a controlled substance\u201d and not the \u201ccreating]\u201d of a controlled substance. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Because the conduct described in Gonzalez\u2019s state felony information and judgment of conviction is equivalent to the offense of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, the district court did not plainly err in finding that Gonzalez\u2019s Michigan conviction qualified as a controlled substance offense and enhancing his offense level under Section 4Bl.l(a). <em>See Ford, </em>509 F.3d at 717. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tu Cir.
