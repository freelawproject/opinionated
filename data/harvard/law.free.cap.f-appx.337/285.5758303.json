[to] possess in or affecting commerce, any fire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>arm or ammunition.\u201d After the district court denied Hayes\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, Hayes entered a conditional guilty plea and appealed to this court. We reversed, concluding that the district court should have granted the motion to dismiss. <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>482 F.3d 749 (4th Cir.2007). Thereafter, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1702, 170 L.Ed.2d 512 (2008), reversed our decision, <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1079, 172 L.Ed.2d 816 (2009), and remanded the case for further proceedings. On remand, we now conclude that Hayes\u2019s conviction and sentence must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">On February 24, 1994, Hayes was convicted in Marion County, West Virginia, Magistrate Court of misdemeanor battery. The victim was Hayes\u2019s then-wife Mary Ann Hayes (now Mary Carnes), with whom he cohabitated and had a child. Hayes was represented by counsel during that prosecution, and his conviction remains valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">On July 25, 2004, deputies from the Marion County Sheriff\u2019s Department responded to a 911 call from Mary Carnes reporting domestic violence at Hayes\u2019s home. With Hayes\u2019s consent, the deputies searched the home and recovered a Winchester rifle. Further investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\u201cATF\u201d) revealed that Hayes had possessed several other rifles throughout 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-16\">Based upon the ATF\u2019s investigation, on January 4, 2005, Hayes was charged in a three-count indictment with violating \u00a7 922(g)(9) and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (West 2000). Hayes moved to dismiss his indictment, arguing that his prior battery conviction was neither a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d (\u201cMCDV\u201d) under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2009), nor a qualifying predicate offense under \u00a7 922(g)(9). The Government filed a superseding indictment alleging the same substantive counts but including a \u201cNotice of Additional Factors\u201d detailing Hayes\u2019s battery conviction and arguing that the conviction qualified as a MCDV under \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u201cNotice of Additional Factors\u201d alleged that the victim in the battery conviction was Hayes\u2019s spouse with whom he shared a child and cohabitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-17\">Hayes again moved to dismiss, arguing principally that his battery conviction was not a MCDV because it did not require, as an element of the offense, the existence of a domestic relationship. Relatedly, Hayes contended that the \u201cNotice of Additional Factors\u201d was void because the domestic relationship between him and the victim did not appear on the face of any judicial documents in the battery conviction. Hayes contended that, under <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the Government was prohibited from proving that relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>ship by means of extrinsic evidence. The district court denied Hayes\u2019s motion and, on July 5, 2005, Hayes entered a conditional guilty plea to Count One of the superseding indictment, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss. The district court later sentenced Hayes to five years of probation, with the first six months served as home confinement. On appeal, we reversed, concluding that Hayes\u2019s battery conviction, which did not \u201chave as an element a domestic relationship between the offender and the victim,\u201d did not qualify as a predicate offense under \u00a7 922(g)(9). <em>Hayes, </em>482 F.3d at 751. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed, concluding that \u201cCongress defined \u2018misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u2019 to include an offense \u2018committed by\u2019 a person who had a specified domestic relationship with the victim, whether or not the misdemeanor statute itself designates the domestic relationship as an element of the crime.\u201d <em>Hayes, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1089. Thus, under \u00a7 922(g)(9), \u201cit suffices for the Government to charge and prove a prior conviction that was, in fact, for an offense committed by the defendant against a spouse or other domestic victim.\u201d <em>Hayes, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1084 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The Court remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">On remand, we are left to address Hayes\u2019s additional argument that the Government lacked judicially noticeable evidence of a domestic relationship for the battery conviction and should not have been allowed to prove the domestic relationship with extrinsic evidence. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment. <em>United States v. Hatcher, </em>560 F.3d 222, 224 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">According to Hayes, permitting the Government to prove the domestic relationship by means of \u201cextrinsic evidence\u201d runs afoul of <em>Shepard </em>and our decision in <em>United States v. Washington, </em>404 F.3d 834 (4th Cir.2005). Hayes argues that, consistent with these decisions, the domestic relationship must be proven only by looking to the charging documents, the terms of the plea agreement, the transcript of the plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented. Thus, argues Hayes, the \u201cNotice of Additional Factors\u201d is invalid and the indictment against him defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">We disagree. Hayes overlooks the fact that <em>Shepard </em>and <em>Washington </em>apply only to judicial fact-finding; those decisions operate as a safeguard for the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right \u201cto have a jury determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, his guilt of every element of the crime with which he is charged,\u201d <em>United States v. Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. 506, 522-23, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995) and \u201cany particular fact that the law makes essential to his punishment,\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 232, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the <em>Shepard </em>plurality explained, \u201cthe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee a jury standing between a defendant and the power of the State, and they guarantee a jury\u2019s finding of any disputed fact essential to increase the ceiling of a potential sentence.\u201d 544 U.S. at 25, 125 S.Ct. 1254. Hayes points to no case law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> supporting an extension of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>Shepard </em>and <em>Washington </em>to limit the Government\u2019s ability to prove its case to a jury at trial, and for good reason-no Sixth Amendment concerns are raised by the Government\u2019s use of extrinsic evidence to prove a prior conviction to the <em>jury. </em>Indeed, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in this case presages such a conclusion; the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">To obtain a conviction in a \u00a7 922(g)(9) prosecution, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim of the predicate offense was the defendant\u2019s current or former spouse or was related to the defendant in another specified way. But that relationship, while it must be established, need not be denominated an element of the predicate offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-5\"><em>Hayes, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Presumably, if the Court had Sixth Amendment concerns with the Government\u2019s means of proving the victim of the predicate offense, it would have mentioned them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\"><em>Shepard </em>and <em>Washington </em>do not limit the Government\u2019s ability to prove its case in a \u00a7 922(g)(9) prosecution to a jury. We thus agree with the district court that the Government was permitted to prove the existence of the domestic relationship with extrinsic evidence and that the indictment, with its \u201cNotice of Additional Factors,\u201d was valid on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">For the foregoing reasons, Hayes\u2019s conviction and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-11\">. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-12\">(33)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the term \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d means an offense that\u2014 (i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law; and (ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of ihe victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim!) 1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-19\">18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921 (a)(33)(A) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">. In his opening brief, Hayes relies principally on <em>United States v. Nobriga, </em>408 F.3d 1178 (9th Cir.2005), <em>withdrawn by </em>433 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir.2006) for the proposition that the Government must prove the domestic relationship by means of judicially noticeable facts. In its later opinion, however, the Ninth Circuit specified that the Government was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>permitted to \"prove[] the necessary domestic relationship at trial\u201d and that, like here, any \"mismatch between the Hawaii and federal domestic violence statutes is not a basis for invalidating the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Nobriga, </em>474 F.3d 561, 564 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-9\">. Chief Justice Roberts, in dissent, did discuss <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), and its predecessor, <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), for the proposition that the majority's approach would \u201coften\u201d make it \"necessary to go beyond the fact of conviction and engage in an elaborate factfinding process regarding the defendant\u2019s prior offense.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Hayes, - U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1079, 1092, 172 L.Ed.2d 816 (2009) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Tellingly, Chief Justice Roberts alluded only to the \u201cpractical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach,\u201d not to any potential Sixth Amendment concerns. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
