The Final Administrative Removal Order ordered that Oremade be x*e-moved to Nigeria pursuant to section 238(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b), because he was convicted of an aggx-avated felony. Oremade\u2019s convictions included convictions for financial identity fraud, in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14-113.20; insurance fraud, in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 58-2-161; false pretenses, in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14-100; conspiracy to pass, utter, possess, and conceal, with intent to defraud, counterfeit federal reserve notes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and possession of counterfeit federal reserve notes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472. Oremade was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation for his federal offenses, 15 to 18 months\u2019 impx'isonment for his state offenses, and ordered to pay $800 in restitution for his state offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-14\">After he was ordered removed, Oremade requested withholding of removal, CAT relief, and deferral of removal under the CAT. After a reasonable fear interview, his case was referred to an IJ. The IJ then ordered Ox'emade removed to Nigeria pursuant to the chax'ges in the x\u2019emoval ox'der and denied his thx'ee requests for x'elief.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">On appeal, Ox'emade ax'gues that his cx'iminal offenses were not aggravated felonies. The government concedes that the IJ erred by finding that Oremade was an aggravated felon. It asserts that, as a result, we must vacate the removal order because Oremade should have been placed in removal proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a before an IJ, instead of being placed in administrative removal proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-16\">Generally, an alien is placed into removal proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1229a. However, when an alien has committed an aggravated felony he may be removed in an administrative proceeding, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b), if: (1) he is an alien; (2) who has not been admitted for lawful permanent residence; (3) who has been convicted of an aggravated felony; and (4) who is removable because of that conviction. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 238.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-17\">An alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony is removable. 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(a)(iii). Aggravated felonies include theft for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year, fraud involving a loss to a victim or victims of over $10,000, and counterfeiting a passport for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(43)(G), (M), (P). The BIA has clarified that \u201ca theft offense within the meaning of [\u00a7 1101(43)(G) ] consists of the taking of, or exercise of control over, property without consent whenever there is criminal intent to deprive the owner of the rights and benefits of ownership, even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.\u201d <em>Matter of Garcia-Madruga, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 436, 440-441 (BIA 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Oremade and the government correctly assert that Oremade did not commit an aggravated felony because none of his convictions fall within the definition of an aggravated felony found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(43). Because Oremade was not an aggravated felon, the removal order is void and must be vacated. Because we are vacating Oremade\u2019s removal order, we will not consider his arguments seeking relief from the removal order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate the removal order and grant Ore-made\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">PETITION GRANTED, REMOVAL ORDER VACATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">. Although the government concedes that the legal basis for Oremade\u2019s removal should be vacated, it requests that this court still consider Oremade\u2019s claims for relief because he is removable on other grounds. <em>(See </em>Red Brief at 26). However, neither the BIA nor the IJ made any such findings, so this court has nothing to review as far as Oremade's removability is concerned. In addition, the government also acknowledges that Oremade has been removed to Nigeria. <em>(See id. </em>at 17). As such, it is unclear what actions the DHS would take once this case returns to the immigration court, as Oremade is not presently in the country. Oremade would need to seek to return to the United States under procedures not utilized in this case, and his success in gaining readmittance would be speculative.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
