On appeal, Noland raises two challenges to his sentence. First, Noland asserts his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it exceeded the Guideline range. Second, Noland argues his sentence is substantively unreasonable because certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors relied on by the district court in reaching its sentencing decision were already subsumed in the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-19\">The district court found Noland had an extensive criminal history, beginning when he was 12 years old and consisting of at least 14 criminal convictions. The district court additionally noted the significant public safety risks created by Noland when he fled police while displaying a loaded firearm. Finally, the district coui't agreed with the Government and Noland\u2019s own counsel that Noland had a pressing need to receive drug treatment and vocational training while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-20\">There is no basis on which to conclude the district court made a clear error in judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and therefore, the court\u2019s decision is entitled to due deference. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Moreover, the district court expressly considered all of the relevant factors and imposed a sentence that was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Because \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported the court\u2019s determination of an appropriate sentence in this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion and imposed a reasonable sentence. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number><em>States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">As an additional argument that the upward variance applied was unreasonable, Noland asserts several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors considered by the district court in applying the upward variance are already subsumed in the Guidelines, and therefore cannot properly be used for such variation. Noland provides no case authority for this assertion, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">A plain reading of \u00a7 3553(a) reveals whether or not there may be some overlap between the considerations that inform a Sentencing Guideline and certain factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a), all are to be considered by a court in arriving at a sentencing decision. To ignore one or several \u00a7 3553(a) factors because the Guidelines are also being considered, as Noland advocates, would run afoul of the statute itself, as well as established Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit precedent interpreting and applying the statute. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596 (explaining a district court should begin \u201cby correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range\u201d and \u201cthen consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d); <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (the Sentencing Guidelines are to be considered along with the remaining items listed in \u00a7 3553(a)); <em>see also United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given statutory factor is matter committed to sound discretion of district court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Section 3553(a) expressly provides that the sentencing range (\u00a7 3553(a)(7)) is to be considered along with, for example, the nature of the offense and the characteristics and history of the defendant (\u00a7 3553(a)(1)), and the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense and to provide just punishment for the offense (\u00a7 3553(a)(2)). Consistent with the statutory scheme, the Supreme Court and this Court have indicated the Sentencing Guidelines must be considered concurrently with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including enumerated offense and offender characteristics. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596; <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Noland provides no case authority for his argument to the contrary, and it should therefore be rejected on the authority of <em>Gall, Talley, </em>and \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Cf. United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007) <em>(\u201cAmedeo II\u201d) </em>(\u201c[A]s for Amedeo\u2019s argument that certain aspects <em>of </em>his conduct (such as the abuse of the attorney-client relationship) had already been considered in imposing an <em>enhancement </em>under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, Amedeo points to no authority that deems it impermissible for the district court to also have considered this conduct in imposing a variance in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d) (emphasis in original). We, therefore, conclude there was no abuse of discretion by the district court in considering \u00a7 3553(a) factors that may overlap considerations of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm No-land\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
