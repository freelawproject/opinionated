The district court affirmed the decision of the Commissioner, and Tucker appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Dr. Chris Mauldin treated Tucker for knee trauma on November 29, 2004, after she hit her right knee while opening a door. He treated Tucker\u2019s subsequent knee effusion with medication and informed her that she could return to her normal activity. Tucker\u2019s subjective complaints of knee pain persisted through January 7, 2005 despite Dr. Mauldin\u2019s statements that he successfully treated her knee in November 2004. Dr. Mauldin suggested ongoing conservative treatment with medication and moist heat after a follow-up exam on January 7, 2005, revealed some pain around the right knee joint with minimal effusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">Tucker also complained of neck discomfort near the end of 2004, and an MRI on December 20, 2004 revealed a left lateral disc protrusion at C5-6 and C6-7. Tucker\u2019s continued complaints of neck pain prompted a bone scan on January 20, 2005, but the scan yielded normal results. Dr. Aremmia Tanious, who had treated Tucker twice since December 14, 2004, opined on January 24, 2005 that Tucker\u2019s degenerative cervical spine disease, migraine headaches, and depression rendered her \u201ctotally disabled\u201d and \u201cunable to perform any job at this point.\u201d By February 2005, Tucker\u2019s subjective pain complaints persisted, and now included allegations of pain in her neck, upper back, and shoulders, as well as fatigue. This prompted Dr. Tanious to cite fibromyalgia as the possible cause of Tucker\u2019s diffuse nonspecific pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">On February 22, 2005, Dr. Tanious requested that Tucker be excused from jury duty due to fibromyalgia. On June 13, 2005, Tucker underwent a comprehensive mental status examination by Dr. Joanna McCraney. During this evaluation Tucker cited her physical problems as the only reason she is unable to work. Tucker explained her ability to conduct activities of daily living including cooking and other chores, but noted a need to spend much of the day in a recliner to relieve her back pain. Specifically, Tucker noted that she drives, shops, and prepares meals. Tucker also referenced limited social activities. Dr. McCraney diagnosed Tucker with depression, but concluded that she did not appear unable to work from a mental standpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-18\">Dr. Tanious again examined Tucker for complaints of shoulder, arm, and leg pain on December 12, 2005. Despite Tucker\u2019s relatively normal physical examination, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Tanious once again opined that she was \u201cnot able to perform any type of job.\u201d On December 29, 2005, Dr. Tanious completed a formal \u201cMedical Assessment of Ability to do Work-Related Activities (Physical)\u201d form. Dr. Tanious explained that Tucker\u2019s lifting and carrying were not affected by her impairments, but nevertheless limited her to 5 pounds carrying both frequently and occasionally. Dr. Tanious then noted that Tucker was limited to 4 hours standing/walking in an eight hour day with interruptions every 1 hour, and suffered from no limitation to her ability to sit. Dr. Tanious further opined that Tucker could only occasionally climb, balance, stoop, crouch, kneel, and crawl.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Tucker applied for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act on February 15, 2005, alleging disability beginning January 27, 2005. Her claim was denied initially on July 1, 2005 and upon reconsideration on July 26, 2005. On July 29, 2005, Tucker filed a timely request for a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). The ALJ held a hearing in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, on January 4, 2006, at which she took testimony from Tucker and vocational expert Ronald K Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d) and evaluated the opinions of medical experts, including Dr. Tanious. The ALJ issued an unfavorable decision on June 27, 2006, finding that Tucker was \u201cnot disabled\u201d because she retained the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform a full range of sedentary work as of her date last insured for benefits. This decision became the Commissioner\u2019s final decision after the Appeals Council denied Tucker\u2019s subsequent request for review on November 6, 2006. Tucker then filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, Hattiesburg Division, seeking judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying her disability application. Tucker and the Commissioner each filed district court briefs, and a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation on February 15, 2008, affirming the decision of the Commissioner. Tucker did not file any objection. The district court issued an order adopting the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation on August 5, 2008, 2008 WL 3285903, and a final judgment affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision on August 8, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">II. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The Commissioner\u2019s decision is reviewed by this court only to ascertain whether (1) the decision is supported by substantial evidence and (2) whether the Commissioner used the proper legal standards to evaluate the evidence. <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). Substantial evidence is that which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). It is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance. <em>Johnson v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 340, 343 (5th Cir.1988). This court does not reweigh the evidence in the record, try the issues de novo, or substitute its judgment for the Commissioner\u2019s, even if the evidence weighs against the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>See Newton, </em>209 F.3d at 452. Conflicts in the evidence are for the Commissioner and not the courts to resolve. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ\u2019s decision must stand or fall with the reasons set forth in the ALJ\u2019s decision, as adopted by the Appeals Council. <em>Id. </em>at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The claimant has the burden of proving she has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment lasting at least twelve months that prevents her from engaging in substantial gainful activity. <em>Newton, </em>209 F.3d at 452 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A)). Substantial gainful activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ty is defined as work activity involving significant physical or mental abilities for pay or profit. <em>Id. </em>at 452-53 (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1572(a) and (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The ALJ uses a five-step sequential process to evaluate claims of disability in which he must determine whether: (1) the claimant is not working in substantial gainful activity; (2) the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) the claimant\u2019s impairment meets or equals a listed impairment; (4) the impairment prevents the claimant from doing past relevant work; and (5) the impairment prevents the claimant from doing any other work. <em>Id. </em>at 453 (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520). The claimant bears the burden of proof on the first four steps, and the burden shifts to the Commissioner for the fifth step. Thus, the claimant must show first that she is no longer capable of performing her past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>(citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e)). If the claimant satisfies this burden, then the Commissioner must show that the claimant is capable of engaging in some type of alternative work that exists in the national economy. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Chaparro v. Bowen, </em>815 F.2d 1008, 1010 (5th Cir.1987)). Once the Commissioner makes this showing, the burden of proof shifts back to the claimant to rebut this finding. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Chaparro, </em>815 F.2d at 1010). A finding that the claimant is not disabled at any step is conclusive and ends the inquiry. <em>Masterson v. Barnhart, </em>309 F.3d 267, 272 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">III. THE DECISION OF THE ALJ</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Applying step one of the five step inquiry to Tucker\u2019s claim for disability, the ALJ found that Tucker had not engaged in any substantial gainful activity at any relevant time. At step two, the ALJ found that Tucker suffered from the following \u201csevere\u201d impairments: fibromyalgia and arthritis of the knee. At step three, however, the ALJ determined that none of Tucker\u2019s impairments, or a combination thereof, met or medically equaled any impairment in the Listing of Impairments found in 20 C.F.R. 404, subpart P, Regulation 4, Appendix 1. At step four, the ALJ found that Tucker\u2019s RFC precluded performance of her past relevant work, but at step five, the ALJ concluded that Medical-Vocational rule 201.21 directed a finding of \u201cnot disabled\u201d given Tucker\u2019s age, education, work experience, and RFC. In assessing Tucker\u2019s RFC, the ALJ found that Tucker retained the RFC to perform a full range of sedentary work and that her statements concerning the intensity, duration, and limiting effects of her symptoms were not entirely credible. The ALJ acknowledged that \u201c[t]he objective medical evidence clearly show[ed] that the claimant has impairments which could reasonably be expected to cause mild to moderate pain and limitations which would clearly restrict her to no more than sedentary level of activity.\u201d However, the ALJ found Dr. Tanious\u2019 conclusion that Tucker was unable to perform any type of job to be inconsistent with other medical evidence as well as Tanious\u2019 own records. Furthermore, the ALJ noted that Tucker\u2019s own testimony regarding her limitations were consistent with a sedentary level of activity, and that her impairments were not shown to be \u201cso severe as to prevent the claimant from being present and attentive in a normal job setting requiring no more than sedentary work.\u201d Therefore, the ALJ found that Tucker was not disabled as defined under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Tucker contends that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that she retains the RFC for sedentary work because (1) Dr. Tanious stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>she is \u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cunable to work\u201d and (2) Dr. Tanious\u2019 description of her actual functional limitations, specifically the 5-pound weight limitation, do not lead to the conclusion that she can perform sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">In the first instance, it appears that Tucker has waived both of these arguments by failing to raise them in the district court. <em>Keenan v. Tejeda, </em>290 F.3d 252, 262 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201cIf a party fails to assert a legal reason why summary judgment should not be granted, that ground is waived and cannot be considered or raised on appeal\u201d). Although Tucker challenged the ALJ\u2019s assessment of her RFC in the district court proceeding, she did not specifically assert either of the challenges presented here. Specifically, Tucker failed to argue that the 5-pound lifting and carrying restriction Dr. Tanious assessed is inconsistent with a sedentary RFC. She also failed to argue that the ALJ failed to properly weigh Dr. Tanious\u2019 medical source statements that she is \u201ctotally disabled\u201d and \u201cunable to perform any job at this point,\u201d in a manner sufficient to satisfy the requirements of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d). Because Tucker failed to raise these arguments in the district court, they have been waived. <em>Keelan v. Majesco Software, Inc., </em>407 F.3d 332, 340 (5th Cir.2005) (noting that a party \u201cmust press and not merely intimate the argument during the proceedings before the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Even if Tucker\u2019s arguments were properly before this court, they would not present a successful challenge to the decision of the ALJ. The ALJ\u2019s determination that Tucker is not disabled is supported by substantial evidence in the record. Tucker first argues that the 5-pound lifting and carrying restriction Dr. Tanious assessed is not consistent with the ALJ\u2019s finding that Tucker can perform the full range of sedentary work. According to the applicable x*egulations, the perfoxrnance of the full x-ange of sedentary work requires the ability to lift and carry a maximum of 10 pounds occasionally. 20 CFR 404.1567(a). Although the 5-pound x'estriction does not suppox-t the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Tucker can pex-form the full range of sedentary wox\u2019k, the ALJ based his RFC assessment on the entire medical record, including Tucker\u2019s office visits at various clinics and multiple tests and tx*eatments, and not solely on the specific functional limitations specified by Dr. Tanious. The ALJ, after reviewing and weighing the entire medical record in detail, concluded that the evidence only established that Tucker \u201chas impairments which could reasonably be expected to cause mild to moderate pain and limitations which would cleaxJy restrict her to no more than a sedentax-y level of activity.\u201d In addition, even if the ALJ had credited the weight restxiction expressed by Dr. Tanious, it would likely not have affected the ALJ\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Tucker was not disabled under the Act. It is uncontested that the vocational expert testified that \u201cthere are some sedentary jobs that don\u2019t involve lifting more than five pounds at a time\u201d that an individual of the age, education, work history, and RFC desexhbed by Dr. Tanious could perform. <em>See Ripley v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 552, 557 (5th Cir.1995) (noting that \u201cReversal of [the ALJ\u2019s] decision ... is appropriate only if the applicant shows that he was prejudiced.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Furthermore, even if Tucker\u2019s second argument was not waived, the ALJ did not err in failing to credit Dr. Tanious\u2019 ultimate conclusions that Tucker is \u201ctotally disabled\u201d and \u201cunable to perform any job at this point.\u201d The regulations defining \u201cmedical opinions\u201d specifically state that conclusoiy statements such as those made by Dr. Tanious are \u201cnot medical opinions as descxibed in paragx-aph (a)(2) of [20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527], but are, instead, opinions on issues reserved to the Commissioner because they are administrative findings that are dispositive of a case,\u201d and are not entitled to any special significance or treatment under the regulations. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e), (e)(3). A determination by a treating physician that an applicant is \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201cunable to work\u201d is not a medical opinion entitled to deference, but rather a legal conclusion \u201creserved to the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Frank v. Barnhart, </em>326 F.3d 618, 620 (5th Cir.2003). Thus, the ALJ did not err in failing to credit Dr. Tanious\u2019 conclusions that Tucker is \u201ctotally disabled\u201d and \u201cunable to perform any job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Tucker waived her arguments by failing to raise them in the district court. Even if Tucker had properly preserved her arguments, they would not to present a sufficient challenge to the decision of the ALJ. Therefore, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
