The district court imposed the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Brown timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-23\">Counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), noting no meritorious issues for appeal but challenging the constitutionality of \u00a7 841, contending the sentencing disparity between powder cocaine and crack offenses violated Brown\u2019s right to equal protection and bears no rational relationship to any lawful government purpose. Brown has not filed a pro se supplemental brief, and the Government declined to file a brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-24\">Brown\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2006) lacks merit. This court has repeatedly held that the sentencing disparity between cocaine powder and crack offenses does not violate either equal protection or due process, and that \u00a7 841 has a rational basis. <em>See United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 876-77 (4th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>58 F.3d 96, 99-100 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>900 F.2d 37, 39 (4th Cir.1990). Furthermore, the 2007 amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines have no effect on the constitutionality or applicability of the statutory mandatory minimum sentences for crack offenses. <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 573, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-25\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Brown, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Brown requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
