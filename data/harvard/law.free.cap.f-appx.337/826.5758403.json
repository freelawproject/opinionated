Bush, through counsel, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a sentencing reduction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">In 1999, Bush pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The probation officer prepared a pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) and determined that Bush was accountable for 95.1 grams of crack cocaine, giving him a base offense level of 32. However, the probation officer found that Bush was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and because the statutory maximum penalty was life imprisonment, he received a new offense level of 37. The probation officer then applied a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, giving Bush a total offense level of 34. Bush\u2019s status as a career offender gave him a criminal history category of VI which, when coupled with his offense level of 34, gave him an applicable guideline range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. At sentencing, the district court adopted the probation officer\u2019s guideline calculations and sentenced Bush to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirmed Bush\u2019s sentence on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">In October 2008, Bush filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for a sentencing reduction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that, regardless of his status as a career offender, he was eligible for a sentencing reduction because Amendment 706 lowered his underlying base offense level. The court then appointed Bush counsel, who submitted a memorandum acknowledging that Bush was ineligible for a sentencing reduction under <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156, and <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). Nonetheless, counsel challenged <em>Moore\u2019s </em>rationale and argued that the decision was wrongly decided. The district court ultimately denied Bush\u2019s motion as follows: \u201cThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Moore </em>is binding on this Court, and Defendant\u2019s case falls squarely within its holding. Defendant\u2019s sentence was not based on a sentencing range that has been subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>quently lowered by the Sentencing Commission because he was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where he \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any such reduction must also be consistent with the Commission\u2019s applicable policy statement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">In this case, Bush correctly acknowledges on appeal that he was ineligible for a sentencing reduction under <em>Moore </em>because, although Amendment 706 would reduce his base offense level, that base offense level was superseded when he was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330 (\u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">In addition, we decline Bush\u2019s invitation to revisit the district court\u2019s original calculation of his statutory maximum sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) (\u201c[T]he court shall substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (e) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d); <em>see United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1190 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201choldfing] that a district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) <em>and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission </em>\u201d) (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-9\">. Bush's reliance on arguments presented in unrelated petitions requesting this Court to reconsider <em>Moore en banc </em>is without merit, as this Court has recently denied those petitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
