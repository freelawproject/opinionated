The district court sentenced Young to 300 months\u2019 imprisonment on the bank robbery conviction and an additional 144 months on the firearms conviction, to be served consecutively. Young timely noted his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-23\">On appeal, Young argues that the district court improperly enhanced his sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>tence for obstruction of justice. A district court\u2019s factual findings, including those that serve as a basis for an obstruction of justice enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3C1.1, are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Kiulin, </em>360 F.3d 456, 460 (4th Cir.2004). This deferential standard of review requires reversal only if this court is \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d 538, 542 (4th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). However, a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding whether to apply a sentencing enhancement are reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Layton, </em>564 F.3d 330, 334 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">According to USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, a defendant\u2019s base offense level is to be increased two levels for obstruction of justice if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A--\">the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and ... the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">USSG \u00a7 3C1.1. Obstructive conduct within the meaning of \u00a7 3C1.1 includes, but is not limited to, \u201cthreatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully influencing a co-defendant, witness, or juror, directly or indirectly, or attempting to do so.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, comment (n.4(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Here, the district court enhanced Young\u2019s base offense level pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 after determining that Young yelled at a cooperating witness in the courthouse lock-up in the presence of other prisoners and called the cooperating witness a \u201csnitch\u201d and a \u201crat.\u201d Young\u2019s statements and the context in which they were made establish his intent to, directly or indirectly, intimidate or unlawfully influence the cooperating witness. By knowingly revealing the witness\u2019 willingness to cooperate with authorities, Young exposed the witness to a potentially hostile crowd, and the district court could properly conclude based on Young\u2019s statements and the context in which they were made that Young intended to obstruct justice. <em>See United States v. Hurst, </em>228 F.3d 751, 761-62 (6th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the district court did not err in enhancing Young\u2019s offense level by two levels for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Young also argues on appeal that the district court committed procedural error in sentencing him. This court reviews a sentence imposed by a district court under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). United <em>United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155, 161 (4th Cir.2008). In reviewing a sentence, we must first ensure that the district court committed no procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. If there are no procedural errors, we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>A substantive reasonableness review entails taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007) (quotations and citation omitted). Further, this court may presume a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>Even if the reviewing court would have reached a different result, this fact alone is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>\u201cWhen rendering a sentence, the district court must make an <em>individualized </em>assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597) (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis in the original). Accordingly, a sentencing court must apply the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors to the particular facts presented and must \u201cstate in open court\u201d the particular reasons that support its chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>Stating in open court the particular reasons for a chosen sentence requires the district court to set forth enough to satisfy this court that the district court has a reasoned basis for its decision and has considered the parties\u2019 arguments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">We have reviewed the record, and it is clear that the district court conducted a thorough and particularized sentencing hearing during which it considered and, ultimately, rejected Young\u2019s sentencing arguments. Also, the district court applied the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and clearly stated in open court the basis for the chosen sentence. Accordingly, Young fails to demonstrate that his sentence was proeedurally unreasonable. Additionally, this court may presume on appeal that a sentence within a defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range is substantively reasonable, and Young fails to offer anything to rebut that presumption. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 340, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument as the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
