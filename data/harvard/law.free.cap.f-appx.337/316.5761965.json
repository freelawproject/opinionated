He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland affirmed his conviction on June 21, 1993, and his sentence on August 26, 1994. McLeod\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the Maryland Court of Appeals on December 16, 1994. His petition for post-conviction relief to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, where he had been convicted, was denied on February 25, 1998; leave to appeal was also denied. On July 16, 2001 McLeod filed a <em>pro se </em>petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 for a writ of habeas corpus with the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, which was denied as being time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-18\">Arguing that new evidence had been discovered that ought to have been disclosed to him by the State under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), McLeod returned to the Cii'cuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County and filed a motion to re-open his post-conviction proceedings on April 22, 2003. Following a two-day evidentiary hearing in January, 2004, that court issued a statement of reasons, which included findings of fact, denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-19\">On June 1, 2005 this court granted McLeod\u2019s motion for authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). Following a non-evidentiary hearing, the district court, on March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>30, 2007, dismissed the petition with prejudice. <em>McLeod v. Peguese, </em>482 F.Supp.2d 658 (D.Md.2007). The district court did grant McLeod\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Because McLeod has failed to meet the threshold requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii), his successive \u00a7 2254 petition must be dismissed. That is, McLeod has failed to show that the facts underlying his due process <em>Brady </em>claim, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable fact-finder would have found him guilty of murder. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Proceeding nevertheless to the merits, as did the district court, McLeod has not shown that the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County made an objectively unreasonable determination of the facts in light of all the evidence presented to it, or that it unreasonably applied clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Jacqueline Roberson, then twenty-eight years old, was last seen waxing her car off to the side of Governor\u2019s Bridge Road near the entrance to Izaak Walton League Park in Bowie, Maryland on August 10, 1987. Three days later Roberson\u2019s nude body was discovered in a wooded area approximately three hundred feet from the road. Her body was found under leaves and branches, face down, with her hands underneath her body and her legs spread apart. Roberson\u2019s clothing, consisting of a white strapped t-shii-t, a navy blue cut-off t-shirt and a pah- of light blue jeans which had been cut off and made into shorts, were found next to her body. Her undergarments were found beneath her. The cause of death was determined to be two stab wounds to the abdomen, which had not been inflicted through the clothing. There was no evidence of vaginal or anal penetration, and an autopsy failed to reveal the presence of semen in or on her person.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">A red \u201cWMZQ, Country FM\u201d bandana and a knife were found at or near the crime scene. Hah- found on the bandana, which was next to Roberson\u2019s body, was determined to be that of a cat. No fingerprints or blood residue were found on the knife, which was discovered on the unpaved shoulder of Governor\u2019s Bridge Road approximately one-hundred and fifty feet east of the entrance to Izaak Walton League Park. Six latent fingerprints were discovered on Roberson\u2019s car, none of which have been identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">On August 13, 1987, the same day Roberson\u2019s body was discovered, McLeod was arrested for the rape of fifteen year old Lori Webb. Webb was raped in her home earlier that day, and at the time of the rape was wearing a purple shirt and white shorts with thin red stripes. McLeod subsequently pled guilty to raping Webb and was sentenced to forty years in prison with fifteen years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">Detective Robert Edgar, and other members of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department (\u201cPGPD\u201d), interviewed a number of prospective witnesses and suspects in connection with the Roberson murder between August 13, 1987 and February 1, 1988. During this time, members of the PGPD interviewed Pamela Sue Fike. Fike informed the PGPD that she was told by her brother, Christopher Fike, that Harold Freese told him that \u201cthe Saunders\u201d were at Governor\u2019s Bridge Road on August 10, 1987. Pamela Fike\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>brother also told her that he believed the Saunders may have killed Roberson because \u201cthey are the type that may do something like that.\u201d Fike\u2019s statement was memorialized in an undated, but signed, witness statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">On August 15, 1987, two days after McLeod\u2019s arrest for the rape of Webb, his mother, Barbara Bricker, found a pah' of shorts in McLeod\u2019s room with a wax-like substance in the crotch area. She immediately contacted the PGPD. Detective Edgar went to Bricker\u2019s home where he was given the shorts and other items of McLeod\u2019s clothing. At this point, McLeod became a suspect in the Roberson murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Edgar first interviewed McLeod regarding Roberson\u2019s murder on February 1, 1988 at the Prince George\u2019s County Detention Center (\u201cDetention Center\u201d). During the interview, McLeod denied any involvement in, or knowledge of, the murder and provided a written statement. On that same day, and despite his denials, McLeod was charged with the murder of Roberson and related offenses. The following month, however, in March of 1988, the charges were <em>nolle pressed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Following withdrawal of the charges against McLeod, the Roberson murder investigation remained at a standstill for more than two years. At some point in 1991, Edgar decided to once again actively pursue the case, enlisting the assistance of Detective Douglas LaFoille to that end. During the summer of 1991, Edgar and LaFoille asked one of McLeod\u2019s acquaintances to send McLeod a letter designed to elicit an admission from McLeod regarding his involvement in the Roberson murder. Upon receipt of the letter, McLeod demanded that the letter\u2019s true author contact him.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">During an October 2, 1991 interview conducted by Edgar and LaFoille, McLeod again denied any involvement in the Roberson murder. McLeod told the detectives that after being charged in February of 1988, he was approached by a fellow inmate named \u201cRick.\u201d McLeod said that Rick, who was later determined to be Richard Nelson, told him that he knew that McLeod had not murdered Roberson and that he knew who did. At the time of the interview, McLeod told the detectives that Nelson had provided the name of Roberson\u2019s killer, but McLeod could not recall the name. Some 12 years later, however, during the circuit court\u2019s hearing in 2004 on McLeod\u2019s motion to re-open the post-conviction proceedings, McLeod testified that Nelson stated that the murderer\u2019s name was \u201cBrian.\u201d Nelson allegedly told McLeod that Roberson was killed because she happened upon a drug deal and was \u201cin the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d McLeod informed the detectives that Nelson had refused to speak with authorities and would deny ever having discussed the murder. McLeod also provided two written statements, one setting forth what he could recall of his conversation with Nelson, and the other regarding his whereabouts on the day of Roberson\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Nelson was known by the PGPD and the State\u2019s Attorneys Office to be a violent man with an extensive criminal history. Following the 1991 interview with McLeod, the PGPD undertook extensive efforts to locate him. At the time, the PGPD believed Nelson was either a suspect, or a material witness, in the Roberson murder. In furtherance of the effort to locate Nelson, Edgar and LaFoille sought the assistance of state, federal and international law enforcement agencies. The detectives also contacted Nelson\u2019s family members, friends and acquaintances. In the fall of 1991, LaFoille was in contact with Nelson\u2019s ex-wife, Karen Clark. As will be seen, the extent of the contacts, and the information exchanged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>between LaFoille and Clark, are in sharp dispute. Ultimately, the efforts to locate Nelson were to no avail. He was never found and his whereabouts remain unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">In April of 1992, McLeod was indicted for Roberson\u2019s murder. Prior to trial, defense counsel moved to compel discovery, complaining that the State had not complied with its obligations \u25a0 under <em>Brady. </em>The trial court directed the State to produce any witness statements arguably containing exculpatory information. In an attempt to comply with the court\u2019s directive, the lead prosecutor, Laura Gwinn, sent defense counsel a letter. The letter made no reference to Nelson\u2019s ex-wife, Karen Clark, and failed to disclose that the state possessed Pamela Fike\u2019s written statement regarding what she had been told by her brother. The State did, however, provide the defense with a list of prosecution witnesses containing eighty-three names, including Fike\u2019s. The defense attempted to locate Fike, but was unable to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Beginning on October 21, 1992, McLeod was tried before a jury for the murder of Roberson and carrying a dangerous weapon openly with the intent to injure. The State presented evidence that McLeod owned a bandana and a knife like those found at the scene. The State also showed that McLeod lived in a home with cats, which, according to the State, explained why cat hair was found on the bandana. Members of McLeod\u2019s family testified that when they visited him at the Detention Center following his arrest for the rape of Webb, they asked why he had been arrested. According to McLeod\u2019s step-father, William Bricker, McLeod responded \u201crape, murder, something.\u201d McLeod\u2019s mother testified that McLeod responded by asking \u201cwas it murder, was it rape or what? He seemed very confused.\u201d McLeod\u2019s mother and step-father testified further that when asked how he could rape a fifteen year old, McLeod responded, \u201cI thought she was older.\u201d When asked by his family to describe his victim\u2019s clothing, McLeod stated, according to his step-father, \u201c[a] blue pullover and blue shorts,\u201d and according to his mother, \u201ca pullover and navy blue shorts.\u201d The parties stipulated that Webb, who broke down in front of the jury and could not complete her testimony, would testify that she was raped in her home by McLeod on August 13, 1987, and would have identified her clothing. The clothing Webb was wearing at the time of her rape was admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The State offered, and the court admitted, the shorts smudged with car wax recovered from McLeod\u2019s room. The Turtlewax \u00ae brand of car wax found on McLeod\u2019s shorts was shown to be the same brand of wax used by Roberson the day of her murder. McLeod would typically wax his step-father\u2019s raeecar once every two weeks, and the police recovered a container of Turtlewax \u00ae from McLeod\u2019s home. There was a dispute as to the last time McLeod waxed his own car, and washed his clothing, prior to the murder. McLeod\u2019s mother testified that she believed McLeod had waxed his car on August 7, 1987. The State also offered evidence that McLeod gave his step-father conflicting alibis regarding his whereabouts the night of Roberson\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The State argued that McLeod may not have acted alone in murdering Roberson. At trial, the defense specifically referenced other possible suspects, namely, Brian Rose and Wayne Hurley. Upon being called by the defense, Rose invoked <em>his </em>Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer any questions. In closing, the State made reference to the defense\u2019s claim that Rose murdered Roberson, stating \u201c[w]e heard a lot about Brian Rose.... We heard that he has a red and white <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>striped bandana. We heard from his mom that he had a cat.\u201d Based on the forgoing, the State argued that the defendant had not offered a reasonable hypothesis of innocence, and that based on all the evidence, which cumulatively tended to show that McLeod was involved in Roberson\u2019s murder, he should be found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The defense argued, among other things, that in light of the State\u2019s theory that McLeod may not have been the one wielding the knife, and because the evidence did not suggest that Roberson was killed during the course of an attempted rape, McLeod was not guilty of felony murder. The defense also argued that other people were seen near the crime scene with red WMZQ bandanas, and that the evidence implicated Rose to the same extent as McLeod. In sum, the defense argued that the State had not met its burden of proof. On October 27, 1992, the jury convicted McLeod of first degree felony murder and carrying a dangerous weapon openly with intent to injure. McLeod\u2019s requests for post conviction relief on the murder charge failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In March of 2001, nine years after his conviction, McLeod requested that the red bandana and cat hairs recovered from the scene be tested for DNA. The State, however, had destroyed those items, McLeod\u2019s shorts, Roberson\u2019s clothing, and the latent fingerprints taken from Roberson\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">According to Karen Clark, she and Detective LaFoille were in contact on numerous occasions in the fall of 1991. Clark maintains that over the course of these contacts she informed LaFoille of the following, which constitutes the core of the <em>Brady </em>claim: Nelson was a violent drug addict; during the summer of 1987 Nelson gave their son Richard Nelson III a red WMZQ bandana and Nelson owned a matching bandana; at some point during the summer of 1987 Nelson demanded the return of their son\u2019s bandana;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nelson was adamant that the bandana be returned but would not tell Clark why; during the summer of 1987 she met with Nelson and gave him the son\u2019s bandana; Nelson carried knives and his favorite knife was wooden handled with brass fittings, similar to the one found on the shoulder of Governor\u2019s Bridge Road not far from where Roberson\u2019s body was discovered; when she saw Nelson during the summer of 1987 she noticed that he had a new knife and upon inquiry Nelson told her that he had lost his favorite knife; and that Nelson had told her, before they married in 1983, that he was present when a young woman named Donna Dustin was murdered on November 17,1973 in Anne Arundel County. According to Clark, Nelson stated that Dustin\u2019s head had been slammed into the bumper of a car and that his knife was used during the assault. Dustin\u2019s body was found approximately three miles from the spot where Roberson\u2019s body was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">On August 16, 2002, Clark wrote to McLeod in prison requesting the name and contact information of his attorney. McLeod complied with her request and on August 23, 2002 Clark met with McLeod\u2019s counsel, Mitchell Ettinger. In addition to the information allegedly provided to Detective LaFoille, Clark told McLeod\u2019s attorney that Nelson frequented Rips, a restaurant where Roberson worked during the summer. Clark also stated that Nelson was associated with Neil Vaughn, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>of three individuals who acknowledged being near the crime scene the day of Roberson\u2019s murder. Clark further informed counsel that during the summer of 1987, Nelson lived with his then girlfriend Virginia Aeree and that Clark had received items from Nelson that summer with cat hair on them. Clark provided a business card containing the notation, \u201cHyattsville Chapter Izaak Walton League.\u201d The business card was allegedly from Nelson\u2019s briefcase, and the notation allegedly in Nelson\u2019s handwriting. Finally, Clark told counsel not only of the Donna Dustin murder, but also that in the fall of 1980, prior to her 1983 marriage to Nelson, he took her to a wooded area in Bowie, Maryland which he referred to as his \u201cshrine.\u201d At the \u201cshrine,\u201d Nelson asked Clark to lie on the ground and pose \u201cin some particular position.\u201d Clark, who was under the impression Nelson wanted her to pose in the nude, refused and walked away. Upon turning to look back, Clark saw Nelson masturbating.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Following receipt of this information, McLeod\u2019s attorney contacted Aeree who confirmed that Nelson stayed with her during the summer of 1987. Aeree stated that she owned a cat at the time and that Nelson owned a number of bandanas, most of them red. Aeree also confirmed that Nelson was a violent man, and that during the summer of 1987, he frequently used drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">As a result of this new information, on April 22, 2003 McLeod filed a motion in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to re-open his post-conviction proceedings. The motion requested that the court hold an evidentiary hearing regarding alleged <em>Brady </em>violations. McLeod argued that the State failed to disclose favorable and material information to the defense in the form of Clark\u2019s statements to Detective LaFoille. On September 4, 2003 the circuit court scheduled an evidentiary hearing. By order dated December 23, 2003, the court directed the State and PGPD to produce all witness statements taken in connection with the Roberson murder investigation. The only statements produced were created on or before February 1, 1988. The State confirmed that all evidence of the police investigation and all prosecution files created after that date had been lost or destroyed. The State did retain and produce witness statements taken in connection with its initial 1987 investigation into the Roberson murder, including the statement of Fike. Thus, in January of 2004, McLeod learned for the first time of Pamela Fike\u2019s statement that her brother had heard that \u201cthe Saunders\u201d were at Governor\u2019s Bridge Road on August 10, 1987, and that her brother had speculated that \u201cthe Saunders\u201d may have been involved in Roberson\u2019s murder because \u201cthey are the type that may do something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In January of 2004 the circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on McLeod\u2019s motion to re-open the post-conviction proceedings. The court heard testimony from, among others, McLeod, Clark, Aeree, Gwinn, Edgar and LaFoille. Testimony was also received from the Chief Investigator of the Anne Arundel County State\u2019s Attorneys Office, David Cordle. In the course of her continuing quest to learn of Nelson\u2019s whereabouts, Clark became aware that Cordle was interested in the 1973 murder of Donna Dustin. Besides the Roberson murder, Clark believed Nelson was involved in a number of other murders, and in late 1998 or early 1999 she had contacted Cordle to discuss the murders of Dustin and a woman named Jeany Kline. Clark contacted Cordle again in December of 2000, and on February 9, 2001 Cordle spoke with Detective LaFoille. At the hearing numerous inconsistencies emerged regarding the content of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>versations of each Clark and Cordle with LaFoille. <em>See infra </em>pp. 29-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In its July 11, 2004 statement of reasons, the circuit court concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9n\">[w]hen examining the totality of the circumstances and evidence presented at the hearing, as it relates to the credibility of Karen Clark and Detective Douglas LaFoille, the Court finds Detective LaFoille to be the more credible witness. Consequently, the Court finds further that no information linking Richard Nelson to the murder of Jacqueline Roberson was provided by Karen Clark to Detective LaFoille in the Fall of 1991 or at any time pertinent to the Defendant\u2019s claim ... [T]he Court finds that the statement of Pamela Sue Fike, although arguably favorable, was not provided to the defense. As to its materiality, however, it is non-existent and the Court so finds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\"><em>State v. McLeod, </em>No. CT92-0611X, slip op. at 25 (Md. Cir. Ct. Prince George\u2019s County June 11, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In the second \u00a7 2254 petition heard by the district court, McLeod contends that the circuit court unreasonably concluded that the State did not withhold exculpatory information in the form of Clark\u2019s statements to Detective LaFoille and erred as a matter of law in finding Fike\u2019s statement to be immaterial. On March 30, 2007, following a non-evidentiary hearing, the district court dismissed McLeod\u2019s petition by memorandum opinion. <em>McLeod, </em>482 F.Supp.2d 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of McLeod\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus <em>de novo.

The district court held, and the parties do not dispute, that McLeod could not have discovered Clark\u2019s alleged communication with Detective LaFoille prior to August of 2002. Similarly, McLeod had no means of discovering the existence of Fike\u2019s written statement prior to January of 2004 when it was produced by the State. The district court, therefore, correctly found that \u201cthe factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In order to \u201csqueeze through the narrow gateway\u201d created by \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B), <em>Felder v. McVicar, </em>113 F.3d 696, 698 (7th Cir.1997), McLeod was also required to prove to the district court that \u201cthe facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.\u201d \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). If McLeod failed to make such a showing, the district court was obliged to dismiss the petition without reaching the merits. Section 2244(b)(4) directs that \u201c[a] district court shall dismiss any claim presented in a second or successive application that the court of appeals has authorized to be filed unless the applicant shows that the claim satisfies the requirements of this section.\u201d <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 205 (4th Cir.2003) (\u201cWhen the application is thereafter submitted to the district court, that court must examine each claim and dismiss those that are barred under \u00a7 2244(b).... \u201d). Respect for the finality of criminal judgments provides the impetus for the heavy burden placed on successive \u00a7 2254 petitioners by \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(b)(ii). <em>See Calderon v. Thompson, </em>523 U.S. 538, 558, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998) (\u201cSection 2244(b) ... is grounded in respect for the finality of criminal judgments.\u201d). While noting this requirement, the district court proceeded to the merits of McLeod\u2019s petition without applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii) to the underlying facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Under \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii), a petitioner must not only show that reasonable doubt exists in light of the new evidence, but that no reasonable juror would have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the question initially to be resolved is, assuming the information allegedly disclosed by Clark to LaFoille had been turned over to the defense, and Fike\u2019s statement was also disclosed, whether this new evidence, viewed in conjunction with all the evidence, clearly and convincingly establishes that no reasonable fact finder would have found McLeod guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">In an attempt to shoulder his heavy burden and satisfy \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>McLeod characterizes the State\u2019s case at trial as extremely weak and entirely circumstantial. He first points to the fact that the initial charges against him were <em>nolle -prossed, </em>and contends that the evidence that was deemed insufficient when the initial charges were dropped in February of 1988, was the same evidence relied upon when he was indicted in April of 1992. McLeod also argues that the primary evidence relied upon by the State to tie him to Roberson\u2019s murder was the red bandana with cat hair on it, and the knife. According to McLeod, the defense, through Clark, would have established the following, taken verbatim from McLeod\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">\u2022 During the summer 1987, Nelson possessed <em>two </em>red WMZQ bandanas, one that he wore and one that he gave to his and Clark\u2019s minor son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">\u2022 During the summer 1987, Nelson demanded that Clark take the WMZQ red bandana from her son and return it to Nelson, and that Clark complied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">\u2022 Nelson possessed and wore on his belt a wood-handled knife with brass fittings on each end, matching <em>exactly </em>the description of the knife found at or near the crime scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">\u2022 During the summer 1987, Clark noticed that Nelson had a new knife and when she inquired what happened to old knife, he told her that he had \u201clost it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">\u2022 During the summer 1987, Nelson lived with a woman named Virginia Aeree, who has confirmed that she lived with Nelson and that she owned a cat having the <em>same </em>color fur as the cat hairs found on the red WMZQ bandana. Aeree also confirms that Nelson regularly wore red bandanas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">\u2022 Nelson had a long history of violence, particularly toward women, and during the summer 1987 was heavily using drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-11\">\u2022 Nelson took Clark to a wooded area in Bowie, Maryland, which Nelson call his \u201cshrine,\u201d and asked her to lie on the ground naked while he masturbated. This sexual practice is consistent with the crime scene evidence presented by the State, namely that Roberson disrobed <em>before </em>being stabbed, that her clothes were found folded underneath her body, and that there was no evidence of physical rape trauma or the presence of seminal fluid on or in the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-12\">\u2022 The wooded area Nelson referred to as his \u201cshrine\u201d is within three miles of where Roberson was murdered and is the very location where Dustin\u2019s nude and beaten body was found in 1973. Nelson admitted to Clark to having \u201cwailed on\u201d Dustin with a knife and accurately described injuries to Dustin that were never released to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-13\">\u2022 Nelson frequented a restaurant in Bowie, Maryland known as Rips and was known to spend a considerable amount of time there. Roberson, a school teacher, worked at Rips during the summer months as a waitress, thus providing a possible social nexus that never existed between the victim and any putative suspect, including McLeod.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-14\">\u2022 Nelson was a friend to Neil Vaughn, who acknowledged to police that he was in Izaac Walton Park on the day that Roberson was murdered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-15\">\u2022 Nelson possessed a business card on which he wrote the name of the park where Roberson was last seen waxing her car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">(McLeod\u2019s Opening Br. at 29-30) (emphasis in original). McLeod contends that had he been advised of the statements Clark says she made to LaFoille, the defense would have been able to \u201ctrain the beacon directed at McLeod upon Nelson\u201d who McLeod claims is the more likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>perpetrator of Roberson\u2019s murder. (McLeod\u2019s Reply Br. at 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The State argues that even assuming McLeod\u2019s factual allegations are true, they do not satisfy \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). While admitting that a red bandana with cat hair, and a knife, were part of the State\u2019s case at trial, the State argues that other evidence clearly implicated McLeod in Roberson\u2019s murder. That evidence being: when asked by his family the reason for his arrest following the Webb rape, McLeod replied that it was either rape or murder; Roberson was 28 years old when she was murdered, Webb was 15 at the time of her rape, and when informed of Webb\u2019s age following his arrest for her rape, McLeod responded by saying he thought she was older; when asked by his family to describe his victim\u2019s clothing, McLeod\u2019s description matched Roberson\u2019s blue clothing, not Webb\u2019s purple and white clothing; McLeod was placed in the vicinity of the murder the day it was committed by the pair of shorts smudged with the same brand of wax Roberson used to wax her car; and McLeod gave conflicting alibis to his step-father. (State\u2019s Resp. Br. at 22-24). In reply, McLeod notes that he waxed his step-father\u2019s race car frequently, and that none of the fingerprints on Roberson\u2019s car were his. He points out that the allegedly conflicting alibis were regarding his whereabouts the evening of August 10, 1987, while Roberson was murdered in the afternoon. McLeod characterizes his statement that he thought his victim was older as unremarkable and defensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">With respect to his victim\u2019s clothing, McLeod contends that the record does not support the inference the State sought to draw at trial. Yet, the evidence was as follows. The day of her rape, Webb was wearing a purple shirt and white shorts with thin red stripes. An evidence technician testified that at the time of her murder, Roberson was wearing a navy-blue t-shirt with the sleeves cut off, a white strapped t-shirt and a \u201cpair of light blue jeans.\u201d (J.A. at 190-91). McLeod\u2019s mother testified that McLeod indicated his victim was wearing \u201ca pullover and navy blue shorts.\u201d (J.A. at 119). McLeod\u2019s stepfather testified that McLeod \u201cmentioned blue. A blue outfit,\u201d and upon further questioning stated a \u201cblue pullover and blue shorts.\u201d (J.A. at 98-99). While not an exact description of Roberson\u2019s clothing, McLeod\u2019s response is more likely a description of Roberson\u2019s predominantly blue outfit as opposed to Webb\u2019s outfit of purple and white.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">McLeod attempts to diminish the incriminating force of his uncertainty regarding whether he had been arrested for rape or murder by noting that his mother testified he appeared disoriented at the Detention Center. Having been asked whether she visited McLeod at the Detention Center following his August 13, 1987 arrest, Mrs. Bricker testified: \u201cWe did. And there was a lot of confusion during that time.\u201d (J.A. at 117). She also testified that when McLeod was asked what he had been arrested for, McLeod \u201casked was it murder, was it rape or what? He seemed very confused.\u201d (J.A. at 118). McLeod, though, was not a suspect in the Roberson murder until August 15, 1987, when his mother provided Detective Edgar with his wax smudged shorts. McLeod\u2019s being \u201cconfused\u201d does not explain away the incriminating fact that he included murder, along with rape, as a possible reason for what was his rape arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The only mention of the effect of Fike\u2019s statement on the \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii) inquiry is the State\u2019s contention that its limited evidentiary value is self-evident. Fike\u2019s statement regarding what her brother told her, which was what someone else told him \u2014 namely, that the Saunders were at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Governor\u2019s Bridge Road on the date that Roberson was murdered \u2014 is the epitome of inadmissible hearsay. <em>See </em>Md. R. Evid. 5-802. McLeod has offered no evidence that \u201cthe Saunders\u201d were involved in the Roberson murder, and the mere speculation of Fike\u2019s brother that the Saunders \u201care the type that may do something like that\u201d is sheer conjecture. The circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the materiality of Fike\u2019s statement is \u201cnon-existent\u201d is supported by the fanciful nature of the statement. <em>McLeod, </em>No. CT92-0611X, slip op. at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Undoubtedly, accepting Clark\u2019s assertions regarding what she told Detective LaFoille in the fall of 1991 as true, and assuming that the information had been turned over to the defense, McLeod could have attempted to show that Nelson murdered Roberson. That a jury would have been convinced that Nelson was the perpetrator, and McLeod was not involved, is far from a foregone conclusion. Even assuming Clark\u2019s testimony was believed, it would not negate the several incriminating statements made by McLeod at the Detention Center. Still, a reasonable juror may well have found that the evidence regarding Nelson created enough doubt as to McLeod\u2019s guilt to acquit him. This, however, does not satisfy \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). McLeod\u2019s burden was to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that no reasonable juror would have found him guilty; not merely that it is conceivable that he could have been acquitted. The evidence that would have been received at trial as a result of the information Clark claims to have conveyed to LaFoille does present an alternative theory of Roberson\u2019s murder. Yet, as the state has pointed out, it would not have rebutted or called into question much of the State\u2019s case against McLeod.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Even accepting as proven fact the evidence allegedly provided by Clark, and that to which it leads, such evidence would be insufficient, when viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable juror would have found the defendant guilty. McLeod thus failed to satisfy \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii) and dismissal of his petition was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Had McLeod\u2019s petition satisfied \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii), dismissal was nevertheless appropriate on the merits. Under the AEDPA,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-11\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-13\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">Turning first to \u00a7 2254(d)(2), McLeod contends that the conclusion of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County that the State did not withhold evidence favorable to him, consisting of Karen Clark\u2019s alleged statements to Detective LaFoille, was an objectively unreasonable determination of the facts. In reaching its conclusion, the circuit court was presented with a pure question of fact that centered primarily on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>whether Clark or LaFoille was the more credible witness. If, consistent with her testimony, Clark conveyed the information regarding Nelson to LaFoille, the State likely violated McLeod\u2019s due process rights under <em>Brady, </em>if not, no <em>Brady </em>violation occurred. But the question presented for review is a narrow one. It is whether, applying the \u00a7 2254 framework, it was objectively unreasonable for the circuit court to conclude that Clark did not convey the information regarding Nelson to LaFoille in the fall of 1991 and, as a consequence, to disregard Clark\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">In the context of federal habeas challenges to state court judgments, \u201ca determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d \u00a7 2254(e)(1). <em>See Cagle v. Branker, </em>520 F.3d 320, 323 (4th Cir.2008). Discussing federal court collateral review of state court factual determinations under \u00a7 2254(d)(2), and noting federalism\u2019s call for deference, the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell </em>stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">[fjactual determinations by state courts are presumed correct absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, \u00a7 2254(e)(1), and a decision adjudicated on the merits in a state court and based on a factual determination will not be overturned on factual grounds unless objectively unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the state-court proceeding, \u00a7 2254(d)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">537 U.S. 322, 340, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Deference, however, does not imply abandonment or abdication of judicial review and does not by definition preclude relief. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cA federal court can disagree with a state court\u2019s credibility determination and, when guided by AED-PA, conclude the decision was unreasonable or that the factual premise was incorrect by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">At the circuit court\u2019s hearing on McLeod\u2019s motion to reopen the post-conviction proceedings, LaFoille testified that \u201ceverything and anything\u201d was done to locate Nelson in the fall of 1991. (J.A. at 1041). LaFoille also testified that he did not recall meeting Clark. Clark, however, saved two message slips, dated October 14th and 22nd of 1991, both evidencing LaFoille\u2019s attempts to contact Clark. One of the message slips contains LaFoille\u2019s contact information, which he testified was both accurate and in his handwriting. It is undisputed, therefore, that some interaction between Clark and LaFoille occurred. McLeod argues that the circuit court\u2019s conclusion was unreasonable because there was no conflict between Clark\u2019s testimony that she provided LaFoille with the information regarding Nelson, and LaFoille\u2019s testimony that he did not recall meeting Clark. But simply because Clark claims to have told LaFoille certain information, which he does not recall receiving, does not mean that Clark in fact conveyed the information. It is just as likely, as the circuit court found, that LaFoille does not remember receiving the information because Clark never conveyed it to him. Indeed, if Clark did not in the fall of 1991 inform LaFoille of the bandanas and knives that she connects in a variety of ways to Nelson, it makes sense that Detective LaFoille would not, twelve years later, recall meeting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In late 1998 or early 1999, after seeing a reference to Investigator Cordle\u2019s investigation into the death of Donna Dustin on the Bowie High School website, Clark called Cordle to discuss the deaths of Dustin, and another murder victim, Jeany Kline. During the call, Clark asked Cordle to describe the cause of Kline\u2019s death. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Cordle, however, was not familiar with the details of the Kline murder which had occurred outside his jurisdiction. While nothing came of this initial call by Clark, Cordle testified that Clark was interested in locating her ex-husband, Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Clark contacted Cordle again on December 6, 2000. According to Cordle\u2019s testimony, during a December 7, 2000 meeting, Clark was once again interested in locating Nelson because Clark believed Nelson had been involved in Dustin\u2019s murder and because \u201cshe wanted some resolution of what may have happened to him.\u201d (J.A. at 905). Following this December 7th meeting, Cordle and Clark were in contact hundreds of times. Throughout the course of their communications, Clark conveyed a great deal of information pertaining to her belief that Nelson was involved in a number of murders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Some of the information provided by Clark to Cordle implicated Nelson in certain murders in the Bowie, Maryland area, particularly Dustin\u2019s. Regarding Nelson\u2019s involvement in the Roberson murder, Cordle testified, \u201cI don\u2019t recall her saying that he admitted to being involved.\u201d (J.A. at 910).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">At some point between December of 2000 and February of 2001 Clark told Cordle that in October of 1991 LaFoille attempted to contact her seeking to locate Nelson. However, despite Cordle\u2019s testimony that Clark was very open and detail oriented in discussing her attempts to locate Nelson and determine his involvement in the various murders, Cordle never testified that Clark told him that she provided LaFoille any information regarding Nelson\u2019s involvement in the Roberson murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">At Clark\u2019s behest, Cordle called LaFoille at his home in Michigan on February 9, 2001. According to Cordle, during their conversation, LaFoille \u201cstated that when he retired he may have taken a couple of boxes [of notes] and some personal records with him when he moved out to the Midwest.\u201d (J.A. at 879). During cross-examination, LaFoille testified that he made no such assertion and that his reference to files during the conversation was to files in Maryland. Cordle\u2019s notes of the February 9th conversation read, \u201cJW [Jimmy Weidemeyer] was <em>very </em>tight with Nelson.\u201d (J.A. at 1299).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> LaFoille denied making such a statement. There were other contacts, or attempted contacts, between Cordle and LaFoille, but their extent and existence are disputed. Cordle testified that LaFoille did not return two of his phone calls, made in March and April of 2001, and further that he spoke with LaFoille at some point between February and April of 2001, but made no record of the conversation because LaFoille informed him that he was too busy to search for records regarding Nelson. LaFoille, however, testified that he returned all of Cordle\u2019s phone calls. Ultimately, the circuit court conceded that it was \u201cperplexed by the discrepancies between the testimony of Detective LaFoille and that of Investigator Cordle.\u201d <em>McLeod, </em>No. CT92-0611X, slip op. at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">McLeod maintains that the inconsistencies between LaFoille\u2019s testimony and that of Cordle, and other witnesses, rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>all of LaFoille\u2019s testimony unreliable. While there were discrepancies between the testimony of LaFoille and Cordle, these discrepancies do not render unreliable that which LaFoille said. Even if LaFoille told Cordle that he \u201cmay\u201d have documents pertaining to the Roberson case, this does not mean that he did have them. Indeed, Cordle\u2019s notes of the February 9, 2001 conversation, upon which McLeod relies in arguing that Cordle, not LaFoille, accurately testified to the content of that conversation, make no reference to LaFoille\u2019s possession of notes or files. Further, as found by the circuit court, LaFoille\u2019s testimony was bolstered by the testimony of Detective Edgar and Gwinn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">Detective Robert Edgar, to whom Detective LaFoille reported, testified that he never heard of Karen Clark before the matter herein was filed. As the lead investigator, he was also actively involved in the search for Richard Nelson, and in the course of his interviews with Mr. Nelson\u2019s acquaintances and family members, no one directed him to, or even mentioned, Karen Clark. Similarly, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Laura Gwinn had not heard of Karen Clark prior to the filing of this Motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><em>McLeod, </em>No. CT92-0611X, slip op. at 20-21 (internal citation omitted). Finally, while any discrepancies between the testimony of Cordle and LaFoille may bear on LaFoille\u2019s credibility, his credibility alone is not dispositive of whether Clark, in fact, conveyed the information regarding Nelson to him in the fall of 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">After healing Clark\u2019s testimony, in its statement of reasons, the circuit court found that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">From her testimony, it is clear to this Court that Ms. Clark is fixated on her former husband, his whereabouts, and his actions over approximately the past twenty-five years. Ms. Clark\u2019s continued focus on Mr. Nelson, whom she has admittedly not seen sinee 1989, seems to have emerged with single-minded determination in 1998 when she initially contacted Investigator Cordle, some seven years after her alleged conversations with Detective LaFoille.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-9\"><em>McLeod, </em>No. CT92-0611X, slip op. at 18. One need only look to Clark\u2019s testimony to see the reasonableness of the circuit court\u2019s finding. Clark\u2019s description of Nelson\u2019s courtship of her is of interest. She testified that prior to them marriage, though the two never dated. Nelson stalked and beat her. According to Clark, the reason she married and subsequently had a child with Nelson was because \u201c[h]e threatened to murder my family if I didn\u2019t.\u201d (J.A. at 959). Yet, despite this brutality, Clark repeatedly testified to her desire to locate Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">Clark testified that after LaFoille contacted her in the fall of 1991, she met with him on three occasions and spoke with him on the telephone several times. According to Clark, the first face-to-face meeting occurred when LaFoille came to Clark\u2019s place of work, the McEldon Library at the University of Maryland, and the two spoke for two hours. It is during this time that Clark claims to have informed LaFoille of much of the evidence McLeod contends implicates Nelson in the Roberson murder. Clark submitted an affidavit stating, and she testified that, in October of 1991 she accompanied LaFoille to the police station to look at photographs. During the third alleged meeting, Clark claims to have provided LaFoille with Nelson\u2019s address book, which she obtained in 1987. According to Clark, the address book was never returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">Despite Clark\u2019s testimony that she met with LaFoille on three occasions, once for two hours, she could not recall his height. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>(J.A. at 947). In a February 2001 email to LaFoille, Clark wrote,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">I don\u2019t know if you remember me, but you came to see me in College Park to ask some questions about my ex-husband ... which were somehow related to a case you were investigating about a woman that was murdered at Allen\u2019s Pond. I don\u2019t remember what year that was, but Rick has been missing since Sept. 1989. I was wondering if you ever managed to locate Rick, etc. I also remember discussing with you his relationship to some older members of the Pagan Motorcycle gang in Bowie as well as some other issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">(J.A. at 1129). McLeod argued to the circuit court that LaFoille\u2019s response to the email, \u201cI remember a lot of what you are talking about,\u201d (id), proves he remembered speaking with Clark. As noted by the circuit court, however, LaFoille\u2019s response does not necessarily show he remembered meeting Clark. In any event, acknowledging that Clark and LaFoille spoke to each other at some point does not compel the conclusion that Clark disclosed the information regarding Nelson as she now claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Of all of Clark\u2019s assertions, perhaps the most notable is her belated description of Nelson\u2019s behavior at what he referred to as \u201cthe shrine.\u201d While the shrine was purportedly in relation to the murder of Dustin, not Roberson, Clark\u2019s story is consistent with the lack of semen in or on Roberson\u2019s person, and the fact she was not vaginally or anally penetrated. Yet, despite her claim that she divulged a mass of information regarding Nelson in the fall of 1991, Clark, by her own admission, inexplicably neglected to inform LaFoille of what occurred when she and Nelson visited the shrine in the fall of 1980. (J.A. at 938-39, 958). Clark\u2019s first mention of the shrine was to Cordle at some point after she contacted him a second time on December 6, 2000. While Nelson\u2019s alleged behavior at the shrine is consistent with Roberson\u2019s injuries, Clark could have fabricated the story after learning the details of Roberson\u2019s murder through the media or other sources. It is also possible that Nelson was somehow involved in the Roberson murder. But inculpation of Nelson does not necessarily exculpate McLeod. At trial the State argued that McLeod may not have acted alone in murdering Roberson, and evidence of Nelson\u2019s involvement in the murder does not negate the other evidence incriminating McLeod. Finally, on cross examination in 2004, Clark suddenly recalled that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">[sjhortly before he [Nelson] went missing, my last phone call with him was basically that he had information about this [the Roberson] case. Although, nothing specifically, he didn\u2019t say the name. Although he said a woman murdered in Bowie up by Allen\u2019s Pond and that people were going to try and kill him because of what he knew.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">(J.A. at 955). Yet, this critical, and damning, piece of information was omitted from Clark\u2019s affidavit, which was executed over a year earlier on August 23, 2002, describing the information she possessed implicating Nelson in the murders of Dustin, Kline and Roberson.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">Based on its conclusion that LaFoille, not Clark, was the more credible witness, the circuit court found that McLeod failed to demonstrate that the State withheld evidence favorable to him in violation of <em>Brady. </em>Rejecting McLeod\u2019s contention that the circuit court\u2019s finding was objectively unreasonable under \u00a7 2254(d)(2) and (e)(1), the district court stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">this court is not persuaded that the state court\u2019s findings, and in particular its determinations of credibility of the witnesses, can be called \u201cunreasonable\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard in light of the entirety of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings .... As the fact finder, the state court weighed the credibility of the witnesses, and undertook to resolve the many conflicts in the evidence. After considering all the testimonial and documentary evidence presented, the state court concluded that LaFoille\u2019s testimony, as supported by that of his supervisor Edgar, was more credible than, and should .be weighed more significantly than, that of Clark.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><em>McLeod, </em>482 F.Supp.2d at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Like the instant appeal, <em>Cagle v. Branker </em>involved review of a district court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition challenging the credibility determination of a state court. Affirming, this court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2v\">for a federal habeas court to overturn a state court\u2019s credibility judgments, the state court\u2019s error must be stark and clear. Indeed, \u201cfederal habeas courts [have] no license to redetermine credibility of witnesses whose demeanor has been observed by the state trial court, but not by them.\u201d <em>Marshall v. Lonberger, </em>459 U.S. 422, 434, 103 S.Ct. 843, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\"><em>Cagle, </em>520 F.3d at 324 (internal citation omitted). While the evidence does not compel the credibility determination reached by the state court, it certainly provides a sufficient basis for purposes of section 2254(d)(2) to support such a determination. See <em>Wilson v. Ozmint, </em>352 F.3d 847, 860 (4th Cir.2003). The circuit court witnessed first hand the testimony of Clark, LaFoille, Cordle and the other witnesses and the circuit court\u2019s statement of reasons provides a thorough review of that testimony. In deeming LaFoille the more credible witness, the circuit court did not act unreasonably, let alone commit \u201cstark and clear error.\u201d This being the case, the presumption of correctness mandated by \u00a7 2254(e)(1) stands unrebutted. McLeod has failed to show that the circuit court\u2019s factual finding resulted in a decision based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence as required by \u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">With respect to \u00a7 2254(d)(1), McLeod argues that the circuit court erred as a matter of law in finding Fike\u2019s written statement to be immaterial under <em>Brady. See supra </em>p. 25. As this court has noted, \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u201cis quite deferential.\u201d <em>Moseley v. Branker, </em>550 F.3d 312, 319 (4th Cir.2008). To be entitled to relief, a petitioner must show that \u201cthe state court decision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Polk, </em>438 F.3d 350, 354-55 (4th Cir.2006) (citing \u00a7 2254(d)(1)). A decision is contrary to clearly established federal law \u201cif the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by th[e] [Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than th[e] [Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court unreasonably applies clearly established federal law if it \u201cidentifies the correct governing legal principle from th[e] [Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The circuit court committed no such error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">For purposes of <em>Brady, </em>evidence withheld by the state is material \u201cif there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). While finding the statement \u201cat least arguably favorable to the defense,\u201d the circuit court determined that \u201cthe justification for Ms. Fike\u2019s brother\u2019s suspicion, that being \u2018they are the type that may do something like that,\u2019 strains the Court\u2019s ability to conclude that such information could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict, and the Court declines to do so.\u201d <em>McLeod, </em>No. CT92-0611X, slip op. at 11-12. Thus, after identifying the appropriate legal standard, the circuit court concluded that Fike\u2019s statement was not material. The district court correctly found this conclusion not to be an unreasonable application of federal law as determined by the Supreme Court, and rightly left the decision of the circuit court undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">McLeod\u2019s second \u00a7 2254 petition was appropriately dismissed because it failed to satiate the demanding threshold requirement of \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). Even had \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii) been met, McLeod failed to show that the circuit court made an unreasonable factual determination under \u00a7 2254(d)(2), or unreasonably applied federal law under \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Accordingly, the judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\">. Nelson was in a relationship and had a child with a woman named Virginia Aeree who testified to the circuit court on January 13, 2004 that during the summer of 1987, Nelson occasionally stayed with her at her apartment in Frederick, Maryland.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\">.

Clark also contacted the police in an attempt to establish Nelson's role in the death of several people she claims Nelson mentioned were buried on a farm in Mitchville, Maryland.
