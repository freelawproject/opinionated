The sentence was 78 months above the advisory guideline maximum sentence of 162 months. The court characterized the sentence as both a departure based on Grant\u2019s extensive criminal history under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 and as a variance based 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), citing the need for more effective deterrence and to protect the public from Grant\u2019s criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The court noted that Grant had \u201ca criminal history that ranks about as high as anybody [the court had] seen in over 16 years.\u201d The court also cited Grant\u2019s violations of supervised release, his fugitive status in 2007, his use of numerous aliases, and the failure of repeated incarceration and drug treatment to modify Grant\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">We review the sentence for plain error because Grant did not raise in the district court any of the objections he raises on appeal, including any objection to the reasonableness of the sentence. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 625, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Under plain error review, we have discretion to reverse only if there was a clear and obvious error that affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and that seriously affected \u201cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">To determine the reasonableness of a sentence, we \u201cfirst ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">\u201cIf reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.\u201d \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1). Grant\u2019s criminal history score was 23, 10 points above the threshold for the highest Criminal History Category of VI. A criminal history score above the Category VI threshold is a valid basis for an upward departure. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 491-92 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 328 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">The presentence report also recounted several unscored offenses. Grant\u2019s unscored convictions were an additional valid basis for the upward departure. <em>See United States v. Pennington, </em>9 F.3d 1116, 1118 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-16\">Grant\u2019s contentions that the court improperly based the sentence on factual error or the improper weighing of factors are neither significant nor supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the record. Contrary to those contentions, Grant\u2019s sentence could be based on nonviolent conduct and juvenile offenses. <em>See Lee, </em>858 F.3d at 329 (affirming departure based on nonviolent offenses); <em>Pennington, </em>9 F.3d at 1118 (same); <em>see also United States v. Carpenter, </em>963 F.2d 736, 744 (5th Cir.1992) (affirming upward departure based in part on juvenile offenses). Because the court based the departure on acceptable factors, it committed no procedural error. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Smith, </em>417 F.3d at 490 &amp; n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The extent of a variance is a facet of the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. We \u201cgive due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Grant contends that the court gave too much weight to the need to deter future criminal conduct and to protect the public. He asserts that \u201chis maturity is a sign that he will not engage in similarly dangerous conduct in the future.\u201d The record reveals no evidence of maturity or reform. Moreover, there is no support for Grant\u2019s suggestion that deterrence is a valid sentencing rationale only if it is needed specifically to protect the public from violence. The extent of the variance or departure was not unreasonable. <em>See Smith, </em>417 F.3d at 492 &amp; n. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Grant has failed to show that his sentence was unreasonable. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
