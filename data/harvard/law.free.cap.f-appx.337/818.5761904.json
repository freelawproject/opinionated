The notice informed appellant, in conformance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(a)(2)(B), that he had 35 days from the date the notice was mailed to file a claim to the currency,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> verified as required by Rule G(5)(b) of the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions (Supplemental Rules), and that if he filed a claim, he had 20 days after doing so to file an answer to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Appellant responded to the notice, which the district court\u2019s clerk docketed on April 16, 2008, and claimed an interest in the currency at issue; on August 11, the district court issued a notice deeming the response a \u201cclaim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">On August 18, the Government informed appellant that he lacked statutory standing to contest the forfeiture because he had not filed his claim within 35 days of February 27; nor had he verified the claim, as required by Rule G(5). Appellant, in turn, responded by letter dated August 25, again claiming the currency, but he did not answer the complaint. The Government therefore moved to strike appellant\u2019s claim, and the district court ordered appellant to respond to the Government\u2019s motion by October 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Appellant failed to respond, so, on October 17, the court granted the Government\u2019s motion to strike. However, appellant had mailed a response on October 9, and the clerk docketed it later in the day of October 17. The court therefore deemed the response a motion for reconsideration, and concluding that appellant had not complied with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(a)(4)(A) or Rule G(5)(b), denied the motion. Appellant now appeals the court\u2019s decision, arguing that he complied with the filing rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">Section 983(a)(4) and the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture (\u201cSupplemental Rules\u201d) govern civil forfeiture actions and establish the statutory standing requirements for contesting forfeiture. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983; Rule G(l) of the Supplemental Rules; <em>United States v. $38,000.00 Dollars in U.S. Currency, </em>816 F.2d 1538, 1544-45 (11th Cir.1987). Under Rule G(5) of the Supplemental Rules, claimants are required to file both a verified claim asserting their interest in the seized property<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and an answer to the government\u2019s forfeiture complaint. To be timely, the answer to the complaint must be filed \u201cwithin 20 days after filing the claim.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although a district court has discretion to extend the filing period, it may also insist on strict compliance with the Supplemental Rules. <em>United States v. $125,938.62, </em>370 F.3d 1325, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see $38,000.00 Dollars in U.S. Currency, </em>816 F.2d at 1547 (noting that courts consistently require claimants to strictly comply with the Supplemental Rules).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>We have emphasized that claimants must strictly adhere to the procedural requirements of the Supplemental Rules to achieve statutory standing to contest a forfeiture action. <em>See $38,000.00 Dollars in U.S. Currency, </em>816 F.2d at 1545; <em>$125,938.62, </em>370 F.3d at 1328. Moreover, under the Supplemental Rules, the government may move to strike a forfeiture claim at any time before trial for failure to comply with Rule G(5) or for lack of standing. Rule G(8)(c) of the Supplemental Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Because appellant failed timely to file an answer to the Government\u2019s complaint, the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking his claim and subsequently denying his motion for reconsideration. The district court was entitled to insist upon strict compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in Rule G(5) and, thus, to strike appellant\u2019s claim for lack of statutory standing to contest the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-18\">.
