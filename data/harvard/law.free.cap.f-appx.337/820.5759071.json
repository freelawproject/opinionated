On appeal, Grider challenges the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 to his base offense level, alleging that, as a matter of policy, it unfairly establishes equal punishments for possession of ammunition and possession of a firearm. In the alternative, Grider contends the district court should have downwardly departed or varied from the Guideline range based on this unfair punishment scheme and his personal circumstances and history and that the court\u2019s refusal to do so reflected an improper \u201cpresumption of reasonableness\u201d for the Guideline range. We find no merit to either of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">Grider argues that the district court erred by applying \u00a7 2K2.1 in determining his base offense level because it failed to distinguish between possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition in spite of the court\u2019s acknowledgment that there was \u201ccertainly\u201d a difference between the two. Grider asserts that under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the district court could have disregarded \u00a7 2K2.1 based on a policy disagreement with equating firearms and ammunition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-16\">In <em>United States v. Vazquez, </em>558 F.3d 1224 (11th Cir.2009), we held that <em>Kimbrough </em>addressed only a district court\u2019s discretion to vary from the Guidelines \u201cbased on a disagreement with Guideline, not Congressional, policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1229. In this case, however, Congress explicitly prohibits a felon from possessing either ammunition <em>or </em>a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and possession of either subjects a defendant to the same penalties, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number><em>generally </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a). In order to effectuate this congressional policy, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 governs sentencing for unlawful receipt, possession, <em>or </em>transportation of both a firearm or ammunition. Although it retained its full discretion to deviate from the Guidelines based upon the unique circumstances of Grider\u2019s case, the district court did not err in declining to disregard \u00a7 2K2.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">We generally lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure, unless the district court incorrectly believed that it lacked the statutory authority to depart from the Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Norris, </em>452 F.3d 1275, 1282 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court believed it lacked authority to depart. <em>United States v. Holden, </em>61 F.3d 858, 860 (11th Cir.1995). When nothing in the record indicates otherwise, we assume that the sentencing court understood it had authority to depart downward. <em>United States v. Chase, </em>174 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">In this case, the court correctly determined Grider\u2019s Guideline range, and we see no indication in the record that the court mistakenly believed that it lacked the authority to depart downward. Although the district judge did indicate that he felt \u201cobliged to apply [the] Guideline\u201d in spite of his agreement with Grider that there is a difference between possessing a gun and possessing ammunition, this statement goes to the court\u2019s (accurate) understanding that it lacked discretion to disregard a federal statute, namely 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), which prohibits possession of both a firearm and ammunition, or \u00a7 924(a), which provides punishment for the violation of \u00a7 922(g). However, it does not demonstrate a mistaken belief that the court lacked the discretion to depart downward based on other factors unique to the defendant or his situation. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision not to downwardly depart from the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">Our review of the district court\u2019s decision not to grant Grider a \u201cvariance\u201d from the Guidelines, as opposed to a departure, is more appropriately considered a review of the reasonableness of the court\u2019s sentence in light of the sentencing factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>560 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11th Cir.2009). We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Specifically, we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-12\">must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as manda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>tory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 597, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Although district courts must consider the Guidelines as one of several \u00a7 3553 factors, district courts may not presume that a sentence within the Guidelines range is reasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 350-52, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Our review of the sentencing transcript in this case demonstrates that the district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and did not erroneously apply a presumption of reasonableness to the Guidelines range. Indeed, the court specifically noted that it was required to consider \u00a7 3553(a) \u201cto find a sentence that\u2019s reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances\u201d and that it believed that a 30-month sentence was reasonable and appropriate. The court indicated that it had considered Grider\u2019s personal history and characteristics, a psychiatric report on Grider\u2019s alleged mental deficiencies, and Grider\u2019s extensive criminal history before arriving at the sentence imposed. The court also considered a letter from Grider\u2019s mother suggesting that Grider\u2019s criminal history was a result of \u201cthe environment in which lives\u201d but determined that much of Grider\u2019s past conduct was not excusable simply based upon environmental factors. We therefore find that the district court\u2019s denial of Grider\u2019s request for a variance and imposition of a 30-month sentence were reasonable light of the facts and circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-7\">. In addition, we may review a refusal to grant a downward departure to the extent that it was based on a possible misinterpretation or misapplication of the Guidelines' directives regarding such departures. <em>United States v. Castellanos, </em>904 F.2d 1490, 1497 (11th Cir. 1990). However, Ward does not argue that the court misapplied or misinterpreted a provision of the Guidelines related to downward departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\">. Grider bore the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was enlitled to the departure. <em>United States v. Stuart, </em>384 F.3d 1243, 1246 (11th Cir.2004). Any \"factor which removes the case from the heartland of the Guidelines and warrants a downward departure must be supported by evidence in the record.\" <em>Id.) see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 (providing that a district court has the authority to depart downward only if it finds an aggravating or mitigating circumstance \"not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the Guidelines ...\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
