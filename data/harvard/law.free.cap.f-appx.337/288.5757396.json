The sealed indictment was issued December 18, 2006, and a warrant for Williamson\u2019s arrest was issued the following day. In January 2007, a confidential informant, acting in concert with law enforcement agents, met with Williamson while wearing a recording and transmitting device. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>conclusion of the meeting, law enforcement attempted to arrest Williamson on the outstanding warrant; however, he successfully evaded arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Williamson was eventually apprehended and arraigned on June 12, 2007, and received court-appointed counsel. However, Williamson retained counsel who entered his appearance the following week. Williamson\u2019s case was called for jury selection on August 13, 2007. On that date, Williamson informed the court that, during the preceding weekend, he had retained different counsel and wanted his first retained attorney dismissed. After substitute retained counsel indicated that he was prepared to try Williamson\u2019s case two days after jury selection, the district court granted Williamson\u2019s motion to dismiss his first retained counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">At the conclusion of his jury trial, Williamson was convicted of the sole count in the indictment. Williamson was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">On appeal, Williamson first claims the district court erred in admitting the recording of his meeting with the confidential informant. Williamson\u2019s claim is raised for the first time on appeal and is therefoi*e reviewed for plain error. Plain error requires Williamson to establish that: (1) there was error; (2) the error was \u201cplain;\u201d and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Even if he makes this showing, \u201cRule 52(b) leaves the decision to correct the forfeited error within the sound discretion of the court of appeals, and the court should not exercise that discretion unless the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (internal quotations omitted)). Williamson fails to establish that error occurred or that any error was \u201cplain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Williamson argues that, because a sealed indictment had been issued against him, introduction of his recorded conversation with ah informant acting at the direction of law enforcement officers violated his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. In support for his argument, Williamson relies principally on <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964), and <em>Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977). Williamson cites <em>Brewer </em>for the proposition that \u201c[wjhatever else it may mean, the right to counsel granted by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments means at least that a person is entitled to the help of a lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against him \u2018whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment\u2019.\u201d <em>Brewer, </em>430 U.S. at 398, 97 S.Ct. 1232 (quoting <em>Kirby v. Illinois, </em>406 U.S. 682, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">However, Williamson\u2019s selective quotation of <em>Brewer </em>fails to support his position. The State in <em>Brewer </em>did not contest the fact that judicial proceedings had begun against the defendant when he was questioned by the police without counsel present. <em>Brewer, </em>430 U.S. at 399, 97 S.Ct. 1232. Therefore, the question of precisely when judicial proceedings are instituted against a defendant was not before the Court. <em>See Michigan v. Jackson, </em>475 U.S. 625, 629, 106 S.Ct. 1404, 89 L.Ed.2d 631 (1986) (stating that the arraignment signals the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings and thus the attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel) (internal quotations omitted). Moreover, <em>Brewer </em>and <em>Massiah </em>are factually distinct from Williamson\u2019s case as officers in both cases interrogated the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>dants after their respective arraignments. <em>Brewer, </em>430 U.S. at 390-92, 97 S.Ct. 1232; <em>Massiah, </em>377 U.S. at 202, 84 S.Ct. 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In contrast, at the time of Williamson\u2019s conversation with the informant, all that had occurred was the issuance of a sealed indictment and arrest warrant. This court has held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not attach even after a defendant has been arrested based on the filing of a criminal complaint nor is the right triggered during the period between a defendant\u2019s arrest and his arraignment. <em>United States v. Alvarado, </em>440 F.3d 191, 200 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. D'Anjou, </em>16 F.3d 604, 608 (4th Cir.1994). Accordingly, in light of <em>Alvarado </em>and <em>D'Anjou, </em>Williamson fails to demonstrate any error by the district court in admitting the recording of his conversation with the informant or that any such error was \u201cplain\u201d or \u201cclear\u201d under current law. <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>1 F.3d 1430, 1435 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Williamson next contends that the district court abused its discretion by requiring his substitute retained counsel to go forward with the trial two days after he was retained in exchange for granting Williamson\u2019s motion to withdraw his first retained counsel. Williamson appears to allege that the district court abused its discretion by denying his implicit motion for a continuance. Williamson\u2019s argument is without merit. First, both attorneys expressed to the district court that they were prepared to try Williamson\u2019s case two days after jury selection. Additionally, the facts in the record, including that Williamson did not request substitute counsel until the day of jury selection, indicate simply an eleventh hour attempt at delay by a defendant wishing to avoid having to face a potential life sentence. Therefore, the district court did not err in granting Williamson\u2019s motion to substitute counsel and denying Williamson\u2019s implicit motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Finally, Williamson suggests his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal unless the record conclusively establishes that counsel provided ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.2006). The record here does not conclusively establish trial counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Accordingly, we deny Williamson\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief and affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument as the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"Aae\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
