The district court granted Williams\u2019s motion and sentenced him to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was the bottom of the amended guideline range. On appeal, Williams argues that the district court should have sentenced him below the amended guideline range because the Sentencing Guidelines now are advisory under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny. He also argues that the district court failed to show that it considered the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in resentencing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-27\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number><em>James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). Although a district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, an exception lies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag2\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, <em>if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Furthermore, a district court \u201cshall not reduce\u201d a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment \u201cto a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"AxV\">Effective November 1, 2007, Amendment 706 adjusted downward by two levels the base offense level assigned to each threshold quantity of crack cocaine listed in the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 706 (2007) . Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, as amended by Amendment 713, is retroactively applicable and, therefore, may be the basis for a \u00a7 3582 motion. U.S.S.G. Supp. to App. C, amends. 706, 713 (2008) .</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Proceedings under \u00a7 3582 do not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Rather, \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Resentencing pursuant to a \u00a7 3582 motion includes two steps. First, the district court must \u201csubstitute the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range and determine what sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). Second, if the guideline range is lowered by the amended guideline section, the court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether, and to what extent, to reduce the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>In this second step, the amended guideline range in a \u00a7 3582 proceeding is not advisory under <em>Booker, </em>and a district court may not sentence a defendant lower than the amended guideline range. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">With regard to the district court\u2019s explanation of its decision whether, and to what extent, a \u00a7 3582 reduction is warranted, \u201ca district court commits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the [\u00a7 ] 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997); see also <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254 (11th Cir.2009) (vacating and remanding where a district court\u2019s order granting \u00a7 3582 relief did not make clear whether it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">The district court did not err in failing to consider the amended guideline range advisory and refusing to sentence Williams below the range. Additionally, although the district court failed to state explicitly that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>the record is sufficient to conclude that it did do so, given that the same judge presided over the original sentencing and the \u00a7 3582 proceeding, and the judge reduced the original sentence. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Williams to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, as that was the bottom of the amended guideline range, and the district court had no authority to sentence Williams any lower.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no error, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-23\">. Williams\u2019s request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
