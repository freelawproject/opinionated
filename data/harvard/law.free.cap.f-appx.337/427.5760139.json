Oliva-Macias argues that the district court\u2019s written judgment of revocation conflicts with its oral pronouncement of sentence. The Government agrees but argues that the error is harmless. Because the parties had no opportunity at sentencing to consider or object to the written judgment, we review for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-19\">Oliva-Macias pleaded true at his revocation hearing to violating the terms of his supervised release by illegally reentering the United States in May 2008. The district court consequently revoked Oliva-Maeias\u2019s term of supervised release and imposed a 12-month term of imprisonment. At the same hearing, the district court sentenced Oliva-Macias to a 24-month term of imprisonment for his guilty plea conviction for the May 2008 illegal reentry, which was a separate proceeding. The district court agreed to recommend that Oliva-Macias be placed in the prison facility in Eden, Texas, but this recommendation did not appear in the written judgment for the revocation sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-20\">If a written entry of judgment conflicts with an oral pronouncement at a sentencing hearing, the oral pronouncement controls. <em>Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d at 381, 383. Accordingly, because the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence conflicts with its written judgment with regard to the district court\u2019s recommendation that Oliva-Macias be placed at the facility in Eden, Texas, the case is remanded for the district court to amend the written judgment to conform to the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>States v.
