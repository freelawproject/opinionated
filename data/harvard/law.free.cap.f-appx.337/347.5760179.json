We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-15\">The INA authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (2006). It defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to her native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2006). \u201cPersecution involves the infliction or threat of death, torture, or injury to one\u2019s person or freedom, on account of one of the enumerated grounds.... \u201d <em>Li v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 171, 177 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-16\">An alien \u201cbear[s] the burden of proving eligibility for asylum,\u201d <em>Naizgi v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 484, 486 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2008), and can establish refugee status based on past persecution in her native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2009). Without regard to past persecution, an alien can establish a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground. <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2004). The well-founded fear standard contains both a subjective and an objective component. The objective element requires a showing of specific, concrete facts that would lead a reasonable person in like circumstances to fear persecution. <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 353 (4th Cir.2006). \u201cThe subjective component can be met through the presentation of candid, credible, and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution.... [It] must have some basis in the reality of the circumstances and be validated with specific, concrete facts ... and it cannot be mere irrational apprehension.\u201d <em>Li, </em>405 F.3d at 176 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an alien must show a clear probability that, if she were removed to her native country, her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d on a protected ground. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (2006); <em>see Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 370 (4th Cir.2004). A \u201cclear probability\u201d means that it is more likely than not the alien would be subject to persecution. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">A determination regarding eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact, including findings on credibility, are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006). Legal issues are reviewed de novo, \u201caffording appropriate deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the INA and any attendant regulations.\u201d <em>Lin v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 685, 691-92 (4th Cir.2008). This court will reverse the Board only if \u201cthe evidence ... presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002). The immigration judge\u2019s order is the final decision for this court\u2019s review as a result of the Board\u2019s affirmance without opinion. <em>Khattak v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 250, 253 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Jing did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution. Because Jing did not meet her burden of proof to qualify for asylum, she is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). We also find the Board did not engage in any improper factfinding. We further find the Board did not err in finding that Jing did not establish that it was more likely than not she will be tortured if returned to China; thus, Jing is not eligible for relief under the CAT. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
