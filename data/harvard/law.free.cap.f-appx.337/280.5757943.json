Gregory Lashawn Moffitt appealed the 102-month sentence imposed after he pled guilty to one count of possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year of imprisonment, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (2006). In our prior decision in this case, we concluded that the district court erred in imposing a four-level enhancement to Moffitt\u2019s offense level pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) (2006) because the firearm was used in connection with another felony offense. We remanded to allow the district court to consider whether there was any other basis to impose the enhancement. We declined to consider Moffitt\u2019s other argument that the court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) because the firearm was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">On remand, the district court concluded that the four-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) was not appropriate. Moffitt\u2019s total offense level without this enhancement was recalculated at twenty-three, and his criminal history category remained category IV. The resulting sentencing range was seventy to eighty-seven months. The district court sentenced Moffitt to eighty-seven months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-17\">In his objections to the presentence report (PSR), Moffitt first stated a general objection under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>621 (2005), based on his assertion that the Fourth Circuit had created a mandatory Guidelines system contrary to <em>Booker. </em>He then argued that judicial fact-finding under this mandatory system implicated his confrontation rights as articulated in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Moffitt also asserted that the enhancement for a stolen firearm was improper because the evidence that the gun was stolen was insufficient to support the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">At sentencing, the district court concluded that the evidence was sufficiently reliable to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the firearm was stolen, and overruled Moffitt\u2019s objection. On appeal, Moffitt asserts that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level for a stolen firearm. He also repeats his claims that the Fourth Circuit had created a mandatory Guidelines system and his confrontation claim based on <em>Crawford, </em>but offers no argument in support of those issues. The Government responds, urging affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir.1989). This deferential standard of review requires reversal only if this court is \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d 538, 542 (4th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). Moffitt argues that the evidence before the district court was not sufficiently reliable to support its conclusion that the firearm he possessed was stolen. We find that this argument is without merit. Following <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court continues to make factual findings concerning sentencing factors by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Moms, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005). A sentencing court may consider any evidence at sentencing that \u201chas sufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d USSG \u00a7 6A1.3(a). This court has \u201cconstrued various Supreme Court decisions as Teeogniz[ing] a due process right to be sentenced only on information which is accurate.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>438 F.3d 437, 440 (4th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Lee, </em>540 F.2d 1205, 1211 (4th Cir.1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Moffitt acknowledges that the rules of evidence do not apply at sentencing and that the district court may consider hearsay evidence in making its factual determinations. The district court considered the PSR and a police officer\u2019s testimony describing the information obtained through the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and the ATF serial number trace of the firearm. The court specifically took judicial notice of the NCIC database and its reliability and accuracy and concluded that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the firearm was stolen. Because Moffitt\u2019s assertions that the information was not sufficiently reliable are based on conjecture, we find that the district court properly overruled his objection to this enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Finally, Moffitt states, in summary fashion, that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by making factual findings based on a preponderance of the evidence, and that his Confrontation Clause rights were violated because the Fourth Circuit has created a mandatory Guidelines system that gives rise to his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. Moffitt states that he wishes only to preserve these claims for further appellate review and we thus do not consider them further.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Moffitt\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
