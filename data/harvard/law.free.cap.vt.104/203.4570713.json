His counsel expressly admitted that the plaintiff was entitled to a judgment on the notes covered by the specification, except to the extent allowed under these claims. This was a concession, a judicial admission, and a binding waiver of all issues except the amount of the offset and recoupment. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>100 Vt. 210, 212, 136 Atl. 388, and cases cited. This concession bound the defendant throughout the trial; for, when his counsel attempted to interpose the defense that some of the notes were not due, his attention was called to the concession made by former counsel, and the court held him to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">The issues raised by the answer were tried out, and the judgment gave the defendant the benefit of the allowances made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>tbe jury. All of tbe exceptions referred to in tbe defendant\u2019s brief were predicated upon the immaturity of some of the notes. But on that subject, the defendant had been conceded out of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
