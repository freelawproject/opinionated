Vol.). The trial court, sitting without a jury, found Miller guilty and ordered him to pay a fine of $250. We granted Miller a writ of error to consider the sufficiency of the evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-16\">Patrolman C. G. Thomas of the Town of Saltville was the only witness at trial. He testified that on February 17, 1973, at approximately 2:50 a.m., he observed Miller\u2019s automobile, followed it for about 200 yards and turned on the red lights of his patrol car. The Miller vehicle turned into a driveway and stopped. The officer \u201cadvised Miller to get out of the car, seeing the condition he was in.\u201d Thomas then observed that Miller was unsteady on his feet, his eyes were glassy and his speech was somewhat broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-17\">Officer Thomas arrested Miller and advised him that \u201cthe law required him to take a blood test.\u201d Miller replied, \u201cTalk to my lawyer.\u201d Tilomas took Miller to police headquarters, where upon questioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Miller again answered, \u201cAnything you say take to my lawyer.\u201d A blood test, to which Miller consented, was not taken in compliance with the law, and the results were accordingly excluded from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The Attorney General concedes that this case may be controlled by <em>Clemmer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 661, 159 S.E.2d 664 (1968), but seeks to distinguish it. In <em>Clemmer, </em>tbe evidence showed that the defendant had driven his car off the road and through a fence into a pasture field. After getting out of the vehicle the defendant had walked unsteadily and aimlessly, stuttered when he spoke, and acted belligerently. But a witness testified that, although he had stood within two or three feet of Clemmer, he had not \u201csmell [ed] anything\u201d on the accused. Moreover, the arresting officer was not asked whether he had smelled alcohol on Clemmer or in Clemmer\u2019s car. We held that the evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Clemmer had operated his automobile under the influence of intoxicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The Attorney General contends that the present case is distinguishable from <em>Clemmer </em>because in that case there was positive evid\u00e9nce that the accused had no odor of alcohol, while in the case now before us there was no such evidence. This distinction is insignificant. In <em>Clemmer </em>we noted that under Code \u00a7 18.1-54 the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving that the accused was driving under the influence of alcohol or other self-administered intoxicant. 208 Va. at 664, 159 S.E.2d at 666. We therefore held that there could be no conviction under the statute unless there was evidence tending to establish the agency responsible for the erratic behavior of the accused. 208 Va. at 664, 159 S.E.2d at 666. In the present case, as in <em>Clemmer, </em>the Commonwealth had adduced insufficient evidence to establish that the accused had consumed alcohol. In neither case was there any evidence of alcohol in the possession of the accused or in his vehicle. Indeed, the evidence against Miller was weaker than that against Clemmer, for there was no evidence that Miller had driven dangerously or had engaged in belligerent or aggressive conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The Commonwealth has faffed to carry the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Miller was guilty of the offense with 'which he was charged. The testimony of the arresting officer was insufficient to show more than mere probability of guilt. Accordingly, the .judgment of conviction must be reversed and the case dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
