Chapter 10 of Tide 56 of the Code, which chapter pertains to light, power, and other utility companies generally, includes \u00a7\u00a7 56-234<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and -235. Section 56-234, so far as this case is concerned, imposes upon electric utilities the duty to furnish reasonably adequate service at reasonable and just rates and to charge uniformly therefor all persons or corporations using such service under like conditions. The Code section further provides, however, that \u201cnothing herein contained shall be construed as applicable to schedules of rates, or contracts for service rendered by any [electric utility] to any municipal corporation or to the State or federal government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Code \u00a7 56-235 provides, so far as this case is concerned, that if, upon investigation, the rates of any electric utility \u201cshall be found to be unjust, unreasonable, insufficient or unjustly discriminatory or . . . preferential or otherwise in violation of any of the provisions of law,\u201d the SCC \u201cshall have power to fix and order substituted therefor such . . . rates ... as shall be just and reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Article IX, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution of Virginia of 1971 provides, insofar as is pertinent here, that \u201c[s]ubject to such criteria and other requirements as may be prescribed by law, the [SCC] shall have the power and be charged with the duty of regulating the rates, charges, and services . . . of . . . electric companies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">The foregoing statutory and constitutional provisions present these issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">1. Does Code \u00a7 56-235 prevail over and render inoperative the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>provision of Code \u00a7 56-234 which purports to exempt from regulation the rates charged by electric companies for service furnished to municipal corporations or to the state or federal government?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">2. If the answer to question No. 1 is in the negative, does Code \u00a7 56-234 violate Article IX, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution of Virginia of 1971 to the extent that the Code section purports to exempt such rates from regulation?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">These issues arose in this manner: on September 11, 1972, Virginia Electric and Power Company (hereinafter VEPCO or the power company) filed with the SCC an application for declaratory judgment praying for an adjudication that the SCC had the power and duty to regulate the retail rates for service furnished to municipal corporations, counties, the Commonwealth, and the federal government. Such rates, it was alleged, had not theretofore been regulated because of the exemptive provision of Code \u00a7 56-234. The ground of VEPCO\u2019s application for relief was that the adoption of Article IX, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution of 1971 had rendered void and of no effect the exemptive provision of Code \u00a7 56-234.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">A number of interested parties, including the present appellants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, intervened in opposition to VEPCO\u2019s application. Argument was held before the SCC, and the matter was taken under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">On December 12,1972, the SCC entered a final order declaring that VEPCO was required \u201cto furnish adequate service at just and reasonable rates ... to all its customers without discrimination between governmental and other customers.\u201d Commissioner Catterall wrote the majority opinion of the SCC, and Commissioner Shannon concurred in a separate opinion. Commissioner Bradshaw dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Although holding in favor of VEPCO, the SCC did not base its decision upon the ground asserted by the power company, <em>viz., </em>that the adoption of Article IX, \u00a7 2 of the new constitution had invalidated Code \u00a7 56-234 to the extent that it purported to exempt from regulation the rates charged governmental entities for electric service. Instead, Commissioner Catterall ruled that Code \u00a7 56-235, which empowers the SCC to substitute just and reasonable rates where it finds unjust and unreasonable charges to exist, \u201cprevails over anything to the contrary in 56-234.\u201d Similarly, Commissioner Shannon ruled that Code \u00a7 56-235 \u201ctakes precedence over \u00a7 56-234\u201d and \u201cmakes it [the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>duty [of the SCC] to prescribe just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates in all cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In connection with the first issue in the case, <em>viz., </em>whether Code \u00a7 56-235 prevails over and renders inoperative the exemptive provision of Code \u00a7 56-234, we have been treated to extensive discourses upon the constitutional, legislative, and interpretative history of the two code sections. Interesting though that history might be and however strongly it might support the conclusion we ultimately reach, we think much of it unnecessary to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Suffice to say, the SCC was created by the Constitution of 1902<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, but that instrument did not confer jurisdiction upon the SCC to regulate the rates of electric companies. The right to confer such power was reserved to the General Assembly<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>. In 1914<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, the General Assembly conferred upon the SCC the power to regulate electric companies, among other public utilities. This grant of power included not only the authority to regulate the rates of electric companies, but also the authority, now contained in Code \u00a7 56-235, to correct unjust and unreasonable rates. However, the legislation also contained the ex-emptive provision, now found in Code \u00a7 56-234, with respect to schedules of rates or contracts for service rendered to municipal corporations or to the state or federal government. And, until the decision of the majority was announced below in the present case, the rates charged the governmental entities had never been regulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Code \u00a7\u00a7 56-234 and -235, insofar as applicable to electric companies, are parts of a comprehensive legislative plan for the regulation of the rates charged by those companies, which plan is fully detailed in the 14 sections comprising Articles 1 and 2 of Chapter 10, Title 56 of the Code. When \u00a7\u00a7 56-234 and -235 are held up side by side and viewed in context with the entire chapter, there is no apparent conflict between the two Code sections. Section 56-234 appears to exempt from regulation the rates charged by electric companies for service rendered governmental entities and \u00a7 56-235 appears to authorize correction of unreasonable and unjust rates, if found to exist, in those <em>other </em>areas where the powers of the SCC are operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">We would be disposed, therefore, to conclude that Code \u00a7 56-235 does not prevail over and render inoperative the exemptive provision of \u00a7 56-234. But the majority below expressed the view that our prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>decisions dictate the opposite result. So we must defer the outcome until we have examined the earlier cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In this connection, we note that Commissioner Catterall stated in his opinion that the \u201cVirginia Supreme Court has repeatedly held that.. . Section 56-235 prevails over anything to the contrary in 56-234.\u201d We also note that Commissioner Shannon stated that this court has \u201coften held that \u00a7 56-235 takes precedence over \u00a7 56-234.\u201d In our research, however, we have been unable to find an understandable basis for these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In one case upon which Commissioner Catterall relied, <em>Town of Victoria </em>v. <em>Victoria Ice, Light and Power Company, </em>134 Va. 134, 114 S.E. 92 (1922), the forerunner of Code \u00a7 56-234, \u00a7 4066, was mentioned, and then only in passing, merely as being a part of the series of Code sections in which the section operative in that case, \u00a7 4071, now \u00a7 56-235, was also a part. We made no statement concerning the effect of the one Code section upon the other. Indeed, such a statement would not have been appropriate, because the rates there in dispute, which had been fixed by a municipal ordinance granting a franchise, were for service furnished the resident-customers of the town and not, as contemplated by Code \u00a7 56-234, for service to the town itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The only possible relevance of <em>Victoria </em>to the instant case lies in the contention now urged by VEPCO and the SCC that unless Code \u00a7 56-235 is held to prevail over \u00a7 56-234, there will result an abridgement of the police power of the state in violation of Article IX, \u00a7 6 of the Constitution of Virginia of 1971. The <em>Victoria </em>case is authority for the proposition that if the state grants a municipality the power to enter into an <em>inviolable </em>agreement fixing utility rates for the consuming public, an unconstitutional abridgement of the police power would result. But aside from the difference between the types of rates involved in <em>Victoria </em>and the case before us, the answer to the contention now urged is that the exemption purportedly granted by \u00a7 56-234 is not inviolable. The exemption may be repealed at will by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Another case mentioned by Commissioner Catterall, <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Virginia Railway and Power Company, </em>141 Va. 69, 126 S.E. 353 (1925), dealt, as did <em>Victoria, </em>with rates charged the consuming public and not those involved here, <em>viz., </em>the rates for service furnished to municipal corporations or to the state or federal government. Nothing contained in the opinion in the <em>Virginia Railway </em>case lends support to the proposition that Code \u00a7 56-235 prevails over \u00a7 56-234.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>The other case upon which Commissioner Catterall relied, <em>Town of Vinton </em>v. <em>City of Roanoke, </em>195 Va. 881, 80 S.E.2d 608 (1954), involved a civil proceeding in a court of record between the town and the city wherein the city had succeeded to the rights of a water company under an earlier agreement with the town. The question of regulation by the SCC of rates charged for service furnished to governmental entities was in no way involved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The sole case mentioned by Commissioner Shannon, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shenandoah River Light and Power Corporation, </em>135 Va. 47, 115 S.E. 695 (1923), does not support his statement that Code \u00a7 56-235 takes precedence over \u00a7 56-234. In that case, one of the parties sought to bring itself within one of the exceptions in the forerunner of Code \u00a7 56-234, an exception not now contained in that section. But because the party was not within the exception, we held that the contract there in dispute was subject to the authority of the SCC under what is now \u00a7 56-235. This is not to say, however, that an inapplicable statutory exception is overridden merely because another Code section is applicable in a given case.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">On the other side of the picture, the appellants cite <em>Virginia.-Western Power Company </em>v. <em>City of Clifton Forge, </em>125 Va. 469, 99 S.E. 723 (1919). That case also dealt with rates charged the consuming public under a municipal franchise. We said, albeit by way of <em>obiter dictum, </em>that the SCC \u201cis given no jurisdiction . . . over rates charged the municipalities themselves for electric current.\u201d 125 Va. at 478, 99 S.E. at 725. Although <em>Virginia-Western </em>was later overruled on other grounds by <em>Victoria, </em>nothing was said in the latter case which undermined the validity of the view expressed in the above-quoted language.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Again, in <em>Massaponax Sand and Gravel Corporation </em>v. <em>VEPCO, </em>166 Va. 405, 186 S.E. 3 (1936), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">\u201cAll contracts made between [electric] companies and their subscribers, <em>with the exceptions noted in Code, section 4066, as amended [now Code </em>\u00a7 <em>56-234], </em>are subject to change of schedule in rates and charges which may thereafter be ordered by the [SCC].\u201d (Emphasis added.) 166 Va. at 413, 186 S.E. at 7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">And we recently stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>VEPCO, </em>211 Va. 758, 180 S.E.2d 675 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">\u201c[A] Virginia statute exempts from regulation by the [SCC] rates charged to \u2018any municipal corporation or to the State or fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>eral government.\u2019 Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 56-234 (Supp. 1970).\u201d 211 Va. at 760, n.l, 180 S.E.2d at 677-78, n.l.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Constitutional considerations aside, we come, then, to this: what we said as <em>obiter dictum </em>in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>VEPCO, supra, </em>we now declare to be the <em>statutory law </em>of this state. Code \u00a7 56-234 exempts from regulation by the SCC rates charged by electric companies for service furnished to any municipal corporation or to the state or federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Having reached this point, we must now decide whether Code \u00a7 56-234, as we have construed it, is violative of Article IX, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution of 1971. Here again, as with the statutory issue, we have had the benefit of extensive discussion concerning the historical evolution of the policy of exempting from regulation the rates charged for electric service furnished to governmental entities. In addition, we have been offered equally extensive discussion relating to the contemporaneous construction placed upon Article IX, \u00a7 2 vis-a-vis the exemptive provision of Code \u00a7 56-234. But again, though the discussion is interesting and supports our ultimate conclusion, we deem much of it unnecessary to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Suffice to say, we note once more that the Constitution of 1902 did not confer jurisdiction upon the SCC to regulate the rates of electric companies. That authority was later bestowed by statute in 1914. The purely statutory status continued until adoption of the new constitution in 1971, when the SCC\u2019s jurisdiction over electric and other companies was thus defined in Article IX, \u00a7 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\"><em>\u201cSubject to such criteria and other requirements as may be prescribed by law, </em>the [SCC] shall have the power and be charged with the duty of regulating the rates, charges, and services and, except as may be otherwise authorized by this Constitution or by general law, the facilities of railroad, telephone, gas, and electric companies.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">The language italicized above was not, however, proposed by the Commission on Constitutional Revision in its draft of Article IX, \u00a7 2. Instead, the Commission recommended that the sentence in which the italicized language is now found should read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">\u201cThe [SCC] shall have the power and be charged with the duty of regulating the rates, charges, and services and, except as may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>otherwise authorized by this Constitution or by general law, the facilities of railroad, telephone, gas, and electric companies.\u201d <em>Report of the Commission on Constitutional Revision, </em>p. 284 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The italicized language, \u201c[sjubject to such criteria and other requirements as may be prescribed by law,\u201d was added by the General Assembly when it gave approval to the proposed constitution prior to its submission to the electorate. The italicized language was in the proposed constitution as approved by the electorate, and it became a part of the Constitution when that document became effective July 1, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The crucial question becomes, therefore, what is the meaning of the italicized language? We agree with VEPCO that the meaning is clear and unambiguous and that we need not resort to extrinsic evidence in the form of legislative debate or contemporaneous construction to supply the meaning. We do not, however, agree with VEPCO upon the meaning to be given the italicized language. VEPCO says that the disputed language simply means that the General Assembly has the right to prescribe a \u201cmanual of procedure\u201d for the SCC and not to grant \u201clegislative power to curtail or eliminate the [SCC\u2019s] \u2018power and duty\u2019 with regard to . . . particular classes of rates charged\u201d by electric utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The ready and complete answer to VEPCO\u2019s \u201cmanual of procedure\u201d argument is found within the new constitution itself. The last paragraph of \u00a7 3 of Article IX reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">\u201cThe [SCC] may prescribe its own rules of practice and procedure not inconsistent with those made by the General Assembly. The General Assembly shall have the power to adopt such rules, to amend, modify, or set aside the [SCC\u2019s] rules, or to substitute rules of its own.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">This paragraph from \u00a7 3, dealing specifically with the subject of rules of practice and procedure, vests in the General Assembly full and complete power to prescribe such rules or to alter or repeal those which may be promulgated by the SCC. It is difficult to believe that the General Assembly, in approving this paragraph for submission to the electorate while at the same time adding the italicized language to \u00a7 2, intended only to accomplish a single end in both instances\u2014 the reservation of the right to prescribe rules of procedure. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>language in \u00a7 2, \u201c[sjubject to such criteria and other requirements as may be prescribed by law,\u201d means only that the General Assembly may prescribe rules of procedure, then most of the quoted paragraph of \u00a7 3 would be completely superfluous, and that cannot be. So we reject VEPCO\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Nor do we find persuasive VEPCO\u2019s further argument concerning \u00a7 2 that there is an \u201cobvious contrast\u201d between the word \u201csubject\u201d in the first part of the sentence in question and the word \u201cexcept\u201d in the second part, the latter word referring to the \u201cfacilities,\u201d and the former to the \u201crates,\u201d of the listed public utilities. The effect of this \u201cobvious contrast,\u201d VEPCO says, is that only \u201cthe method\u201d of the exercise of the SCC\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to rates is subordinate to legislative prescription. But when the italicized language in dispute is given its proper meaning, any difference between the two words becomes insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The power to determine \u201cthe method\u201d of the exercise of the SCC\u2019s jurisdiction, VEPCO asserts, means only that the General Assembly may prescribe \u201c \u2018what factors are to go into rate-making, what rate of return is to be allowed, what basis (e.g., original cost or replacement value) is to be used to determine the value of plant against which rate of return is to be computed, etc.\u2019 \u201d But the power of the General Assembly to prescribe these factors is fully reserved by the words, \u201c[sjubject to such criteria ... as may be prescribed by law,\u201d contained in \u00a7 2. The view espoused by VEPCO would not, therefore, give any meaning to the words, \u201cand other requirements,\u201d also found in \u00a7 2. These important words must, however, be given their full meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In our opinion, the clear and unambiguous meaning of the language, \u201c[sjubject to such criteria and other requirements as may be prescribed by law,\u201d as related to the case before us, is that the authority of the SCC to regulate the rates charged by electric companies for service furnished to governmental entities is subordinate to the power of the General Assembly to command otherwise. To take this view is but to give the words \u201csubject to\u201d and \u201crequirements\u201d only their common, everyday meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The exemptive provision of Code \u00a7 56-234 is just such a command otherwise. The provision commands that the rates charged by electric companies for service furnished governmental entities shall not be regulated by the SCC. The exemptive provision was permitted by the General Assembly to remain in the Code following adoption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Article IX, \u00a7 2 despite a legislatively-ordered, painstaking review to discover and remove statutory conflicts with the new constitution. The failure to remove the exemptive provision of Code \u00a7 56-234 clearly indicates that the General Assembly discerned no conflict between the statute and the new constitution. Nor do we find such conflict. So we rule that \u00a7 56-234, to the extent that it exempts from regulation the rates charged for electric service furnished to governmental entities, is not violative of Article IX, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution of 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">For the reasons assigned, the judgment of the SCC will be reversed and the application for declaratory judgment filed by VEPCO will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-12\">. Code I 56-232 is also prominent in the arguments of the parties. It provides, so far as this case is concerned, that \u201cschedules,\u201d meaning schedules of rates and charges for service, shall not include contracts of electric utilities with municipal corporations or the state or federal government. In view, however, of the conclusion we later reach with respect to I 56-234, it will not be necessary to refer again to \u00a7 56-232.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-10\">.
