Mollenauer. In an action brought by Mollenauer, Nationwide defended on the ground that the policy \u201ccovered business losses only and the loss of money claimed by [Mollenauer] was personal rather than business funds.\u201d The trial court agreed with Nationwide and entered final judgment in its favor. Mollenauer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">Nationwide\u2019s policy, issued effective January 16, 1969, for a period of one year, named Mollenauer, doing business as \u201cAzalea Garden Texaco,\u201d as the insured. It insured against the loss of money or se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>curities up to a limit of $1,000 \u201cInside the Premises,\u201d and a similar limit \u201cOutside the Premises.\u201d The \u201cpremises\u201d were described as located at a Norfolk address and the business conducted thereon was listed as a service station.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">It was Mollenauer\u2019s practice when making business deposits at his bank to obtain $50 and $100 bills in exchange for smaller bills. He would take the larger bills home and make them part of a \u201cslush fund\u201d he maintained for business or personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In December, 1969, within the policy period, Mollenauer and his wife took a trip, financed from the \u201cslush fund.\u201d In their absence, their home was burglarized and the balance of the \u201cslush fund,\u201d then amounting to $800, was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Mollenauer made claim against Nationwide for his loss, and the claim was denied. The present litigation ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Nationwide takes the position in its brief, as it did in the trial court, that its policy afforded coverage only for \u201cmoney or securities connected with the insured\u2019s business.\u201d When called upon to point out what provision of the policy limited coverage to business property, Nationwide candidly admitted that there was no \u201cspecific provision\u201d having such effect. Instead, it contended that a \u201cfair reading of the entire policy\u201d would support its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Nationwide points to various portions of the policy where Mollenauer is described as doing business under a trade name, where the location and nature of the business are stated, where the word \u201cpremises\u201d is defined as a building occupied for business purposes, and where the conditions are specified under which coverage is afforded against loss \u201cOutside the Premises.\u201d A \u201cfair reading\u201d of these provisions, Nationwide says, shows clearly that \u201cthe only money covered by the policy in question was that which was related to the service station business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">The difficulty with Nationwide\u2019s position is that if a \u201cfair reading\u201d of the policy would <em>support </em>coverage, then that is the reading we must give it. Where an insurance policy is susceptible of two constructions, one of which would effectuate coverage and the other not, it is the court\u2019s duty to adopt that construction which will effectuate coverage. <em>Surety Corporation </em>v. Elder, 204 Va. 192, 197, 129 S.E.2d 651, 655 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Such an effectuating construction is clearly permissible in this case. The policy defines \u201cmoney\u201d merely as \u201ccurrency, coins, bank notes and bullion; and travelers checks, register checks and money orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>held for sale to the public.\u201d Significantly, there is lacking at the end of this definition, and elsewhere in the policy, what Nationwide would like to have supplied, <em>viz., </em>the words \u201cconnected with the insured\u2019s business.\u201d Without such words, money not limited to purely business funds is included within the definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">One provision of the policy covers loss of money \u201cby the . . . wrongful abstraction thereof outside the premises . . . while within the living quarters in the home of any messenger.\u201d The property so insured is of the same character as that included within the policy definition of \u201cmoney,\u201d that is, money not limited to business funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The policy includes the insured within the definition of the word \u201cmessenger.\u201d Mollenauer, the insured, suffered the loss of his money while it was \u201cwithin the living quarters\u201d in his home. That the money, at the time of loss, may have changed its character from purely business funds is immaterial in view of the lack of limiting language in the policy. So Mollenauer\u2019s loss was covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">What Nationwide really wants us to do by its requested \u201cfair reading\u201d of the policy is to infer that only business property was covered. But insurance policies are not construed that way. They are construed by what is written, not by what is omitted, and courts cannot supply the lacking language.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The judgment of the trial court will be reversed and final judgment will be entered here in favor of Mollenauer against Nationwide in the sum of $800.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
