We granted him a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-17\">On June 9, 1972, defendant attempted to commit suicide by taking pills. He wrote a three-page suicide note, which was introduced in evidence without objection. It read in part, \u201cI killed Ellen 3 o\u2019clock Friday morning. I didn\u2019t mean to but it just happened.\u201d Upon his release from the hospital that same day, defendant gave Lieutenant Jesse Altizer of the Williamsburg police department a key to the apartment of Ellen Canady, with whom defendant had previously been living as man and wife but to whom he was not lawfully married.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Altizer and other officers arrived at the apartment in Williamsburg about 1:15 p.m., unlocked the door and found Ellen Canady dead on the bed. Altizer testified that her \u201cright cheek appeared to be swollen and darker than other parts of her face,\u201d and that there was what appeared to be blood in the \u201ccorner of her mouth\u201d and on the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Dr. R. E. DeBord, a medical examiner who viewed the victim\u2019s body at the scene, testified that the time of death was approximately 3:00 a.m. on June 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Dr. R. C. Henry, who performed the autopsy, found the presence of blood in the victim\u2019s mouth. He stated that the victim\u2019s death was caused by suffocation and that she had suffered bruises on her right cheek and lips just before death. He could not rule out an accidental death, but he did rule out suicide \u201cbecause a person in normal health, which this individual was, cannot smother or suffocate themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Officer Dean L. Scott stated that at 1:00 a.m. on June 1, 1972, eight days before Ellen Canady\u2019s actual death, defendant came into police headquarters in a hurry and said, \u201cI\u2019ve killed my wife. I\u2019ve choked her with a rope. I\u2019ve killed my wife.\u201d The officer said that he went to Ellen Canady\u2019s apartment, and she came to the door holding her throat. When asked whether she was all right, she replied, \u201cYes, Bernard tried to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Officer W. D. Robertson testified that on June 8, 1972, the day before Ellen Canady\u2019s death, he was present in the Williamsburg Municipal Court when a preliminary hearing was held for Canady on a charge of bigamy. The officer stated that Ellen Canady testified against Canady.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">At defendant\u2019s trial in the present case, the court overruled his motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. Thereupon, defendant, having been advised by the court that he did not have to testify, stated that he went to Ellen Canady\u2019s apartment at approximately 3:05 a.m. on June 9 to talk with her about the children. At the time the parties were not living together. He said that the victim was in bed asleep; that she awoke, became hostile and started struggling with him; and that while she was lying in bed, he grabbed her around her throat, choked her and \u201cshe went limp.\u201d He further testified that before he left the apartment he heard the victim\u2019s heart beat. He denied from the witness stand he had killed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Defendant contends that the Commonwealth failed to prove the <em>corpus </em>delicti, and that it cannot be established by an uncorroborated extrajudicial confession. He cites <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>464, 144 S.E.2d 310 (1965), and <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>201 Va. 599, 112 S.E.2d 915 (1960), which support the proposition of law. However, a confession is competent evidence tending to prove, along with other evidence, the <em>corpus </em>delicti, although <em>corpus delicti </em>cannot be established by the uncorroborated extrajudicial confession of the accused alone. <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>206 Va. at 468, 144 S.E.2d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In the case at bar, there is considerable evidence, apart from the confession contained in the suicide note, that the decedent\u2019s death was criminally caused and that the defendant was the criminal agent. The record shows that the defendant had made a prior attempt to kill Ellen Canady on June 1, 1972, and that she had testified against him on a charge of bigamy on June 8, 1972, the day before her death. Bruises on the victim\u2019s face and blood in her mouth, revealed by the autopsy, support a finding that her suffocation and death were by violent means. Defendant\u2019s own testimony showed that he was present in the apartment near the time of her death; that he choked the victim during a struggle; that he attempted suicide; and that he wrote the note which said, \u201cI killed Ellen. . . .\u201d The testimony of the medical examiner established 3:00 a.m. on June 9 as the time of death. When all of this is coupled with the contents of the suicide note, which placed the time of killing exactly as fixed by the medical examiner, the <em>corpus delicti </em>is established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Challenging the sufficiency of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, defendant raises the question of \u201cthe wisdom, fairness, and constitutionality\u201d of the rule in <em>Spangler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>188 Va. 436, 50 S.E.2d 265 (1948), which holds that a defendant who introduces evidence after his motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence has been denied waives error on the court\u2019s ruling. We need not decide that question, for we believe that, read in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence of the Commonwealth standing alone was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the killing was willful, deliberate and premeditated.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
