McPeek, a police officer, brought this action for personal injuries received while on duty when his motorcycle collided with an automobile operated by Harry Swersky. A jury trial resulted in a verdict for McPeek for $5,200, and we granted Swersky a writ of error to the judgment entered thereon. Swersky\u2019s liability is not in issue. The dispositive question for our determination is whether the trial court erred in instructing the jury that in assessing damages they might take into consideration, among other factors, any humiliation or embarrassment suffered by McPeek.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-17\">The accident occurred in the City of Norfolk on October 27, 1971. McPeek sustained contusions and bruises of his left shoulder, left elbow and left knee. There were abrasions and swelling of the elbow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>and knee, but x-ray photographs established that no bones were fractured. Although his shoulder and elbow soon healed, McPeek continued to experience discomfort from his knee injury. McPeek\u2019s doctor stated, however, that there was no permanent disability. McPeek lost no pay but incurred total medical expenses of $145.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">McPeek evinced a commendable interest in maintaining his physical fitness by exercise. He testified that, because of his knee injury, for a month or so after the accident he could not bend down as he usually did to play with his children, and he was somewhat \u201cslowed down\u201d in instructing his younger brothers in football and baseball. He exercised, first at home and then at a health club, occasionally wore a knee bandage, and used a \u201cwhirlpool\u201d bath for therapeutic purposes. McPeek also testified that, when exercising extensively, \u201csuch as standing for a long time or running\u201d, he still suffered pains in his knee. But no evidence was presented that McPeek had suffered any disfigurement, embarrassment or humiliation as a result of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The trial court, after eliminating disfigurement as an element of damages, gave Instruction No. 7<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> over Swersky\u2019s objection that there was no evidence to justify an award of damages for humiliation or embarrassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">An instruction should not be given when there is no evidence tending to prove the facts on which the instruction is based. <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Quarterman, </em>210 Va. 598, 172 S.E.2d 739 (1970); <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Fiery, </em>206 Va. 370, 143 S.E.2d 876 (1965). In <em>Crawford, </em>210 Va. at 606, 172 S.E.2d at 744, we disapproved an instruction that permitted the jury to award the plaintiff damages for deformity \u201cand any humiliation or embarrassment associated therewith\u201d where there was no evidence of deformity or of any humiliation or embarrassment resulting from his injuries. <em>See also Oak Knolls Realty </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>212 Va. 396, 397, 184 S.E.2d 809, 810 (1971), where we held that it was error to grant an instruction on permanent injury when no direct evidence supported it and the nature of the injuries was not such that the jury could reasonably have inferred that they were permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Although McPeek did not testify that his injuries caused him any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>humiliation or embarrassment, he argues that such testimony is not required because the jury could have inferred those consequences from the nature of his injuries. In <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>Bosschermuller, </em>206 Va. 360, 367, 143 S.E.2d 881, 887 (1965), relied upon by McPeek, we upheld an instruction permitting the jury to award damages for humiliation or embarrassment where there was no direct evidence of any such damages. In that case, however, the jury could reasonably have inferred humiliation or embarrassment from the plaintiff\u2019s deformed leg and resulting limp which the evidence showed were a consequence of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">There was no direct evidence that McPeek\u2019s injuries resulted in humiliation or embarrassment to him. He suffered no deformity, disfigurement or disruption of bodily functions. McPeek\u2019s injuries, consisting of unexceptional bruises and abrasions, were not of such nature that the jury could reasonably have inferred that they caused him to suffer humiliation or embarrassment. Therefore, the granting of Instruction No. 7 without deleting therefrom item 4 requires that the judgment be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial limited to the issue of damages alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\"> Instruction No. 7 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">\u201cIf from the evidence and the other instructions of the Court you find your verdict in favor of the plaintiff, then in assessing the damages to which he is entitled you may take into consideration any of the following which you believe from the evidence to have resulted from the collision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-11\">* # ** *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-12\">\u201c4.
