Vol.) require a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>versal of Dennis Ray Woodard\u2019s conviction of the felony of distributing marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Woodard was indicted and held for trial at the July, 1971, term of the Circuit Court of the City of Chesapeake. By order entered July 16, 1971, the case was continued \u201con motion of the Attorney for the Commonwealth until the November term of this court.\u201d By order entered December 2, 1971, \u201c[d]ue to manifest necessity\u201d the case was continued until January 26, 1972. When arraigned, Woodard pleaded not guilty, and his counsel moved that Woodard be forever discharged on the ground that three regular terms of the trial court had passed since he had been indicted and held for trial. The court overruled this motion. On January 27, 1972, Woodard was tried without a jury and was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The Attorney General contends that only one regular term of court had passed between Woodard\u2019s indictment and his trial. Although the court entered orders during October, November and December terms, the Deputy Clerk of the court testified that only the November term was a criminal term, that the October and December terms were civil terms, and that criminal cases are tried during civil terms only upon agreement of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">All three terms, however, must be considered regular terms for purposes of the time limitation imposed by Code \u00a7 19.1-191. Although Code \u00a7 17-127 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (1960 Repl. Vol.) authorized certain circuit court judges to designate civil terms, there is no provision that these civil terms shall not be regular terms. Indeed, this statute required that at any of the terms all criminal and chancery matters be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The Attorney General argues that Code \u00a7 17-127 provided for only two regular terms each year of the circuit court of a city and that all other terms were special. There is nothing in the record, however, to show any designation of special terms by the judge of the trial court by order or warrant, as required by Code \u00a7 17-129. More importantly, Code \u00a7 17-127 contained the qualifying language \u201c[ujnless otherwise provided\u201d, and the legislature has provided for additional terms of the Circuit Court of the City of Chesapeake.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The Act of the General Assembly which provided for creation of the new City of Chesapeake by consolidation of the City of South Norfolk and Norfolk County also provided that \u201cthe Circuit Court of Norfolk County shall be known as the Circuit Court\u201d of the consolidated city, with exclusive jurisdiction of all criminal matters. Acts 1962, c. 211, \u00a7 20.01, at 314. Under the provisions of Acts 1914, c. 315, at 544, the State was divided into judicial circuits with specified court terms. The first circuit comprised Norfolk County, whose court terms were to begin on the first Monday in January, February, March, April, May, June, July, October, November, December. <em>See also Times for the Commencement of the Regular Terms, Circuit Courts of Virginia, </em>Acts 1918, at 791. This schedule, which remained unchanged when the 1950 Code took effect, continued in the first circuit after formation of the City of Chesapeake. <em>See Times for the Commencement of the Regular Terms, Circuit Courts of Virginia, </em>Acts 1964, at 1161; Acts 1966, at 1611. Although the legislature has changed the terms of court in various other circuits, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-<em>111.I et seq. </em>(1960 Repl. Vol.), no such changes have been made in the first circuit. Nor does the record show that the November term was omitted by order entered by the circuit judge as permitted by Code \u00a7 17-127. Therefore, the July, October, November and December terms of the Circuit Court of the City of Chesapeake were regular terms within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.1-191.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The Attorney General attaches undue significance to the recent omission of the November term from the tables of terms of the Circuit Court of the City of Chesapeake found in the Acts of Assembly. <em>See Times for the Commencement of the Regular Terms, Circuit Courts of Virginia, </em>Acts 1968, at 1605; Acts 1970, at 1764; Acts 1972, at 1648. These tables are prepared by the Clerk of the House of Delegates as required by Code \u00a7 30-13 (1973 Repl. Vol.), and, although assembled pursuant to legislative mandate, they are not themselves legislative enactments. They constitute merely lists containing information, furnished by clerical personnel for the use and benefit of the public. <em>See </em>Revisors\u2019 Note to Code (Annotated) of 1919, \u00a7 5893. Thus, any error in the tables does not alter the legislative provision for regular terms of the Circuit Court of the City of Chesapeake in July, October, November and December.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">As Woodard was indicted and held for trial at the July term, which is therefore excluded from computation of three regular terms within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.1-191, <em>Butts </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>145 Va. 800, 807-08, 133 S.E. 764, 766 (1926), our concern is with the October, November and December terms. The burden was on the Commonwealth to prove excuse for the failure to try Woodard before these three regular terms had passed. <em>Heflin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 407, 409, 177 S.E.2d 644, 645 (1970); <em>Flanary </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 204, 210, 35 S.E.2d 135, 138 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The Commonwealth, even with the testimony of the Deputy Clerk, failed to carry its burden of proving that no court was held at the November or December terms, an excuse allowable under clause (6) of Code \u00a7 19.1-191. Assuming, without deciding, that this testimony was admissible, it tends to explain rather than excuse the delay in bringing Woodard to trial. The Deputy Clerk testified that the judge of the trial court was ill in November and December, that the judge who had agreed to try Woodard on December 2, 1971, the last day of the November term, failed to appear on the trial date so that the case was continued because no judge was present, and that the judge of the trial court, who was \u201cin and out of here\u201d during December, signed some orders at his home and at least one order which showed his presence in the courthouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The Attorney General, relying on <em>Butts </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>145 Va. at 808, 133 S.E. at 766, contends that even if none of the six excuses specified in Code \u00a7 19.1-191 applies, excuses of a similar nature prevent Woodard\u2019s discharge. The Attorney General asserts that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>July term continuance was similar to one granted on Woodard\u2019s motion, which would have been excusable under clause (4) of Code \u00a7 19.1-191. This argument is based on the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s statement at trial that the continuance from the July term to the November term was agreed to in order to benefit Woodard by permitting him to cooperate with law enforcement agents. This position, however, is untenable, for we cannot take cognizance of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s statement. The order granting the continuance, containing no suggestion of an agreement, speaks for itself. <em>Heflin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>211 Va. at 408, 177 S.E.2d at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Finally, the Attorney General says that the failure of the judge who had agreed to try Woodard to appear on the trial date is an excuse similar \u201cto those set out specifically in \u00a7 19.1-191.\u201d We do not agree. To approve this view would be to permit a judge, through inadvertence or dereliction, to circumvent the legislative determination of the requirements of a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Under the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.1-191 we must reverse Woodard\u2019s conviction and dismiss the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-17\"> \u201cCode \u00a7 19.1-191.
