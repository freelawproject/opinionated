Defendant, who pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant an irresistible impulse instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-18\">The evidence showed that defendant, in an unprovoked attack, stabbed and killed Gene Smith as he sat on a stool at the counter of the Greenleaf Cafe. Medical expert witnesses testified that defendant was not feebleminded or psychotic but was subject to grand mal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>seizures or psychomotor seizures; that during a grand mal seizure the victim loses consciousness, cannot respond to outside stimuli, and his bodily movements are random, jerky and uncoordinated; and that during a psychomotor seizure the victim \u201cis in a dream-like state\u201d and has \u201csevered all the bridges of communication with his environment\u201d, does not know the difference between right and wrong, is unable to control himself, and cannot resist his impulses.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Upon defendant\u2019s plea of legal insanity, the trial court granted the customary \u201cright and wrong\u201d instruction. But defendant argues that the killing was the result of an irresistible impulse occurring while he was suffering a grand mal or psychomotor seizure and that the trial court erred in refusing an additional instruction based on that theory. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">None of the medical expert witnesses testified that a person suffering a grand mal or psychomotor seizure is able to distinguish right from wrong; but, evidence of a defendant\u2019s capacity to make such a distinction is a prerequisite to an irresistible impulse instruction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-6\">\u201cThe irresistible impulse doctrine is applicable only to that class of cases where the accused is able to understand the nature and conse-: quences of his act and knows it is wrong, but his mind has become so impaired by disease that he is totally deprived of the mental power to control or restrain his act.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 704, 718, 70 S.E.2d 284, 292 (1952).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The refused instruction, assuming it was a correct statement of the law, was therefore irrelevant and \u201can irrelevant instruction, though abstractly right, ought not to be given.\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>88 Va. 633, 640, 14 S.E. 330, 332 (1892).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Since the \u201cright or wrong\u201d instruction is predicated on the <em>incapacity </em>of a defendant to distinguish right from wrong and the \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d instruction is predicated on the <em>capacity </em>to make such a distinction, different evidence is required to support each instruction. Since there was no evidence to support a finding that a person suffering a grand mal or psychomotor seizure has such capacity, the trial court did not err in refusing defendant\u2019s instruction, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
