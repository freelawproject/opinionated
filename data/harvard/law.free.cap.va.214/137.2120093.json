Code \u00a7 33.1-107.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the date set for the hearing it was discovered that one of those summoned was not qualified to serve as a commissioner because he was not a freeholder of the City of Martinsville, where the condemned property was located. By agreement, each of the parties exercised two peremptory challenges and the remaining four persons, instead of five as required by Code \u00a7 33.1-107, were appointed and acted as trial commissioners. At the conclusion of the hearing the four commissioners rendered a unanimous report making the awards set forth earlier. This report was subsequently confirmed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The Attorney General argues that the appointment of five trial commissioners is jurisdictional and that such jurisdiction cannot be conferred by agreement or by waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">It is well established that statutes conferring the power of eminent domain are to be strictly construed against the grant, and the authority conferred by such statutes must be exercised in the manner provided by law, <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>201 Va. 514, 519, 112 S. E. 2d 137, 141 (1960). However, where the parties agree, with the court\u2019s approval, to waive strict compliance, such agreements will be enforced against the condemnor. <em>See Plummer </em>v. <em>Dept, of Conservation, </em>209 Va. 616, 166 S. E. 2d 281 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Here the Highway Commissioner agreed to the appointment of only four trial commissions. This agreement constituted a waiver of strict compliance with the statutes, so the order of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\"> Code \u00a7 33.1-107, which was in effect when this case was tried, was repealed by Acts of Assembly, 1972, c. 765.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
