They engaged in an argument because Hargrave was \u201cgoing with\u201d Gill\u2019s sister. Hargrave announced that he intended to terminate his relationship with Gill and \u201cmove out the house.\u201d He demanded his coat which was in Gill\u2019s possession. Gill declined to surrender the coat to defendant who then left the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Hargrave returned to the room a few minutes later carrying a single shot twenty-two calibre rifle in his hands. When he was about ten feet from Gill, who was seated in a chair, defendant told Gill \u201cto give him his coat\u201d and fired toward her without raising the rifle to his shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The projectile grazed Gill on the right shoulder causing a \u201clittle bum\u201d before it struck a washing machine approximately three feet behind her. Gill immediately fled the scene and went to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">To prove the crime of attempted murder two essential elements must be established. The specific intent to kill the victim must be shown and this must be coupled with evidence of some overt but ineffectual act in furtherance of this purpose. The use of a deadly weapon, standing alone, is not sufficient to prove the specific intent required to establish attempted murder. <em>Thacker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>134 Va. 767, 114 S.E. 504 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The necessary intent constituting one element in an attempt to commit murder is the intent in fact, as distinguished from an intent in law. <em>Merritt v. Commonwealth, </em>164 Va. 653, 662, 180 S.E. 395, 399 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Intent in fact is the purpose formed in a person\u2019s mind and may be, and frequently is, shown by circumstances. It is a state of mind which may be shown by a person\u2019s conduct or by his statements. <em>Chittum </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 12, 16, 174 S.E.2d 779, 781 (1970); <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 222, 228, 148 S.E.2d 800, 804 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">The facts and circumstances here, i.e., the use of a deadly weapon coupled with the defendant\u2019s other conduct and utterances, were sufficient for the trial court to find that defendant had the requisite intent to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
