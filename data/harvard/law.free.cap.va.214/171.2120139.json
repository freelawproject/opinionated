Those Acts would have provided financial aid in the form of grants or loans to students in public and nonsectarian private institutions of higher education in Virginia and in the form of loans only to students in those sectarian colleges not having as their primary purpose the furnishing of religious training or theological education. Both earlier Acts would have permitted repayment of a loan either in money or by making satisfactory academic progress during the school term for which the loan was received.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">The earlier legislation was attacked upon the ground that it violated the Establishment of Religion Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. We upheld the legislation against that attack. 213 Va. at 264, 191 S.E.2d at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The legislation was also attacked upon the ground that the financial aid provided for therein exceeded the limitations set forth in Section 11 of Article VIII of the Virginia Constitution and therefore violated Section 10 of Article VIII. We held that the legislation, in permitting repayment of financial aid by academic progress, actually provided for conditional grants or gifts and not loans. This, we said, exceeded the authority of Section 11 of Article VIII,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which permits only \u201cloans\u201d to students attending certain private institutions of higher education in the Commonwealth, both sectarian and nonsectarian. And, since the conditional grants or gifts could have been made to students in sectarian institutions, we held the legislation to be in violation of Section 10 of Article VIII <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of our Constitution, which permits such type of financial aid only to students in public or nonsectarian private schools. 213 Va. at 268, 191 S.E.2d at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Following our decision, the General Assembly enacted Chapters 2 and 106,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Acts of Assembly of 1973. Chapter 2 amends and reenacts Code \u00a7\u00a7 23-38.12, -38.13, -38.15, -38.16, -38.17, and -38.18,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which were first added to the Code by Chapter 18 of the Acts of 1972. Chapter 2 provides for a program of undergraduate tuition assistance in the form of loans to residents of Virginia who attend private, nonprofit institutions of collegiate education in the state which have as their primary purpose to provide collegiate or graduate education and not to provide religious training or theological education. Aid provided under Chapter 2 may be used only for undergraduate collegiate work in educational programs other than those providing religious training or theological education of an indoctrinating nature. Code \u00a7 23-38.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Chapter 106 repeals the Code sections enacted by Chapter 19 of the Acts of 1972 and adds Code \u00a7\u00a7 23-38.45 through -38.53.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Chapter 106 provides for a program of undergraduate scholarship assistance, based in part upon need, to residents of Virginia in the form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>grants or loans to students who attend public institutions of higher education in the state. The Chapter also provides financial aid in the form of loans only to students who attend private, nonprofit colleges in Virginia, except those institutions which have as their primary purpose to provide religious training or theological education. Grants or loans awarded under Chapter 106 may be used only for payment of tuition, fees, room, board, or other educational expenses which the recipient is obligated to pay during the academic year for which the award is made. Code \u00a7 23-38.50. Grants or loans made to students attending public institutions shall be upon such terms and conditions as the administering authority deems appropriate. Code \u00a7 23-38.49 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Both new chapters provide that loans made to students attending private institutions may be repaid either in money or, for each successfully completed academic year in which a loan is received, \u201cby actions beneficial to, or of service to, the Commonwealth.\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 23-38.15 (a) and -38.49(b). Where repayment is made by actions beneficial to, or of service to, the Commonwealth, it may be in the form of one or more of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">1. Residence and domicile in Virginia and employment by the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions. One year of service repays one year of loan;</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">2. Residence and domicile in Virginia and employment by an organization or activity operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes or for testing for public safety or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals. One year of service repays one year of loan;</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">3. Residence and domicile in Virginia and gainful employment in or out of the state in activity other than as set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 above. Service for one and one-half years repays one year of loan;</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">4. Residence and domicile in Virginia. A period of two years of residence and domicile repays one year of loan;</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">5. Active duty in the armed services of the United States. One year of service repays one year of loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">Both financial aid programs under review are to be administered by the State Council of Higher Education. Both were funded by appropriations approved by the General Assembly. Chapter 464, Item 513.1, Acts of Assembly of 1973. The Comptroller expressed doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>concerning the constitutionality of the new legislation. Accordingly, he notified the Attorney General that he would refuse to honor vouchers from the State Council of Higher Education and, until this court adjudicated the validity of the legislation, would not issue warrants for payment thereof out of the appropriations made by the General Assembly. The Attorney General then filed the present petitions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for writs of mandamus requiring the Comptroller to issue warrants for payment of amounts authorized by the legislation. Code \u00a7 8-714.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">As in the first <em>Miller </em>case, the Comptroller contends that the legislation under review is invalid because the loans provided for therein exceed the limitations of Section 11 of Article VIII of the Virginia Constitution and are, therefore, violative of Section 10 of Article VIII. And, as in the first <em>Miller </em>case, the Comptroller contends that the legislation is unconstitutional because it is in violation of the Establishment of Religion Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. A new contention of the Comptroller in this case is that the legislation also violates the Free Exercise of Religion Clause of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\n<em>The Virginia Constitutional Questions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The Comptroller contends that Chapters 2 and 106 of the Acts of Assembly of 1973 provide, just as the 1972 legislation provided, for conditional grants or gifts not contemplated by Section 11 of Article VIII of the Virginia Constitution, which permits only loans. Therefore, the Comptroller concludes, insofar as the new chapters permit such conditional grants or gifts to be made to students in sectarian institutions, they are violative of Section 10 of Article VIII, which permits such type of aid only to students in public and nonsectarian private institutions. The Comptroller argues that the five alternative methods of repayment set forth in Chapters 2 and 106 differ in no way from the method of repayment set forth in the earlier legislation, viz., satisfactory academic progress, which we struck down in the first <em>Miller </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The Attorney General contends, on the other hand, that the Report of the Commission on Constitutional Revision, the subsequent legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>lative action of the General Assembly, and the opinion of this court in the first <em>Miller </em>case, recognize that loans made under the authority of Section 11 of Article VIII may be repayable other than in money. This being so, the Attorney General argues, the legislation under review must be found constitutional if the methods of repayment set forth therein provide for the giving of any consideration recognizable in the law of contracts, that is, a benefit to the Commonwealth or a detriment to the recipient of a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The Attorney General insists that each of the five methods of repayment provides sufficient consideration in that each secures to the Commonwealth meaningful benefits and imposes upon the recipient significant restrictions which constitute legal detriments. And in an amicus curiae brief filed by the Council of Independent Colleges in Virginia in support of the Attorney General\u2019s position, it is stated that how \u201cvaluable the recipient\u2019s service or benefit is\u2014how much it is worth to the Commonwealth\u2014is ... a matter to be decided not by a court, but by the General Assembly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We accept the Attorney General\u2019s premise that a loan made pursuant to the authority of Section 11 of Article VIII need not be\" repayable only in money, but may be repayable in some other manner. And we might agree that if the case could be decided upon simple principles of contract law, the General Assembly\u2019s pronouncement of what is sufficient consideration for such a loan would be controlling. However, we do not think the case can be decided by reference to principles of contract law. The controlling question, in our opinion, is not whether sufficient consideration has been provided for but whether the General Assembly had, in the first instance, authority to provide that Section 11 loans could be repaid <em>upon the terms </em>set out in Chapters 2 and 106. We proceed to an examination of that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Section 11 of Article VIII authorizes the General Assembly to provide for <em>loans </em>to students attending certain nonprofit institutions of higher education in Virginia. If all we had before us was the stark word \u201cloans,\u201d as used in Section 11, we would be forced to hold that any loan made pursuant thereto would have to be repayable in money. But we know that the Revisors of the Constitution, the electorate which approved it, and the General Assembly which put it into effect intended the word \u201cloans\u201d to have a meaning different from what it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>denotes in the ordinary commercial transaction. The extent of that difference, however, is the crucial determination we must make.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We know the word \u201cloans\u201d was intended to convey something more than its usual meaning because in its Commentary upon Section 11 of Article VIII, the Commission on Constitutional Revision stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">\u201cThe Commission does not propose any state appropriations to private colleges and universities. Its proposals are much more modest. In the first place, the proposed section would allow the Commonwealth to extend to students in private institutions, whether church-related or not, loan programs available to students in public or private nonsectarian colleges in Virginia. For example, students in church-related colleges could be made eligible for the State Teacher Scholarships given by the State Board of Education. <em>These loans, given to undergraduates preparing for teaching in the pmblic school system, can be cancelled either by a specified period of teaching or by </em>repayment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Thus, although we know that in revising the Constitution it was intended that loans made under the authority of Section 11 of Article VIII could be repayable other than in money, we also know that any different manner of repayment was intended to be confined within very narrow limits\u2014the rendering of public service to the Commonwealth. We say this because the one example given, \u201cteaching in the public school system,\u201d is an act of public service and the one different method of repayment cited, \u201ca specified period of teaching,\u201d requires such public service.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">It cannot be presumed that because approval was given the revised Constitution with the intention that one alternative method of repayment of loans would be permitted, other far different methods were also intended to be permitted. To the contrary, it must be presumed that approval was given in light of the \u201cmodest\u201d proposals of the Commission on Constitutional Revision. Those proposals displayed the clear intent to limit the manner of repayment of loans to methods substantially following the given example of public service to the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">We hold, therefore, that in order for financial aid to be valid as a loan under Section 11 of Article VIII, it must be repayable either in money or by public service to the Commonwealth. Four of the five alternative methods of repayment set forth in the present legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>lation, those numbered 2 through 5,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> fail to meet this test. Mere residence in the state, either by itself or coupled with employment by the nonpublic employers permitted by the legislation, or active duty in the armed services of the United States, are not acts substantially following the example of public service to the Commonwealth contemplated by Section 11 of Article VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">To the extent that the legislation under review permits repayment of loans by methods 2 through 5, it must be held to provide for conditional grants or gifts in excess of the authority granted by Section 11 of Article VIII. And, since the conditional grants or gifts may, under the legislation, be made to students in sectarian institutions, they are, to that extent, violative of Section 10 of Article VIII, which limits such type of aid to students in public and nonsectarian private schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">This does not mean, however, that the entire programs envisioned by Chapters 2 and 106 must fall. Each of the Chapters now before us contains a severability clause. This situation differs from the first <em>Miller </em>case, where only one of the Acts under consideration had such a clause. Here, with a severability clause in each Chapter, we can eliminate what is bad and salvage what is good.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">We may salvage in three areas. First, method No. 1 set forth in Chapters 2 and 106, which method permits repayment of loans by employment by the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions, passes the test of Section 11 of Article VIII. This method substantially fits the pattern of public service contemplated by Section 11 as necessary to repay a loan other than in money. Therefore, we uphold Chapters 2 and 106 to the extent that they provide financial aid in the form of loans to students attending the eligible educational institutions defined therein, both sectarian and nonsectarian, such loans to be repayable only in money or by employment by the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Second, Section 10 of Article VIII permits financial aid, without restriction as to form, to students in public institutions. Thus, such aid may take the form of grants or loans. Therefore, we uphold Chapter 106 to the extent that it provides aid in such form to students in public institutions. The terms and conditions upon which the grants or loans are made shall be determined by the State Council of Higher Education. Code \u00a7 23-38.49(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Third, Section 10 of Article VIII also permits financial aid, without restriction as to form, to students in nonsectarian private schools. Thus, such aid may take the form of outright grants. It follows that such aid may also be in the form of conditional grants. While, as we have held, conditional grants are not loans within the meaning of Section 11 of Article VIII and are invalid under Section 10 when sought to be made to students in sectarian schools, such grants may, under the authority of Section 10, be made to students in nonsectarian schools. And there is nothing in Section 10 to prevent such grants from being made upon the condition that they be repaid either in money or by one or more of the five alternative methods set forth in Chapters 2 and 106. Therefore, we uphold Chapters 2 and 106 to the extent that they provide financial aid in the form of conditional grants, repayable in the manner specified therein, to students in nonsectarian private institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\n<em>The Federal Constitutional Questions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Since we approve in Part I of this opinion financial aid in the form of loans, repayable either in money or by public employment, to students in sectarian institutions, we must now consider the First Amendment questions raised by the Comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">We held in the first <em>Miller </em>case, as has been noted, that the financial aid programs there under review did not violate the Establishment of Religion Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The Comptroller, making the same Establishment of Religion contention he made before, asks us to \u201creappraise\u201d our former holding and declare the present legislation invalid. If circumstances had not changed, we would decline the request to reappraise since the Comptroller\u2019s contention was so clearly rejected in the first case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>However, following our first <em>Miller </em>decision and, indeed, after we had heard argument of this matter, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down decisions in ten cases involving state programs of aid to private educational institutions. These new decisions require a reexamination of our earlier holding. We have had the benefit of supplemental briefs of counsel in this case concerning the question of the effect of the new decisions upon the issues here.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Of the four opinions written by the Supreme Court disposing of the ten cases, three involved state programs aiding private elementary and secondary schools. In <em>Levitt </em>v. <em>Committee for Public Education, </em>93 Sup. Ct. 2814 (1973), the Court struck down as \u201can impermissible aid to religion\u201d a New York statute which would have reimbursed private schools for the cost of state-mandated testing and record keeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In <em>Sloan </em>v. <em>Lemon, </em>93 Sup. Ct. 2982 (1973), the Court declared unconstitutional Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cParent Reimbursement Act for Nonpublic Education,\u201d which would have reimbursed parents for tuition paid for their children to attend the state\u2019s private elementary and secondary schools. The Court held that the Act violated \u201cthe constitutional mandate against the \u2018sponsorship\u2019 or \u2018financial support\u2019 of religion or religious institutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">In <em>Committee for Public Education </em>v. <em>Nyquist, </em>93 Sup. Ct. 2955 (1973), the Court invalidated a New York statute which would have (1) provided for direct grants to private elementary and secondary schools for maintenance and repair of facilities and equipment, (2) established a plan of reimbursement to low-income parents for tuition paid for children attending such schools, and (3) provided tax relief to higher-income parents with children attending such schools. The Court held that all three aspects of the legislation had \u201cthe impermissible effect of advancing religion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The fourth case, <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>McNair, </em>93 Sup. Ct. 2868 (1973), involved the South Carolina Educational Facilities Act, a program aiding institutions of higher education. The Act established an Educational Facilities Authority to assist institutions of higher education in the financing and construction of physical facilities through the issuance of revenue bonds. The bonds, payable solely from funds derived from the revenues of projects, were not to constitute a debt or a pledge of the faith and credit of the state. Likewise, the expenses of the Authority were to be paid from the revenues of projects. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>No facilities so constructed could be used for sectarian instruction or religious worship.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">At issue was a proposal for the Authority to finance construction of a project for the Baptist College at Charleston. Although the school\u2019s trustees were elected by the South Carolina Baptist Convention, approval of the Convention was required for certain financial transactions, and 60% of the student body was Baptist, there was no evidence that the school was pervasively sectarian. Further, it was shown that there were no religious qualifications for faculty membership or student admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The contractual arrangements between the Authority and the college gave the Authority the right to make inspections to determine whether any of the financed facilities were used for sectarian purposes. The contract terms also permitted the Authority, upon default by the college, to establish rules, charges, and fees for the use of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The Supreme Court upheld the South Carolina legislation against an Establishment of Religion attack asserted by a taxpayer. Reverting to the guidelines it had established in <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602 (1971), the Court held that the purpose of the legislation was secular; that the legislation did not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion; and that the legislation did not foster an excessive entanglement of government with religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Of particular significance to the issue before us, the Supreme Court in the <em>Hunt </em>case relied upon its earlier decision in <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 672 (1971), stating two important propositions. First, there is a pertinent difference between aid to church-related elementary and secondary schools on the one hand and aid to church-related institutions of higher education on the other. Second, the Establishment Clause does not prohibit all programs which in some manner aid institutions with religious affiliations or, as the Court put it another way, not all aid is forbidden because aid to one aspect of an institution frees it to spend its other resources on religious ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The <em>Tilton </em>case, upon which the Supreme Court relied, involved the federal Higher Education Facilities Act. The Act authorized grants and loans to institutions of higher education, both nonsectarian and sectarian, for the construction of physical facilities to be used only for secular education. The Supreme Court upheld the Act against a First Amendment attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>The <em>Tilton </em>holding is important here because in the first <em>Miller </em>case we said that the decision was \u201cwholly dispositive of the First Amendment question\u201d then before us. Now, the question is whether the new Supreme Court decisions have proved us wrong in our view. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">With the new decisions, the crucial difference between aid on the elementary-secondary level and aid on the college level remains intact. We relied in the first <em>Miller </em>case upon the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of that difference, and we feel justified now in <em>relying </em>upon the Court\u2019s restatement of that difference in <em>Hunt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">With the new decisions, the three-pronged test\u2014secular purpose, primary effect, and degree of governmental entanglement\u2014also remains intact. We upheld the legislation under consideration in the first <em>Miller </em>case after applying each prong of the test. We reach the same result with respect to the legislation under consideration here.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Our position with respect to Virginia\u2019s financial aid programs is buttressed by several considerations. In the three new decisions involving programs of state aid to private elementary and secondary schools, the Supreme Court stressed the highly parochial nature of many of the schools which would be benefited. It listed eight characteristics displaying the pervasiveness of religion in admission policies, curricula, student activities, and faculty appointments. However, under the Virginia legislation now before us, students in institutions of higher education which display those characteristics would be barred at the outset from participating in benefits. This is so because Section 11 of Article VIII of our Constitution and the legislation under review exclude from eligibility those institutions which have as their primary purpose to provide religious training or theological education.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">In the <em>Hunt </em>case, the Supreme Court stated that the burden rests upon the party challenging a state program of aid \u201cto show the extent to which the College is church-related.\u201d And the Court held that \u201cthere is no evidence here to demonstrate that the College is any more an instrument of religious indoctrination than were the colleges and universities involved in <em>Tilton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Here, there is no evidence in the record of the extent of church relationship of the private institutions which would be eligible to have their students participate in benefits under the Virginia programs. We do have, however, the following statement in the Commentary of the Commission on Constitutional Revision upon Section 11 of Article VIII:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u201cMany of the private colleges in Virginia are church-related, but typically they operate like any other college. For example, of the twelve members of the Association of Independent Colleges (composed of nearly all of the accredited private non-profit four-year colleges in Virginia), nine have some degree of church relationship. Yet none of the nine... imposes any religious tests for student admission or faculty selection, and none serves primarily a single religious faith. All, in short, are an integral part of Virginia\u2019s commitment to higher education, their doors open without discrimination to the youth of the Commonwealth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The state programs of aid involved in this case are to be dispensed in a \u201ccollege setting,\u201d as in <em>Tilton </em>and <em>Hunt, </em>rather than in elementary and secondary schools, and are confined to institutions having as their primary purpose to provide secular and not sectarian education. Therefore, we affirm the view expressed in the first <em>Miller </em>case and reject the Comptroller\u2019s contention that the programs violate the Establishment of Religion Clause of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">This brings us to the Comptroller\u2019s further contention that the legislation under review violates the Free Exercise of Religion Clause of the First Amendment. This contention is answered directly by <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Richardson, supra, </em>where the same attack was made upon the Higher Education Facilities Act there being considered. In rejecting the contention of the appellant taxpayers that the Free Exercise Clause was violated because they were compelled to pay taxes which in part financed grants under the Act, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">\u201cAppellants, however, are unable to identify any coercion directed at the practice or exercise of their religious beliefs.\u201d 403 U.S. at 689.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Finally, the legislation now before us differs in one respect, so far as the First Amendment questions are concerned, from that under consideration in the first <em>Miller </em>case. Under Chapters 2 and 106 of the Acts of 1973, the recipient of a loan may make repayment by employment by a religious organization or activity. We raised the question with counsel whether this provision violated the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment. Since we approve in Part I of this opinion such method of repayment of financial aid in the form of conditional grants to students in nonsectarian schools, we must consider the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>We believe the question is adequately answered in the supplemental brief of amicus curiae Council of Indep\u00e9ndent Colleges in Virginia, where <em>Walz </em>v. <em>Tax Commission, </em>397 U.S. 664 (1970), is cited. <em>Walz </em>held that so long as a state does not single out a religious organization for special treatment, there is no violation of the First Amendment. In permitting repayment of financial aid by employment by religious organizations, the Virginia legislation has not specially favored such organizations in any respect. Instead, it has grouped them with charitable, scientific, literary, educational, and other organizations having worthy quasi-public purposes.
