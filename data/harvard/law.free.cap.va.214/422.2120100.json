(Greyhound), which intervened in opposition to Trailways\u2019 application, held a certificate to serve Richmond, Norfolk and intermediate points, operating over the route defined in Trailways\u2019 application. The Commission ruled that Code \u00a7 56-281 (Cum. Supp. 1973)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is controlling and Code \u00a7 56-281.1 (Repl. Vol. 1969)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is inapplicable and that \u201cthe facts in support of public convenience and necessity . . . [were not] of the paramount importance required to justify the requested certificate\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Trailways contends that the Commission erred in ruling that Code \u00a7 56-281 is controlling; that inasmuch as Trailways\u2019 operation between termini would be \u201cclosed doors\u201d and since only 10% of the defined route would traverse the state highway system while 90% would traverse the interstate highway system, Code \u00a7 56-281.1 is controlling; that its evidence shows that operation under the certificate requested would reduce travel time, enhance travel safety and promote passenger convenience; and that such evidence satisfies the public convenience and necessity standard of Code \u00a7 56-281.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We need not decide which statute controls. Code \u00a7 56-281.1 empowers the Commission to grant multiple carriers certificates to operate over the interstate highway system \u201cupon a showing of public convenience and necessity.\u201d Code \u00a7 56-281 denies to a competing carrier the right to a certificate to operate over a state highway route previously certificated to another carrier \u201cunless and until it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Commission that the service rendered by such certificate holder, over such route, is inadequate to the requirements of the public necessity and convenience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The Commission found that \u201c[t]here is no evidence that Greyhound service ... is inadequate\u201d, a finding Trailways does not contest, and that \u201cthe facts in support of public convenience and necessity ... [do not] justify the requested certificate\u201d, a finding we must view as <em>\u201cprima facie </em>just, reasonable and correct.\u201d <em>Atwood Transport Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>197 Va. 325, 332, 88 S.E.2d 922, 927 (1955); <em>see Farmers &amp; Merchants Nat'l Bank </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 401, 404-05, 192 S.E.2d 744, 747 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Since, on this record, we cannot say that the Commission abused its discretion in finding that the standard of neither statute was satisfied, it is immaterial which statute controls, and the Commission\u2019s order will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-7\"> <em>\u00a7 </em>56-281.
