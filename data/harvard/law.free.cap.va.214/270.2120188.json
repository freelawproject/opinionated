The judgment arose out of a claim against Overnite for damages to goods owned and shipped by Golding from Sand Springs, Oklahoma, to Gaffney, South Carolina. The shipment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>received by Overnite from a connecting carrier in Atlanta, Georgia, for delivery to its destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Process on the action instituted in the New York court against Overnite was served on Thomas Rooney, its \u201cmanaging agent\u201d in New York. Although Overnite acknowledged receipt of the process, it elected not to appear and defend the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Golding instituted the present action against Overnite to enforce the New York judgment. Overnite filed a special plea and a motion to quash the action on the ground that the judgment was unenforceable in Virginia because the New York court did not have personal jurisdiction of Overnite. After hearing evidence on the special plea and motion to quash, the trial court, in a written opinion, held that the service of process in New York was invalid on the grounds that Overnite was not \u201cdoing business\u201d in New York, and that maintenance of the suit against Overnite in New York offended \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d We granted Golding a writ of error to the judgment sustaining Ovemite\u2019s special plea and motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Golding contends there was ample proof in the record that Over-nite was \u201cdoing business\u201d in New York to such an extent as to be legally amenable to the process served in that State.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The evidence shows that at the time Golding instituted its action in New York Overnite had an office in the textile business area of New York City, which was staffed by Thomas Rooney and a secretary. Rooney was a resident of Long Island, New York, a full-time employee of the company, and its eastern sales manager. He had been an employee of Overnite in its New York office since at least 1957. Overnite\u2019s name was listed on the directory located in the lobby of the building where it had its office; it had a listing and an advertisement in the yellow pages of the New York C telephone directory; and it had a direct telephone line between its New York office and its Richmond office. The salaries of the two full-time employees, the rent, and all other expenses of operating the New York office were paid by Overnite from its Richmond office. It did not have a bank account in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Rooney\u2019s principal duty in New York was to call on transportation personnel, advising them of Overnite\u2019s services and soliciting their business in the eight southern states in which it had a certificate to operate. Rooney distributed Ovemite\u2019s promotional literature and carried a business card showing the company\u2019s location in New York, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>He was reimbursed by Overnite for solicitation expenses and his New York Traffic Club membership dues. The exact amount of revenues generated by Rooney\u2019s activities does not appear in the record, but a representative of Overnite estimated that it was in excess of $100,000 a year. When asked on cross-examination if it was as much as $1,000,-000 a year, he replied that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In addition, Rooney was involved in other business activities for Overnite. While he did not actually adjust claims, he \u201cintervened\u201d concerning some accounts and made recommendations for adjustment. The direct telephone line with the New York office was utilized to some extent by the claims department of the Richmond office to have Rooney contact claimants who were dissatisfied with the handling of their claims. Although Rooney did not collect Overnite\u2019s accounts, which was the responsibility of the Richmond office, he was active in urging Overnite\u2019s delinquent customers to pay their accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Freight moving out of New York on other lines could interconnect with Overnite\u2019s lines operating in those states where it had a certificate. None of Overnite\u2019s tractor-traders carried freight into or out of New York since it had no authority to operate in that state. At times, however, some of Overnite\u2019s trailers were physically present in New York under lease to other carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Overnite admitted that Golding had a prima facie case of negligence against it for damages in handling the shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Golding acknowledged, in its argument before us, that if the New York court did not have jurisdiction to enter the judgment sued on, it was void and unenforceable in Virginia. But it argues that under \u00a7 301 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of New York (CPLR), and the case law of that State, Overnite was \u201cdoing business\u201d in New York and that it was amenable to process there.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Both parties agree that we must look to the law of New York to determine the validity of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Section 301 (CPLR), in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">\u201cA court may exercise such jurisdiction over persons, property, or status as might have been exercised heretofore.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">This provision was enacted in 1963, subsequent to the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310 (1945). There the Court declared that a state is permitted to exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>when the defendant, if he is not present in the forum state, has \u201ccertain minimum contacts with it [the forum state] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Hence \u00a7 301 (CPLR) retained New York\u2019s more restrictive pre<em>International Shoe </em>jurisdictional power and reaffirmed the preceding case law of the State defining the power of New York courts to exercise in personam jurisdiction, including the \u201cdoing business\u201d test which is controlling here. <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Finnish National Airline, </em>15 N.Y.2d 426, 430, 208 N.E.2d 439, 440, 260 N.Y.S.2d 625, 627 (1965); <em>Simonson </em>v. <em>International Bank, </em>14 N.Y.2d 281, 287, 200 N.E.2d 427, 429-30, 251 N.Y.S.2d 433, 437 (1964); <em>Blount </em>v. <em>Peerless Chemicals </em>(P.R.) <em>Inc., </em>316 F.2d 695, 696 (2d Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">New York has no precise test for determining whether or not a foreign corporation is \u201cdoing business\u201d within the State; each case is analyzed and determined according to its own particular facts. <em>Tauza </em>v. <em>Susquehanna Coal Co., </em>220 N.Y. 259, 268, 115 N.E. 915, 918 (1917); <em>La Belle Creole </em>v. <em>Attorney-General, </em>10 N.Y.2d 192, 197, 176 N.E.2d 705, 708, 219 N.Y.S.2d 1, 5 (1961). Certain guidelines, however, have been established by New York case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">In <em>Tauza, supra, </em>the court held that a foreign corporation was \u201cdoing business\u201d in New York when its activities within the State were not occasional, casual or isolated, but rather had a \u201cfair measure of permanence and continuity\u201d so as to warrant a finding of its presence there. <em>See also Simonson </em>v. <em>International Bank, supra, </em>14 N.Y.2d at 285, 200 N.E.2d at 429, 251 N.Y.S.2d at 436; <em>Frummer </em>v. <em>Hilton Hotel Internat'l, Inc., </em>19 N.Y.2d 533, 536, 227 N.E.2d 851, 853, 281 N.Y.S.2d 41, 43, <em>cert. denied </em>389 U.S. 923 (1967). Other cases have characterized the degree of activity required as a \u201ccontinuity of action from a permanent locale.\u201d <em>See Sterling Novelty Corporation </em>v. <em>Frank &amp; Hirsch Distributing Co., Ltd., </em>299 N.Y. 208, 210, 86 N.E.2d 564, 565, 12 A.L.R.2d 1435, 1438 (1949); <em>Irgang v. Pelton &amp; Crane Company, </em>42 Misc.2d 70, 72, 247 N.Y.S.2d 743, 746 (Sup.Ct. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Mere solicitation of business by a foreign corporation in New York does not constitute \u201cdoing business\u201d and make it amenable to suit therein. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Surf Properties, Inc., </em>4 N.Y.2d 475, 480, 151 N.E.2d 874, 876, 176 N.Y.S.2d 318, 321 (1958). But if a corporation is involved in substantial solicitation, very little evidence of other business activities in New York is required to meet its \u201cdoing business\u201d test. <em>Elish </em>v. <em>St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., </em>305 N.Y. 267, 269, 112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>N.E.2d 842, 843 <em>(l953) ;Ackert </em>v. <em>Ausman, 29 </em>Misc.2d 962, 967, 218 N.Y.S.2d 822, 827 (Sup.Ct. 1961), <em>aff\u2019d mem. </em>247 N.Y.S.2d 999 (1964); <em>Jaftex Corp. </em>v. <em>Randolph Mills, Inc., </em>282 F.2d 508, 510 (2d Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The \u201ccumulative significance\u201d of all a corporation\u2019s business activities in New York, not the effect of an isolated or single activity, must be considered in determining whether the \u201cdoing business\u201d test has been met. <em>Ackert </em>v. <em>Ausman, supra, 29 </em>Misc.2d at 966, 218 N.Y.S.2d at 826; <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Piper Aircraft Corporation, </em>274 App.Div. 435, 439, 84 N.Y.S.2d 580, 584 (Sup.Ct. 1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Moreover, under \u00a7 301 (CPLR), a claim asserted against a defendant need not arise out of any business done in New York to make it amenable to suit there. <em>Tauza </em>v. <em>Susquehanna Coal Co., supra, </em>220 N.Y. at 268, 115 N.E. at 918. <em>Cf. </em>\u00a7 302 (CPLR).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Finnish National Airline, supra, </em>the defendant corporation was an airline with executive offices in Finland. It had no flights within the United States. It had an office in New York, staffed by three full-time and four part-time employees. The office sold no tickets and made no contracts which bound the corporation. Its New York activities consisted of transmitting reservations from other airlines and travel agents to the defendant\u2019s European office and engaging in some publicity work. It maintained a New York bank account for the payment of office expenses. In holding that the defendant was amenable to suit in New York, the court noted, in distinguishing <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Surf Properties, Inc., supra, </em>(mere solicitation of business) that the business in New York was done by defendant\u2019s employees rather than by an independent contractor who acted for others as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In the case at bar, it is evident that in 1967 Overnite was not only engaged in substantial solicitation of business in New York, but was also engaged in other business activities there. Overnite\u2019s business activities in New York were continuous, systematic and permanent. Rooney had been Overnite\u2019s eastern sales manager since at least 1957. He was a full-time employee, and was involved in prodding Over-nite\u2019s delinquent debtors and participated in freight claims work. Even though Rooney did not actually settle claims or collect money, and he was not provided a bank account in New York, the work he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>performed for the company amounted to more than the mere solicitation of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We hold that the evidence here shows that the cumulative activities of Overnite in New York met the test of \u201cdoing business\u201d in that State under New York law. It was thus amenable to service of process in New York and the judgment entered by the Civil Court of the City of New York was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We do not agree with the trial court that the maintenance of Golding's action in New York was offensive to \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d The New York standards for personal jurisdiction over nonresidents under \u00a7 301 (CPLR) are more restrictive than the <em>International Shoe </em>standard of \u201cminimum contacts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">We are not unmindful of the inconvenience that is caused when a company is subjected to litigation in a foreign jurisdiction, but as the New York Court of Appeals said in <em>Frummer </em>v. <em>Hilton Hotels Internat'l, Inc., supra, </em>19 N.Y.2d at 538, 227 N.E.2d at 854, 281 N.Y.S.2d at 45, \u201cit is part of the price which may properly be demanded of those who extensively engage\u201d in doing business in New York State. <em>See also Gelfand </em>v. <em>Tanner Motor Tours, Ltd., </em>385 F.2d 116, 120-21 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>390 U.S. 996 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Since the New York judgment is valid and thus entitled to full faith and credit, the judgment of the court below is reversed and the case remanded for the entry of judgment for Golding.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\">. Section 302 (CPLR) provides that New York may exercise personal jurisdiction over non-domiciliaries <em>it </em>the claim \u201carose from\u201d a defendant\u2019s transaction of business in New York. It has no application here because Golding\u2019s action did not arise out of Overnite\u2019s New York activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
