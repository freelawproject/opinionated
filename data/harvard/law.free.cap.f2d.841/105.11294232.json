We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">A few minutes after midnight, January 10,1985, Gardner\u2019s cellmate, without notice or warning threw a dark liquid in Gardner\u2019s face. Gardner experienced a burning sensation in his left eye. He flushed his eye with water and called a guard. Deputy William Cato responded and, upon seeing Gardner\u2019s eye, promptly transported him to the Guadalupe County Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">At the hospital Gardner was examined and treated by a doctor and nurse. His eye was irrigated with a saline solution, and an ointment and a bandage were applied. Gardner was released from the hospital around 12:40 a.m. with a written notation that he should \u201csee prison physician tomorrow, 1/11/85.\u201d Early that morning, Gardner was transferred to the custody of the Texas Department of Corrections. Upon arriving at Huntsville that afternoon he was examined in the TDC diagnostic unit. Medical personnel changed his eyepatch and an examination by a physician was scheduled. When seen by the physician, Gardner\u2019s eye was treated and he was referred to an ophthalmologist. In the meantime salve was regularly applied and the bandage was changed. The ophthalmologist confirmed the earlier treatment and recommended that Gardner wear sunglasses and return for a follow-up examination in two weeks. Gardner complained of headaches, blurred vision and sensitivity to light.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">The matter was referred to a magistrate who used a questionnaire and reviewed Gardner\u2019s deposition to determine the specifics of Gardner\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint. The procedure followed has the endorsement of this court. <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Green v. McKaskle, </em>788 F.2d 1116 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Cay v. Estelle, </em>789 F.2d 318 (5th Cir.1986). The magistrate recommended dismissal and Gardner objected. After a <em>de novo </em>review, the district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) district courts are empowered to dismiss frivolous <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>complaints. <em>Green v. McKaskle. </em>By definition, a complaint which does not have a realistic chance of success is frivolous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">Gardner complains that the defendants displayed a deliberate indifference or a callous disregard of his serious medical needs, contrary to the holding of <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291-92, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), which teaches that \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the \u2018unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\u2019 ... proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.\u201d Our reading of this record persuades us otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-16\">Immediately after the chemicals were thrown in his face Gardner was taken to the nearest hospital. It was after midnight but a doctor and nurse administered to his needs. The next day he saw other medical personnel who examined and treated him. The prison doctor called in a specialist. During the interim he was regularly treated by prison medical personnel. The specialist approved the earlier treatment and prescribed sunglasses and caution.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-17\">There is nothing in this record to support a suggestion of deliberate indifference or callous disregard <em>of </em>Gardner\u2019s medical needs. Evidence to the contrary abounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-18\">Gardner next contends that his fourteenth amendment rights were violated when he was placed in a cell with a mental<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>ly unstable inmate who had access to cleaning chemicals. At best this raises an issue of the defendants\u2019 negligence, a claim not cognizable as a violation of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Davidson v. Cannon, </em>474 U.S. 344, 106 S.Ct. 668, 88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986); <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">As we observed in <em>James v. Alfred, </em>835 F.2d 605, 606 n. 1 (5th Cir.1988), \u201cthe \u00a7 1915(d) concept of frivolousness is not limited to a failure to state a claim. Rather, it embraces cases beyond credulity or possessed of little promise of success on the merits.\u201d That concept accurately describes Gardner\u2019s complaint. It was properly dismissed as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
