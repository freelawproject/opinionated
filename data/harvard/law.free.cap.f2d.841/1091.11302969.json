Dewey Harden, Jr. was fired from his position as professor at Troy State University\u2019s Dotham/Fort Rucker campus. The administration organized a panel of five faculty members to review the initial decision to fire Dr. Harden. The panel conducted hearings from July 7 to July 29, which lasted for more than fifty hours and produced a transcript of more than fifteen hundred pages. The panel voted 4-1 to fire Dr. Harden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-20\">Dr. Harden believed that the university had fired him in violation of his constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech, and brought this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) action. Previously, he actively assisted the EEOC in bringing discrimination charges against the school, and helped organize a campus chapter of the Alabama Education Association, a group devoted to representing teacher\u2019s rights, on campus. These activities, he claimed, were major reasons for his termination. Dr. Harden also sued the defendants for defamation, based on their initial accusation of sexual impropriety.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court ruled in favor of the defendants, and Dr. Harden appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-21\">We find that there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s decision, and we affirm. Based on the evidence, a reasonable factfinder could have concluded that Dr. Harden fought with faculty members who were his administrative superiors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>and then attempted to involve students in his disputes. There was also evidence that these disputes centered largely around matters that were <em>not </em>of public concern and that Dr. Harden\u2019s behavior caused disruption and disharmony among the faculty. Finally, evidence showed that Dr. Harden had been remiss in his duties as advisor to the Gamma Beta Phi fraternal organization, had not kept regular office hours, and had repeatedly violated minor rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\">\n<em>Sexual Impropriety Charges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">Although we affirm the trial court\u2019s holding, we feel it necessary to discuss two points raised. The first involves the trial court\u2019s analysis of the sexual impropriety charges brought against Dr. Harden. The school initially listed Dr. Harden\u2019s sexual impropriety as one of the reasons for his dismissal; but, because there was some question about evidence sufficient to substantiate the claim, the school expressly dropped the charge prior to his termination hearing. At the termination hearing, the university presented no evidence regarding Dr. Harden\u2019s sexual conduct; and, the panel did not list sexual impropriety as one of the reasons for the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">Dr. Harden\u2019s sexual conduct only became an issue in this case because Dr. Harden himself raised it by claiming defamation. The defendants answered the charge by proving that their allegations were true. They obtained and presented an affidavit from a former student of Dr. Harden\u2019s stating that she had had an affair with him. Although Dr. Harden conceded that he had slept with the student, he did not drop the claim. Instead, he insisted that his conduct had not constituted \u201csexual impropriety\u201d because he had not allowed the affair to interfere with their student-teacher relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">Although the evidence of sexual impropriety was presented solely in connection with the libel charge, the district court considered this evidence in determining whether defendants violated Dr. Harden\u2019s first amendment rights when they fired him. The trial court noted that the Eleventh Circuit has consistently encouraged district courts to conduct <em>de novo </em>reviews of first amendment claims, rather than to defer to the findings of the administrative panels that initially decided to fire the claimants. <em>See, e.g., Holley v. Seminole County School District, </em>755 F.2d 1492, 1501-02 (11th Cir.1985). Based on this principle, the court properly concluded that it had the authority to consider all evidence relating to Dr. Harden\u2019s first amendment claim. However, the trial court improperly determined that <em>Holley </em>also authorized it to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review into Dr. Harden\u2019s fitness to teach. The district court stated that evidence of sexual misconduct, though not considered at the administrative hearing, was relevant because: (a) it showed that Dr. Harden was unfit to be a professor; and (b) it rendered any error committed by defendants harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">While we agree with the district court that sexual misconduct with students renders one unfit to serve as a teacher, considering this evidence while reviewing the \u201ctermination\u201d is a misapplication of the legal principle discussed in <em>Holley. Holley </em>states that <em>de novo </em>review is appropriate because a facially constitutional termination hearing can exist even when the termination actually occurred for an unconstitutional reason. Thus, when a plaintiff argues that \u201c \u2018an unconstitutional result [was] reached despite procedural ... regularity and substantial evidence to support [the Board\u2019s] conclusion,\u2019 \u201d the court may look beyond the record in investigating the truth of the claim. <em>Holley, </em>755 F.2d at 1502 (quoting <em>Professional Association of College Educators v. El Paso County Community College District, </em>730 F.2d 258, 264 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 881, 105 S.Ct. 248, 83 L.Ed.2d 186 (1984). The district court, read this case, which authorizes courts to conduct <em>de novo </em>reviews of the <em>decision-making process </em>to guarantee that there were no constitutional violations, as one that authorized courts to reevaluate a teacher\u2019s fitness to teach whenever that teacher claims that he or she was fired for exercising free speech rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>We disagree with the district court\u2019s interpretation. Newly uncovered evidence regarding the claimant\u2019s earlier conduct can never serve as a basis for the \u201creal reason\u201d that a board fired a professor, and so is entirely irrelevant on that issue. Therefore, the district court should not have considered this evidence in reviewing the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">\n<em>Mt. Healthy Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">The first time the Eleventh Circuit considered this case, it found that \u201c[t]he district court .erred in concluding that the <em>Mt. Healthy </em>doctrine controlled.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Harden v. Adams, </em>760 F.2d 1158, 1165 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1007, 106 S.Ct. 530, 88 L.Ed.2d 462 (1985). We stated: \u201cFirst, that doctrine is narrower than the district court\u2019s opinion suggests\u2014 Second, <em>Mt. Healthy </em>is distinguishable from the instant case in that the appellant there did not have tenure, a fact on which the Court explicitly relied in reaching its decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court interpreted this to mean that the <em>Mt. Healthy </em>test does not apply to tenured teachers. On remand, the trial judge first expressed his disagreement with the circuit panel, and then stated that he did not know what standard to apply instead of <em>Mt. Healthy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">We would like to clarify the issue. The district court was correct in stating that <em>Mt. Healthy </em>applies regardless of whether a teacher has tenure. <em>See, e.g., Holley, </em>755 F.2d at 1500 (applying <em>Mt. Healthy </em>test to evaluate tenured teacher\u2019s claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">The circuit panel had also recognized this. <em>See Harden, </em>760 F.2d at 1165 (\u201c[Rjeliance on impermissible factors does not, in and of itself, render a termination decision unconstitutional, if there were other, permissible reasons for the termination which were sufficient to support the decision.\u201d) <em>(citing Mt. Healthy Board of Education v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 285-86, 97 S.Ct. 568, 575, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">We believe that the earlier panel had simply meant that the district court had misapplied <em>Mt. Healthy </em>by failing to apply it correctly in light of Dr. Harden\u2019s tenured status. When a teacher is tenured, \u201ca university [must] make a considerably stronger showing than the appellees did in <em>Mt. Healthy </em>\u201d to justify dismissal. <em>Harden, </em>760 F.2d at 1165. Such was done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-11\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-12\">The trial court rendered a lengthy and detailed analysis of this matter. Except for the minor instances discussed above, we find the record amply supports the conclusions reached for the reasons stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-13\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">. Harden also alleged that the university had denied him procedural due process by organizing a biased committee determined to uphold the initial decision to fire him; and, he asserted that the administration had decided to fire him regardless of the panel\u2019s findings. However, we find that there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court's determination that Harden received a fair hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1182-8\"><em>. </em>In <em>Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 286, 97 S.Ct. 568, 575, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), the Supreme Court reasoned that a teacher should not be able to \u201cprevent his employer from ... reaching a decision not to rehire him based on [his performance] record, simply because the protected [conduct] makes the employer more certain of his decision.\u201d Therefore, if an employer would have fired the employee anyway, the employer\u2019s decision will not be reversed based on the employee\u2019s exercise of his or her first amendment rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
