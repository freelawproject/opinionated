The relevant legal principles in this case are settled and challenged only in their application. That this is a capital case sounds no greater call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>for studied and evenhanded application than ought always be at hand. At the same time and as I will insist, the binary choice of life or death tolerates no mediating, graduating scale of consequences for slippage in protecting rights constitutionally secured to persons whose life the State would take. Ours was no watery eyed decision. When a prosecutor with a close case repeatedly asks the jury to do what it must not \u2014 infer the accused\u2019s guilt from his insistence that the state prove its case without his testimony \u2014 the conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Facts matter \u2014 at every level. And the events at trial must be mastered to give to grandly stated constitutional norms their content, meaning, and force. To these eyes, the undisputed record of what occurred at this trial permits no answer in service of the constitutional principle at issue but the one we gave. The question is not whether the jury <em>could </em>have convicted Gongora of capital murder absent the error; rather, it is whether the admissible evidence of Gongora\u2019s guilt presented the State with a difficult case, and whether the comments on silence closed the evidentiary gap. The prosecutor persisted in asking the jury to infer Gongora\u2019s guilt from his not taking the stand. Such a blatant violation of a primer rule of criminal trials by a felony prosecutor from a major metropolitan city is no accident. It is in the heat of trial with close cases that able counsel sometimes give way to the frustration of being denied an opportunity to shore their case. Viewed objectively, the effort was to enhance the opportunity for conviction. Whatever other post hoc speculation may be offered, it cannot erase the record \u2014 of the arguments made and the evidence presented of Gongora\u2019s participation in the robbery and death of Delfino Sierra.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The responsive path of the law here reflects the power of prosecutorial comment. Our jurisprudence long tolerated comment on a defendant\u2019s silence, persuaded that the Fifth Amendment was adopted only to forbid a defendant\u2019s coerced testimony. But the very force of these prosecutorial comments came to be viewed in pragmatic terms as being coercive in fact, not to be turned by anemic, routinized instructions to disregard. Alluding to this history here is only to remind that the effectiveness of such comments has not changed \u2014 and that their temptation for a prosecutor with a less-than-compelling case remains great. So an effort to save a verdict tainted by such violations with contentions that the State\u2019s case was overwhelming at least demands close scrutiny of the facts. I resolve no facts. I only recount the versions competing for the jury\u2019s verdict, leaving them to reject with their own voice the view that there were none that offered succor to the defendant. There were, and I will describe them.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The State\u2019s theory was that six men in a van spotted Delfino Sierra walking on Northside Drive in Fort Worth, Texas, that two of the men approached Delfino Sierra, that one was the shooter, and that the other was the accomplice. After sorting and re-sorting this deck of six, the State rested its capital case against Gongora upon its ability to persuade the jury that he was one of those two men \u2014 specifically, the shooter. Gongora admitted, in a pre-indictment statement to police investigators introduced into evidence at trial, that he was in the van when the men spotted Sierra walking and that \u201cwe wanted to ... get a little money.\u201d He did not admit that he was one of the two men who approached Sierra. Rather, his account of events, accepted as true and understood together with Juan Vargas\u2019s initial sworn statement to police, can lead to no other conclusion than that Gongora <em>remained in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number><em>the van </em>after Vargas, the van driver, dropped off the shooter and his accomplice in a parking lot across the street and to the east of the intersection where Sierra was shot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Gongora recounted that \u201cwe passed [Sierra on Northside Drive] ... and pulled into the little store before you pass the railroad tracks,\u201d that <em>\u201cwe did a U-tum </em>in the parking lot and went back towards where [Sierra] was walking,\u201d that \u201cnext thing I remember the side door opened, all of us <em>were going to get out then there were gunshots,\u201d </em>that \u201cI turned around and saw the guy that was wearing the cowboy hat laying on the ground,\u201d and that \u201c[r]ight after the shots all of us jumped back in the van and we left.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For his part, Vargas \u2014 an indicted co-conspirator who testified under plea as the State\u2019s star witness \u2014 insisted in his initial, pre-plea statement that he stopped at the \u201clittle store\u201d on Northside Drive before the railroad tracks; that Carlos Almanza (the shooter) and James Luedtke (the accomplice) <em>jumped out in the store\u2019s parking lot and crossed Northside Drive on foot </em>toward Sierra; and that Vargas did a U-turn in the parking lot, drove back toward Sierra, and stopped in a driveway on Calhoun Street.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The \u25a0 only part of Vargas\u2019s story that changed at trial was the identity of the two men who jumped out of the van and walked across the street \u2014 this, after extensive plea negotiations between Vargas, his lawyer, and both prosecutors. The prosecution presented Vargas\u2019s trial version of the respective routes of the van and its six passengers as undisputed fact \u2014 a characterization that is accurate, <em>except for the identity of the two assailants. </em>The store, the driveway, and Vargas\u2019s route are all clearly depicted in Defense Exhibit 15, an oversized map of the crime scene drawn by a detective in open court based on the Vargas accounts and the account of the only neutral eyewitness, Sonia Ramos. The exhibit was admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>into evidence without objection by the prosecution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Putting Gongora\u2019s account together with Vargas\u2019s initial statement and accepting both as true, Gongora <em>must </em>have remained in the van after Vargas dropped off Almanza and Luedtke in the parking lot and until the van arrived in the driveway on Calhoun Street south-east of Sierra and his two assailants. In this version of events, Gongora\u2019s statement that \u201call of us were going to get out then there were gunshots\u201d refers to Gongora and the remaining three men in the van. Indeed, the apparent absence of any time gap between the moment when Gongora was \u201cgoing to get out\u201d of the van and the \u201cgunshots\u201d not only maps perfectly onto Vargas\u2019s testimony that he heard the shots shortly after he pulled into the driveway, but makes sense only if the shooter and the accomplice, who had to walk for some distance to cross the street and intercept Sierra (and whom Ramos spotted walking with Sierra for some time) were already long since out of the van. And the fact that Gongora had to \u201cturn[ ] around\u201d to see \u201c[Sierra] laying on the ground\u201d is consistent with the location of the van at the time of the shooting (in the driveway) as well as Vargas\u2019s testimony that he could see the shooting from the van. Finally, both of Vargas\u2019s accounts had the shooter jumping out of the front passenger seat, whereas Gongora noted only that \u201cthe side door opened.\u201d It bears reminding that Gongora gave his statement without the benefit of counsel \u2014 before the criminal complaint was filed and the grand jury returned an indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">At best, Gongora admits that he briefly exited the van <em>after </em>Vargas looped the van back toward Sierra and temporarily stalled out his engine in the driveway on Calhoun Street. Gongora stated that \u201call of us <em>were going to get out then there were gunshots </em>\u201d and that \u201cI <em>turned around </em>and saw the guy that was wearing the cowboy hat laying on the ground.\u201d By this language, Gongora was still in the van or about to get out when he heard the gunshots. With that in mind, the jury could have reasonably concluded that Gongora\u2019s statement that \u201call of us jumped back in the van\u201d refers to the fact that the two men who accosted Sierra got back into the van <em>(ie., </em>\u201ceveryone was back inside\u201d). This point was not lost on the defense, which reminded the jury that \u201cif you read the statement, he never got out of the van ... that\u2019s one version you can take from this.\u201d Or, Gongora could have been referring to himself and the remaining passengers \u2014 after all, in Vargas\u2019s accounts, the shooter and accomplice did not reenter the van until it pulled back out of the driveway onto Calhoun Street.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> What is certain is that Gongora did not, as suggested by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>CCA, admit that he was one of the two men who approached Sierra \u2014 an admission that would have directly contradicted his insistence that he did not know \u201cwho got down with the gun.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And the jury heard sharply diverging accounts of the identity of the shooter and his accomplice \u2014 two from Vargas, the State\u2019s key witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In Vargas\u2019s initial sworn statement to police, Carlos Almanza and James Luedtke (\u201cGuero\u201d/\u201cWero\u201d) jumped out of the van in the parking lot and walked across the street toward Sierra. Almanza was the shooter, and the other three men in the van were left unmentioned. This account was corroborated by Vargas\u2019s wife as well as by Almanza\u2019s former cell mate Ramiro Enriquez, who had no stake in the case and testified that Almanza admitted to the killing in prison.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to Enriquez, Almanza gave an account in which Vargas parked his van across the street from Sierra and Almanza got out of the van \u201cwith some of his homeboys (I\u2019m not sure how many),\u201d crossed the street toward Sierra, said \u201cwhat\u2019s up\u201d in Spanish, shot Sierra in the back of his head, stood over his body, and, finally, got picked up by Vargas \u2014 an account that closely resembles Sonia Ramos\u2019s eyewitness account, Vargas\u2019s initial statement, and Luedtke\u2019s trial testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The prosecution\u2019s ballistics expert could not rule out the possibility that the bullets recovered from Sierra\u2019s body came from the same gun that Almanza used in a second, non-fatal shooting later that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">The State\u2019s case against Gongora did not exist until Vargas, the driver, made one critical change to his story, substituting Gongora for Almanza and Albert Orosco for Luedtke as the two men who walked across the street.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That was Vargas\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>proffer to the prosecution, conditioned, as the jury was well aware, on his receipt of a 23-year sentence instead of a trial for capital murder. With this exculpation, Luedtke, of course, followed with the same account, clearing himself from the risk of capital charges and giving the State a second witness.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even as he took the stand, however, Luedtke gave testimony consistent with his initial role as the accomplice, offering minute details about the shooting and stating that he heard the shooter utter specific words to Sierra (\u201ccasa la febio\u201d)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> when the jury could have very reasonably concluded, based on common sense and Vargas\u2019s testimony that the shots rang out immediately after he pulled into the driveway, that only the shooter and the accomplice would have been able to hear what passed between themselves and Sierra.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Sonia Ramos, the sole independent eyewitness, testified only that she spotted two men walking with Sierra about a block ahead of her as she was driving west on Northside Drive and that the man walking to Sierra\u2019s left shot him in the intersection of Northside and Calhoun. Ramos testified that she did not even notice the van until she glanced over her shoulder while turning right on the opposite corner of the next cross-street past the intersection, a block away (\u201cI looked back, I seen the van, and then I took off\u2019). Ramos twice stated that she did <em>not </em>see who got back into the van, nor did she indicate whether she was in a position to see anyone around the van. She noticed the van because its reverse lights were on,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> suggesting that Vargas and the three passengers were already backing out into Calhoun Street (where, according to Vargas, they intercepted the shooter and the accomplice). As the State conceded during its closing argument, Ramos\u2019s placement of the shooter to Sierra\u2019s left ran headlong into Vargas\u2019s revised ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>count, casting doubt not only on Gongora\u2019s role as the shooter, but on Vargas\u2019s revised account more generally.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\"><em>This </em>was the posture of the State\u2019s casein-chief when the prosecutor repeatedly reminded the jury, in the face of sustained objections and in a closing rebuttal that could not be answered by the defense, that <em>Gongora </em>\u2014 unlike, say, James Luedtke\u2014 failed to testify to explain his \u201crole\u201d in Sierra\u2019s robbery and shooting. That the prosecutor unrelentingly pounded on Gongora\u2019s silence \u2014 first directly and later by implication \u2014 cannot seriously be disputed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> And understood in the context of the narratives competing for the jury\u2019s verdict, the effect of these comments was deadly. After all, \u201c[w]ho do you expect to hear from? The person who wasn\u2019t involved at all, that had nothing at all, just present during that deal? Of course you hear from that person.\u201d (Left unstated was the reality that those who <em>did </em>testify were heard from only after their exculpation through the plea deal struck with Vargas.)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">It is no answer that there was sufficient evidence to convict Gongora as a party to capital murder even if he remained in the van after the shooter and the accomplice jumped out and headed toward Sierra.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Brecht </em>focuses not on the sufficiency of the evidence sustaining the conviction, but on actual prejudice to the jury\u2019s verdict.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Here, the prosecution itself repeatedly em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>phasized that the six van-inhabitants\u2019 respective \u201croles\u201d in Sierra\u2019s robbery and murder were critical to gauging their culpability. And as reflected in the jury instructions, the State\u2019s law-of-the-parties theory was narrow, hinging on the notion that Gongora was either the shooter or the accomplice. The prosecution knew that its case rested on the testimony that it had plea bargained for \u2014 and that there was significant evidence in the record to support either of Vargas\u2019s diverging accounts. And it perceived, correctly, that reasonable doubts remained. It is in this context that the comments on Gongora\u2019s silence took their toll.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">I am keenly aware of the Supreme Court\u2019s strong enforcement of AEDPA and the principles of federalism in which the Act is grounded \u2014 a command anticipated in and subsumed by <em>Brecht.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I remain convinced that the prosecutor\u2019s unrelenting Fifth Amendment violations here infected every aspect of Gongora\u2019s trial; that they had a real, substantial, and injurious effect on the jury\u2019s verdict, causing the jury to accept the State\u2019s theory that Gongora was either the shooter or the accomplice when the evidence identifying him as such came from the shifting and contradicted testimony of co-conspirators who were high on heroin and drunk at the time of the shooting, questioned their own recollection of events, changed their stories prior to trial, and testified under plea or fear of charges. It signifies that during oral argument, counsel for the State conceded that the prosecutor who handled the closing rebuttal may have become \u201cemotional\u201d and may have reached \u201cthe point where this guy feels like he\u2019s got to say something to establish the credibility of these accomplice witnesses.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Even were <em>AEBPA/Chaprmn </em>to govern our review, declaring the <em>Griffin </em>errors in this case \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d would drain the right to silence of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>meaning. Such a conclusion cannot, by any stretch of language, be characterized as fairminded or reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">I have lifted from the record one narrative that the jury could have drawn. That another, the State\u2019s, can be drawn is no answer to the prosecutor\u2019s impermissible argument \u2014 one born of a fear that the jury would not accept that version of events as true beyond a reasonable doubt. So, I say only that I share this felony prosecutor\u2019s doubts \u2014 grave doubts that caused him to make what he well knew was an argument that was potent, and forbidden because it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-5\">.

I'm not sure what he was wearing but I remember he was wearing a cowboy hat. We passed him up and <em>pulled into the little store before you pass the railroad tracks. ~We did a U-turn in the parking lot and went back towards where the guy was walking. </em>All we wanted to do is get a little money and go about our business. <em>Next thing I remember the side door opened, all of us were going to get out then there were gunshots, I turned around and saw the guy that was wearing the cowboy hat laying on the ground. </em>I think there was about three fast shots fired. <em>Right after the shots all of us jumped back in the van and we left </em>....

Moreover, the jury heard \u2014 from Vargas, the police detective, and the prosecution itself \u2014 that the only aspect of Vargas\u2019s story that changed was the identity of the two men who jumped out in the parking lot and assailed Sierra. <em>See, e.g., </em>37 RR 135-137, 38 RR 151-52.

It would not have been lost on the jury that Vargas and Luedtke had an incentive to downplay their own level of participation in the crime: admitting any overt act in furtherance of the robbery could serve to inculpate them as parties. And the remaining men in the van \u2014 Orosco, Almanza, and Steven Gongora \u2014 all refused to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">.

The corroboration by Vargas's wife requires some explanation. As the CCA observed on direct review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">[Vargas\u2019s wife Maria] Morales [gave a sworn statement to police] that on a night around the time of the offense, Vargas came home crying.

However, Gongora's jury only heard a police detective testily that Morales's statement was \"consistent with\u201d Vargas\u2019s initial account, that the detective had \"interviewed her independently,\" that he \"didn\u2019t interject anything as to who I had spoken to or anything else like that,\u201d and that he \"allowed her to tell me what she knew and without any other guidance or pushing or anything like that.\u201d The trial court refused to allow Gongora to introduce Morales's full statement or cross-examine her. Gongora raised the issue on direct appeal, but the CCA flatly concluded that \"even if the trial court abused its discretion ..., [Gongora] was not harmed by this error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Three judges dissented, concluding that the error warranted a new trial. <em>See id. </em>at *15. Gongora did not raise the issue before our panel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b731-14\">. Of course, Luedtke testified that <em>Gongora, </em>not Almanza, was the shooter who spoke to Sierra and stood over his dead body \u2014 but only after Vargas cut Luedtke loose with the plea agreement, substituting Gongora for Almanza and Orosco for Luedtke.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b731-15\">.

The prosecution did not deliver a coherent narrative of why Vargas initially inculpated Luedtke while \"covering\u201d for Albert Orosco. Luedtke was a card-carrying member of the Puero Li'I Mafia, of which Vargas was a leader, while Orosco had no affiliation with the gang. Police did not talk to Luedtke until six months before Gongora\u2019s trial \u2014 over a year after the shooting. Dylan Griffith, another PLM member not involved in Sierra's shooting, testified at trial that Luedtke told him \u201cI ain't \u2014 I ain't going down for it.

Ramos testified that she first spotted Sierra flanked by two men about a block ahead of her, with all three men walking west on Northside Drive (in her driving direction). Ramos insisted that the shooter walked to the <em>left </em>of Sierra; that the other man walked to Sierra's right; and that none of the men changed their relative positions before the shooting. There was no confusion as to what Ramos meant by \"left\u201d and \"right,\u201d as she repeatedly testified that the three men were walking on the left side of the street (recall that Ramos and the men were moving in the same direction, so that her left was their left). Moreover, her testimony was consistent with forensic evidence that a bullet hit the back, left side of Sierra\u2019s head. Vargas, however, placed Gongora to Sierra\u2019s <em>right, </em>again relative to Sierra\u2019s walking direction. And though the detective's intake sketch of the crime scene (not in evidence) does not clearly reflect Vargas\u2019s placement of Gongora and Orosco, the panel\u2019s focus was on the defense\u2019s unobjected-to Exhibit 15. The exhibit, a map, clearly placed Gongora to Sierra\u2019s right and Orosco to Sierra's left; moreover, the detective who drew it insisted that it reflected Vargas\u2019s account of the men's respective positions \u2014 in the teeth of sharp questioning by the prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\">. <em>See Gongora v.

Irrespective of whether Gongora was the shooter, those facts establish his guilt under Texas\u2019s law of parties. <em>See id. </em>at 290-91 (Owen, J., dissenting). On direct appeal, Gongora claimed the prosecutor impermissibly commented on his failure to testify. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cTCCA\u201d) concluded to the contrary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANN\">When viewed in context, the complained-of comments appear to be the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to comment on [Gongora\u2019s] failure to produce witnesses other than [himself], which is a permissible area of comment....

However, the court did not abuse its discretion in thereafter overruling [Gongora\u2019s] various motions for mistrial on this issue.

Because Judge Owen has persuasively analyzed Gongora\u2019s claim under <em>Brecht, see Gongora, </em>710 F.3d at 289-90 (Owen, J., dissenting), I offer only brief additional comments, drawn from a similar case in which the Supreme Court recently granted certiorari:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">The majority compounds its error by engaging in a form of possible-harm review that verges on a presumption of prejudice. This leniency appears both in its emphasis on dicta opining about the likelihood that juries draw adverse inferences, and in its ultimate finding of a \u201cvery real risk\u201d of prejudice. Alas, the correct harmless-error standard does not permit such speculation, and neither does the undisputed evidence ....[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">Under the \u201cpossible-harm review\u201d conducted by the Sixth Circuit in <em>Woodall </em>and the instant panel majority \u2014 and exemplified by Judge Higginbotham\u2019s determined portrayal of key facts in the light most favorable to Gongora \u2014 \u201cno error will ever be harmless because one can never know what led a jury to its decision and it is always possible that a jury based its decision on the alleged error in question. But that is not the standard under <em>Brecht....\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Not only did the evidence establish Gongora\u2019s guilt, but \u201c[t]he trial judge, in addition to issuing curative instructions during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, admonished the jurors several times that they could not and must not consider Gongora\u2019s choice not to testify as evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Gongora, </em>710 F.3d at 289 (Owen, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-15\">Judge Higginbotham\u2019s latest response dismisses the instructions to disregard as \u201canemic [and] routinized\u201d without explaining why they \u2014 from his reading of a long-cold record \u2014 were ineffective. He further contends that finding the <em>Griffin </em>error harmless would \u201cdrain the right to silence of <em>all </em>meaning\u201d (emphasis added). That hyperbolic assessment is difficult to square with Judge Higginbotham\u2019s observation that commenting on a defendant\u2019s silence was \u201clong tolerated\u201d because the Fifth Amendment was interpreted, in accordance with its plain language, \u201conly to forbid a defendant\u2019s coerced testimony.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Judge Higginbotham\u2019s response also imbues the prosecutor\u2019s confused comments with almost talismanic significance: So great was their purported effect on the jury that, to Judge Higginbotham, they \u201cinfected every aspect of Gongora\u2019s trial.\u201d By far the better inference is that, after carefully weighing the conflicting evidence \u2014 and notwithstanding the <em>Griffin </em>error, which had no discernible impact on the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case \u2014 the jury, having heeded the trial court\u2019s instructions, concluded that Gongora was one of the two men who approached the victim before he was shot. Viewed in light of the deference owed to the fact-finder and to the state courts, the record compels the conclusion that \u201cGongora has not shown that the prosecutor\u2019s violations of the Fifth Amendment substantially influenced the jury\u2019s verdict that he was guilty of capital murder.\u201d <em>Gongora, </em>710 F.3d at 290 (Owen, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">In response to any suggestion that the panel majority\u2019s error in applying <em>Brecht </em>is not grounds for en banc review, I note that Judge Higginbotham has elsewhere opined that \u201c[tjhis is a court of error,\u201d and its refusal to consider matters en banc \u201cleaves litigants at the <em>mercy of </em>panel roulette \u2014 the \u2018law\u2019 being the unchartered and legally indefensible view of two judges.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Supreme Court itself, moreover, routinely engages in error-correction in the habeas arena.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because the Court reserves summary reversal for \u201cmatter[s] of sufficient national importance,\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it follows that any case evading AEDPA\u2019s relitigation bar \u2014 to say nothing of <em>Brecht\u2019s </em>even more stringent standard \u2014 \u201cinvolves a question of exceptional importance.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-17\">By declaring the error harmful under <em>Brecht, </em>the majority implicitly brands the determination of the TCCA as worse than unreasonable and the thorough analysis of two federal judges as beyond fairminded disagreement. Adding injury to insult, the panel majority not only has vacated Gongora\u2019s conviction but has done so after several years of deliberation. The prospect of retrial has dimmed with the passage of time and the death of the prosecution\u2019s key witness. There is a real possibility that Gongora will go free, despite having confessed.

In defense of his panel majority opinion, Judge Higginbotham takes the unusual step of filing a spirited statement \"respecting the denial of rehearing en banc.\u201d Responding to this dissent, he not only presents his judgment as a substitute for that of the state courts, but he additionally offers his proposed verdict for that of the state-court jury. Ignoring the double layers of deference with which we review state-court habeas rulings, Judge Higginbotham also announces the following <em>per se </em>rule: \"When a prosecutor with a close case repeatedly asks the jury to do what it must not \u2014 infer the accused\u2019s guilt from his insistence that the stare prove its case without his testimony \u2014 the conviction cannot stand.\u201d Such an inflexible standard of review would contravene decades of habeas jurisprudence, not to mention caselaw on harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Although purporting to \"resolve no facts,\u201d Judge Higginbotham credits some statements, disregards others, and generally approaches the case as would a fact-finder in the first instance \u2014 all before addressing the prosecutor\u2019s comments on Gongora's failure to testify. (See, for example, Judge Higginbotham\u2019s conclusion that Gongora\u2019s use of the future tense \u2014 \"all of us were going to get out then there were gunshots\u201d \u2014 definitively indicates that he had not left the van when the shots were fired, then speculating that a simultaneous statement \u2014 \"all of us jumped back in the van\u201d- \u2014 does <em>not </em>bear its plain meaning, <em>i.e., </em>that Gongora had left the van.) Once he reaches the prosecutor\u2019s scattershot comments, Judge Higginbotham unpersuasively characterizes them an \"unrelenting[ ] poundpngj.\"</p>\n<p id=\"ALy\">Almost entirely missing from Judge Higginbotham's thoughtful analysis of the record is precisely what Gongora must show: some meaningful nexus between the error and the verdict. Judge Higginbotham contends that the prosecutor's comments <em>must </em>have swayed the jury because, before they were made, the state\u2019s case was lacking. But Judge Higginbotham offers no explanation\u2014 beyond his <em>ipse dixit </em>\u2014 for how the prosecutor\u2019s borderline-incoherent statements\u2014 which the jury was swiftly and repeatedly instructed to disregard \u2014 \"closed the evidentiary gap.\u201d <em>See Gongora v. Thaler, </em>710 F.3d 267, 285-87 (5th Cir.2013) (Owen, J., dissenting) (quoting the prosecutor).</p>\n<p id=\"Ac8X\">Judge Higginbotham maintains that \"reasonable doubts remained\u201d <em>before </em>the prosecutor impermissibly commented on Gongora\u2019s silence. If that is so, however, it is highly unlikely that the prosecutor\u2019s error did anything to dispel them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\"><em>.Gongora v.
