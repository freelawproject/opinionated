(PNI)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> following a trial by jury in which the then First Assistant District Attorney of Philadelphia, Richard A. Sprague, was found to be defamed. We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>PNI asks us to review the order of the trial court, affirmed by a pourt en banc, denying its motion for a new trial and/or judgment non obstante veredicto.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">We will first deal with the denial of a new trial. The standard on which our review is premised in granting or refusing a new trial is one in which we will not reverse absent an abuse of discretion or error of law which controlled the outcome of the case. <em>Allison v. Snelling &amp; Snelling, Inc., </em>425 Pa. 519, 229 A.2d 861 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We begin with a recitation of the facts sufficient to dispose of the claim raised and reserve until later a more detailed accounting upon review of the judgment n.o.v. issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In September of 1972, Greg Walter was adjudged guilty in municipal court of violating Pennsylvania\u2019s wiretap law (18 P.S. \u00a7 3742) for recording phone conversations while on the staff of the <em>Evening Bulletin. </em>The prosecutor was Richard A. Sprague, who recommended a sentence of fifteen days to one year imprisonment. An appeal was taken to Common Pleas Court, where, sometime in 1973, a stipulation was entered into, the sum and substance of which is not herein revelant.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Because of Walter\u2019s criminal status, his duties were curtailed by the <em>Bulletin. </em>This led to his securing employment with <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer, </em>which is published by PNI. One of Walter\u2019s first assignments occurred in the early part of 1973. An article by Walter appeared in a series of stories published by <em>The Inquirer </em>linking Sprague to illegal activity engaged in by members of the Pennsylvania State Police (then headed by Rocco Urella, Sr.). This supposed association was made by the discovery of an alias (\u201cNicholas Pratko\u201d) purportedly used by Sprague and exposed him to attack by impugning to him knowledge of and complicity in the activity, i.e., the wiretapping of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission\u2019s phones during its investigation of alleged corruption in the Philadelphia police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>During the period the \u201cPratko\u201d stories were being released, Walter also was working with another <em>Inquirer </em>reporter (Kent Pollock) in the investigation of a 1963 homicide of one John Applegate. Sprague, as Chief of Homicide for the District Attorney\u2019s Office, handled the matter which culminated in the two suspects (Rocco Urella, Jr. and his classmate, Donald Scalessa) being released.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">With the resurrection of the Applegate case and Sprague\u2019s refusal to submit to questioning by Walter and Pollock because of asserted statements attributed to them that they were out to \u201csmear\u201d him, <em>The Inquirer </em>decided to proceed to publish a number of articles in April of 1973 (credited to Walter and Pollock) detailing, and placing under scrutiny, Sprague\u2019s role in light of his \u201cvery close\u201d ties with Rocco Urella, Sr., the father of one of the suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Sprague filed a complaint in trespass contending that he had been libelled by the various articles and editorials appearing in <em>The Inquirer. </em>Following a trial which lasted approximately eight weeks and generated over four thousand pages in testimony, a jury awarded Sprague 1.5 million dollars in compensatory damages and 3 million dollars in punitive damages. This timely appeal was filed thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The first issue centers upon the propriety of the trial court\u2019s determination that PNI did not have the right to refuse to disclose its sources of information, and, upon failing to do so, all information related thereto was excluded from the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The facts leading up to the exclusion start with Kent Pollock testifying on direct examination that the first he learned of Applegate was from a \u201csource\u201d who was very close to the Urella family. At this point in his testimony, the trial court interjected, \u201cWho?\u201d Counsel for Sprague seized the opportunity to seek a response to the question, while PNI\u2019s counsel objected. The matter was taken up in chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Counsel for PNI argued that under Pennsylvania\u2019s Shield Law (42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5942(a)) Pollock should be allowed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>testify fully as to the information garnered from the source without having to divulge his/her identity, nor should any adverse inference be drawn from his exercise of this statutory and First Amendment privilege. Further, PNFs counsel contended that, to the extent that the exercise of this privilege would hinder the plaintiffs ability to scrutinize the genuineness of the source, a balance had to be struck in favor of preserving the identity of the source, otherwise the purpose of the Shield Law, i.e., to encourage the free flow of information, would be undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Counsel for the plaintiff, on the other hand, envisioned the Shield Law as no more than an investigative tool, the effect of which dissipated once the information conveyed by the confidential source was placed in print. Also, he felt that if a source signed an affidavit in support of the information given, this constituted a waiver of the privilege. Lastly, counsel for the plaintiff asserted that the remedy for failure to reveal a source should be an \u201cadverse inference charge\u201d by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In response to the assertions of counsel, the trial court entered the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">... the Court determines that in this case the Shield Law is inapplicable and that the defendants have no constitutional right to refuse to reveal its sources. Therefore, it is ordered that the defendant disclose its sources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">If the defendant chooses not to reveal their sources, it is precluded from defending this action on the grounds that the articles in suit, or any portion thereof, were based upon information received from a reliable, but undisclosed source.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">In order to implement this Order, all evidence of what information defendants received from allegedly reliable, but undisclosed sources, shall be excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">PNI\u2019s attempt to secure extraordinary relief from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania was \u201cdenied without prejudice\u201d in a per curiam order. The trial resumed thereafter, and the instances in which PNI\u2019s witnesses (Pollock and Robert J. Terry, also a reporter for <em>The </em>Inquirer) invoked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the privilege of the Shield Law, so as not to reveal the identity of their sources, occurred during their cross-examination and numbered 26 in total.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">It was a month-and-half into the trial, and two witnesses short of PNI completing its case, before the court and the parties discussed in chambers what evidence would be kept from the jury\u2019s consideration because of the June 13, 1983 order relating to the Shield Law. After this conclave, the jury was instructed to disregard the testimony of certain witnesses because of sources that were not disclosed. The court also told the jury that the defendant(s) did not have a right to refuse to reveal its sources, and, for doing so, \u201call evidence of what information defendants received from allegedly reliable, but undisclosed sources, shall be excluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The court proceeded to particularize the information that the jury was to ignore in its deliberations for the failure of the witnesses to disclose their sources in direct violation of his order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">First\u2014Prosecution Memorandum (Exhibit P-3-2). This was testified to by Pollock as having been obtained from a source he refused to reveal. (This document was sent by the Pennsylvania Attorney General\u2019s Office to the District Attorney of Montgomery County, which was the location of a motor lodge where the State Police wiretapping of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission took place; and the first Pollock learned of the name \u201cPratko\u201d\u2014which was associated with Sprague, was from this instrument.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">Second\u2014Any information with respect to the statement in <em>The Inquirer </em>article of April 1, 1973 that read: \u201cSubsequent to the homicide, Sprague boasted to at least one of his friends that he \u2018could get anything I want from Rocco Urella,\u2019 according to a sworn statement by the friend obtained by The Inquirer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">Third\u2014The language in the April 1, 1973 article to be deleted from consideration read: \u201cSprague\u2019s involvement with Urella Sr. became evident four days after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the wiretaps were discovered when The Inquirer leamed[] Sprague spent an entire day in conference with Urella at Urella\u2019s Delaware County home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">Fourth\u2014Pollock\u2019s testimony of a contact close to Urella family who told him certain alleged things. Refusal to reveal source required exclusion of any evidence in respect to this statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">Fifth\u2014Terry\u2019s testimony that he had a source check police records to determine whether Applegate had criminal record was likewise to be removed from the jury\u2019s consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">At the close of the case, the court repeated its Shield Law directive and instructed the jury to \u201cstrike\u201d from its consideration certain portions of the evidence. Numerous objections were lodged and denied; in particular, we cite counsel for the plaintiff\u2019s request that, as to the Shield Law, the jury should have been charged that \u201ctheir failure to reveal sources would warrant a finding that there were ... no sources; and therefore, that would constitute known falsity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">After the jury entered a verdict in favor of Sprague, timely post-verdict motions were denied, and judgment was affirmed by a court en banc (Judge Carson, dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The court below, in support of its decision that the Shield Law was inoperative to the facts, looked to a variety of material, one of which was the Pennsylvania Constitution, Art. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 11. Perforce, the court interpreted \u00a7 11 \u201cas creating a constitutional right to defamation.\u201d This precise argument was rejected recently in a 5-4 decision by this Court, sitting en banc. See <em>Hatchard v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., </em>350 Pa.Super. 1, 18-21 n. 12, 504 A.2d 211, 220-21 at n. 12 (1986), allocatur pending; see also <em>Coughlin v. Westinghouse Broadcasting and Cable, Inc., </em>780 F.2d 340 (3rd Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">The <em>Hatchard </em>majority concluded that the provisions of the Constitution mentioned above did not entitle a litigant access to a reporter\u2019s notes and other documentary material, as well as \u201couttakes\u201d, in the preparation of a libel suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>against a news-media-defendant. Simply stated, the Court was not able to \u201cagree that any of the constitutional provisions cited [, i.e., Art. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7 &amp; 11,] ... create[d] any right to bring a defamation action____\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accord <em>Mazzella v. Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., </em>479 F.Supp. 523, 528-29 (E.D.N.Y.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The court also invites our attention to <em>Herbert v. Lando, </em>441 U.S. 153, 99 S.Ct. 1635, 60 L.Ed.2d 115 (1979), a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that the First Amendment did not preclude a plaintiff\u2019s inquiries into the editorial processes leading to publication of an allegedly defamatory television program. However, we do not read anything in <em>Herbert v. Lando </em>to vitiate our ability to interpret the Pennsylvania Shield Law. The Court there merely stated that the First Amendment does not afford <em>&amp; </em>privilege to withhold editorial processes. As is relevant here, we note that there was no shield law in question before the high Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">More on point, we believe, is the decision of <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972). The issue there was the obligation of reporters to respond, under grand jury subpoenas, to questions relevant to an investigation into the commission of crime. The Court ruled that there was no constitutionally protected right to refuse to appear before a grand jury. Of interest to us is the manner in which the Court dealt with Branzburg\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">The petitioner-Branzburg was a staff reporter for a daily newspaper in Kentucky which carried a story, under his byline, detailing his observation of two individuals synthesizing hashish from marijuana. A photograph of the hands of these individuals was included, and the article recited that the petitioner had promised not to reveal the identity of these two. When the petitioner was subpoenaed by the county grand jury, he appeared, but refused to identify the individuals involved. A state trial judge ordered the petitioner to answer the questions posed and rejected his contentions that the Kentucky reporters\u2019 privilege statute (substantively similar to Pennsylvania\u2019s Shield Law), the First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Amendment or specific sections of the Kentucky Constitution authorized his refusal to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">On appeal, the Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis that, inter alia, its shield law did not offer someone a privilege to refuse to testify about events he had observed. Although the United States Supreme Court agreed, it is important to remember the Court\u2019s caveat that it was \u201cpowerless to bar state courts from responding in their own way and construing their own constitutions so as to recognize a newsman\u2019s privilege, either qualified or absolute.\u201d 408 U.S. at 706, 92 S.Ct. at 2669. This is exactly what we are doing here. Except, we find it unnecessary to embark on an analysis of our Constitution to decide whether the relief sought by PNI is permissible, for it is clear to us that in enforcing the privilege enacted by the Shield Law, we are to construe the statute broadly. See, e.g., <em>Lal v. CBS, Inc., </em>726 F.2d 97, 100 (3rd Cir.1980); <em>In re Taylor, </em>412 Pa. 32, 40, 193 A.2d 181, 185 (1963). Thus, to the extent the court below wishes us to follow the lead of the State of New York, which condoned the preclusion of a media-defendant\u2019s use of any of its sources and information as proof of verification or evidence of responsibility when it opted to rely on its statutory privilege\u2014shield law (see <em>Greenberg v. CBS, Inc., </em>419 N.Y.S.2d 988, 997, 69 A.D.2d 693 (1979)), we decline the invitation. To the same effect see <em>Newton v. NBC, </em>11 Media Law Reporter 1950 (D.Nev.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">It is beyond cavil, as urged and relied upon by the court below, that the ruling at <em>In re Taylor, supra, </em>in which the scope of the precursor of the present Shield Law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was being construed, contained the following verbiage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">The language of each Constitution [, i.e., state and federal,] is clear, and by no stretch of language can it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>protect or include under \u201cfreedom of the press,\u201d the non-disclosure of sources of information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">412 Pa. at 39, 193 A.2d at 184. If we were to proceed no farther in our reading, we might be inclined to agree with the court below sanctioning PNI for its election not to disclose its sources. We do not because one must \u201cread on\u201d to secure the full meaning of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">One learns that the media-defendant\u2019s right of non-disclosure was predicated upon the shield law, a statute which the Court repeatedly cautioned should be construed broadly so as to avail anyone invoking its privilege the right of non-disclosure with respect to \u201cany source of any information\u201d. The defendant implemented the privilege to avoid having to disclose its sources to a grand jury investigating crime. This would appear to be consistent with the later ruling of <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, supra</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accord <em>Maressa v. New Jersey Monthly, </em>89 N.J. 176, 445 A.2d 376, 383 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 907, 103 S.Ct. 211, 74 L.Ed.2d 169 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"AtPm\">The <em>Taylor </em>Court was quite emphatic in its belief that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>It is a matter of widespread common and therefore of Judicial knowledge that newspapers and news media are the principal source of news concerning daily local, State, National and international events. We would be unrealistic if we did not take judicial notice of another matter of wide public knowledge and great importance, namely, that important information, tips and leads will dry up and the public will often be deprived of the knowledge of dereliction of public duty, bribery, corruption, conspiracy and other crimes committed or possibly committed by public officials or by powerful individuals or organizations, unless newsmen are able to <em>fully and completely </em>protect the sources of their information. It is vitally important that this public shield against governmental inefficiency, corruption and crime be preserved against piercing and <em>erosion.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">412 Pa. at 41, 193 A.2d at 185 (Emphasis added in part; footnote omitted). This tenet has been most recently re-affirmed by our Supreme Court in <em>Hepps v. Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., </em>506 Pa. 304, 485 A.2d 374 (1984), rev\u2019d on other grounds \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1558, 89 L.Ed.2d 783 (1986), albeit in dicta (see <em>Hatchard, supra), </em>to embrace the libel arena.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The United States Supreme Court reversed the <em>Hepps </em>decision so as to require a private individual-plaintiff to prove falsity in a defamation action. In the course of doing so, it recounted that during the Common Pleas Court trial, <em>The Inquirer </em>took advantage of Pennsylvania\u2019s Shield Law on a number of occasions, with the result that the trial court refused to give a charge benefitting either side on the ramifications of invoking the privilege. This fact was grasped by our Supreme Court as a trade-off for continuing to place the common law burden of proving truth on <em>The Inquirer, </em>since it felt that the law of libel was heavily weighed, already, in favor of the media-defendant. The United States Supreme Court did not agree that the libel scales were unnecessarily tipped toward the media-defendant and decided to shift the burden of proof as to \u201cactual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>malice\u201d (a concededly high obstacle to hurdle) back to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">The question arises: Is the trial court\u2019s remedial (exclusionary) measure tantamount to returning the scales in libel cases to a posture other than that set by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Hepps? </em>It would be if one equates the requirement that the defendant disclose its \u201csources\u201d (going forward with the evidence) to be a prod, in essence, to prove the truth of the articles or suffer the consequences of exclusion. We deem it to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">It is obvious to this Court that the plaintiff in <em>Hepps </em>was not to be accorded any preferential, procedural treatment by requiring the defendant to bear the burden of proving falsity to resolve a perceived imbalance in the law of libel when it came to proof. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s belief to the contrary, its attempt to ameliorate the situation by pointing to the use of the Shield Law by the defendant as an equalizer, although not endorsed by the United States Supreme Court, was not condemned as constitutionally infirm. This is evident from the Court\u2019s remark that, \u201c[i]n the situation before us, we are unconvinced that the State\u2019s shield law requires a different constitutional standard than would prevail in the absence of such a law.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 106 S.Ct. at 1565. Thus, the Shield Law was stated to have no appreciable affect on the burdens of proof as the case stood before the high Court, which obviously was cognizant of the role played by the statute at trial without the attending exclusion of \"source\u201d evidence from the jury\u2019s purview.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">To sanction the trial court\u2019s procedural recourse would be, we believe, to invalidate Pennsylvania\u2019s long-standing practice of establishing rules of evidence and privilege by legislative action. See <em>Coughlin v. Westinghouse Broadcasting and Cable, Inc., </em>603 F.Supp. 377, 381 (E.D.Pa.1985), aff\u2019d 780 F.2d 340 (3rd Cir.1985). Moreover, to conclude otherwise would be in derogation of our Supreme Court\u2019s admonition in <em>Taylor </em>to guard against an \u201cerosion\u201d of the Shield Law. In the same vein, we find the offer made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>PNI by the trial court, i.e., either disclose your sources or suffer the loss of <em>all </em>evidence related thereto being considered by a jury on the question of liability, to be no choice at all\u2014a Hobson\u2019s choice. See <em>Taylor, </em>193 A.2d at 186 (Redacting the informant\u2019s name from documents and then making them available to other side was felt by the Court \u201crealistically\u201d to nullify the object and intent of the shield law).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We hold that the trial court, by excluding relevant evidence from the jury\u2019s bailiwick was, in effect, \u201cexacting\u201d a penalty upon the defendant for its exercise of a statutory right,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and trying to accomplish by indirection what it could not achieve directly. See <em>Branzburg, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 681, 92 S.Ct. at 2656-57; <em>Jamerson v. Anderson Newspaper, Inc., </em>469 N.E.2d 1243, 1250 (Ind.App.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Furthermore, Sprague\u2019s contention that PNI\u2019s position would permit it to use the Shield Law as a \u201csword\u201d, resulting in a deprivation of his due process rights to explore the reasonableness of the reporters\u2019 pre-publication actions is not persuasive. See <em>Coughlin, supra, </em>780 F.2d at 342 (\u201cShield Law does not ... result in a denial of due process in violation of the fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">To the extent that the New York Supreme Court takes a different approach to resolve this vexing set of circumstances, see <em>Greenberg v. CBS, Inc., supra, </em>we prefer to retain the spirit of our Shield Law intact and not debilitate it by veiled attempts to strike a balance in an area which we believe is best left to the Legislature to resolve, as has been the case in one state. See Tenn.Code.Ann., Sec. 24-1-208(b), wherein the absolute privilege of the shield law is rendered nugatory \u201cwith respect to the source of any allegedly defamatory information in any case where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>defendant in a civil action asserts a defense based on the source of such information.\u201d For an analogous setting see <em>Hatchard, supra </em>at 222 n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Of the 26 states which currently have Shield Laws,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 8, including Pennsylvania, have what has been described as \u201cthe \u2018ultimate\u2019 in news media protection; that is, the press has a seemingly unassailable privilege not to disclose the source of any information obtained in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Jamerson, supra, </em>469 N.E.2d at 1248 &amp; n. 3. This preference for and continued endorsement of the privilege in this Commonwealth is evidenced by the Legislature\u2019s re-enactment of the 1937 statute without substantial change in July of 1976. See note 2, <em>supra; Hatchard, supra; Jamerson, supra; </em>see also <em>Coughlin, supra, </em>603 F.Supp. at 380 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">We are unpersuaded by the course taken by some sister states in this sensitive and always volatile cauldron of the law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We think it prudent to maintain the status quo, i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>use of the Shield Law and evidence related thereto, which has been viewed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Hepps </em>without any voiced objection by a majority of that Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our approach is no less inimical to the plaintiff than presently exists under <em>Hepps. </em>This is reflected in the cogent observations of Circuit Judge Becker in his Concurring Opinion in <em>Coughlin:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\"><em>... </em>although the Shield Law affects the <em>manner </em>in which plaintiffs [sic] may develop evidence to support his defamation claim, it does not make successful defamation claims impossible. Plaintiff may use other evidence, both direct and circumstantial, to substantiate his claim. Admittedly, the plaintiffs\u2019 [sic] case is made much more difficult by the Shield Law, but that reflects a choice by the state legislature that it is not within our power to upset.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">780 F.2d at 349 (Emphasis in original).

Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., </em>497 Pa. 163, 439 A.2d 652 (1981). Accordingly, the plaintiff, in order to recover, had to establish that PNI published<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>complained-of articles with actual malice, i.e., with knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard of whether they were false. <em>Sullivan, supra; Corabi, supra; Curran, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The material which the jury found to be legally offensive would appear to begin with <em>The Inquirer </em>publication of March 25, 1973, written by Greg Walter and titled: \u201cEx-Official Denies Report Linking Sprague to \u2018Pratko\u2019 \u201d, with a follow-up caption\u2014\u201cReport Linking Sprague, \u2018Pratko\u2019 Is Denied\u201d\u2014appearing on another page carrying a continuation of the story.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Of the twenty-two paragraphs in the article, four specifically made reference to either Sprague or a named, former Justice Department official denying that he (Sprague) was using the alias \u201cNicholas Pratko\u201d, a name which surfaced during the court-martial of three State Troopers charged with wiretapping the phones of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission\u2019s investigation of purported police corruption in Philadelphia. \u201cPratko\u201d was to have been in constant contact with the former State Police Commissioner, Rocco Urella, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The connection with Sprague came by way of a report prepared by a State Policeman attached to the Crime Commission (Sgt. Matthew Hunt). The report detailed that, according to informed sources, a telephone operator at the State Police Academy volunteered that \u201c \u2018Pratko\u2019 was Richard Sprague.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Two days later, <em>The Inquirer </em>carried a story by Howard S. Shapiro\u2014\u201cWitness Ties Sprague To Mystery Figure in Trooper Wiretap Case\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\u2014tying Sprague to \u201cPratko\u201d through Sgt. Hunt\u2019s testimony at the court-martial proceedings. He was to have stated that a confidential source told him that \u201cPratko\u201d was thought to be Sprague. In the second column of the article, it was reported that Sprague \u201cvigorously\u201d denied any link to \u201cPratko\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>On March 31, the same reporter wrote a sequel in which he noted that a decision on the court-martial would be forthcoming. He also recounted how Sprague had been mentioned by Sgt. Hunt as using an alias in the registration of a vehicle found at the motor lodge where the wiretapping took place.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">A second set of articles was preceded by an exchange of communiques beginning with a March 14, 1973 telegram asking Sprague interrogatories regarding the death of John Applegate. The next day, Sprague responded to the executive editor (Eugene L. Roberts, Jr.) of <em>The Inquirer </em>that his prosecution of one of the Yablonski murder cases rendered it \u201cimpossible\u201d to answer the detailed questions posed by Pollock and Walter. He also mentioned his prosecution of Walter, the pending appeal thereof, and reports from \u201creliable\u201d individuals that the reporter was \u201cout to get\u201d and \u201csmear\u201d him. He did state, however, that upon completion of his work he would answer any questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">A second telegram, dated March 16, consented to a delay. Sprague responded by letter on March 28. In it he reasserted that Walter was out to \u201csmear and destroy\u201d him, and those individuals who were present when these remarks were allegedly made were named. He also referred to the \u201cPratko\u201d serials. In closing, he denied any wrong-doing in the handling of the Applegate matter, and was willing to have it examined by an \u201cimpartial, independent individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In answer, Roberts wrote on March 29 that Walter\u2019s involvement in the story would be to \u201caid\u201d Pollock, with the writing reserved to Pollock. Roberts also stated how the prosecution of Walter had been questioned by <em>The Inquirer </em>and how Sprague\u2019s feeling, that a reporter once charged should not participate in a story about his prosecutor, caused him \u201cconcern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The next salvo came from Sprague. He responded in a letter of even date that his purpose was to convey the possible motivation behind Walter\u2019s \u201cmalicious\u201d statements, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>and, as for Pollock\u2019s fitness, he concluded not to allow Pollock an interview either, after being advised by one of his contacts that Pollock had said: \u201c ... we are out to get Sprague.\u201d As a result, Sprague\u2019s willingness to be interviewed would have to occur in the absence of both Pollock and Walter.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Roberts\u2019 retort was in the form of a second letter in as many days that to acquiesce to a public official\u2019s objection to a specific reporter covering a story would be to render the official a \u201cde facto\u201d editor of <em>The Inquirer. </em>This he could not approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Roberts repeated his request that Sprague submit to questioning by Pollock and, this time, one Aaron Esptein. If there was no reply, whatever story had been prepared would be run with a notation as to Sprague\u2019s reasons for declining to talk.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">True to his word, <em>The Inquirer </em>published thereafter two articles, both under the byline of Pollock and Walter. The first, printed on April 1, was headlined: \u201cDid Sprague Quash Homicide Case as Favor to Urella?\u201d \u201cSprague, Urella Tied to Wiretap, Homicide Cases.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The introductory paragraphs to the approximately two- and-one-half-page, five-column story intermingled the \u201cPratke\u201d incident with the Applegate homicide. It then proceeded to \u201clink\u201d Sprague and Urella, Sr. to the wiretap incident, with a denial by Sprague. The article then discussed what transpired subsequent to Applegate\u2019s death, e.g., Sprague\u2019s late-night drive with Urella, Sr. to police headquarters and his participation with police in deciding not to prosecute Urella\u2019s son. Continuing, the writers recited in detail the facts surrounding the homicide, as garnered from those present and a so-called \u201cofficial report\u201d attributed to Sprague, to which repeated references were made as being deficient when compared to and inconsistent with respect to the witnesses\u2019 accounts of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>The article described Urella, Jr.\u2019s roommate\u2019s discharge at the magistrate hearing as coming at Sprague\u2019s urging. And, it was reported that Sprague boasted after the homicide to one of his friends, who gave a sworn statement of the same to <em>The Inquirer, </em>that \u201che \u2018could get anything [he] want[ed] from Rocco Urella.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The second <em>Inquirer </em>story of note appeared April 2, and sought, again, to associate Sprague with the wiretapping controversy surrounding Urella, Sr.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the second and fifth paragraphs, according to sworn testimony given before the Crime Commission by a receptionist in Urella\u2019s office, Sprague was \u201cin constant touch\u201d with Urella.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The other article and editorials in <em>The Inquirer </em>add little to the manner in which Sprague was portrayed in the writings already discussed. Thus, although we will not make specific reference to them, we nonetheless, are cognizant of their existence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">At trial, Sprague attempted to prove that the articles and headlines cited were false, that PNI was aware of their falsity or, in the alternative, acted in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity by failing to determine their accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">While Sprague was on the stand, he denied any involvement in the \u201cPratko\u201d affair or engaging in any impropriety with regard to the Applegate case. In particular, Sprague, in reference to the April 1 article, denied the existence of any \u201cSprague report\u201d and refuted the non-existence of homosexual charges against Applegate by quoting from the summarization sheet in the Philadelphia police homicide file (criminal extract # 260719) containing a conviction for sodomy in 1953 and a 1960 charge of solicitation that was still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>outstanding as of the time of Applegate\u2019s demise. The file also disclosed, contrary to the same article, that Urella, Jr. and Funk (Applegate\u2019s roommate) were administered lie-detector tests and passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Sprague steadfastly maintained that at no time did he try to cover-up Applegate\u2019s death, which was preceded by an innocent meeting of the victim by Urella, Jr. and Scalessa in a bar. A subsequent trip to the victim\u2019s apartment, under the pretext to secure a woman and more alcohol, ended in Scalessa striking him on the face for making a homosexual remark and lunging at Scalessa to prevent departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Sprague stated that because in his own mind he questioned whether Scalessa was saying he threw the punch at Applegate to protect Urella, Jr., he requested they take lie-detector tests, and, also, that LaSalle students be asked what Scalessa might have said to them regarding the incident before the news of the death became public. This was done and a pattern of consistency emerged supportive of who struck Applegate, i.e., Scalessa and not Urella.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">As for the specific content of the April 1 article, to which reference has not already been made, Sprague denied that: 1) he \u201cdeclined to prosecute\u201d Urella; 2) he recommended no prosecution \u201cdespite objections by the police\u201d; 3) he was in \u201cconstant touch\u201d with the then Commissioner Urella as to the investigation being conducted by the State Crime Commission; 4) he was \u201cin conference\u201d an entire day with Urella at Urella\u2019s Delaware County home four days after the wiretaps were discovered; 5) he refused to be interviewed by <em>The Inquirer; </em>6) unanswered questions existed about Applegate; 7) in 1971 he was a Special Crime Commission Investigator in Delaware County to look into corruption after Urella left office; and 8) he \u201curged\u201d magistrate to discharge Scalessa\u2014only \u201crecommended\u201d. Lastly, as for Urella\u2019s late-night drive of Sprague to the police station, Sprague had no specific recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">As for the \u201cPratko\u201d connection, Sprague produced an April 5 news release issued by the executive director of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission disavowing any knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>by the Commission that \u201cPratko\u201d was an alias of Sprague\u2019s. To the same effect, a letter from the Commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police indicated that a conversation with Sgt. Hunt had produced no information to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">In an accompanying letter, Sgt. Hunt recounted how he had been \u201cabruptly interrupted\u201d at the court-martial proceedings, wherein he made mention that a confidential informant \u201cthought\u201d that Sprague was possibly utilizing the code name \u201cPratko,\u201d so as not to be able to elaborate further that he had personal knowledge of who \u201cPratko\u201d was, and that it was not Sprague.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">To place matters in perspective, it requires mentioning that in 1972 the Commission was investigating the Philadelphia police department, and Sgt. (now Lieutenant) Matthew E. Hunt\u2014working for the State Attorney General\u2014was field supervisor for the Commission\u2019s agents looking into corruption in the City of Philadelphia. One of his duties related to the now ill-fated wiretapping incident of the Commission\u2019s agents in a Montgomery County motor lodge that resulted in the court-martial of three state troopers.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Furthermore, Officer Edward J. Brooks, in charge of investigating Applegate\u2019s death, stated that Sprague did nothing to \u201cinterfere\u201d with the case or the conclusions he drew from the evidence. As he remarked, there was only one thing different Sprague did that had not been done before, i.e., he asked that Urella, Jr. and Scalessa be given a polygraph. In 1963, it was the practice of the police that where an individual admitted to the commission of a crime, one could \u201calmost positively\u201d say that \u201cyou didn\u2019t polygraph.\u201d Yet, Sprague went that additional step.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Harry G. Fox, Chief Inspector of Detectives in 1963, echoed Brooks\u2019 sentiments that Sprague made no effort to influence the investigation or his decision-making. He did offer that because everyone knew Urella, Sr., they tended to do \u201csomething more than we do ordinarily.\u201d He opined that if Urella, Jr. had not been the son of a policeman, he would not have been arrested, and, probably, Scalessa would not have been arrested either because, basically, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the recommendation of the assistant district attorney, Sprague.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Both witnesses agreed that a right to re-arrest existed but was not exercised following Scalessa\u2019s discharge by the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Upon the evidence presented, the trial court determined initially, as it was obligated to do under the law (see <em>Corabi, supra), </em>that the \u201cPratko\u201d and Applegate publications were susceptible to a defamatory meaning. The jury\u2019s verdict reflects a concurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">We have no quarrel with the preceding conclusion, nor with the finding of falsity as to Sprague\u2019s involvement in the \u201cPratko\u201d episode or his \u201cquashing\u201d of the Applegate case as a favor to Urella.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Having determined that the printed word was both false and defamatory, we need to decide whether PNI was guilty of doing so with \u201cactual malice.\u201d See Concurring Opinion of Justice WHITE in <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc., supra, </em>105 S.Ct. at 2949, citing <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974) and <em>Sullivan, supra. </em>The task is not an easy one, and never has been since <em>Sullivan, </em>in striking a balance between the public\u2019s interest in being fully informed about public officials and public affairs and the competing interest of those who have been defamed in vindicating their reputations.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The United States Supreme Court has given us some direction in this area in its recent decision of <em>Bose Corp., supra. </em>It wrote there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">The burden of proving \u201cactual malice\u201d requires the plaintiff to demonstrate with clear and convincing evidence that the defendant realized that his statement was false or that he subjectively entertained serious doubt as to the truth of his statement.

We are left, therefore, as phrased most aptly by Sprague\u2019s counsel early on in the trial as the parties met in chambers, with \u201cthe issue [of] whether they acted in reckless disregard of the truth.\u201d See <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>376 U.S. at 280, 84 S.Ct. at 726; Anno., Libel and Slander: What Constitutes Actual Malice, Within Federal Constitutional Rule Requiring Public Officials and Public Figures to Show Actual Malice, 20 A.L.R.3rd 988, \u00a7 4[a].</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Federal cases have provided guidance to the states in defining a \u201creckless\u201d publication. In <em>Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964), the necessity for a showing that \u201conly those false statements made with the high degree of awareness of their probable falsity demanded by <em>[Sullivan </em>]\u201d was emphasized. 376 U.S. at 74, 86 S.Ct. at 216. \u201cReasonable-belief\u201d was not equated with the \u201creckless-disregard-of-truth\u201d standard. The test enunciated by <em>Sullivan </em>is not that of ordinary negligence; and defeasance of the privilege is conditioned, not only on negligence, but also on reckless disregard for the truth. <em>Id.; </em>Anno., 20 A.L.R.3rd 988, \u00a7 4[a] at 998-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The most expansive effort to elaborate on the scope of \u201creckless disregard\u201d, as applied to the First Amendment dissemination of information, came in <em>St. Amant v. Thompson, </em>390 U.S. 727, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262 (1968). The Court admitted that the perimeters of the phrase just mentioned would evolve through a case-by-case adjudication. It then proceeded to discuss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s opinion in <em>Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130, 153, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 1991, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967), stated that evidence of either deliberate falsification or reckless publication \u201cdespite the publisher\u2019s awareness of probable falsity\u201d was essential to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>covery by public officials in defamation actions. These cases are clear that reckless conduct is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published, or would have investigated before publishing. There must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication. Publishing with such doubts shows reckless disregard for truth or falsity and demonstrates actual malice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">390 U.S. at 731, 88 S.Ct. at 1325. An example of the manner in which the \u201creckless\u201d standard is to be applied is reflected in <em>Time, Inc. v. Hill, </em>385 U.S. 374, 87 S.Ct. 534, 17 L.Ed.2d 456 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\"><em>Hill </em>dealt with an article in Life Magazine about a family being held hostage by convicts, which, according to the article, became the subject of a novel and subsequent play. In the article, members of the Hill family were depicted as physically and sexually abused. However, an interview with Mr. Hill stressed that their captors treated them courteously.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Life\u2019s article became the subject of a suit premised upon a New York statute which gave a person a right of action when his name (used to promote the sale of goods without proof of consent) was the subject of a \u201cfictitious\u201d report or article.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Of interest is the Supreme Court\u2019s reference to a Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in that state as an aid to understanding the construction being given to the statute. In the course of analyzing that ruling, the <em>Hill </em>Court observed that minor errors did not constitute \u201cfictionalization\u201d. According to the State\u2019s highest court, <em>material and substantial </em>falsification was the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">It is germane that the United States Supreme Court did not equate \u201cmaterial and substantial\u201d falsification with \u201cproof of knowledge of the falsity or that the article was prepared with reckless disregard for the truth\u201d, which it unequivocally stated \u201cis also required.\u201d 385 U.S. at 386-87, 87 S.Ct. at 541. To the extent New York\u2019s highest court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>endorsed another (lesser) standard of proof, <em>Hill </em>found it to be inconsistent with the constitutional protection afforded the press and speech alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Time, the publisher of Life, defended on the basis that the article was of legitimate public interest and was published in good faith without any malice whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">At trial, the author denied that he had knowledge from the start that the play had no connection to the Hill situation, aside from being a hostage incident. Although stating that the play was \u201cbetween a little bit and moderately fictionalized\u201d, the author thought that the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of the play was the Hill incident. Albeit reversing for the trial court\u2019s injection into its instructions the element that liability could be premised upon \u201csome incidental mistake of fact, or some incidental incorrect statement\u201d, the <em>Hill </em>Court did observe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">The jury might reasonably conclude from this evidence\u2014 particularly that the New York Times article was in the story file, that the copy editor deleted \u201csomewhat fictionalized\u201d after the research assistant questioned its accuracy, and that Prideaux [the Life writer] admitted that he knew the play was \u201cbetween a little bit and moderately fictionalized\u201d\u2014that Life knew the falsity of, or was reckless of the truth in, stating in the article that \u201cthe story reenacted\u201d the Hill family\u2019s experience. On the other hand, the jury might reasonably predicate a finding of innocent or only negligent misstatement on the testimony that a statement was made to Prideaux by the free-lance photographer that linked the play to an incident in Philadelphia, that the author [of the novel and play] Hayes cooperated in arranging for the availability of the former Hill home, and that Prideaux thought beyond doubt that the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of the play was the Hill incident.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">385 U.S. at 393-94 &amp; n. 11, 87 S.Ct. at 545 &amp; n. 11; cf. <em>Anderson v.

The first was written by Walter on March 25, 1973 and, in the headline, denied any connection between Sprague and \u201cPratko\u201d on the word of an ex-official.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In the body of the article, no less than seven (7) references are made to Sprague not being \u201cPratko.\u201d When the story does discuss the two names as being the same person, it does so in respect to a report written by Sgt. Matthew Hunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Neither Sgt. Hunt, nor the attorney who cross-examined him at the court-martial, denied the elicitation of testimony that a confidential informant (telephone operator) had told Hunt that the name \u201cPratko\u201d was being used by Sprague. Hunt also admitted in January of 1973 he gave a routine statement to State Police investigators that he had a source who believed Sprague to be \u201cPratko.\u201d This statement/report was used to cross-examine Sgt. Hunt on the existence of a confidential informant linking Sprague with \u201cPratko\u201d \u2014Hunt admitted to this \u201creluctantly\u201d at the court-martial, and testifying thereto only after being ordered to do so by the review board.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Based on what was said and in light of what was written, we fail to detect how the newspaper\u2019s qualified privilege, in giving an accounting of a court-martial proceeding, was lost in the absence of \u201cclear and convincing\u201d proof that anything other than a \u201csummary of substantial accuracy\u201d was reported. See <em>Curran, supra; Binder v. Triangle Publications, Inc., </em>442 Pa. 319, 275 A.2d 53 (1971); <em>McAndrew v. Scranton Republican Pub. Co., </em>364 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Pa. 504, 72 A.2d 780 (1950); Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">We see no reason why the same qualified privilege would not apply to the second \u201cPratko\u201d article of March 27, provided, of course, it was \u201ca substantially correct account of the proceedings.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 611, Comment <em>f </em>We find it to be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">We see that the introductory paragraph depicted Sgt. Hunt as \u201creluctantly\u201d linking Sprague with \u201cPratko\u201d, a matter of which we have already made note, and corroborated by the attorney who extracted the admission at the hearing. The second paragraph recounted Hunt\u2019s testimony of his informant that Sprague was \u201cPratko\u201d, a fact that did transpire at the hearing, but which in the remaining article was off-set by accounts that a trooper had assigned a vehicle under the alias of \u201cPratko\u201d to Corporal Metro Kardash, that the informant\u2019s statements were hearsay and maligning by inference, and Sprague\u2019s \u201cvigorous\u201d denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">We have read the testimony of Sgt. Hunt, against the story printed, and do not find evidence of \u201cactual malice\u201d on the part of PNI in its March 27 publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">As for the March 31 article, Howard S. Shapiro, who penned the second article, admitted there was an inaccuracy between his \u201chard\u201d copy and the story which appeared in the paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">His original read: \u201c... Hunt ... linked Sprague\u2019s name to <em>an alias who allegedly </em>is registered to the unmarked State Police car used in the bugging incident.\u201d (Emphasis added) The actual article provided: \"... Hunt said Sprague <em>allegedly </em>had used an alias in the registration of an unmarked State Police car linked to the bugging incident.\u201d (Emphasis added) According to Sgt. Hunt\u2019s testimony at trial: \u201cThe second paragraph is false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">Further, Sgt. Hunt and Paul C. Van Grossi\u2014Trooper Metro Kardash\u2019s attorney at the court-martial, confirmed that a Trooper Kury, whose job it was to issue and keep track of vehicles assigned to undercover troopers, testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>at the hearing that Kardash was issued a vehicle in the name of \u201cPratko\u201d. Interestingly enough, this was cited in Shapiro\u2019s March 27 article, along with the fact that the police found at the wiretap location a type of vehicle (a coupe) that had been registered to \u201cPratko.\u201d Neither fact was discussed in the later article.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Additionally, Shapiro said he had juxtaposed \u201chearsay evidence\u201d with \u201cRichard Sprague.\u201d Again, this was not published in the final article.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">When Shapiro was asked at his deposition why he did not mention Sprague\u2019s denial in the March 31 writing as he had in the March 27 piece, he responded: \u201cI did not put that denial in that story, and I don\u2019t know why.\u201d Moreover, the deponent-Shapiro agreed with plaintiff\u2019s attorney that the changes made by the city editor the day of publication were \u201csignificant\u201d, and, in the case of the re-write of \u201callegedly\u201d by the same man, that was tantamount to \u201can inaccuracy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">We have no hesitancy in holding that the actions of PNI (through its agents/servants\u2014copy editors and Shaprio) are not synonymous with innocent or negligent misstatements.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The originator of the March 31 article used <em>specific </em>language to convey his thoughts of what transpired at the court-martial hearing. The re-write, which excised \u201chearsay\u201d and realigned \u201callegedly\u201d, connotes a meaning other than that initially intended.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Instantly, unlike <em>Time, Inc. v. Hill, supra, </em>the trial court did properly instruct the jury that the determination of liability had to be premised upon \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of a knowing or reckless falsity. As acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>edged and approved by <em>Hill, </em>we find it was for the jury to decide, under the particular facts here, whether the conduct of PNI (deletions, re-writes and omissions) altered the substance of the article of March 31 so as to rise to the level of \u201creckless\u201d conduct violative of the countervailing right of a public official to his good name/reputation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Likewise, we conclude that it was for the jury to decide whether the April 1-2 articles were written with reckless disregard for the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">To explicate, the Applegate coverage had its genesis in December of 1972 when Walter received a \u201ctip\u201d that Sprague, ten years previously, had \u201ccovered-up\u201d Urella\u2019s son\u2019s involvement in a murder case. During this same period, Walter had been dismissed by one paper and hired by <em>The Inquirer, </em>whose executive editor decided to move with \u201cforce\u201d on this.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Walter\u2019s deposition reveals that once he located Apple-gate\u2019s roommate (Funk) in February of 1973, a tapped conversation took place, and was followed a month later by a phone interview to double-check the accuracy of the earlier meeting. Walter stated Funk was consistent on both occasions, i.e., Urella went into the bedroom with Applegate, and, when Urella came running out, Scalessa was on top of Funk, hitting him. Nowhere is this documented. In fact, this was countered by Scalessa\u2019s March 5 interview by Walter which placed Urella with him in the living room during the entire episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Prior to finding Funk, Walter interviewed Applegate\u2019s daughter (Nancy DeAngelis) and was informed that an aunt (Lillian, now deceased) had once mentioned that her father had \u201chomosexual difficulties as a young man.\u201d This was consistent with the article that appeared in the March, 1963 edition of the <em>Evening Bulletin, </em>where it was written that Applegate had been convicted of sodomy in 1953 and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>awaiting trial on a charge of solicitation to commit sodomy in 1960. This clipping was in PNI\u2019s file, known by the acronym RUDS (Rocco Urella\u2014Dick Sprague).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">PNI\u2019s efforts to secure local, state or federal confirmation of any conviction proved unsuccessful. However, the summary sheet in Applegate\u2019s criminal extract, which was read to Walter during his interview of the record\u2019s officer, documented this fact quite clearly. Also, the <em>Bulletin </em>reported that Urella and Scalessa had taken lie-detector tests. This was doubted by <em>The Inquirer, </em>and its inability to confirm this fact caused it to be questioned in the April 1 article.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Scalessa was interviewed on March 5, 1973 in Maryland, and he admitted to Walter that he hit Applegate. He was also interviewed on March 10, this time by phone. Scalessa was asked why he would have admitted to killing Applegate when it was clear that he did not. This conversation was reproduced in the April 1 article, and was conceded by Pollock as implying that Scalessa at some time had confessed to the homicide when, in actuality, that never occurred. At trial, Pollock stated that the question posed was somewhat \u201cunfair.\u201d Further, Funk never accused Scalessa or Urella of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Walter had stated he secured a statement from Funk, during the personal interview in New York, that Urella killed Applegate. Nowhere in Funk\u2019s deposition is there any discussion that either murdered Applegate, and, inexplicably, the tape-recording of the conversation with Funk could not be found by Walter. Nor did Walter\u2019s notes of the interview document this accusation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Walter also disbelieved Scalessa\u2019s March 5 statement that he struck Applegate, and that he and Urella \u201cwere confronted with homosexuality\u201d in the apartment because Walter believed Scalessa was made the \u201cfall guy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Scalessa, according to Walter, at some point said that Urella hit Funk. This was crucial in Walter\u2019s mind since Sprague had not prosecuted Urella because there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>no evidence that he struck anyone. However, Funk had never said that he had contact with Urella; he said he was hit by Scalessa. Nonetheless, Walter discounted Funk\u2019s recollection in this instance because Funk had been drinking on the evening in question. Yet, Walter placed reliance on Funk\u2019s story, which indicated to Walter that Urella struck and killed Applegate, because he \u201cbelieve[d] the man.\u201d Is this evidence of selective news-reporting? <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-5\">Roberts was on the stand for over four days, and during that period, he recounted poring over the April 1 article paragraph by paragraph, and being convinced by Pollock\u2019s recitation of the sources for the statement(s) that the story was accurate. He offered that his only objective in circulating the article was to bring to the forefront what he perceived to be the questionable conduct of Sprague\u2019s handling of a case in which Sprague knew (was \u201cvery close\u201d friends with) the father of one of the participants.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>As to the fabled \u201cSprague\u2019s official report\u201d, Roberts could not remember whether Pollock showed it to him. Roberts did believe that if Pollock had shown him a \u201cpiece of paper\u201d and stated it to be the \u201cSprague official report\u201d, he would have felt that Sprague would have been entitled to an apology for associating his name to a document that had been repeatedly referred to in the April 1 article as woefully insufficient in substance and rebutted by reference to other evidence tending to cast a cloud of impropriety on Sprague\u2019s conduct in seeking and obtaining a dismissal of criminal action against Scalessa and Urella.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Roberts acknowledged that he had no reason to doubt the veracity of the <em>Bulletin </em>story of 1963 recounting the events surrounding the Applegate case, e.g., giving of lie-detector tests to Scalessa and Applegate, Funk not recalling falling down or being knocked over, and Sprague \u201crecommending\u201d there be no arrests. Curiously, Roberts stated that at no time did he or anyone from <em>The Inquirer </em>attempt to contact the <em>Bulletin </em>reporter responsible for the 1963 story. We refer to this merely as an aside, for we are quite well aware that what a defendant did, as compared to what it did not do, is the measuring rod against which its conduct is to be assessed. See <em>Sullivan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">While Pollock was on the stand, he gave information relating to the content of the RUDS file, and what he relied upon in writing about Applegate.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Pollock stated that he knew that the March 31 story was false, and he tried to rectify the matter in his April 2 article. When he denied that he had knowledge prior to the March 25, 27 or 31 articles that Sprague was not \u201cPratko\u201d, it was pointed out that he wrote a January 7, 1973 article (headlined: \u201cDespite Denial, Urella Had Wiretapping Evidence\u201d) in which it was reported \u201cUrella told Crime Commission investigators that Pratko was the undercover name of Met<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>ro Kardash.\u201d No mention of this was made in the April 2 article.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">At the time Pollock wrote the April 1 article, he stated that he did not know that Applegate was a homosexual. This is refuted by the record. For example, No. 27 in the RUDS file covered a notation about a Mr. Laughran, i.e.,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac6\">Called the Norfolk Apartments, Clearview Ave., spoke with Mr. Francis H. Laughran, owner. Very cooperative. His records show Franklin P. Funk and Applegate rented a sixth-floor apartment. He says it was general [sic] thought that the two men were homosexuals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">According to Pollock, the aforesaid was in the file, and \u201cit would have been in February, probably, of 1973.\u201d Next, one of Applegate\u2019s two children told the reporters that her aunt informed her about homosexual problems encountered by her father during his childhood. Lastly, as for Apple-gate making a homosexual advance to either Urella or Scalessa, Pollock stated: \u201cMr. Scalessa had told us that that was the case, yes, sir. I believe it was also information contained in the March, 1963 Bulletin article.\u201d Notwithstanding this, Pollock included the following in the April 1 story: \u201cBut his death\u2014along with the apparently untrue accusation that he had a record as a homosexual\u2014was an extremely personal tragedy to his family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">There was evidence that only one of Applegate\u2019s children was interviewed regarding the homosexual charges which surfaced and were reported in the <em>Bulletin </em>in 1963. When confronted with the claim that what he wrote, based on what a single child had told him, was false, Pollock stated: \u201cI wrote all the information I had; except, I grant you, this one particular point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Pollock\u2019s attempt to render the matter innocuous by asserting that it was unintentional and an oversight was countered by Sprague\u2019s counsel by reference to Pollock\u2019s pre-trial affidavit, which was prepared by PNI\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">... that the article of April 1, 1973, w[as] believed by me to be true and correct, and I possessed no knowledge, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>any reason whatsoever to doubt the truth of any part of the aforesaid article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">In another instance, we observe that in one paragraph of the news article at issue, Pollock wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">Urella\u2019s son and a LaSalle College classmate were involved in a 1963 fight that led to the beating death of a forty-eight-year-old man, but Sprague recommended there be no prosecution despite objections by police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">When plaintiff\u2019s counsel inquired why the article reads as if the police \u201cobjected\u201d to <em>both </em>(Urella\u2019s and Scalessa\u2019s) cases being dropped, the question posed was: \u201cDid they [police] object to Mr. Sprague\u2019s recommendating that there was no basis for arresting Urella?\u201d Pollock answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He was asked further: \u201cWhat objections did the police have with respect to Urella?\u201d To this he responded: \u201cNone to my knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Nevertheless, Pollock persisted that the above-cited news article was to be read as: \u201cThere would be no prosecution of anyone, is what th[at] says, not that there was no prosecution specifically as to Urella.\u201d Thus, Pollock denied that he printed a known falsehood.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">As to what \u201cfavor\u201d was referred to in the legend: \u201cDid Sprague Quash Homicide Case as Favor to Urella?\u201d, Pollock offered that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">There was a legitimate, logical question as to whether or not Mr. Sprague had kept the lid on that investigation as a favor to Mr. Urella.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">At page 181 of Pollock\u2019s 1975 deposition, the witness answered the same question differently; viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-11\">It is not now, nor was it then my suggestion that Mr. Sprague did any favor for Mr. Urella in order to receive favors in return.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">Further, Pollock stated that in Scalessa\u2019s interview, he changed his story in response to questions asked by Pollock that it had earlier been reported that Rocco Urella, Jr. had not hit anyone. To this Scalessa answered: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know.\u201d This was not reported in the April 1 article, but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>was in Pollock\u2019s notes. Additionally, in the article, Pollock wrote about Applegate telling Scalessa \u201che was not going to leave until he blew him\u201d, and then in the next paragraph Pollock asked Scalessa: \u201cDid he (Applegate) seem to be like a homosexual?\u201d The answer was: \u201cNo.\u201d As to the approach taken by Pollock in his writing, the reporter did not dispute, on inquiry by the trial court and counsel for Sprague, that the way he wrote those two paragraphs were \u201cmisleading\u201d as to Scalessa.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Lastly, Pollock acceded that the question put to Scalessa, and printed in the article, as to \u201cWhy did you say you did?\u201d\u2014referring purportedly to his admitting to killing Applegate on a prior occasion, was \u201ca touch unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Based on the detailed accounting just recited, we believe the \u201cactual malice\u201d determination was a proper one for the jury. See <em>Time, Inc. v. Pape, </em>401 U.S. 279, 91 S.Ct. 633, 28 L.Ed.2d 45 (1971); <em>Time, Inc. v. Hill, supra; Bausewine v. Norristown Herald, </em>351 Pa. 634, 41 A.2d 736 (1945). Thus, we affirm the denial of the judgment n.o.v.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The final two points we wish to make concern the following. First, the award of compensatory and punitive damages must bear a \u201creasonable relation\u201d to each other,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> as articulated by the trial court in its charge to the jury, and approved by this Court en banc <em>(Kirkbride v. Lisbon Contractors, Inc., </em>357 Pa.Super. 322, 516 A.2d 1 (1986)). In other words, punitive damages are still awardable upon a showing of knowing or reckless falsehood. See <em>Herbert v. Lando, supra, </em>441 U.S. at 160 &amp; n. 6, 99 S.Ct. at 1641 &amp; n. 6, citing <em>Gertz, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 350, 94 S.Ct. at 3012.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Second, we adopt the position taken by Judge Carson, in his dissenting opinion, that the adverse inference was inappropriate, the simple reason being that there was no evidence that the absent witness (Walter) was anymore accessible to the defendant than he was to the plaintiff. Quite the contrary, in-chambers discussions indicated that Walter was in court at the direction of defendant\u2019s counsel, who was asked to make him available for questioning by plaintiff\u2019s attorney. This did occur, but the plaintiff never exercised his opportunity to inquire of the witness when he had the occasion to do so. He will not be heard to complain now. Moreover, Walter was deposed and his questioning generated over 450 pages of transcript. We would wonder what more could be asked of the witness that had not already been put to him during his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In conclusion, finding that the Shield Law of this Commonwealth was violated by not applying it to the case at bar, we reverse and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Jurisdiction is not retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The Philadelphia Inquirer</p>\n<p id=\"Am9\">Sunday, March 25, 1973</p>\n<p id=\"AjM\">Ex-Official Denies Report Linking Sprague to \u2018Pratko\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">By Greg Walter <em>Of The Inquirer Staff</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Allegations that First Assistant District Attorney Richard A. Sprague was actually the mysterious \u201cNicholas Pratko\u201d involved in the State Police wiretapping scandal were countered Saturday by a former State Justice Department official.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Walter L. Foulke, former executive deputy attorney general, said he had been told that \u201cPratko\u201d was actually a code name for one of the three state troopers now being court-martialed on wiretapping charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">\u201cPratko\u201d has been mentioned at the court-martial as a code name used by someone who frequently contacted former State Police Commissioner Rocco P. Urella at his Harrisburg headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">THE NAME has also been linked to an unmarked state police car found at the George Washington Motor Lodge in King of Prussia last Nov. 28\u2014the day after wiretaps were found on phones of the State Crime Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">The car was registered under Pratko\u2019s name, according to Commission sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">The suggested link between Sprague and \u201cPratko\u201d\u2014 which Sprague has vigorously denied\u2014was made at the court-martial by Norristown attorney Paul C. Vangrossi while cross-examining a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Vangrossi represents one of the three troopers being court-martialed, Cpl. Metro Kardash.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">According to Foulke, who resigned his Justice Department post at the start of this year, Kardash himself may have been \u201cPratko.\u201d Foulke told The Inquirer:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">\u201cIN FACT, Urella told me personally that \u2018Pratko\u2019 was a code name for Metro Kardash.\u201d He added that Urella had refused to sign a statement to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Besides Kardash, the defendants in the court-martial are Lt. Stephen Luchansky and Cpl. Curtis Guyette. The three were members of Urella\u2019s so-called \u201cpalace guard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">The allegations against Sprague, Foulke said, \u201cmust be mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">\u201cI know of no such report. Unless there had been other developments since the first of the year, there is no definite report linking Richard Sprague to \u2018Pratko.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">The Inquirer learned earlier Saturday that documents turned over by the Crime Commission to attorneys representing the troopers included a report written by state police Sgt. Matthew Hunt, who was attached to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">Hunt\u2019s report detailed an interview with a telephone operator at the State Police Academy at Hershey. In that report, according to informed sources, the telephone operator volunteered \u201cthat \u2018Pratko\u2019 was Richard Sprague.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">THE LEAD was subsequently abandoned, the Inquirer has been told.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">Sprague, meanwhile, has called the report \u201can absolute absurdity.

Sprague on Monday to the mysterious \u201cNicholas Pratko,\u201d a prominent alias in a wiretapping scandal.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">Sgt. Matthew E. Hunt, commander of a state Crime Commission police unit investigating alleged police corruption in Philadelphia, told the court-martial board that a confidential informant \u201ctold me the name (Nicholas Pratko) was Dick Sprague, that he thought it was Dick Sprague.\u201d An unmarked state police car registered to the Pratko alias was found at the George Washington Motor Lodge in King of Prussia last Nov. 28. Hunt\u2019s detail was headquartered at the motel, where their three trooper colleagues are charged with wiretapping the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>EARLIER Monday, Sgt. Paul Kury, a trooper who assigns vehicles with fictitious registrations to undercover agents, testified that the coupe was assigned to Cpl. Metro Kardash, one of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Kardash\u2019s attorney, Paul C. Vangrossi, asked Hunt about the confidential informant\u2019s data over the objections of Maj. Robert Rice, state police prosecutor, who charged that the information is hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Hunt refused to reveal the informant\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Vangrossi produced a police report, filed by Hunt last January, which apprently spelled out the informant\u2019s details.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">SPRAGUE HAS vigorously denied any link to the name or the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">After the testimony, lawyers from both sides huddled with court martial board president Maj. William Grooms in a noisy \u201cprivate\u201d sidebar conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">\u201cSomebody in the city of Philadelphia is being maligned here by inference in a situation that is grossly unfair,\u201d Rice was heard to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">\u201cWhatever was in the report was in the report,\u201d replied Wallace Worth Jr., attorney for Lt.

SHAPIRO</p>\n<p id=\"ANM\">\n<em>Inquirer Harrisburg Bureau</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b657-18\">HERSHEY.\u2014The outcome of the controversial wiretapping court-martial of three state policemen now depends solely on State Police Commissioner James D. Barger.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Both sides presented final arguments Friday morning and the three-man court-martial board, led by Maj. William Grooms, broke for lunch before going into private session to decide the guilt or innocence of the police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">But it is Barger who must make the final decision after reading the recommendations made by the board. By state police law, those recommendations will never become public.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Grooms said Barger \u201cabsolutely makes the final decision,\u201d and may choose to accept the court-martial board\u2019s recommendations or may reject al tribunal suggestions in the secret report. The board would arrive at recommendations sometime this weekend, Grooms predicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Because a court-martial is not a criminal proceeding, the most severe penalty would be expulsion of the troopers from the force.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The troopers\u2014Lt. Stephen Luchansky and Cpls. Metro Kardash and Curtis Guyette\u2014are accused of wiretapping phone lines used by 13 state policemen assigned to a state Crime Commission probe of Philadelphia police corruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Final arguments ended two weeks of charges and countercharges, with accusations of political overtones made by the defense at the final session.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">Philadelphia\u2019s first assistant district attorney, Richard Sprague, also was mentioned during the court-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">Sgt. Matthew Hunt said Sprague allegedly had used an alias in the registration of an unmarked state police car linked to the bugging incident. Sgt. Hunt is commander of the wiretapped police unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">The car appeared in the parking lot of the George Washington Motor Lodge, at King of Prussia, last Nov. 28. Hunt\u2019s unit was stationed at the motel, where the wiretapping had been discovered by a janitor the previous day.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">Defense lawyers argued Friday that Guyette and Kardash registered under assumed names at the motel, but that no testimony or evidence charged the two with the installation of any wiretaps.</p>\n<p id=\"Aay\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The Philadelphia Inquirer</p>\n<p id=\"APg\">April 1, 1973</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Did Sprague Quash Homicide Case as Favor to Urella?</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">\n<em>This story was written by Inquirer Staff Writer Kent Pollock following an extensive investigation by Inquirer Staff Writer Greg Walter and Pollock.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">First Assistant-District Attorney Richard A. Sprague, whose name was linked last week to former State Police Commissioner Rocco P. Urella in a wiretapping controversy, once declined to prosecute Urella\u2019s son in a homicide case.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Urella\u2019s son and a LaSalle College classmate were involved in a 1963 fight that led to the beating death of a 48-year-old man, but Sprague recommended there be no prosecution despite objections by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">The wiretapping controversy began last November when men working directly for Urella were seen fleeing a King of Prussia motel after wiretaps were discovered on State Crime Commission investigators\u2019 telephones.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">At the time, the investigators were probing Philadelphia police corruption\u2014an investigation that both Sprague and District Attorney Arlen Specter have severely opposed since its inception.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">JUSTICE DEPARTMENT sources have told The Inquirer that it has been substantiated that Urella\u2019s men were keeping tabs on the commission\u2019s Philadelphia investigation and that Sprague kept \u201cin constant touch\u201d with Urella during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">Sprague\u2019s name was linked to Urella during court-martial proceedings against three men who worked for Urella. Sprague has publicly denied any connection with the wiretapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">Sprague\u2019s involvement with Urella Sr. became evident four days after the wiretaps were discovered when, The Inquirer learned, Sprague spent an entire day in conference with Urella at Urella\u2019s Delaware County home.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Sprague recently categorized his relationship to Urella as \u201cvery close, exceedingly close.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">An extensive Inquirer investigation into the Sprague-Urella relationship and the 1963 homicide revealed that:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">A MIDNIGHT TELEPHONE call was placed by Urella to Sprague shortly after Urella learned of his son\u2019s involvement in the homicide. Hours later, Urella drove Sprague to the police department\u2019s homicide division where Sprague, as chief of homicide for the District Attorney\u2019s office, was partly responsible for deciding not to prosecute Rocco P. Urella Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">SPRAGUE ACQUIESCED to police demands to prosecute Urella\u2019s classmate, but asked a magistrate to drop the charges. Urella Jr. did participate in the fight, but was never charged with any crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">THE VICTIM\u2019S ROOMMATE told police he was being assaulted by Urella Jr.\u2019s classmate when the fatal assault apparently took place. Nevertheless, Urella\u2019s classmate was arrested. The victim\u2019s roommate was present at the magistrate\u2019s hearing, but wasn\u2019t called to testify by Sprague.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">THERE ARE DISCREPANCIES between Sprague\u2019s official report, which makes no mention of Urella Jr. even as a witness, and comments he made at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">The story begins unfolding at 10:30 P.M., Saturday, March 2, 1963. Here is the cast of characters:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">ROCCO URELLA JR., 21, a pre-medical student at LaSalle College who lived off campus with his family. His father was then a captain in charge of the Reading State Police Barracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">DONALD F. SCALESSA, 20, a classmate and buddy of Urella Jr. who lived on campus and is the son of a wealthy Washington, D.C. physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">JOHN R. APPLEGATE, 48, a General Electric Company clerk and a patron at Charley\u2019s Bar, Broad and Clearview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>sts., which was near his home at Norfolk Manor Apartments, 1415 Clearview st.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">FRANKLIN R. FUNK, 47, a former clergyman working for the Philadelphia Transportation Company and Apple-gate\u2019s roommate.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Urella Jr. and Scalessa, who was under age at the time, entered Charley\u2019s Bar at about 10:30 P.M., where they met Applegate at about 1:30 A.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">An hour later, the three left the taproom and\u2014at Apple-gate\u2019s suggestion\u2014went to Applegate\u2019s apartment to meet some girls and have a drink, according to statements made to police by Urella Jr. and Scalessa at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Applegate\u2019s family and Funk have told The Inquirer that Applegate was a heavy drinker. In fact, he had been intoxicated earlier in the evening and Funk had urged him not to go out again.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Once inside Applegate\u2019s apartment, a fight began and Applegate was killed. His death certificate classifies the death as a homicide caused by brain damage \u201cdue to blunt impact to head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">According to Sprague\u2019s official report, Applegate arrived home and asked Funk to \u201cbreak out the whiskey bottle for some drinks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">HIS REPORT continues: \u201cFunk refused to get any bottle and then asked the two men (Scalessa and Urella Jr.) to leave the apartment, whereupon one of the men struck Funk, knocking him to the floor and splitting his lip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">Sprague\u2019s report says Funk got up off the floor and both men fled with Funk chasing them to the outside hallway. When Funk returned, the report says, he found Applegate lying on the floor and believed Applegate was \u201csleeping off his drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">When Funk awoke at about 8 A.M., Sprague\u2019s report says, he found Applegate in the same position and he realized Applegate was dead, so police were summoned to the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Scalessa was arrested eight days later on a general charge of homicide. That same day, he was taken before Magistrate Louis Vignola, who discharged the case at Sprague\u2019s urging.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Sprague told Vignola, according to newspaper reports, that he had urged police not to arrest Scalessa because a prima facia case had not been established. Vignola agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">AFTER THE HEARING, Sprague told reporters that Scalessa had hit Applegate when Applegate made an improper suggestion \u201cunder circumstances which gave the defendant the right to strike the deceased and protect himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Urella Jr. was not charged, Sprague told reporters, \u201cbecause he did not strike anybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">There is no mention of an improper suggestion by Apple-gate in Sprague\u2019s official report written at the time and still on file in the District Attorney\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Further, Funk has told The Inquirer in a recent series of interviews that Scalessa was assaulting him (Funk) when Applegate was apparently assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">Shortly after the trio arrived at the apartment, Funk related, Urella and Applegate went into the apartment\u2019s bedroom, where they remained until Urella and Scalessa fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">Funk said Urella and Applegate might have gone into the bedroom to look for the liquor which was hidden. He wasn\u2019t certain, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">Funk said it wasn\u2019t long after Urella and Applegate went into the bedroom that Scalessa jumped him (Funk) and began hitting and choking him, splitting Funk\u2019s lip in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">\u2014Urella ran from the bedroom, Funk said, then Scalessa stopped hitting him and fled with Urella. Funk said he chased the two youths as they ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">WHEN FUNK returned to the apartment, he said, Apple-gate was lying outside the bedroom door, apparently passed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>out. Punk called a friend of his and asked her what he should do.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The woman, who also knew Applegate, told Funk to just let Applegate sleep off his drunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The next morning, Funk found Applegate in the exact same position and he realized his roommate was dead. He called a physician who came to the apartment and pronounced Applegate dead and told Funk to call the police, which Funk did.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">There is no mention of Funk\u2019s telephone calls to his woman friend or to the doctor who pronounced Applegate dead in Sprague\u2019s official report summarizing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Funk was taken by police to the department\u2019s homicide division where he was questioned most of the day of March 3 and given a lie detector test to determine whether he assaulted Applegate.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">At that time, Funk related his entire story and was then released by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">SEVERAL DAYS later, Funk said, police visited him and showed him an artist\u2019s drawing of Urella Jr. which Funk identified as the man he saw going into the bedroom with Applegate before Applegate died.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">Funk also said he was present during Scalessa\u2019s hearing and was willing to testify, but Sprague never called him to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">\u201cIt was over in ten minutes,\u201d Funk said. \u201cI was shocked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">Funk said he couldn\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t see Urella at the hearing. Not understanding what was happening, Funk said he questioned Detective Edward Brooks, who had investigated the case, why Scalessa had assaulted him (Funk) if he was busy assaulting Applegate.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">\u201cI tried to get information out of Brooks. I said \u2018For goodness sakes tell me why I was hit\u2019 and he said, \u2018because you came to John\u2019s (Applegate\u2019s) aid. I don\u2019t remember that at all,\u201d Funk said.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Funk said he was certain of his identification of Urella because Urella had light hair while Scalessa\u2014the man he vividly remembers attacking him\u2014had black hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">A check of admission photographs at LaSalle College shows Urella with light hair and Scalessa with black hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Scalessa was interviewed at his Glenn Burnie, Md., home where he is currently a real estate broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Question: \u201cWas Funk ever struck by anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Answer: \u201cYes, he was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Question: \u201cBy you or by Rocco?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Answer: \u201cBy both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">Question: \u201cBoth of you struck him, why?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">Answer: \u201cBecause he was, well, when I struck him he was being struck by Rocco.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">This portion of Scalessa\u2019s interview contradicts Sprague\u2019s claim that Urella was not arrested because \u201che did not strike anybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">The police report on the incident says that Scalessa struck Applegate on the left lower jaw. \u201cHe (Applegate) fell to the floor on one knee and his elbow,\u201d the report says.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">Detective Brooks testified at the hearing that Applegate had been convicted of sodomy in 1953 and was awaiting trial at the time of his death on a 1960 charge of solicitation to commit sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">His testimony tended to support Sprague\u2019s claim that there had been some sort of \u201cimproper suggestion\u201d by Applegate.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-17\">A search of Philadelphia police records, state police records, records in New Jersey where Applegate once lived and Federal records did not turn up any evidence of Apple-gate\u2019s ever having been arrested on any charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-18\">Applegate\u2019s children were shocked when they read in the newspapers the allegations about their father\u2019s homosexuality. Applegate had been engaged to be married a few years prior to his death, according to his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>FURTHER, CHARLEY\u2019S BAR, according to a bartender who said he knew the taproom\u2019s history, has never been a hangout for homosexuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In a recent interview, Philadelphia Medical Examiner Dr. Marvin E. Aronson said Applegate\u2019s death was caused by \u201ctraumatic sub-arachnoid hemorrhage and contusion of brain stem due to blunt impact to head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">After reviewing photographs taken of Applegate\u2019s body, along with autopsy reports, Dr. Aronson said the terminology \u201cblunt impact\u201d could mean a fist or some other object.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">\u201cIn this case, I will tell you, there are also some superficial lacerations in the area where this injury took place ... it is possible that this was done with a fist, but it makes it not as likely,\u201d Dr. Aronson said.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The fatal injury, according to medical reports, was situated behind Applegate\u2019s left ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Scalessa told The Inquirer he had struck Applegate on the chin. At the time of his arrest, he told police the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">During his Inquirer interview, Scalessa didn\u2019t relate anything about an argument over drinks being served by Funk.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">\u201cAs soon as we got inside that door, we never had a drink, we never had anything, not a cigaret. Right away we were confronted with the homosexuality,\u201d Scalessa said.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">He continued, \u201cI said, \u2018Rocco, let\u2019s get out of here.\u2019 Funk said to me, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to (commit a sex act) you first.\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, you\u2019re not\u2019 and I hit him and ran.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">At a different point in the interview, Scalessa identified Applegate as the person who made the proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">Question: \u201cApplegate made an advance at you verbally, or did he touch you?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">Answer: \u201cIn the apartment, verbally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-16\">Question: \u201cDid he (Applegate) seem to be like a homosexual?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-17\">Answer: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Question: \u201cDid he touch you?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Answer: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Several days later, The Inquirer again interviewed Scalessa. It was suggested that Scalessa had not told the truth during the first interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Question: \u201cIt is quite clear that you didn\u2019t kill John Applegate ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Answer: \u201cWell, I know that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Question: \u201cWhy did you say you did?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Answer: \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Scalessa refused to answer further questions after being asked why he allowed himself to be blamed for a serious crime he did not commit. Earlier, he had told The Inquirer:</p>\n<p id=\"AaU\">\u201cI don\u2019t like delving back into it. It was something that happened years ago and I don\u2019t like thinking about it, let alone talking about it. It has no pleasantries at all. It\u2019s a disgusting thing and I don\u2019t really like to talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AT9\">None of the other people involved, except for Funk, would comment on the case for The Inquirer.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">Urella Jr. was reached by telephone in Bologna, Italy, where he is currently attending the University of Bologna Medical School.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">\u201cI have no comment ... no comment whatsoever,\u201d said Urella Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">Urella was told that Scalessa had said he did not kill Applegate.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">\u201cI have no comment,\u201d he said, then hung up.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-15\">Urella Sr. said, \u201cThis thing is ten years ago and it\u2019s ridiculous to even talk about it ... Mr. Sprague is a friend of mine and we\u2019ve been professional friends for many, many years. I\u2019m not going to get specific about any questions you\u2019re putting to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-16\">HE CONTINUED, \u201cMy son? Well, of course ... he didn\u2019t strike anybody. He was down there and ... it\u2019s all going back ten years ... I know this much, my son wasn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>involved and he wasn\u2019t charged with anything and he took a lie detector test to see if he was telling the truth as a witness and it showed he was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">There is no notation of Urella taking a lie detector test on the police department\u2019s summary of the case.

Arthur Matthews was questioned about the existence of lie detector test results and replied, \u201cThis (the summary) is all that is available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Repeated attempts to interview Sprague were unsuccessful. On several occasions in correspondence to Inquirer Executive Editor Eugene Roberts, Sprague expressed a willingness to answer questions about the Applegate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">But, nevertheless, he refused to be interviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">In one letter to Roberts, Sprague said, \u201cThere is nothing in the least improper that occurred in the handling of the Applegate case, and I would be happy to have that case reviewed by any impartial, independent individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">ACTIVITIES SURROUNDING Applegate\u2019s homicide, documented by The Inquirer, indicate considerable involvement by Sprague as the District Attorney\u2019s Office chief of homicide, although he was the close personal friend of one of the suspect\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">Scalessa\u2019s La Salle College classmates have told The Inquirer that Scalessa was \u201cshocked\u201d when he learned of Applegate\u2019s death from a newspaper account.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">An article in the March 4, 1963, Philadelphia Inquirer was shown to Scalessa by a classmate because Scalessa had been bragging earlier that day about how he and Urella had beaten up a couple of men.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">Scalessa called Urella, he told The Inquirer, then went to Urella\u2019s home where he discussed the situation with Urella Jr. and his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">AT 12:55 A.M. ON MARCH 5, 1963\u2014several hours after Urella Sr. first learned of his son\u2019s involvement in the homicide\u2014Urella Sr. placed a call to Sprague\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Sprague was not in, but Urella left a message with Sprague\u2019s wife that it was important for Sprague to get in touch with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">A private detective had been hired by Sprague\u2019s wife at the time to trace her husband\u2019s movements. The detective\u2019s report was later used in connection with a divorce proceeding brought by Sprague that is still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The private detective reported that Sprague returned to his home shortly before 4 A.M. on March 5, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Later in the day, Sprague\u2019s wife asked him about the call from Urella because, she told The Inquirer, the Urellas had been friends for a number of years and she was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Sprague told his wife that Urella\u2019s son and another ... were involved in the killing of a center city man.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">\u201cI asked Dick (Sprague) what he had done. He said everything was \u2018taken care of,\u2019 \u201d Mrs. Sprague said.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">IT WASN\u2019T LONG after Sprague had made the comment to his wife that Urella picked him up to go, Sprague told his wife, \u201cto homicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">Mrs. Sprague not only recalls the incident, but she kept detailed notes about it in a diary that she has shown The Inquirer to document her story.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">This story has also been confirmed by another Inquirer source close to the Urella family.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">A series of meetings followed between Sprague and police, according to what Sprague told newspapers at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-15\">During one of the meetings, Sprague reported at the time, \u201cThe police department decided to arrest one boy (Scalessa). The DA\u2019s Office recommended there be no arrests, but the police department decided to go ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-16\">Subsequent to the homicide, Sprague boasted to at least one of his friends that he \u201ccould get anything I want from Rocco Urella,\u201d according to a sworn statement by the friend obtained by The Inquirer.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>THE SWORN STATEMENT also alleges that Sprague on several occasions was driven to a Pennsylvania resort area in Urella\u2019s state police vehicle by Trooper James McCann, Urella\u2019s state police driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">McCann was recently suspended by Urella\u2019s successor, Commissioner James Barger, as a result of an investigation stemming from the intimidation of a witness in the wiretapping controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Sprague and Urella\u2019s law enforcement careers have crossed paths many times since the 1963 homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">It was Sprague who was sent in 1971 to Delaware County as a special Crime Commission investigator to look into corruption shortly after Urella left his post there as chief of the county detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">MEANWHILE, John Applegate\u2019s family and his former roommate wonder why nobody was held accountable for his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">John Applegate is now just a morgue number, along with thousands of others in the city\u2019s archives.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">But his death\u2014along, with the apparently untrue accusation that he had a record as a homosexual\u2014was an extremely personal tragedy to his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">\u201cAfter I read about it,\u201d his daughter recently told The Inquirer, \u201cI called up the man who put the stone on my father\u2019s grave and I asked him to add one more line:</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">\u201cRest in Peace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">\u2018Leaked\u2019 Wiretap Data, Trooper Admits</p>\n<p id=\"A8K\">April 2, 1973</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">By KENT POLLOCK And GREG WALTER</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">\n<em>Of The Inquirer Staff</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">A state trooper assigned last year to the State Crime Commission\u2019s Philadelphia police corruption probe has admitted in a sworn statement that he leaked confidential information about the investigation to men working for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>former State Police Commissioner Rocco P. Urella, The Inquirer has learned.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">At the same time, state police sources say, a receptionist in Urella\u2019s office has given sworn testimony before the crime commission that Philadelphia First Assistant District Attorney Richard A. Sprague kept \u201cin constant touch\u201d with Urella.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">erred in an extensive investigation into the illegal wiretapping of telephones used by commission investigators at a King of Prussia motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">ALL FIVE MEMBERS of Urella\u2019s so-called \u201cpalace guard\u201d have been suspended as a result of the wiretapping probe. Three of the men last week were defendants in a court-martial proceeding stemming from the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">The receptionist in Urella\u2019s office has given secret testimony that reveals that Sprague constantly called Urella for months prior to the wiretaps\u2019 discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">The receptionist\u2019s testimony has been turned over to state police investigators to help them piece together the entire story surrounding the wiretapping of crime commission telephones at the George Washington Motor Lodge.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">SPRAGUE AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY Arlen Specter have publicly denounced the crime commission\u2019s investigation as being unnecessary. Philadelphia police foiled crime commission plans to set up surveillance on possible corruption activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">In one celebrated case, a trooper working for the crime commission was arrested for pinching a waitress in a center city bar. The charges of assault, filed by the police, were later dropped by Specter.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">A high state police source close to the investigation has told The Inquirer that Trooper Gerald T. DeWalt, who refused last week to answer questions during the court martial hearing, has given a sworn statement admitting his part in an elaborate effort to counter the crime commission\u2019s effectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>DeWALT HAS, among other things, admitted tipping off Urella\u2019s men\u2014in a clandestine way\u2014that the wiretaps on crime commission telephones had been discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">DeWalt also admitted in his statement that Cpl. Metro Kardash, one of the three troopers facing court martial, had asked him many questions about the commission\u2019s activities, including what motel rooms were being used by commission investigators.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Three room numbers were given to Kardash by DeWalt, the trooper\u2019s sworn statement says. They were the rooms of supervisors Sgt. Matt Hunt and Cpl. Charles Todd, along with the room number of the investigators\u2019 \u201creport room\u201d from which information was telephoned to commission headquarters in St. Davids.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The telephones in these three rooms later were found to be wiretapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">THE SCHEME to tip off Urella\u2019s men that the wiretaps had been discovered began at about 11 A.M. last Nov. 28, shortly after DeWalt learned that the wiretaps had been discovered, according to his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">He said he called his wife ... and told her to call Mrs. Marion Gobrecht, operator of the Sentinel Motel on Route 202, and tell her that the wiretaps had been discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Urella is half-owner of the motel with Mrs. Gobrecht, according to the recorder of deeds office in Chester County courthouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Mrs. Gobrecht then called Urella in Harrisburg, but he was not in. She left an urgent message for him to call back. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">The receptionist has told the crime commission that Urella returned to his office running, something she had never seen him do before.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">Telephone company records subpenaed by the crime commission show long-distance telephone calls that support DeWalt\u2019s admissions. They also show contact between DeWalt and Kardash for a long time.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>According to a commission memorandum detailing the crime commission\u2019s investigation, Urella has admitted receiving a telephone call for Mrs. Gobrecht. He told investigators, the memorandum says, that the telephone call was in reference to a bomb threat at the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">SHORTLY AFTER URELLA received the call from Mrs. Gobrecht, according to the commission memorandum, three separate telephone calls were made in the motel room where Urella\u2019s men were [allegedly intercepting] commission telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The callers, according to commission testimony by the motel operator, told Urella\u2019s men to get out of the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">It was then that three men were seen fleeing the room. They were chased, but not caught, by commission investigators. They were recognized as Urella\u2019s men, however, according to the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">URELLA THEN DROVE at 80 miles an hour down the Pennsylvania Turnpike to meet the alleged wiretappers behind a huge cinder pile on Route 202 near turnpike exit 23, according to allegations in the prosecution memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Urella told crime commission investigators that Nicholas Pratko was the code name for Kardash.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">A crime commission investigator testified during the court martial, however, that he had been told by a reliable informant that Pratko was a code name used by Sprague.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">THE INFORMATION was contained in raw crime commission reports that were obtained and introduced at the court-martial by defense attorneys.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-14\">. It requires mentioning that all of PNI\u2019s outstanding stock is owned by Knight Newspapers, Inc., a litigant whose motion for a non-suit was granted following the presentation of Sprague\u2019s case-in-chief. As for the other defendants (i.e., Greg Walter, Kent Pollock, Howard Shapiro, Eugene L. Roberts, Jr., Creed C. Black, Michael Pakenham and Aaron Epstein), a stipulation was entered into whereby Sprague agreed to drop them from the case, with the condition that he be permitted the right to try the matter as though they were still parties to the suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\">.

Some of the remaining issues proffered by PNI relate to the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury, i.e., 1) in not defining clear and convincing evidence as requested in PNI\u2019s point for charge number one; 2) in stating damages need be proved only by a preponderance of the evidence; 3) in not instructing that presumed damages could not be awarded absent clear and convincing evidence; 4) in not charging on nominal damages; and 5) by inadequately charging on punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The trial court properly denied No. 1. Inasmuch as PNI\u2019s point for charge would have required that the evidence had to be \"Free from doubt\u201d, this was a higher standard than that required in criminal cases. Thus, this was inconsistent with the intermediate level assigned to the clear and convincing standard by the United States Supreme Court in libel cases. See <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (Clear and convincing standard falls between preponderance of the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt criteria).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">No. 2 would appear to be inconsistent with <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974), that state-defined standards of liability for defamation cannot fall below the \u201cactual malice\u201d criterion of <em>Sullivan </em>and still be held valid. Therefore, albeit <em>Gertz </em>dealt with a private-individual libel suit, we see no reason why the logic underpinning its application for awarding punitive damages would not justify its utilization in public official/figure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>cases, i.e., to prevent the unnecessary exacerbation of the danger of media self-censorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">No. 3 is remedied by the instruction on clear and convincing evidence necessary to establish damages, which, by necessity, would negate the award of presumed damages. <em>Gertz, supra. </em>As for Nos. 4 and 5, we find them not to be meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-15\">Any other issues not otherwise specifically dealt with in our discussion are deemed, given the result reached instantly, not to warrant in-depth review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
