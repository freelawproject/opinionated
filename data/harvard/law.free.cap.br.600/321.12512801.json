Altenburg, Jr., United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Before the court is a Motion to Reduce Claims of RKL Financial Corporation (Doc. No, 19) (the \"Motion\") filed by Felix A. Mendez, Sr. (the \"Debtor\") in the above referenced matter. In the Motion, the Debtor argues that the secured claim of RKL Financial Corporation (\"RKL\") must be reduced as the attorneys' fees and costs included therein (the \"Fees\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   are excessive and unreasonable, and exceed the statutory limits set by the New Jersey Fair Foreclosure Act (the \"Act\") and the New Jersey Rules of Court (the \"NJ Rule\" or \"NJ Rules\"). RKL filed a cross-motion seeking relief from the automatic stay, asserting that the relief sought violates the anti-modification provision of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), and further, that the Debtor's plan is not feasible (the \"Cross-Motion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The parties, through the various submissions and oral arguments, are asking this court to determine the reasonableness and/or limit of the Fees under the Act, the NJ Rules, state law and/or the parties' contract. However, because RKL does not consent to a loan modification, the Debtor may only address the fully matured secured claim of RKL under section 1322(c)(2), and that provides only two options: payment of the final judgment in foreclosure (limiting the Fees as allowed thereunder), or payment of the mortgage (to pay the default under the mortgage, which by its terms, provides for payment of the Fees). Regardless of which option the Debtor chooses, RKL insists that it is entitled to the Fees. Because the court chooses to abstain from determining the reasonableness and/or limit of the Fees as the state court is the better court to determine that issue, relief from the stay will be granted, limited to allowing the state court to consider the Fees under state law. Once that determination is made, this court will allow any Fees granted by the state court, and absent an amicable resolution between the parties, the Debtor will have to file a modified plan addressing RKL's allowed claim under section 1322(c)(2) of which the feasibility will be determined in the ordinary course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Accordingly, the Motion will be held in abeyance until the state court determines the reasonableness and/or limit of the Fees. The Cross-Motion will be denied on the grounds stated but the court will vacate the automatic stay for the limited purpose of allowing the parties to proceed in state court on a determination of the amount of the Fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This matter before the court is a core proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B), and the court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and the Standing Order of Reference issued by the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on July 23, 1984, as amended on September 18, 2012, referring all bankruptcy cases to the bankruptcy court.

Doc. No. 1. On July 6, 2018, the Debtor filed the Motion. RKL opposed the Motion and filed the Cross-Motion. Doc. No. 24. Debtor then filed a response to RKL's opposition and Cross-Motion, Doc. No. 25, to which RKL filed a response. Doc. No, 27. Thereafter, the court sent a letter to the parties in an attempt to narrow the issues. Doc. No, 28. The Debtor responded with a supplemental letter brief, Doc. No. 29. Likewise, RKL also filed a supplemental response. Doc. No. 30. A hearing was held on September 18, 2018, after which the court allowed the parties to submit post-hearing submissions. The deadline to submit pleadings was extended from time to time to allow the parties to amicably resolve the matter. With no settlement reached, the parties made their final submissions. Docs, No. 37 and 38. This matter is now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052, the court issues the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In making these findings, the court has considered the arguments of the parties, the documentary evidence, and the totality of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   RKL is a secured creditor of the Debtor, Doc. No. 19, p.3. The obligation to RKL was evidenced by a fifteen-year note with a balloon payment that matured on May 7, 2014.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Debtor heavily contested this action, and due to that, plus attempts to negotiate a workout, RKL incurred extensive attorneys' fees. On April 10, 2018, RKL finally obtained a final judgment of foreclosure from the Superior Court of New Jersey (the \"Final Judgment\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Final Judgment awarded RKL $ 161,639.05 in principal and interest, but only $ 1,766.39 of its Fees, as calculated by, or rather limited under, NJ Rule 4:42-9(a).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither the mortgage (and for that matter, the note) nor the Final Judgment clearly evidenced an intent to preserve the effect of any of the mortgage obligations post-Final Judgment. Doc. No. 24, pp. 18-31; Doc. No. 19, pp. 29-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his case, the Debtor proposes a 36-month plan, which makes the last payment thereunder due in 2021. Doc. No. 2. Under the plan, the Debtor intends to address the claim of RKL through a loan modification.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . RKL timely filed a proof of claim claiming it is owed the total of $ 197,280.18, including the $ 32,839.81\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Fees. Claim No. 2. The Fees represent all the fees RKL asserts it incurred in connection with enforcing its rights under the note and mortgage as opposed to the amount\n   awarded in the Final Judgment that were limited pursuant to the NJ Rules. Doc. No. 24, p.15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thereafter, the Debtor filed the Motion, arguing that RKL's request for the Fees is excessive and unreasonable and exceeds the maximum recoverable attorneys' fees and costs allowed under the Act and the NJ Rules. Doc. No, 19, p.33. The Debtor argued that pursuant to the Act, RKL may only recover a maximum of $ 1,794.41 in attorneys' fees. Accordingly, RKL's total claim should be reduced to $ 166,234.78.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Of course, RKL opposed the reduction of its claim and filed the Cross-Motion. It stated \"[b]y law Bankruptcy Court may not approve a bankruptcy plan filed in a Chapter 13 case that modifies the terms of a mortgage loan on the homeowner's principal residence.\" Doc. No. 24, p.10, RKL argued that the Motion violates Section 1322(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code because that section prohibits\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   modification of the rights of holders of claims secured solely by a security interest in real estate that is the debtor's principal residence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On that basis, RKL argued that there can be\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   modification of its claim and therefore, its claim, including all of its Fees, must be paid. RKL declared:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, the Court need not consider Debtor's Motion to Reduce RKL's claim. Debtor's Plan violates 1322(b)(2) and therefore cannot be confirmed, and therefore a motion to reduce or modify the lender's claim is moot and irrelevant. The court can see that Debtor seeks, by way of a Motion to Reduce Claim, to do what bankruptcy law expressly prohibits. Debtor seeks to impermissibly modify the lender's claim, via this Motion and via his Plan which violates 1322(b)(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For this reason, RKL also averred that the Debtor's plan is not feasible, and the Cross-Motion must be granted. In support of its position, RKL relied,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   on\n   <em>\n    Nobelman v. American Savings Bank,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11800\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/324/\">\n    508 U.S. 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11800,6525430\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/113/2106/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11800\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/324/\">\n    124 L.Ed.2d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) and\n   <em>\n    In re Scarborough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704077,3671143\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/406/\">\n    461 F.3d 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Initially, the court entertained the Motion, believing it to be a straight-forward issue about the reasonableness of the Fees. In addition, since the court was hopeful that the parties might amicably resolve the issue, it refrained from making its decision. But when settlement negotiations failed, and the parties submitted their latest submissions, it became apparent that the reasonableness of the Fees was really a secondary issue. Rather, first, a determination had to be made as to whether the Debtor could even propose a plan that provided for a loan modification, and if so, whether the Debtor could reduce RKL's secured claim by excluding the Fees. As there appears to be a misunderstanding as to what a debtor can and cannot do under Section 1322,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   some clarification is necessary. This requires an examination of the impact of section 1322(c) on section 1322(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Section 1322(c)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Simply put, RKL's strict reading of subsection 1322(b)(2) is not supported by the law. Section 1322(b)(2) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Subject to subsections\n   </em>\n   (a) and\n   <em>\n    (c)\n   </em>\n   of this section, the plan may-...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) modify the rights of holders of secured claims, other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence, or of holders of unsecured\n   claims, or leave unaffected the rights of holders of any class of claims[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   11 U.S.C.\u00a7 1322(b)(2).

Those subsections provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Subject to subsections (a) and (c)\n   </em>\n   of this section, the plan may-...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (3) provide for the curing or waiving of any default; ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (5) notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, provide for the curing of any default within a reasonable time and maintenance of payments while the case is pending on any unsecured claim or secured claim on which the last payment is due after the date on which the final payment under the plan is due[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) and (5) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \" Section 1322(b)(3) does not sanction the curing or waiving of a default on a secured claim without regard to its terms.

That's it.

The court recognizes that RKL could seek to amend the Final Judgment in state court (this court cannot amend the Final Judgment) and/or obtain an order for the Debtor to pay additional sums under the NJ Rules, but that has not been pursued. If the Final Judgment is amended and/or additional sums are awarded, certainly those sums would be included in the total amount due to RKL in this case.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Shandar Holding Corp.,\n   </em>\n   No. 12-7336 FLW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203810574\">\n    2013 WL 3810574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J.

But of course, RKL does have an opportunity in state court to amend the Final Judgment or obtain an order to pay additional sums under NJ Rules because the doctrine of merger does not prevent it from doing so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shandar Holding Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203810574\">\n    2013 WL 3810574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There is a question of whether such a mortgage falls under the section 1322(c)(2) exception. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Goione\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512461\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/595/477/#p487\">\n    595 B.R. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Judge Kaplan found that under section 1322(c)(2)\"there are only three scenarios in which [ section 1322(c)(2) ] is applicable: (1) short term\n   mortgages, (2) long term mortgages on which the debtor is within five years of completing payments; and (3) mortgages with balloon payments.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512461\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/595/477/#p487\">\n    595 B.R. at 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this court respectfully suggests that a mortgage that fully matured prepetition and is in default, like here, creates a fourth scenario under section 1322(c)(2). Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Collier\n   </em>\n   suggests section 1322(c)(2) encompasses mortgages that fully matured prepetition. \u00b6 1322.17. This makes sense because certainly a mortgage that fully matured prepetition is a secured claim whose last payment comes due prior to the end of a chapter 13 plan. So, by its own terms, section 1322(c)(2) applies since sections 1322(c)(1) and (c)(2) are inclusive of each other and section 1322(c)(2) expressly applies to secured claims\n   <em>\n    on which the last payment comes due prior to the last payment under a chapter 13 plan\n   </em>\n   . At the same time, the incorporation of section 1322(b)(5) into section 1322(c)(1) has no impact because in a fully matured debt situation, there are no payments to maintain and there are no payments due after the final plan payment as required by that section. Accordingly, a debtor can only address a default on a fully matured debt under section 1322(b)(3) through section 1322(c)(2). Indeed, the court cannot not think of a time when section 1322(c)(1) would apply to a fully matured mortgage. Finally, other courts have held that section 1322(c)(2) applies to a prepetition fully matured secured obligation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nepil,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"689386\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/206/72/\">\n    206 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   77 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Escue,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6451111\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/184/287/#p293\">\n    184 B.R. 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 293 (Bankr.

S.D. Fla. 1995) ). Accordingly, this court finds that section 1322(c)(2) applies to a mortgage that fully matured prepetition and is in default\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In lieu of paying a foreclosure judgment on a mortgage that fully matured prepetition, section 1322(c)(2) affords a debtor an opportunity to pay the default over the life of a plan. As explained above, that payment is not a modification of the secured claim.\n   <em>\n    Collier\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 1322.07. But by addressing a default under a fully matured mortgage by curing same over the life of a plan, a debtor cannot ignore the mortgage's terms.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6461924\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/189/216/#p218\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\" Section 1322(b)(3) does not sanction the curing or waiving of a default on a secured claim without regard to its terms\"). Indeed, all provisions of that mortgage, including allowance of attorneys' fees, are reinstated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winogora,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"440307\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/209/632/#p635\">\n    209 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   636 ;\n   <em>\n    Goione\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512461\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/595/477/#p487\">\n    595 B.R. at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because a debtor seeks to cure the default rather than satisfy the judgment, the merger doctrine does not apply. Consequently, a debtor is bound by all terms of the mortgage including payment of attorney fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Interestingly, here the Debtor's plan proposes a loan modification with RKL. The Debtor has also applied for loss mitigation through the court's program in an effort to negotiate that loan modification. But how can one modify a loan that does not exist due to the entry of the Final Judgment and the application of the merger doctrine? Clearly, in order to do a loan modification, a loan would have to exist. To that end, for a loan to exist, the Debtor must acknowledge the existence of the mortgage and seek to address the default thereunder. Payment of the default under the mortgage means reinstatement of all of the mortgage terms, including RKL's right\n   to the Fees. Yet, the Debtor wishes to limit the Fees to the amount set forth in the Final Judgment. The Debtor cannot have his cake and eat it too. He cannot effectively reinstate the mortgage to cure the default thereunder through a loan modification while at the same time enforce the Final Judgment and/or ignore the terms of the mortgage. He can either limit the Fees through payment of the Final Judgment or address the default under the mortgage he seeks to modify, effectively resulting in a reinstatement of its terms. Whether by repaying the loan or seeking a loan modification (which would require RKL's consent) the Debtor would be required to pay the Fees because the loan documents provide for it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also suspects, as it suggested earlier, Doc. No. 28, that RKL will not agree to a loan modification without the repayment of the Fees, and this court cannot require it to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Debtor relies on\n   <em>\n    In re Hatala,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"312064\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/295/62/\">\n    295 B.R. 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D.N.J. 2003), to support his position that RKL's claim should be limited to the Fees set forth in the Final Judgment. However, this court is not bound or persuaded by that decision and disagrees with it. First, that case is distinguishable as it was dealing with cure and reinstatement of a long-term debt under section 1322(c)(1) unlike this case where there can be no cure, reinstatement and maintaining of payments. Next, the court in\n   <em>\n    Hatala\n   </em>\n   subsequently recognized that \"[t]here may be some question as to whether\n   <em>\n    Hatala\n   </em>\n   is still good law ...\"\n   <em>\n    In re Boyd,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046592\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/401/137/#p141\">\n    401 B.R. 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 141, n.3 (Bankr. D.N.J. 2008). Finally, the remaining cases the Debtor relies on are distinguishable from the facts here, irrelevant to the issue presented, unpersuasive and/or not binding on this court. Simply put, the court does not believe one can gain the extraordinary benefit of reinstating a fully matured mortgage for purposes of seeking a loan modification while at the same time avoiding the burden of that mortgage's terms, including the payment of a lender's attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Determination of the Reasonableness of the Fees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Here the parties invite this court to determine the entitlement to and/or the reasonableness of the Fees in excess of those awarded in the Final Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Simply put, the merger doctrine prevents the court from doing so, as the mortgage provided the basis for shifting fees to the borrower, but the merger doctrine provides that the mortgage no longer exists.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    In re A &amp; P Diversified Technologies Realty, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8453658,3805451\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/337/\">\n    467 F.3d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 341 (3d Cir. 2006). Nor did the mortgage provide for post-judgment fee-shifting. Any additional fees, if warranted, may only be obtained by RKL convincing the state court to amend the Final Judgment, and/or by obtaining an order to pay additional sums pursuant to the NJ Rules, a determination that is well within the province of the state court. Accordingly, the state court, not this bankruptcy court, should be the one to hear RKL's application for additional fees and expenses not included in the Final Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart Title Guar.

Permissive abstention \"allows a court to abstain from hearing a particular matter arising under title 11 or arising in or related to a case under title 11, in the interest of justice or in the interest of comity with state courts or respect for state law.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Vanhook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730185\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/468/694/#p700\">\n    468 B.R. 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 700 (Bankr. D.N.J. 2012). New Jersey courts consider several factors in determining when to abstain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shalom Torah Centers v. Philadelphia Indem. Ins. Cos.\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-6766 (FLW),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201322295\">\n    2011 WL 1322295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D.N.J. Mar. 31, 2011). The courts recognize, however, that not all factors need to be considered in all cases and that their importance will \"vary with the particular circumstances of each case\" such that \"no one factor is necessarily determinative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The factors present in this case warranting abstention are: the issue raised must be resolved before the Debtor can confirm his plan and therefore, the outcome has an effect on the efficient administration of the bankruptcy estate; because of the issuance of the Final Judgment and the effect of the merger doctrine, the award of additional fees is solely an issue of state law; the argument presented is difficult (there is a presumption that the fees allowed by the NJ Rules are reasonable but RKL asserts that state law allows it to obtain additional fees); both the Debtor and RKL have cited several cases in which New Jersey courts have allowed and disallowed fees, creating an uncertainty; there is a question whether the Fees are limited under the mortgage itself due to the use of the language \"permitted by Rules of Court\"; a related state court foreclosure matter already exists thus the issue can easily be addressed there; comity favors abstention; but for the bankruptcy of the Debtor, this court would not have jurisdiction over the issue; there is no issue with severing the state law claim from the core proceeding; any decision by the state court can be enforced by this court; the prejudice to the parties in having the state court decide the issue is remote; and finally, the state court is an expert on state court foreclosure law and certainly has a better understanding than this court of what types of fees are reasonable in a foreclosure action. This is a bankruptcy court not a state court foreclosure court. How does the court know whether the $ 32,000 in Fees initially requested in RKL's proof of claim, or its recent agreement to reduce the Fees to $ 12,000, Doc. No. 37, are reasonable? The Fees may be reasonable. The reduction and reduced amount may also be reasonable. But this court has nothing to measure the Fees or the reduced amount against because it is never involved in foreclosure litigation and does not know the costs usually associated therewith. As such, this court will abstain from determining the reasonableness of the Fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Relief From Stay\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Relief from the automatic stay is not warranted on the grounds asserted by RKL. RKL's misunderstanding of section 1322(b)(2) by ignoring the exceptions thereto does not provide \"cause\" for relief from the automatic stay. Further, it is too early to determine whether the Debtor's plan is feasible. That is a confirmation issue. It is possible for the Debtor to modify his plan that currently provides for a refinance or sale of the property. Moreover,\n   now that it has been determined how RKL's claim can be treated, perhaps there will be a compromise. Granting relief from the stay on plan feasibility grounds at this time would be premature. Since no cause exists on the grounds asserted by RKL, its Cross-Motion must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Nevertheless, unless the parties can resolve their differences and be civil, under either option that the Debtor chooses, it would be necessary for the court to grant RKL relief from the automatic stay to give it the opportunity in state court to determine the appropriateness and/or reasonableness of the Fees and/or to amend the Final Judgment and/or obtain an order to pay additional sums under the NJ Rules due to the court invoking abstention. Any additional amounts granted by the state court will become part of RKL's allowed secured claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Because the court chooses to abstain from determining the reasonableness and/or limit of the Fees as the state court is the better court to determine that issue, relief from the stay will be granted limited to allowing the state court to consider the Fees under state law. Once that determination is made, this court will allow any Fees granted by the state court, and absent an amicable resolution between the parties, the Debtor will have to file a modified plan addressing RKL's allowed claim under section 1322(c)(2) of which the feasibility will be determined in the ordinary course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Accordingly, the Motion will be held in abeyance until the state court determines the reasonableness and/or limit of the Fees or the parties resolve. The Cross-Motion is denied on the grounds stated but the court will vacate the automatic stay for the limited purpose of allowing the state court to proceed with its determination on the amount of the Fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   An appropriate judgment has been entered consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The court reserves the right to revise its findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    RKL additionally believes it is also now entitled to additional fees associated with this bankruptcy case.
