In its Motion to Dismiss,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant argues that Dr. Kolb's demand for return of the car occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the sale and that, because the Defendant did not know of the Georgia Writ of Possession or the contested ownership of the car at the time of the sale, the Trustee has failed to state a claim for conversion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rule 12(b)(6) provides that before an answer is filed a defendant may seek dismissal of a complaint if the complaint fails to state a claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Disposition of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) focuses only upon the allegations and whether those allegations state a claim for relief. In reviewing a motion to dismiss, courts must accept the allegations as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Rule 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rule 8(a)(3) requires a \"demand for the relief sought.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   For a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, it must contain sufficient factual\n   matter to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Facial plausibility is present \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The tort of conversion is the \"wrongful exercise of dominion or control over property to the detriment of the rights of one entitled to possession.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Florida courts recognize the common law tort of conversion. \"[C]onversion occurs when a person asserts a right of dominion over chattel which is inconsistent with the right of the owner and deprives the owner of the right of possession.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Under Florida law, the elements of conversion are (1) an act of dominion wrongfully asserted; (2) over another's property; and (3) inconsistent with his ownership therein.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff must establish that he or she had the car or entitled to possession of the car at the time of the conversion for the claim to succeed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The rule for auctioneers, however, is slightly different and approaches almost strict liability for conversion when an auctioneer sells property in which its principal lacked marketable title.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority legal rule applicable in virtually all states, including Florida,\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   is that a sale by\n   an auctioneer for a principal who has no or questionable title to property is liable to the rightful owner even if the auctioneer does not know of the principal's lack of authority to sell. Lack of knowledge or the auctioneer's good faith simply is not a legal defense to conversion if an auctioneer improperly sells property. Similarly, the fact that the Writ of Possession did not issue until July 20, 2015, or that Dr. Kolb demanded no return of the car until after the sale is irrelevant. Defendant sold the car when its principal, the Debtor, arguably lacked the authority to transfer title, as alleged by the Trustee. Plaintiff has stated a claim for conversion against Defendant in Count I.
