Tucker, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Among other things, this Chapter 11 case raises the question whether the Debtor's entanglement with a medical marijuana dispensary business, which business is illegal under federal criminal law but not necessarily illegal under Michigan law, requires the dismissal of this federal bankruptcy case. The Court concludes that dismissal is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case came before the Court on March 6, 2019, for a hearing on three motions, namely: (1) the United States Trustee's motion to dismiss this case (Docket # 30, the \"Dismissal Motion\"); (2) the motion by the Debtor entitled \"Debtor's Motion to Reject Executory Lease with MJCC 8 Mile, LLC\" (Docket # 37, the \"Lease Rejection Motion\"); and (3) the motion by MJCC 8 Mile, LLC for relief from the automatic stay (Docket # 43, the \"Stay Relief Motion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the hearing, after obtaining leave of Court to do so,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Debtor filed a supplemental brief in further support of its position on the pending motions, and the United States Trustee and MJCC 8 Mile, LLC filed responses to the Debtor's supplemental brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court has reviewed those post-hearing papers filed by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court has considered all of the oral and written arguments of the parties, and all of the briefs and exhibits filed by the parties. For the reasons stated in this opinion, the Court will deny the Debtor's Lease Rejection Motion, grant the United States Trustee's Dismissal Motion, and deny the Stay Relief Motion as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this bankruptcy case and this\n   contested matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 157(a) and 157(b)(1), and Local Rule 83.50(a) (E.D.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Debtor filed this Chapter 11 bankruptcy case on December 16, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor is a Michigan corporation that \"is in the business of manufacturing and installing custom cabinets[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor occupies and uses two conjoined buildings, located at 7451 and 7461 West 8 Mile Road, Detroit, Michigan. That real estate (the \"Nocha Property\") is owned by Weaam Nocha, who is the President and sole shareholder of the Debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed that the Debtor is not, and never has been, an owner of the Nocha Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The November 16, 2016 Lease, and the Debtor's pre-petition state court litigation with MJCC 8 Mile, LLC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before filing this bankruptcy case, the Debtor, Weaam Nocha, and others were defendants in a state court lawsuit filed by MJCC 8 Mile, LLC, captioned\n   <em>\n    MJCC 8 Mile, LLC v. Basrah Custom Design, Inc., et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 17-001663 (Wayne County,\n   Michigan Circuit Court) (the \"State Court Lawsuit\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the State Court Lawsuit, MJCC 8 Mile, LLC (\"MJCC\") claimed to have the right to possession of the Nocha Property under a written lease, which lease also gave MJCC an option to purchase the Nocha Property. MJCC sought enforcement of that lease and the purchase option. The lease was executed on November 16, 2016, and is referred to in this Opinion as the \"November Lease\" or the \"November 2016 Lease.\" A copy of the November Lease appears in the record of this case as Exhibit 1 to the brief filed by the Debtor on February 8, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The November Lease named the Debtor as the \"Landlord\" and MJCC as the \"Tenant,\" and it was signed on November 16, 2016 by Weaam Nocha for the Debtor, as \"Its Owner,\" and by MJCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under the November Lease, MJCC leased the part of the Nocha Property located at 7461 West 8 Mile Road, for an initial term of 5 years, renewable by MJCC for 6 additional 5-year terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   During that lease term, MJCC also had the option to lease the adjacent part of the Nocha Property, located at 7451 West 8 Mile Road, also for an initial term of 5 years, renewable by MJCC for 3 additional 5-year terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The November Lease also gave MJCC an option to purchase the Nocha Property, for $ 1.2 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It is undisputed, and was clearly understood by all parties at the time of the signing of the November Lease, that MJCC's purpose in entering into the November Lease was to use the Nocha Property to operate a medical marijuana dispensary. And this is clear from the face of the November Lease. For example, the document stated that \"[t]he Premises will be used for a licensed medical marijuana dispensary (the '\n   <strong>\n    Designated Use\n   </strong>\n   ') and for no other purpose whatsoever.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the initial 5-year term of the Lease was to begin \"on the date Tenant receives approval from the City of Detroit for its Designated Use[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The defendants in the State Court Lawsuit were the Debtor, Weaam Nocha, Rafaa Nocha (Weaam Nocha's wife, a/k/a Rafaa Dawood), Holden Dawood (the Nochas's son), and DMCC, LLC (a limited liability company formed by the defendants). All of the defendants jointly defended against MJCC's claims, and opposed the efforts of MJCC to obtain possession of or purchase the Nocha Property. One of their primary defenses was that MJCC \"fraudulently tricked\" Weaam Nocha into signing the November Lease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It is undisputed that in seeking relief in the State Court Lawsuit, and in now seeking stay relief in this Court, MJCC has sought possession and ownership of the Nocha Property, in order to use that property as a medical marijuana dispensary. Such a marijuana business apparently would not violate Michigan law, but as\n   discussed below, it would violate federal criminal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The State Court Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The State Court Lawsuit went to trial, and on December 7, 2018, the state court found for MJCC, in a lengthy written opinion and order, entitled \"Finding of Facts and Conclusions of Law\" (the \"State Court Decision\"). A copy of the State Court Decision appears in the record of this case as Exhibit 4 to the Debtor's brief filed on February 8, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As discussed in Part III.D of this Opinion, below, the findings and conclusions of the State Court Decision are binding in this Court, on the Debtor, Weaam Nocha, and MJCC, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. For this reason, and because they are important to this Court's decision on the pending motions, the Court will describe the state court's findings and conclusions in detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the State Court Decision, the state court found and concluded, among other things, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Weaam Nocha was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   tricked or fraudulently induced into signing the November Lease;\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 at the time the November Lease was signed, the Nocha Property was owned solely by Weaam Nocha;\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 Weaam Nocha signed the November Lease as an agent of the Debtor,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the Debtor in turn signed the November Lease as agent of and on behalf of the owner of the property at issue, Weaam Nocha;\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 the November Lease, including the purchase option it contains, is valid and enforceable by MJCC;\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 the term of the November Lease began on November 10, 2016, and MJCC's right to exclusive possession of the Nocha Property began on November 26, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The State Court Decision found that the Nocha Property is one of the very few properties located within the City of Detroit that is available and suitable for conducting a medical marijuana dispensary. The state court found that \"there are very few fully compliant properties in the City [of Detroit]\" where one can \"open a medical marijuana dispensary.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is \"due to the tight restrictions imposed by Detroit's Medical Marijuana Zoning Ordinance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Nocha Property is such an available property - as the state court put it, the property is \"in the 'green zone.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The state court also found that the efforts by Weaam Nocha, the Debtor, and the other defendants to avoid enforcement of the November Lease, including its purchase option, were motivated by a desire to make more money from the Nocha Property, either by (1) renting or selling the Nocha Property to MJCC, or someone else in the medical marijuana business, for a higher rent or a higher sale price than the $ 1.2 million price set by the purchase option in the November Lease; or (2) using the property to open and operate a marijuana dispensary themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The State Court Decision described, in detailed findings:\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 how Weaam Nocha and his wife, Rafaa, continually demanded more money from MJCC for the lease or purchase of the Nocha Property, even after the November Lease was signed, demanding, for example, an increase in rent from the $ 5,000.00 per month in the November Lease\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   to $ 7,500.00 per month, and demanding $ 1.5 million to sell the property to MJCC instead of the $ 1.2 million agreed to in the November Lease's purchase option;\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 how MJCC refused the Nochas's greater financial demands, and instead insisted on performance of the November Lease;\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 how the Nochas then reacted by refusing to honor the November Lease;\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 how all of the state court defendants -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Debtor, Weaam Nocha, Rafaa Nocha, and their son Holden Dawood - then decided to open and operate a medical marijuana dispensary themselves at the Nocha\n   Property, and went to great lengths to try to do so; including the defendants' formation of a new LLC - the defendant DMCC, LLC - to obtain a license from the City of Detroit to operate a medical marijuana dispensary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Based on its detailed findings, the state court entered a judgment in favor of MJCC and against the defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   For relief, \"given the validity of the November 2016 Lease,\" the State Court Decision ordered that MJCC could elect one of two options.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Under the first option, MJCC could elect to have a \"[d]eclaratory judgment that the November 2016 Lease is valid and enforceable.\" Under this option, MJCC was required to \"exercise[ ] its option [under the November 2016 Lease] to purchase the entire property (7451 and 7461) for [$] 1.2 million\" and MJCC would obtain the \"immediate transfer of ownership to DMCC to Plaintiff[ ] along with possession of the Property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Under the second option, MJCC could elect to have a declaratory judgment that \"the November 2016 [L]ease [is] null and void,\" plus a money judgment in the total amount of $ 713,658.72.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under this option, \"Defendants would maintain ownership of the property and the Marijuana license.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   MJCC elected the first of these alternative forms of relief, and desires to close, as soon as possible, on its purchase of the Nocha Property for the $ 1.2 million price. This is so MJCC can begin to operate its medical marijuana dispensary business on the Nocha Property as soon as possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Nine days after the State Court Decision, and in direct response to it, the Debtor filed this bankruptcy case. The Debtor and the other state court defendants also filed an appeal of the State Court Decision to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which appeal is pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The preclusive effect of the State Court Decision, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As the Debtor's counsel conceded during the hearing, the findings and conclusions of the state court in the State Court Decision are binding on the Debtor and MJCC. Those parties are precluded from contesting such findings and conclusions in this bankruptcy case, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. And this is so even though the Debtor has appealed the State Court Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This Court previously has explained how collateral estoppel applies in bankruptcy cases, under the federal Full Faith and Credit Statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201738\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   :\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"In determining whether a state court judgment precludes relitigation of issues under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the Full Faith and Credit Statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201738\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , requires bankruptcy courts to \" 'consider first the law of the\n   State in which the judgment was rendered to determine its preclusive effect.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bay Area Factors v.

Collateral estoppel therefore applies, and in effect, the parties to the State Court Decision, including the Debtor, Weaam Nocha, and MJCC, are bound by the findings and conclusions in the State Court Decision, unless and until that State Court Decision is reversed, vacated, or modified on appeal. And counsel for the Debtor explicitly conceded this, during the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Discussion of the Debtor's motion to reject the November 2016 Lease, under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 365.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In its Lease Rejection Motion, the Debtor seeks an order allowing it to reject the November 2016 Lease. MJCC opposes that motion on several grounds. The United States Trustee also opposes that motion, because he seeks dismissal of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court must deny the Debtor's Lease Rejection Motion, for two reasons. First, the November Lease is not a lease that the Debtor may reject under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the Debtor is not a real party in interest under that lease. Rather, the Debtor signed the November Lease only in its capacity as agent for the one and only owner of the Nocha Property at issue, namely, Weaam Nocha. This is conclusively established by the State Court Decision, as noted in parts III.C and III.D of this Opinion. As a result, the Debtor cannot assume or reject the November Lease under \u00a7 365. That section says that a \"trustee,\" which includes a Chapter 11 debtor-in-possession under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201107\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), \"subject to the court's approval, may assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease\n   <strong>\n    of the debtor\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). Many of the subsections in \u00a7 365 use this phrase, executory contract or unexpired lease \"of the debtor,\" and thereby reinforce the point that \u00a7 365 applies only to such contracts \"of the debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), 365(b)(4), 365(c), 365(d)(1), 365(d)(2), 365(e)(1), 365(e)(2), 365(f)(1), 365(f)(2), 365(f)(3), 365(g), 365(i)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The November Lease is not a lease \"of the debtor\" but rather is a lease of the Debtor's 100% shareholder, Weaam Nocha, who at the time of the November Lease was the only owner of the subject property. (As noted in Part III.A of this Opinion, it is undisputed that the Debtor is not and never has been an owner of the subject property.) The Debtor therefore cannot assume or reject the November Lease, so the Debtor's Lease Rejection Motion must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   That Motion also must be denied for a second reason, namely, because this bankruptcy case must be dismissed, for the reasons discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

This case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    a. \"Cause\" exists under \u00a7 1112(b)(1) to dismiss or convert this case.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The UST argues that the Debtor has filed and is pursuing this bankruptcy case with unclean hands, because the Debtor's purpose is not to disentangle from any marijuana-based business, but rather to enable its owner to profit from a marijuana business. The UST argues that the Debtor's real purpose is to use this bankruptcy case to help enable the Debtor's 100% shareholder, Weaam Nocha, to obtain a better marijuana-based deal than what is provided by the November Lease and the State Court Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Debtor denies that it has unclean hands. The Debtor says that it wants to disentangle itself from the November Lease, by rejecting that lease. The Debtor insists that it does not want to be involved in the marijuana business, but rather just wants to try to reorganize its custom cabinet business, and continue doing that business, at its existing location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   But this Court is bound to reject these assertions by the Debtor. It is clear and obvious to this Court, from the findings and conclusions in the State Court Decision, that the Debtor's sole shareholder, Weaam Nocha, caused the Debtor to file this bankruptcy case for the sole purpose of evading the State Court Decision, and avoiding the enforcement of the November Lease, so that Weaam Nocha does not have to sell the Nocha Property to MJCC for only $ 1.2 million. Weaam Nocha obviously wants to realize more money for himself, as owner of the Nocha Property, than what the enforcement of the State Court Decision will give him, either by (1) renting or selling the Nocha Property to MJCC, or to some other marijuana dispensary business, for a higher rent or a higher sale price than $ 1.2 million; or (2) using the property to operate a marijuana dispensary himself, as he started to do with the help of his immediate family members before the State Court Decision was issued. Weaam Nocha did not cause the Debtor to file this bankruptcy case for the benefit of the Debtor or the Debtor's creditors, but rather solely for his own benefit - a benefit that depends on activity that is illegal under the CSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Borrowing from the words used by the UST in its motion, Weaam Nocha wants to use this bankruptcy case \"to set aside this illegal contract [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the November Lease] so that he can negotiate a better illegal contract.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Under Weaam Nocha's control, the Debtor denies these things. But these denials are precluded by the State Court Decision's findings and conclusions. The Debtor and Weaam Nocha both are bound by the findings and conclusions in the State Court Decision, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. That means that they are precluded from now making assertions that are contrary to the findings and conclusions of the State Court Decision. And those findings and conclusions, described in Part III.C of this Opinion, inescapably lead to this Court's conclusions of what that the actual purpose of this bankruptcy case is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The assertion that the Debtor, Weaam Nocha, and his family do not want the Nocha Property to be used or involved in the marijuana business, especially, is belied\n   by the state court's detailed findings about all the efforts Weaam Nocha and his family went to in order to operate their own marijuana dispensary business at the Nocha Property, after refusing to honor the November Lease with MJCC. And then, only nine days after losing the State Court Lawsuit, Weaam Nocha caused the Debtor to file this bankruptcy case (1) to try to \"reject\" the November Lease under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 365 ; and (2) to try to obtain the benefit of the automatic stay to delay MJCC's obtaining ownership of the Nocha Property while Weaam Nocha, the Debtor, and the other state court defendants appeal the State Court Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The actual purpose of filing and prosecuting this bankruptcy case is for the Debtor and its 100% shareholder to use this bankruptcy court, and the Bankruptcy Code, to assist them in obtaining a result that is contrary to federal criminal law under the Controlled Substances Act, and therefore contrary to federal public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   This federal court cannot allow itself to be used in this way. The Court finds that the Debtor has unclean hands, and that there is \"cause\" to dismiss or convert this case, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201112\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    b. There is no practical alternative to dismissal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Having found that cause exists to dismiss or convert this case under \u00a7 1112(b)(1), the Court next must determine which of these choices is \"in the best interests of creditors and the estate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds that dismissal, rather than conversion to Chapter 7, is in the best interests of creditors and the estate, for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   First, a conversion to Chapter 7 would mean a liquidation of the Debtor, and the termination of the Debtor's business of manufacturing and installing custom cabinets. The Debtor does not want to liquidate in Chapter 7. Rather, the Debtor has expressed a desire to continue operating its custom cabinets business, even though that business is relatively small,\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   and there is no reason to think that the Debtor cannot continue to operate its custom cabinets business outside of bankruptcy. Nor has any creditor of the Debtor advocated for the conversion and liquidation of the Debtor in Chapter 7. There is no reason to think that a liquidation of the Debtor in Chapter 7 is in the best interests of the creditors or the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Second, like the court in the\n   <em>\n    Way to Grow\n   </em>\n   case, discussed in Part III.F.2 of this Opinion, this Court sees \"no practical alternative to dismissal\" in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Way to Grow\n   </em>\n   , 597 B.R. at 132. Conversion is not a practical alternative. As discussed in Part III.E of this Opinion, the Court has ruled that the Debtor cannot reject (or\n   assume) the November Lease under \u00a7 365(a), because that lease is not a lease or executory contract \"of the debtor.\" That ruling will thwart the bankruptcy strategy in this case of the Debtor and its owner, Weaam Nocha. But even with that ruling, the continued pendency of this bankruptcy case, whether in Chapter 11 or in Chapter 7, creates an impossible situation for this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   One major problem has to do with the automatic stay. After this Court's ruling on the Debtor's Lease Rejection Motion, Weaam Nocha will be forced by the state court, under the State Court Decision, to sell the Nocha Property to MJCC, and MJCC then will become the owner of that property. As owner, MJCC will have the exclusive right to possession of the Nocha Property, under Michigan law. But the Debtor operates its custom cabinet business from that property, and currently is in sole possession of that property. While this bankruptcy case remains pending, under either Chapter 11 or Chapter 7, the automatic stay will prevent MJCC from taking any action to wrest away possession of the Nocha Property from the Debtor, even after MJCC becomes the owner of the Nocha Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 362(a)(3) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Convenient Food Mart No. 144, Inc. v.

Such relief from the stay would be to permit that owner to prosecute an eviction action in an appropriate non-bankruptcy court, to obtain possession of the property. (MJCC has filed a motion for relief from stay in this case.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   But this is not a normal case. In this case, the Court likely would have to refuse to grant any stay relief, or any other relief, requested by MJCC, because MJCC also has unclean hands. The granting of stay relief to MJCC obviously would assist MJCC in its efforts to open and operate a medical marijuana dispensary, in violation of federal law. Just as \"a federal court cannot be asked to enforce the protections of the Bankruptcy Code in aid of a Debtor whose activities constitute a continuing federal crime,\"\n   <em>\n    Rent-Rite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4163354\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/484/799/#p802\">\n    484 B.R. at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted), neither can a federal court be asked to enforce any\n   <em>\n    creditor\n   </em>\n   protections under the Bankruptcy Code, such as the relief-from-stay provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), in aid of a\n   <em>\n    creditor's\n   </em>\n   commission of a federal crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   This Court is unwilling and unable to assist a party like MJCC to violate federal\n   law. So this Court likely would not grant stay relief to MJCC, even after MJCC became the owner of the Nocha Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Thus, the continuation of this bankruptcy case, under either Chapter 11 or Chapter 7, would leave the Court and the parties stuck in the middle of a continuing tug-of-war between two parties with unclean hands (the Debtor and MJCC), with the Court unable and unwilling to grant relief to either party. To use a metaphor employed by the UST, the only practical solution is to \"cut the Gordian knot,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   by dismissing this case. Such dismissal is available here, at the request of a party that does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have unclean hands - the UST. And dismissal will leave the Debtor, Weaam Nocha, and MJCC to continue their battles in the state court, where those battles belong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   So the Court will dismiss this bankruptcy case. And in order to prevent any attempted evasion by anyone of the Court's decisions today, the Court will bar the filing of any new bankruptcy case, by or against the Debtor, for a period of two years. This should give ample time for the Debtor's pending state court appeal to conclude.

And the Court is aware of the May 2, 2019 decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in\n    <em>\n     Garvin v. Cook Invs. NW\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520874\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1031/\">\n     922 F.3d 1031\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (9th Cir. 2019). In\n    <em>\n     Garvin\n    </em>\n    , the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a bankruptcy court's confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan, over the objection of the UST, even though one of the debtors had a tenant who was involved in a marijuana growing operation. But\n    <em>\n     Garvin\n    </em>\n    involved only a narrow issue of law that is not before this Court. The issue was whether the debtors' plan met the confirmation requirement in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(3), that the plan be \"proposed ... not by any means forbidden by law.\" The court of appeals held that this provision in \u00a7 1129(a)(3) applies only to the \"means of a reorganization plan's\n    <em>\n     proposal\n    </em>\n    , not its substantive provisions.\"\n    <em>\n     Garvin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520874\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1031/\">\n     922 F.3d at 1033, 1035\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (italics in original). Thus, the court held that the quoted prong of \u00a7 1129(a)(3) was not violated by the substance of the confirmed plan, including the debtor's continuing to lease its building to a marijuana grower in violation of federal law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Garvin\n    </em>\n    , earlier in the bankruptcy case, before the plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy court, the UST had filed a motion to dismiss, based on the one debtor's leasing to a marijuana grower. The dismissal motion argued that \"cause\" existed to dismiss that debtor's case, because of \"gross mismanagement of the estate\" by the debtor, within the meaning of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201112\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(4)(B).\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520874\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1031/\">\n     922 F.3d at 1033\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The bankruptcy court denied that dismissal motion, \"but with leave to renew [it] at the plan confirmation hearing.\"\n    <em>\n     Garvin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520874\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/1031/\">\n     922 F.3d at 1034\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But the UST failed to renew its dismissal motion at the confirmation hearing, and instead argued only its objection to confirmation based on \u00a7 1129(a)(3). In affirming confirmation of the debtors' plan, the court of appeals ruled that the UST waived its dismissal motion argument under \u00a7 1112(b). For this reason, the court of appeals refused to address that issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    The decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in\n    <em>\n     Garvin\n    </em>\n    is not binding on this Court, and, with respect, this Court does not necessarily agree with the\n    <em>\n     Garvin\n    </em>\n    court's holding about \u00a7 1129(a)(3). And, respectfully, one might reasonably question whether the\n    <em>\n     Garvin\n    </em>\n    court should have refused to decide the \u00a7 1112(b) dismissal issue. That refusal, on waiver grounds, arguably is questionable, because it allowed the affirmance, by a\n    <em>\n     federal\n    </em>\n    court, of the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan under which a debtor would continue to violate\n    <em>\n     federal\n    </em>\n    criminal law under the CSA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"39\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    UST Mot.

The Court finds that neither of these choices is in the best interests of the creditors and the estate. This is so because neither of these options would serve any useful purpose in this case, and also for the same reasons why dismissal, rather than conversion, is in the best interests of the creditors and the estate, as discussed below. So the choice under \u00a7 1112(b)(1) is between dismissal and conversion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"41\">\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    The Debtor's monthly operating reports filed in this case show that the Debtor's income from its custom cabinets business is rather small.
