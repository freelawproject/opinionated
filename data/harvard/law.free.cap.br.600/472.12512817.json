Suits, Jr. (\"Suits\" or \"creditor\"), a judgment creditor, objected to the discharge.\n   <em>\n    In re Katsiroumbas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512080\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/36/\">\n    589 B.R. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. N.D.N.Y. 2018). The appeal has been fully briefed and will be decided on the basis of the submissions without oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Katsiroumbas is a restaurateur and businessman. In 2006, debtor sold off A-1 Restaurant, a pizzeria he owned in Dryden, New York, for $ 1.5 million. The parties to the sale agreed to split up the proceeds using two different contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   First, the buyer shelled out $ 850,000 at the time of purchase. The parties recorded this payment using a standard purchase and sale contract written in English and memorialized on standard New York State real estate transfer forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Second, the buyer promised to pay off the remaining $ 650,000 balance in 84 monthly installments of $ 9,600 at 6 percent interest. The parties memorialized this part of the deal in a private agreement written in Greek, executed in Greece, and secured by a mortgage on property located in Greece (the \"Note\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After selling off the pizzeria, Katsiroumbas tried his hand at investing in other business ventures. First, debtor helped out two other entrepreneurs by pouring a substantial sum of money-by his own estimation, about $ 500,000-into Brix Pubaria, a bar and restaurant in Cortland, New York. However, the relationship between debtor and his co-investors soured and they tried to push him out of the shared enterprise. According to debtor, litigation over ownership of that restaurant remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the spring of 2014, still reeling from being booted out of Brix Pubaria, Katsiroumbas borrowed about $ 289,000 from Suits to open La Piazza, a restaurant in\n   Syracuse, New York. However, the business bled money right from the start and debtor was forced to close the restaurant in November of that year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 18, 2015, apparently as a result of his investment in the failed La Piazza venture, Suits recovered money judgments in state court against Katsiroumbas for $ 341,063.52 and $ 66,711.71. Debtor partially satisfied the latter judgment. Thereafter, debtor made ends meet by working at other restaurants, selling off another property he owned, and accepting a buyout of a mortgage he held on another. Debtor also helped his uncle, Peter Constantine, open and operate Bravo, a pizzeria located in Freeville, New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 28, 2016, seeking a fresh start and a way to rid himself of liability for the substantial money judgment he still owed to Suits, Katsiroumbas filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. As one might expect, creditor sought to block debtor's gambit. Creditor filed an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy case and sought an order denying debtor a discharge of his debts. In that filing, creditor argued debtor had falsified certain records associated with his financial condition, made false statements in connection with his bankruptcy case, or otherwise failed to explain the disposition of certain estate assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 20, 2018, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Margaret Cangilos-Ruiz held a one-day bench trial on Suits's objection to Katsiroumbas's discharge. Judge Cangilos-Ruiz heard testimony from seven witnesses and received extensive documentary evidence into the record, including sworn depositions taken in prior proceedings.\n   <em>\n    In re Katsiroumbas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512080\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/36/\">\n    589 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   40 n.2 (detailing evidentiary record and submissions considered).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At trial, the parties principally disputed whether Katsiroumbas: (1) possessed an undisclosed ownership interest in Bravo at the time he filed for bankruptcy\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (2) received money for work performed at Bravo that he did not disclose in his bankruptcy filing; and (3) properly disclosed any pending or outstanding payments that remained due on the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For his part, Katsiroumbas acknowledged that he received \"substantial payments\" on the Note between 2006 and 2013, but insisted that further installment payments ceased in 2013, well before he filed for bankruptcy. In July of that year, debtor and the counter-party reached a \"satisfaction agreement\" on a final, lump sum payment that would fully discharge the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As for his alleged ownership interest in Bravo, Katsiroumbas admitted that he helped his uncle start the business and conceded that he performs \"many roles\" on a day-to-day basis, but insisted that he received just three $ 500 paychecks (which he properly disclosed on his filing) when the restaurant first opened. Instead of money, debtor claimed that he now receives free meals at the restaurant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Suits introduced evidence tending to show that Katsiroumbas's story was false or misleading. Among other things, creditor showed that debtor had under-reported payments from the Note to the Internal Revenue Service. Creditor argued that this and other related evidence suggested debtor had hidden away some amount of cash from the deal. Creditor also introduced evidence that Mr. Constantine, debtor's uncle, might well have been only a figurehead for Bravo, with debtor himself in full\n   control of the restaurant behind the scenes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On this point, Suits demonstrated that Katsiroumbas himself possessed authorization to sign checks on Bravo's bank account and handled the permitting process with the county health department. Further evidence showed that a large portion of Bravo's transactions are in cash, that the restaurant's process for handling and tracking these cash payments is not rigorous, and that debtor had regular access to the stream of cash moving between the restaurant's registers and the restaurant's bank account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 1, 2018, after post-trial briefing, Judge Cangilos-Ruiz issued an order finding Katsiroumbas ineligible for discharge. The August MDO rejected Suits's claim that debtor had concealed an ownership interest in Bravo or stashed away additional cash compensation flowing from his work at the restaurant. The August MDO also rejected creditor's claim that debtor lied about receiving additional compensation from the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, the August MDO found that Katsiroumbas produced contradictory and incomplete evidence of his financial condition. The August MDO also found that debtor's declarations of ignorance regarding his own finances were untruthful and that debtor had \"deliberately obfuscated his affairs.\" Accordingly, Judge Cangilos-Ruiz denied debtor a discharge. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On appeal, Katsiroumbas argues the bankruptcy court clearly erred in finding the documentary and testimonial evidence of his financial condition to be insufficient and his justification for certain irregularities to be unavailing. Debtor contends that these errors are closely related to the court's unreasonable application of a ten-year \"lookback\" period. Further, debtor argues that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in finding certain of his deposition statements false or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Suits responds that the bankruptcy court's findings of fact are grounded in a detailed and exhaustive analysis that takes into account even obscure factors, like Katsiroumbas's depression. Creditor argues that the bankruptcy court recognized the seriousness of denying debtor's discharge but correctly concluded that such an extreme sanction was warranted in light of debtor's misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"One of the central purposes of the Bankruptcy Code and the privilege of discharge is to allow the 'honest but unfortunate debtor' to begin a new life free from debt.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Cacioli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716612,3723324\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/463/229/\">\n    463 F.3d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 234 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Grogan v.

According to debtor, the bankruptcy court made two, related errors: first, it acted unreasonably in \"looking back\" over the past ten years of debtor's records and second, it erred in concluding that he produced inadequate documentation to establish his financial status in the run up to his bankruptcy filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Katsiroumbas's argument is premised on an important detail about \u00a7 727(a)(3) that might be easy to miss: the provision is not concerned with the broader question of whether a debtor might have been guilty of being a poor record-keeper throughout his financial life. Rather, the provision applies only if a debtor's more recent record-keeping behavior (or misbehavior, as the case may be) renders it impossible to get a clear picture of his financial condition as it stood on the date he filed his bankruptcy petition.\n   <em>\n    In re Kran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179494\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/493/398/#p404\">\n    493 B.R. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404 (S.D.N.Y. 2013),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149457,4195762\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/206/\">\n    760 F.3d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Of course, this inquiry necessarily involves some examination of a debtor's pre-petition record-keeping behavior. But as with most things, the question of how far a bankruptcy court should \"look back\" in time depends on the particular facts and circumstances of each case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Kran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179494\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/493/398/#p404\">\n    493 B.R. at 404-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting the notion that \u00a7 727(a)(3) is an \"indefinite penalty for any kind of past malfeasance\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As Katsiroumbas points out, \"[i]n the ordinary consumer bankruptcy case, it is probably reasonable to limit an inquiry [under \u00a7 727(a)(3) ] to a period of two years before the commencement of the case[.]\"\n   <em>\n    In re Losinski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6542019\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/80/464/#p474\">\n    80 B.R. 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 474 (Bankr.

Judge Cangilos-Ruiz found that the \"repayment status\" of the Note fell within the scope of \u00a7 727(a)(3) even though the evidence strongly indicated that the final payments occurred in July 2013, \"just over three years before the petition date.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Katsiroumbas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512080\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/36/\">\n    589 B.R. at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As the bankruptcy court explained, the Note's repayment status was relevant under the particular circumstances of this case because it involved a large amount of money coming into the hands of a \"highly experienced restauranteur and small business owner.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Katsiroumbas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512080\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/36/\">\n    589 B.R. at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under those circumstances, Judge Cangilos-Ruiz concluded that \"a reliable record of $ 9,600 monthly payments would be reasonable to expect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512080\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/36/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Katsiroumbas essentially argues that this was unfair or, as he puts it, \"requiring [him] to maintain precise records for over a ten year period of unreasonable.\" But debtor's argument about \"precise records\" mischaracterizes the bankruptcy court's expectations on this score. To the contrary, Judge Cangilos-Ruiz clearly explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Though the court does not demand that any one source of evidence fully explain the Note's status, all the proffered non-contemporaneous evidence is unreliable or conclusory in light of other evidence, and contemporaneous evidence only accounts for a small fraction of payments on the Note. On the basis of that shortcoming and the inconsistencies in Debtor's records, the court finds that [Suits] has carried his burden to show that records maintained by Debtor are inadequate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    In re Katsiroumbas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512080\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/36/\">\n    589 B.R. at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Although a two-year \"lookback\" period may be common in run-of-the-mill bankruptcy cases, \"[i]t is up to the bankruptcy court's broad discretion to determine on a case by case basis whether the records produced by the debtor are sufficient.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sethi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11250784\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/250/831/#p838\">\n    250 B.R. at 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In this case, the bankruptcy court determined that a longer \"lookback\" period was necessary for the limited purpose of tracing payments received from a single source in connection with a single, substantial transaction. The bankruptcy court determined that this made sense under the circumstances because, apart from the complexity of Katsiroumbas's restaurant business, the repayment schedule on the Note was basically debtor's only source of non-restaurant installment income.\n   <em>\n    In re Katsiroumbas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512080\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/36/\">\n    589 B.R. at 46-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"There is no evidence that the volume and complexity of Debtor's non-restaurant installment income is so great that a record of payments would be a high bar.\"). Upon review, there is no error, clear or otherwise,\n   in this determination. Accordingly, the August MDO's denial of discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(3) will be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The August MDO also found that Katsiroumbas's declarations of ignorance regarding his own finances were untruthful and that debtor had \"deliberately obfuscated his affairs.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Katsiroumbas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512080\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/36/\">\n    589 B.R. at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A), discharge may be denied if \"the debtor knowingly and fraudulently\" made a \"false oath or account\" that is \"in or in connection with the case.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A). As the August MDO noted, a creditor objecting to discharge on this basis bears the burden of establishing that: (1) the debtor made a statement under oath; (2) the statement was false; (3) the debtor knew the statement was false; (4) the debtor made the statement with fraudulent intent; and (5) the statement related materially to the bankruptcy case.\n   <em>\n    In re Katsiroumbas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512080\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/36/\">\n    589 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   49 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re DeMartino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750709\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/448/122/#p127\">\n    448 B.R. 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127 (Bankr.

According to debtor, the bankruptcy court read too much into debtor's confusion about some of the issues, improperly concluding that his ignorance of certain matters signaled an attempt to deceive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   That assertion might be true in a vacuum. But that is not how the bankruptcy court saw things. As Suits points out, in addition to her more \"sweeping\" observations about the various shortcomings in Katsiroumbas's sworn testimony, Judge Cangilos-Ruiz also made specific findings about specific statements, finding several to be \"demonstrably false.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Katsiroumbas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512080\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/36/\">\n    589 B.R. at 49-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The bankruptcy court further found that debtor knew that these statements were false, that they were made with the requisite fraudulent intent, and that they were \"directly related\" to his bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512080\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/36/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512080\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/36/\">\n    at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Katsiroumbas's brief, which offers explanations and excuses for the various problems the bankruptcy court identified with his testimony and other sworn statements, makes plain that he wants this Court to second-guess Judge Cangilos-Ruiz's findings about his credibility and his subjective intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   There is no reason to do so.
