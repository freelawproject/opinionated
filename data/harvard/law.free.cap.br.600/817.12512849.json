If the IRS willfully violates the stay, it is liable for an individual debtor's actual damages including costs and attorney's fees. The IRS, here, admittedly violated the automatic stay by offsetting taxes owed pre-petition with the debtors' annuity payments to be received post-petition. Before filing an administrative claim for relief with the IRS, the debtors filed an adversary proceeding. After a trial on the severed issue of actual damages, this court ruled the debtors could not prove the actual damage claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The debtors' attorney's fees are a different story. Two provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207430\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 7433) and related regulations ( 26 C.F.R. 301.7430-1(a) and (e) ; 301.7433-2) require the debtors to exhaust administrative remedies before filing an adversary proceeding to recover their attorney's fees for the automatic stay violation. The necessary administrative claim must first be filed with the \"Chief, Local Insolvency Unit, for the judicial district in which the bankruptcy petition\" was filed. 26 C.F.R. 301.7433-2(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   But there is a problem: there is no \"Chief, Local Insolvency Unit, for the judicial district.\" The IRS now concedes after nearly two years of litigation that after filing the adversary proceeding the debtors did properly file an administrative claim - they just needed to file it before the adversary proceeding was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While the current application of this exhaustion requirement appears to be regulatory legerdemain, our circuit requires exhaustion. The broad waiver under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   must be tempered by the relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue code that require exhaustion of administrative remedies before the IRS can be found to have waived their sovereign immunity. For that reason and because the IRS now concedes the debtors here have satisfied the requirements, the court is constrained to dismiss the attorney's fees claim without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Paul Langston (\"Paul\") once worked for the Federal Government. While he worked there, Paul earned a defined benefit annuity payment which was administered by The Office of Personnel Management (\"OPM\") who distributed those payments to Paul. He also owed nearly $ 88,000.00 to the IRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Paul and his wife, Kathleen, (collectively \"Langston,\" \"Langstons,\" of \"Plaintiffs\") filed this Chapter 13 case in January 2017. About two weeks later, the IRS learned of the Langstons' bankruptcy case. In less than a week, the IRS filed a claim in the bankruptcy case. About two months after this case was filed, and while the automatic stay (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was in effect, Paul received a letter from OPM telling him the IRS would be withholding $ 339.17 of his April 3, 2017 annuity payment \"because [Paul] owe[s] the Government.\" The IRS withheld Paul's post-petition annuity payments for the months of April through July 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the failure of informal attempts by the Langstons' counsel to convince the IRS to return the payments, the Langstons filed this adversary proceeding on May 3, 2017. The Langstons did not pursue any administrative remedies until after this suit was filed. But, the IRS returned the April and May annuity payments within two weeks after the adversary proceeding was filed and the June and July payments shortly thereafter. The IRS released the OPM levy on June 23, 2017 and notified Langstons' counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The IRS answered the complaint. Then, Langstons' counsel tried without success to find the right \"Chief, Local Insolvency Unit\" to receive an administrative claim. Many web searches and even formal discovery was met with no identified \"Chief, Local Insolvency Unit.\" Exasperated, Langstons' counsel sent the administrative claim addressed to \"Chief, Local Insolvency Unit\" to every IRS office located within this district. The IRS admitted in discovery that to their knowledge no employee retains the title of \"Chief Local Insolvency Unit\" after the IRS reorganized in 2010. The IRS instead referred debtors' counsel to a listing of \"Collection Advisory Groups.\" The IRS did respond after receiving debtor's administrative claim noting they were referring it to the \"Local Insolvency Unit.\" But the IRS did not name a \"Chief\" of that unit. And so, it goes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the Pretrial Conference in this matter, the court and the parties agreed the \"actual damages\" portion of the debtors' claim should be tried first. It was. The court issued an oral ruling finding the Plaintiffs did not meet their burden of proof for being \"actually\" damaged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The IRS then filed this motion to dismiss the attorney's fees claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Civil Rules 12(b)(1), (h)(3) and (i) (made applicable to bankruptcy adversary proceedings by Rule 7012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IRS argues that this court does not yet have subject matter jurisdiction to decide the attorney's fees issue because the debtors filed this adversary proceeding before filing an administrative claim with the IRS. They reason that their waiver of sovereign immunity under \u00a7 106(a)(1) for attorney's fees claims stemming from automatic stay violations is conditioned upon a debtor's compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207430\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 7433 and the applicable regulations before filing suit. Counsel for the United States noted in oral argument that the Plaintiffs have now complied with the exhaustion requirement because they filed the administrative claim, albeit at the wrong time and that more than six months have passed with no action by the IRS. 26 C.F.R 301-7433-2(d)(ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that complying with the administrative remedy in this case is impossible because there is indisputably no \"Chief, Local Insolvency Unit\" identified to accept the claim even if it was filed before the adversary proceeding. Since the law does not require pursuit of an administrative remedy that is impossible to achieve, Plaintiffs argue, even if they dismissed the suit and filed another administrative claim they could not comply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In reply the IRS argues the Plaintiffs have successfully submitted an administrative claim. So, they contend, the lack of an individual who is the \"Chief, Local Insolvency Unit\" does not mitigate the conditional waiver of sovereign immunity for attorney's fees claims for automatic stay violations: first exhaust administrative remedies before filing this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California has jurisdiction of this bankruptcy case and adversary proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) as this is a proceeding arising under Title 11 of the United States Code and arising in a case under Title 11.

If the proceeding is not deemed \"core\" the parties have agreed to have this court enter a final judgment in the matter.

Administrative remedy exhaustion is a jurisdictional prerequisite. The IRS has shown that neither the Langstons' adversary complaint nor the amended complaint alleged that they exhausted their administrative remedies before suing for attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. # 1, 17. So the Langstons did not comply with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207430\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 7433. The court does note however the great lengths Plaintiffs went to comply after the fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs mailed\n   an administrative claim addressed to \"Chief, Local Insolvency Unit\" to nine separate IRS offices on or around September 25, 2017. Doc. # 104, exh. A. All offices listed appear to be within the boundaries of the Eastern District of California. The Langstons even propounded interrogatories to the IRS to learn how IRS notified the public of the identity of the Chief, Local Insolvency Unit. The IRS responded: \"IRS Publication 4325 has a listing of all local Collection Advisory Groups,\" though no explanation was provided if \"Collection Advisory Group\" is identical to \"Local Insolvency Unit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. # 103, 104, exh. C, p. 6, \u00b6\u00b6 4-14. The court must wonder what issues might be raised if Plaintiffs did timely file the administrative claim to \"Chief, Collection Advisory Group.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Langstons also contend that compliance with the requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207430\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 7433 and accompanying regulations would be futile and therefore unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taniguchi v.

First, the facts of this case do not support the argument. The IRS, through counsel, has conceded that the Langstons have exhausted their administrative remedies and they can proceed with another lawsuit to seek their attorney's fees. So, compliance with the administrative remedy here was neither impossible nor futile.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Second, neither\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Taniguchi\n   </em>\n   help the Langstons here. Those cases did not deal with a pre-requisite to damage recovery or an apparent failure of the relevant law or regulations to have a designated person to whom an administrative claim could be sent. In\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff did not receive the necessary transcript to challenge an immigration judge's credibility determination in an asylum proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Singh v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9272129\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/1164/#p1169\">\n    362 F.3d 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1169-70 (9th Cir. 2004). It was thus futile to require the timely exhaustion requirement. In\n   <em>\n    Taniguchi\n   </em>\n   it was futile to require exhaustion because the basis for the plaintiff's equal protection claim - arbitrary waiver of deportation by the Attorney General - was not supported since plaintiff's status as a legal permanent resident did not legally permit the Attorney General to waive a deportation requirement.\n   <em>\n    Taniguchi v. Schultz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11436011\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/950/#p957\">\n    303 F.3d 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 957-58 (9th Cir. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs here filed the adversary proceeding to stop Defendant from garnishing the annuity payments. Plaintiffs could have simultaneously filed the administrative claim and then filed another adversary proceeding for attorney's fees, if need be. In fact, in this case, the IRS stopped garnishing wages and returned the funds shortly after learning of the pending adversary proceeding. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the Langstons' approach. This scenario is substantially different from those at issue in\n   <em>\n    Taniguchi\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs' defense that the administrative remedy is not available falls short. Strict compliance, as argued by the IRS in reply, requires that the administrative claim \"be sent in writing to the Chief, Local Insolvency Unit, for the judicial district in which the taxpayer filed the underlying bankruptcy case giving rise to the alleged violation.\" 26 C.F.R. 301.7433-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff actually did send such a notice but after the lawsuit was filed. The IRS now admits Plaintiffs have complied and could proceed with another action for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Therefore, pursuant to Civil Rules 12(b)(1), (b)(6) and (c), this motion is GRANTED without prejudice. Since there is no other issue to be tried in this adversary proceeding, the court will issue separate orders dismissing the attorney's fees claim, denying the Langstons' motion for summary judgment without prejudice as moot, and enter a judgment accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Unless specified otherwise, all chapter and section references are to the Bankruptcy Code,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -1532.

At oral argument, Plaintiffs' counsel analogized the IRS' application of the regulations here to Lucy Van Pelt's penchant for moving the football as Charlie Brown was about to kick it in Charles M. Schulz' beloved \"Peanuts\" comic strip. The court notes that Lucy, after all, also dispensed psychiatric advice for a nickel.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Of course, now, counsel for the United States has stated the debtors have complied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    To be sure, one could logically argue that \u00a7 362(k) uses the term \"including\" before \"costs and attorneys' fees\" when describing \"actual damages\" relief afforded those injured by willful violations of the stay. As we see below, that probably makes no difference in the analysis given the specificity of the statutes conditioning attorney's fees recovery from the IRS for improper collection activity on exhausting administrative remedies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Similar sentiments have been expressed elsewhere:\n    <em>\n     Gray v.
