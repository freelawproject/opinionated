For the avoidance of doubt, the term \"\n   <em>\n    Affiliated Companies\n   </em>\n   \" hereinafter does not include McMinnville and Austin Bluffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Management\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   10. All of the Affiliated Companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries of TFEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   11. Since their inception, TFEC and the Affiliated Companies have had common managers, and TFEC has directed all actions of the Affiliated Companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   12. Steven L. Down (\"\n   <em>\n    Down\n   </em>\n   \") founded TFEC, and from 2011 to 2018, he was the Chief Executive Officer. Down and his brother, David W. Down, were also managers of TFEC and the Affiliated Companies. TFEC Docket No. 72, \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   13. On or about June 28, 2018, Brooks Pickering became Chief Restructuring Officer of TFEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   14. On or about August 30, 2018, Mr. Pickering resigned and Gil A. Miller was appointed Chief Restructuring Advisor of TFEC. TFEC Docket No. 99. Mr. Miller served in this role until the appointment of the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   15. On November 27, 2018, the Court entered an\n   <em>\n    Order Approving Appointment of Chapter 11 Trustee\n   </em>\n   , approving the appointment of the Trustee as the Chapter\n   11 trustee of the TFEC estate. TFEC Docket No. 214.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   16. The Trustee manages the Affiliated Companies through TFEC, which is the sole member of the Affiliated Companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     TFEC Capitalization\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   17. Down capitalized TFEC primarily through private investor funding and hard money loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   18. Prior to the Petition Date, on May 10, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   against TFEC and Down in the United States District Court for the District of Utah (Case No. 2:18-cv-00382), a copy of which is attached to the Trustee's Memorandum as\n   <em>\n    Exhibit A\n   </em>\n   . The Complaint alleges that Down had raised approximately $ 120 million from approximately 300 investors since 2011, and Down misrepresented the profitability of TFEC even after he was fully informed that TFEC was not profitable and had never been profitable. On May 11, 2018, the District Court entered a\n   <em>\n    Final Judgment\n   </em>\n   in this lawsuit in which TFEC and Down consented to entry of the Final Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Down agreed to pay $ 150,000 in civil penalties, and TFEC and Down were enjoined from violating securities laws. Case No. 2:18-cv-00382 Docket No. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   19. The Trustee's investigation to date indicates that information that Down provided to investors about the profitability of TFEC's enterprise was not accurate, and the funds obtained from operating the event center and Waterpark businesses were not sufficient to sustain the entire enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Affiliated Companies' Capitalization and Property Acquisition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   20. None of the Affiliated Companies has ever had a source of income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   21. The debts of each of the Affiliated Companies have been paid by TFEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   22. Each of the Affiliated Companies acquired title to real property through hard money or traditional loans that were secured by the real property they held. TFEC caused each of the Affiliated Companies to enter into these loans, and any cash down payments or debt service on the loans was made from TFEC funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   23. TFEC guaranteed or is otherwise obligated for the majority of the Affiliated Companies' real property loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Business Operations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   24. TFEC's corporate office is located in a building that it leases located in West Jordan, Utah (the \"\n   <em>\n    Office\n   </em>\n   \"). TFEC runs its operations and manages each of the Affiliated Companies from the Office, and none of the Affiliated Companies have separate offices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   25. All books and records of TFEC and the Affiliated Companies are located in the Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   26. TFEC has approximately two hundred and twenty-five employees. The Affiliated Companies have no employees, and to the extent that they require services they rely on TFEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   27. TFEC manages each of the Affiliated Companies without receiving compensation or remuneration, including providing bookkeeping services and attending to management of property owned or leased by the Affiliated Companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   28. TFEC's business includes operating event centers and a waterpark at the real properties held by some of the Affiliated Companies. TFEC has no written contracts with the Affiliated Companies for use of the properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   29. TFEC attends to all aspects of running the event centers and executing events, including contracting with persons\n   wanting to hold events, securing prepayments, servicing events, contracting with vendors that assist in servicing the events, and collecting final payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   30. All activity for TFEC and the Affiliated Companies has always been filed on consolidated tax returns as the Affiliated Companies are considered to be disregarded entities by the Internal Revenue Service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n    <em>\n     Cash Management and Accounting\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   31. Prior to the TFEC Petition Date TFEC had 3 bank accounts. TFEC Docket No. 72 (Schedule B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   32. Prior to the TFEC Petition Date, none of the Affiliated Companies had bank accounts, and creditors of the Affiliated Companies were therefore paid on checks issued by TFEC using its accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   33. Prior to the TFEC Petition Date, TFEC maintained two sets of accounting records. The first contained activity for TFEC corporate overhead and all activity for operating and non-operating Affiliated Companies (\"\n   <em>\n    TFEC QuickBooks\n   </em>\n   \"). The second file contained only the activity for Waterpark operations, even though the Waterpark is a dba of TFEC. Within the TFEC QuickBooks, all real property, debt and operational income and expenses of the Affiliated Companies were consolidated. Each transaction was identified to a particular \"Class\" representing the Affiliated Company to which the transaction related. There was no attempt made to book intercompany receivables and payables to identify TFEC's payment of any of the Affiliated Companies' obligations, such as debt service or property taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   34. The Trustee's investigation, while still preliminary and ongoing, indicates that TFEC used the funds it obtained from business operations and investors to fund whatever the needs of the entire enterprise were at any given time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   35. The assets and business activities of TFEC and the Affiliated Companies have been treated as a single enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    7.\n    <em>\n     The Affiliated Companies' Bankruptcy Filings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   36. After the TFEC Petition Date, the following companies filed cases seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code: Elk Grove (July 16, 2018, Case No. 18-25208), Gilbert (July 25, 2018, Case No. 18-25419), McMinnville (July 27, 2018, Case No. 18-25492), St. George (September 6, 2018, Case No. 18-26653), Littleton (September 24, 2018, Case No. 18-27111), Fresno (October 15, 2018, Case No. 18-27713), Bricktown (October 17, 2018, Case No. 18-27766), and Clovis (October 31, 2018, Case No. 18-28140) (collectively, with TFEC, the \"\n   <em>\n    Debtors\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   37. As the trustee of TFEC, the Trustee manages these Debtors as debtors in possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   38. To date, the following companies have not sought bankruptcy protection: Austin Bluffs, Burr Ridge, Cutten Road, Cedar Park, Stone Oak, Beaverton, Roseville, and Trolley (the \"\n   <em>\n    Non-Debtors\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     CONSOLIDATION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   39. The Court finds that it is in the best interests of creditors and all parties in interest to substantively consolidate the following Debtor and Non-Debtor Affiliated Companies with TFEC as of the TFEC Petition Date: Gilbert, St. George, Littleton, Fresno, Clovis, Cutten Road, Stone Oak, Beaverton, Roseville (collectively, the \"\n   <em>\n    Falls Parties\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   40. The Trustee also sought consolidation of Debtor McMinnville and Non-Debtor Austin Bluffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Basis for and Benefit of Consolidation of the Falls Parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   41. The Court finds that it is in the best interests of creditors and all parties in\n   interest to substantively consolidate the Falls Parties with TFEC for reasons general to all of the Falls Parties as well as reasons specific to certain of the Falls Parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   42. The following considerations general to most or all of the Falls Parties support consolidation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   a. The Falls Parties are alter egos of TFEC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   b. Substantive consolidation will make it unnecessary to quantify and prosecute intercompany claims that may exist between TFEC and the Falls Parties, thus conserving considerable resources of the separate estates or entities. For example, at this time, arguably, the Falls Parties on whose properties TFEC was conducting business have claims against TFEC for use of their properties, and TFEC has claims against each of the Falls Parties for, among other things, costs of managing the Falls Parties and monies it used to purchase properties and pay the debts of the Falls Parties. The cost of quantifying these claims will likely exceed any benefit that might result. Among other things, (a) to the extent that TFEC may have claims against the Falls Parties, those Parties have no source of income to pay TFEC other than from any equity that may exist in their respective properties; (b) the Falls Parties' primary creditors are those claiming to hold claims secured by property, and therefore, any equity in the property will be paid to TFEC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   c. Substantive consolidation of the Falls Parties with TFEC will resolve corporate governance and authority issues as to these Affiliated Companies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   d. For the Non-Debtor Falls Parties, substantive consolidation will allow the Trustee to include these entities in a reorganization or orderly liquidation, including the benefits associated with bankruptcy sale provisions and bankruptcy transparency. Specifically, substantive consolidation will allow the Trustee to sell real property owned by Cutten Road, Stone Oak, Beaverton, and Roseville under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code for a higher price than if that property were sold without the protections of Section 363, and thus realize a higher return for creditors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   e. Substantive consolidation will greatly streamline the TFEC case and the cases of the Debtor Falls Parties, thus, among other things, reducing costs and delays related to separate administration, minimizing confusion by parties in interest created by the various cases (and non-cases), and consolidating noticing issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   f. Substantive consolidation will benefit the creditors of the individual Falls Parties by giving those creditors recourse against TFEC and all of the Falls Parties rather than simply the individual company against which they currently hold a claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   g. Substantive consolidation will benefit TFEC's creditors by allowing the Trustee to realize greater returns on the sale of the Falls Parties' properties and then upstream those funds more easily and efficiently to TFEC for the benefit of its creditors. Further, substantive consolidation will not expose TFEC to significantly greater liability than it currently has. TFEC has already guaranteed the debt of Fresno, Cutten Road, and Stone Oak and will incur no additional liability by being consolidated with those three companies. Consolidation will make TFEC liable for possible deficiency claims held by the creditors of Gilbert, Littleton, and Roseville, but even should those claims accrue, they would, based on information available at\n   this time, constitute only about 2.5% of the total unsecured claims against TFEC, and thus do not represent a significant dilution to TFEC unsecured creditors, whose claims at this time are estimated to exceed $ 100 million.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   43. Other means of administering the Debtors' bankruptcy cases would be less efficient and less likely to maximize the value of assets for the benefit of creditors. For example, appointment of a trustee for each of the Debtors may not be beneficial given that, in the absence of consolidation, one person likely could not serve as a trustee for TFEC and the Affiliated Companies given the significant and complicated intercompany claims. Multiple trustees and professionals would greatly increase administrative costs to the detriment of all creditors. Accordingly, substantive consolidation of the Falls Parties with TFEC is in the best interests of all parties in interest and the respective bankruptcy estates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Companies Not Consolidated at this Time.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   44. Due to the American Objection and the Museum Objection, the Court reserves consideration of the Motion as it relates to Non-Debtor Austin Bluffs and Debtor McMinnville. A hearing on the American Objection is scheduled for April 17, 2019, and a hearing on the Museum Objection is scheduled for May 6, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   45. The Court makes no findings regarding the appropriateness of consolidating the following companies with TFEC at this time: Debtor Elk Grove, Debtor Bricktown, Non-Debtor Cedar, Park Non-Debtor Burr Ridge, and Non-Debtor Trolley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Notice and Objections\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   46. Based on the Notice, the Certificate of Service of Motion Documents, the Certificate of Service of Notice, and the Declaration Concerning Service, the Court finds that notice of the Motion and the Hearing was properly served on all creditors of TFEC, the Falls Parties, McMinnville, and Austin Bluffs giving them an opportunity to object to the relief sought in the Motion. Such notice is sufficient, and no further notice or service is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   47. No objections were filed as to substantive consolidation of Gilbert, St. George, Littleton, Fresno, Clovis, Cutten Road, Stone Oak Parkway, Beaverton, and Roseville with TFEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   48. American filed the American Objection, objecting only to the substantive consolidation of Austin Bluffs with TFEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   49. The Museum filed the Museum Objection, objecting only to the substantive consolidation of McMinnville with TFEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   50. At the hearing, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion as to consolidation of Austin Bluffs and McMinnville, and counsel for American and the Museum did not object to the consolidation of the Falls Parties, as defined herein, with TFEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   51. Accordingly, there are no objections to the substantive consolidation of the Falls Parties with TFEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   52. The Court finds that all parties who were served with the Notice and did not object have consented to the Court exercising jurisdiction over Non-Debtors Cutten Road, Stone Oak Parkway, Beaverton, and Roseville.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   53.

Courts have adopted two tests for\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   consolidation, with the key factor under both tests being whether there was \"reliance on an entity's apparent separateness.\"\n   <em>\n    Bonham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11667522\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/226/56/#p99\">\n    226 B.R. at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   66. The first test is established in\n   <em>\n    In re Auto-Train Corporation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1635300,4329734,6126502,4329323,1635279\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/810/270/\">\n    810 F.2d 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 1987), where the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   consolidation requires the movant to show that such consolidation is necessary to achieve some benefit or avoid some harm. If this showing is made,\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   consolidation will be allowed unless any opposing party proves that it relied on the separate credit of one of the entities to be consolidated\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   that the harm to it in shifting a filing date will\n   outweigh the benefits of\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   consolidation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1635300,4329734,6126502,4329323,1635279\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/810/270/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1635300,4329734,6126502,4329323,1635279\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/810/270/\">\n    at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   67. The second test for\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   consolidation was set forth by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    In re Baker &amp; Getty Financial Srvcs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6521409,10516919\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/974/712/\">\n    974 F.2d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir.1992). Under this test, the following two factors are considered in determining whether substantive consolidation should occur as of the petition date: (1) whether the creditors dealt with the consolidated entities as if they were the same,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (2) the affairs of the consolidated entities are so entangled that it would not be feasible to identify and allocate all of their assets and liabilities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6521409,10516919\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/974/712/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   68. Under either of these tests, substantive consolidation of Falls Parties as of the TFEC Petition Date is appropriate. The Falls Parties had no corporate existence outside of the TFEC corporate group. The Falls Parties' affairs are so entangled with those of TFEC that it would be most efficient to consolidate them as of the TFEC Petition Date, which allows the Trustee to capture the Falls Parties' assets as assets of the consolidated estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   69. No party in interest has objected to substantive consolidation as of the TFEC Petition Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   70. Accordingly, the Falls Parties are substantively consolidated with TFEC as of the TFEC Petition Date.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
