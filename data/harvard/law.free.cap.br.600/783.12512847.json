Hanan, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The debtor seeks to have his student loans, consolidated in 2001, discharged because he asserts that continued repayment would constitute an undue hardship. After obtaining a bachelor's and Master's degree, being employed and then self-employed for 19 years, the debtor ended his new job search in early 2016 after six weeks to stay home to care for his ailing parent, and then for his young child. As part of its argument against undue hardship, the lender seeks a determination that a trust, established by the debtor's mother shortly before her death in 2017, creates an income stream for the debtor's benefit and not strictly for the benefit of the settlor's grandchildren.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Applying the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test, in light of\n   <em>\n    Krieger v. ECMC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court holds that\n   repayment of this debtor's student loans does not constitute such an undue hardship as to make that obligation dischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8). The Court also interprets the trust settlor's intent to have set aside funds for her grandchildren's education, not the education of her 46-year old son, and so those funds are not available to the debtor for the repayment of his student loans or his other living expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff, Dylan Frey Tuttle, is a married father of one. Mr. Tuttle, (dba Vulkans Forge Consulting Ltd, dba Weestack LLC) and his wife, Madison Zuverink, filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on August 18, 2016 and were granted a discharge on November 28, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 27, 2017, the Court granted Tuttle's motion to reopen his case to file an adversary complaint to determine the dischargeability of his student loans. Tuttle's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaint asserts that excepting his student loan debt from discharge will impose an undue hardship on the debtor, his wife, and their young son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The original defendant was Navient Solutions, Inc. On June 9, 2017, the Court granted Education Credit Management Corporation's (\"ECMC\") motion to substitute ECMC as a party defendant for Navient. ECMC is a not-for-profit Minnesota corporation that administers and guarantees the Federal Family Education Loan Program (\"FFELP\"). ECMC also provides specialized guarantor services to the Department of Education and other FFELP guaranty agencies, including accepting transfer of title to certain student loan accounts on which the student loan borrower has filed a bankruptcy proceeding. ECMC accepted the transfer of all right, title and interest in Tuttle's consolidated loan from its original guarantor. Exhibit 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After several months of discovery and discovery-related motions, the Court held a trial, with testimony from Mr. Tuttle and Ms. Kerry Klitsch of ECMC. Thereafter, the Court set a post-trial briefing schedule,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and took the matter under advisement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin has jurisdiction to decide this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

They separated when he was age 11, as an only child. He and his mother lived in a Chicago apartment, and he attended public high school while she worked as a housekeeping supervisor at a hospital. They lived modestly, and he \"did not have a lot of guidance regarding schooling or a career.\" He incurred student loan debt for his tuition and expenses at Shimer College in Chicago, where he received a Bachelor's Degree in 1994. He also assumed student loan debt while studying at the London School of Economics, where he received a Master's Degree in Political Sociology in 1996.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After completing his formal education, Mr. Tuttle worked in options trading between 1997 and 2005. He first served an internship learning the options trade in 1997, then as a clerk at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1998. After that he worked as a clerk for a trader at the Board of Options Exchange, working on a joint account for over a year, into 1999. For the next several years he traded off and on, sometimes for his own account and sometimes for another's account. When the exchange transitioned from floor to electronic trading, Tuttle was unwilling to incur more debt to obtain a Master's degree in quantitative finance and thereby participate in electronic trading, so he accepted a severance package as his department downsized. He drove a cab at night in 2006. After leaving trading, he volunteered for a small business development corporation, and then worked in economic development programming, developing programs for managers and small business owners. During this period, he also took 30 credits of coursework in economics and accounting at the local technical school, without borrowing for tuition and in an effort to improve his employment prospects. Exhibit 42. After being denied a promotion, he started his own business in 2011, around the same time he got married. He worked in Chicago during the week, sleeping in his office, and coming to Milwaukee on weekends to be with his wife. While trying to make a go of his grant-writing training business, Tuttle successfully completed a Phase I SBIR award (small business innovation research program through the National Science Foundation) but did not progress further as he was unable to secure significant investor commitments. As he said, \"By then it was December, 2015, and he was running out of options and realized the business was not going to work and was not sustainable.\" He also testified \"his wife humored him for awhile and then said he had to get real and move on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Tuttle has generated no monthly income since October 2015. He testified that because it took so long for the business to become \"cash flow positive\" he could not make payments on his educational loans after January 6, 2012. His job search between the weeks of November 21, 2015 and January 9, 2016 was unsuccessful. He then ceased his search, because his mother became terminally ill and shortly thereafter his wife became pregnant. Exhibit 34. He converted his Illinois S-Corporation into a Wisconsin LLC (Weestack, LLC) with the intention of running the business from home. Exhibit 4. That business never produced revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After finding local daycare costs to be almost $ 1,000/month, Exhibit 48, and considering Mr. Tuttle's irregular income over time, Exhibit 44, and work history, Tuttle testified he and Ms. Zuverink decided that he should care for their child full-time, stating \"it is plausible that our children will be better off with a parent at home.\" As part of this decision, he testified he also considered the fact of his \"low-income background\" and his perception of its effect on his employability. He testified that\n   his career history of lack of advancement and lack of supervisory experience, by mid-life, were also factors in his conclusion that he was not readily employable. He did not specify for which types of employment he based this conclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He and his wife filed their Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in August, 2016, several months before their child was born.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Their child is now a healthy two-year-old, and both Mr. Tuttle and Ms. Zuverink are healthy and ages 46 and 32, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Loan Repayment History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Tuttle's initial student loans totaled $ 39,088, including Stafford Subsidized, Stafford Unsubsidized, and Federal Perkins loans. Exhibit 40. His loans entered repayment in 1997. Tuttle repaid his Perkins Loans ($ 5,000) by August, 2000, during the time he was working in options trading. Exhibit 10. On January 10, 2001, Tuttle executed a Federal Consolidation Loan Application and Promissory Note created pursuant to FFELP. Tuttle's consolidation loan of his Stafford Loans was disbursed on January 22, 2001 in the amount of $ 41,871.56, including capitalized interest, with a repayment period of 25 years. Exhibit 49, Response 9. ECMC now holds title to the consolidation loan. To date, Tuttle has made 104 payments on his FFELP consolidation loan in the total amount of $ 34,198.59, of which $ 4,799.84 was applied to principal. Since he consolidated his Stafford Loans, Exhibit 10, he has taken nine periods of deferment or forbearance, totaling 87 months between January 1, 2003 and May 4, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exhibit 49, Response 11. During that same period, he had several employers, some unemployment, and had also been an entrepreneur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   These periods of deferment and forbearance have resulted in capitalization of interest. Thus, as of the time of trial in late summer, 2018, his consolidated loan had a balance due of $ 59,640.19. Exhibit 105. His updated payment schedule, issued January 22, 2017, requires 196 monthly payments: $ 368.50 for five months beginning April 2, 2017, increasing to $ 504.90 for 190 months, and one final payment of $ 502.66 if the loan were to be paid off by July 2033. Exhibit 41. Tuttle has avoided default on his student loan debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Loan repayment options have changed over the time since Mr. Tuttle first entered repayment. Presently, he has not elected to participate in any repayment plans offered by the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program. Ms. Klitsch described the Standard Repayment Plan, Graduated Repayment Plan, Extended Repayment Plan, Income Contingent Repayment Plan (\"ICRP\"), Income-Based Repayment Plan (\"IBR\"), and Revised Pay as You Earn Plan (\"REPAYE\") (collectively, the \"Ford Program\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1087a.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20685.208\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 685.208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 209 ; Exhibit 107. Tuttle contended that if he accepted a current offer for IBR, it would mean \"accepting a new direct consolidation loan with a maximum repayment period of 25 years under standard or graduated repayment plans, and that he would have lost credit for any payments made toward income-driven repayment plan forgiveness.\" CM-ECF Doc. No. 54, at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   He also argues, somewhat conversely, that \"the possibility of loan forgiveness also implies a potential nondischargeable tax liability, and the debt would be reported to credit bureaus for the life of the loan, negatively impacting our household's ability to build assets.\" CM-ECF Doc. No. 72, at 15, \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Income and Expenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When the debtors commenced their Chapter 7 in August, 2016, they listed over $ 64,000 in credit card debt on Schedule E/F.

That debt has since been discharged, and Mr. Tuttle asserts he has incurred no new debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   They also listed student loan debt totaling $ 49,339 for Mr. Tuttle and $ 37,693 for Ms. Zuverink.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20685.208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20685.208\">\n    at 27-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The household's adjusted gross income over the last several years has ranged from a high of $ 68,049 (in 2013) to a low of $ 27,245 (in 2016). Exhibit 101. The debtors' tax returns for 2015, 2016 and 2017 showed an average federal tax refund of $ 6,481.00, although these were not accounted for on Schedule I. Exhibit 100. The Chapter 7 panel trustee held a meeting of creditors and a continuance of that meeting, at which both debtors appeared. The trustee issued her Report of No Distribution (no asset report) on October 13, 2016. The debtors received their discharge in November 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mr. Tuttle testified that his wife recently defended her Ph.D. thesis in microbiology and was scheduled to receive her Ph.D. in late 2018. According to Tuttle, at the time of trial Ms. Zuverink was applying for post-graduate fellowships and as a consequence the family might be required to move to Toronto. Tuttle testified that his wife is likely to earn between C$ 40,000 and C$ 45,000, or an average of C$ 42,500 for the years of any fellowship in Toronto (or elsewhere in Canada). The foreign currency exchange rate, as of the date of this decision, is C$ 1.3620 to $ 1.00 USD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/reports-statements/treasury-reporting-ratesexchange/current.html\n   </em>\n   That means a Canadian salary of $ 42,500 would be approximately $ 31,204.00 USD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Tuttle and/or his family have received benefits from the Wisconsin Home Energy Assistance program, Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin's Financial Assistance Program, BadgerCare Plus insurance for their child, WIC Wisconsin, and a local church food pantry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   ECMC disputes the accuracy and necessity of a number of Mr. Tuttle's currently claimed expenses. Schedule J, dated August 18, 2016, listed $ 1,525 in total expenses. Tuttle testified that he merely estimated their Schedule J expenses based on a budget he created during mandatory credit counseling. As such Schedule J was not based on actual expenses but rather on a discussion that he had with his wife prior to adding a child to their household and he failed to budget for several categories of expenses. Tuttle testified that his household monthly expenses for January to June 2017 (five months after he filed his Schedule J) were $ 3,210.69, for their household of three. He submitted this list of revised expenses to ECMC in discovery and offered it at trial as Exhibit 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   ECMC argued that certain claimed expenses were unduly high for a \"thrifty lifestyle\": $ 258.10 in monthly healthcare for three healthy family members, $ 262.53 monthly for \"electronics and merchandise\" and $ 253.37 in transportation and car insurance expenses (versus the $ 173 listed on Schedule J). ECMC argued that Tuttle improperly took the car expense figure from a consumer survey, Exhibit 7, instead of basing it on the debtors' actual household expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In response, Mr. Tuttle testified that the \"electronics and merchandise\" category includes online purchases, such as the second-hand clothing and books his wife buys for herself and their child. In his interrogatory response he agreed some of the $ 527.34 expense under \"Weestack LLC,\" his home business, was no longer applicable, as it originally reflected the wind-down expenses for his first business, Vulkans Forge Consulting, but in his reply brief he agreed that the business had ended. He acknowledged that $ 152.19 per month for restaurant expense was \"more than we would like, but convenience and social obligations occasionally win out.\" He also expected household income to decline after his wife obtains her Ph.D., because Social Security and Medicare were not withheld while his wife was a graduate student, and will be withheld in future. He did not estimate those deductions. If Ms. Zuverink accepts a fellowship in Toronto and the family moves, Tuttle expects some increased expenses. He did not identify those expenses. Exhibit 6 does not include any student loan payment for Tuttle, which, as Ms. Klitsch testified, if he does not enter into a new deferment or new IBR arrangement, would be between $ 469 to $ 555 per month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    The Trust\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Mr. Tuttle also provided a copy of the July 22, 2016 Miriam Guillermina Carrillo Living Trust (the \"Trust\"), which his mother established and of which he is, by virtue of his mother's passing and the terms of the trust document, now the sole trustee.

Section 6, which makes Mr. Tuttle a 100% beneficiary is qualified by Section 8, which requires that any property distributed to him be retained in trust until his death. The plain meaning is that any funds designated to Tuttle, not previously allocated to subtrusts specifically identified for the benefit of Tuttle's children, are for the benefit of his heirs only. This reading also is supported by Section 4(b) which makes Madison Zuverink, Tuttle's wife and mother of his child, the successor trustee. (In other words, all the provisions of the Trust document are directed for the care of Tuttle's issue.) Further support for the interpretation that Tuttle does not financially benefit from the trust corpus, is that the Chapter 7 panel trustee was aware of the Trust document, held two section 341 meetings with the debtors, and still issued a no asset report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 16-28259, CM-ECF Doc.

As ECMC acknowledged, the debtors' income at the time of filing was \"tenuous.\" CM-ECF Doc. No. 77 at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Mr. Tuttle projected his spouse will be making (or likely is already earning this Spring semester) C$ 40,000-C$ 45,000 annually in her fellowship. Converting to U.S. dollars, the projected average would be $ 31,204 per year. Allowing a 20% reduction for federal income tax and other withholding, Ms. Zuverink's average monthly take-home would be approximately $ 2,080.00. That amount is 120% of the poverty guideline. Mr. Tuttle testified that after the fellowship, Ms. Zuverink will seek full-time employment as a microbiologist. The Court finds that the household income is likely to increase beyond the $ 2,080/month at least by year 2021, solely due to Ms. Zuverink's profession. But assessing present income only, against the expenses described below, Mr. Tuttle's household cannot meet a minimal standard of living and make payments on his student loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Household expenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   ECMC argued that Exhibit 7, the U.S. Department of Labor survey of average annual expenditures by households of three, was not targeted at the Milwaukee region and therefore should not be accepted to support Mr. Tuttle's revised schedule of expenses. On further review of that survey, the Court agrees that it holds little persuasive value. Not only do the survey tables fail to narrow the data by region of the country, but footnote 1 states \"data are likely to have large sampling errors\" and footnote 2 \"value is too small to display,\" and these footnotes appear on multiple entries under the column pertaining to the debtor's 2018 household income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Overall, ECMC argues that the claimed expenses fail to reflect \"belt-tightening\" required by\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   and its progeny.\n   <em>\n    In re O'Hearn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9103036\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/559/#p564\">\n    339 F.3d at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (to meet the first prong, a debtor must manifest he is making major personal and financial sacrifices, and not merely sustaining \"garden variety hardship\"). Mr. Tuttle argued that reducing the expenses assailed by ECMC would still show a deficit in his family's budget, citing\n   <em>\n    In re Innes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1088655\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/284/496/\">\n    284 B.R. 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Kan. 2002). If Ms. Zuverink remains the only income-earner in the household, then the Court agrees with Mr. Tuttle's math.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   ECMC criticizes the debtor's monthly healthcare expense of $ 258.10, shown on Exhibit 6. Mr. Tuttle says this includes co-pays, deductibles and other non-insured expenses. The Court accepts that amount, in part because Tuttle's argument that ancillary benefits, like WIC, Badgercare and Froedtert health assistance which Ms. Zuverink received while a research assistant, will no longer be available to the family when they relocate for Ms. Zuverink's fellowship. Church assistance, however, is likely to be equally available if needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Next, ECMC criticized the $ 262.53 category for electronics and merchandise on Exhibit 6, but Mr. Tuttle testified that amount included second-hand clothing for his wife and child, and there is no other line item for clothing. He did not explain the electronics portion of that line item, but specifies other amounts for cable, services and supplies and utilities. The\n   Court concludes that he has failed to identify what \"electronics\" are and so reduces that amount to $ 130.00. Likewise, Tuttle failed to identify the nature of the line item \"other expenses\" in the amount of $ 172.26, other than to say it was a category from his bank's online tool. But he did not offer bank statements into evidence, and it is the debtor's burden to be specific.\n   <em>\n    Nelsen v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp.

Without a description, the Court must discount that expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   With regard to transportation expenses, as noted above, the Court does not accept the survey contained in Exhibit 7, and so instead of the $ 148.08 shown on Exhibit 6, the Court accepts the expense for transportation costs in Schedule J, line 12 of $ 65. The Court agrees with Mr. Tuttle that the $ 527.34 expense for Weestack can be eliminated. The Vulkans Forge business has not been functioning since at least late 2015, and, contrary to his August, 2016 notation on Schedule I that \"home business should be cash flow positive within a year,\" the debtors' 2017 tax returns showed a $ 3,000 loss for Weestack. Essentially, it, too, is not functioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   While the debtors do not live extravagantly, cases interpreting sec. 523(a)(8) require \"belt-tightening\" so that taxpayers are more likely to recoup their investment in student borrowers. Accordingly, the Court finds $ 194.94 in monthly entertainment, restaurants and travel expense to surpass the \"belt-tightening\" required, and should be reduced to $ 100.00. The Court also finds that $ 523.95 per month for groceries, for a healthy family of 3, is high relative to what other debtors in this district manage, and should be reduced to $ 424.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   With these reductions, monthly expenses on Exhibit 6, for Mr. Tuttle's household of 3, total $ 2,100.62. Those expenses are below the adjusted Schedule I income of $ 2,196.04 (reflecting prorated tax refunds and no business expense loss), by $ 96.42. This is a very strict budget. It may not include a health insurance premium. And, as of the date of trial, Tuttle could not maintain a minimal standard of living and still make his loan payments. Mr. Tuttle's testimony that his wife would be working in her fellowship several months after trial, at a projected average monthly salary of $ 2,080, does not mean an income increase for her in the near term, and could mean a decrease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   ECMC argues under the first\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   prong that Mr. Tuttle has failed to maximize his income, and some courts analyze that factor at this point.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Butler v.

At the time of trial Tuttle and his family lived in an urban area, and he testified that his wife's fellowship opportunities are also in an urban area. This means an expanded array of employment opportunity for Tuttle's search, possibly exploiting his finance background, his workforce development experience, his researching ability, his experience as a grant-writer/professional writer, or a trainer. He has an undergraduate and a graduate degree. True enough, he will need to find employment to\n   a degree that covers his loan payment and childcare at least until their child or children are in school, or work that is on an alternating shift from that of his wife. His explanation at trial for why he was not hired during the six-week period in 2015-16 when he looked for work was lacking in detail, as was the reason why his own entrepreneurial efforts failed. He testified to his conclusion \"there is no career or good job for me to return to when our children reach school age,\" but again, the lack of specificity undermines the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Mr. Tuttle cites\n   <em>\n    In re Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874370,4182861\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/1227/\">\n    650 F.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2011), but the Eighth Circuit follows a totality of circumstances analysis. Even so, the facts in\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   creating a persistent inability to pay are starkly distinguishable. There, the debtor and her husband had five children, including twins with autism who required intensive at-home therapy and enough hours of parental involvement in that therapy that essentially equated to a full-time job. Even looking ahead a few years to when the therapy hours would lessen, the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   court appeared to view parenting of five children, including two with special needs, and even though debtor's husband worked two jobs, as a persistent, additional circumstance strongly suggestive of a continuing inability to repay.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874370,4182861\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/1227/\">\n    650 F.3d at 1232-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, the concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   skeptically points to some family expenditures not reflective of proper minimizing of expenses to sustain an \"undue hardship\" burden.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874370,4182861\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/1227/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874370,4182861\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/1227/\">\n    at 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In support of his argument for unemployability due to childcare duties, Mr. Tuttle explained that he and his wife had their first child in December, 2016. Apparently together they decided that it would be more \"cost-effective\" for him to provide childcare, instead of gaining outside employment. Tuttle asserted that monthly childcare for an infant in his area cost $ 997, Exhibit 48. Another court in our Circuit rejected a debtor's choice of staying home to provide childcare as a basis for seeking discharge of her student loans, when full-time work was very likely available to her.\n   <em>\n    Wessels v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9452332\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/271/313/#p315\">\n    271 B.R. 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315 (W.D. Wis. 2002). To the extent that Tuttle's mother's illness in 2016 was a special circumstance taking him out of the workforce, that circumstance did not create a \"persistent inability\" to pay his student loan debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Another factor Mr. Tuttle points to for inability to pay is that he considers himself of \"low-income family background.\" He relies on research comparing low-income college graduates' earnings peaks to that of higher-income graduates' earnings peaks, as well as relative likelihoods of educational loan defaults or deferments between those two groups.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CM-ECF Doc. No. 72, at 7 et seq., Exhibit 22. Tuttle testified that his \"work history is consistent with college graduates from low-income backgrounds\" and that this concept was relevant to his decision to leave the workforce and care for his child. Tuttle may or may not have a profile, like innumerable others, that fits the \"low-income background\" of the research he cites. But that broad descriptor cannot replace the discrete individual characteristics recognized by\n   <em>\n    Goulet\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Krieger\n   </em>\n   , such as lack of job skills, or significant physical or psychological impediments. Sweeping categorization and arguable predictors may be useful in policy arguments to legislators, but courts in this Circuit are tasked with applying sec. 523(a) 8) to a single debtor's specific circumstances, as manifested by admissible evidence before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Last, Mr. Tuttle makes another policy argument. He urges that the second\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   prong should not apply when the borrower's repayment burden is not commensurate\n   with his projected ability to pay, because the servicer approved deferment and consecutive forbearances for years, instead of offering the debtor an income-sensitive repayment schedule. He argues that his principal balance of 160% of the borrowed amount, in spite of having made 104 payments, is a clear indication that his repayment burden is not commensurate with his ability to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   But this argument places the burden on the lender, not the borrower. As the\n   <em>\n    Roberson\n   </em>\n   court teaches, the debtor must accept the consequences of his decision to borrow.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11960381,6528190\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/999/1132/\">\n    999 F.2d at 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"If the leveraged investment of an education does not generate the return the borrower anticipated, the student, not the taxpayers, must accept the consequences of the decision to borrow.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11960381,6528190\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/999/1132/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Mr. Tuttle so far has declined to re-consolidate his current loan and enter into any new ICRP, IBR or REPAYE program. Now that this adversary proceeding is concluding, he may view things differently. One of those options, even though it establishes a longer payment duration, could allow for reduced payment in the near term, while Tuttle looks for work and a greater payment after Tuttle's income increases once he obtains employment, as well as after his child/children are school-age and childcare costs decrease. Presumably his wife's income also will increase when her fellowship concludes. Whether or not Tuttle refinances, a consideration of the taxability of forgiveness of the loan balance at the end of term is premature.\n   <em>\n    Gesualdi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890792\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/505/330/#p340\">\n    505 B.R. at 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Mr. Tuttle has failed to present evidence of insurmountable circumstances making him unable to pay his student loan debt for the remainder of the payment period. Having earned a bachelors degree, and a Master's degree from the London School of Economics, Tuttle has a substantial education. And, although he has had some difficulty maintaining employment in the past, he has a history of sophisticated work, self-direction and creativity. Nonetheless, Tuttle cites his age, his \"low-income background,\" and lack of supervisory experience as barriers to employment and means to repay his loans. None of these circumstances appear exceptional or indomitable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232500\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/517/870/#p876\">\n    517 B.R. at 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and so do not meet the \"certainty of hopelessness\" standard required by the second\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   prong. Even setting aside any \"gloss\" of that phrase, given all of the debtor's positive attributes, experience and years of work life ahead, Mr. Tuttle has not established an inability to pay that is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Efforts to make payments.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Mr. Tuttle paid his $ 5,000 Perkins loan by August, 2000. He consolidated his Stafford loans in 2001, and in the 17 years since then, has taken deferments\n   totaling almost 7 and one-half years because of his professed inability to make payments. As a consequence of delaying payments on principal, interest has accrued and become capitalized. Tuttle points out that he has made over 100 months of payments (about 8 and one-half years) and has avoided default. But obtaining a deferment does not necessarily evidence good faith, when it is not followed by payment or a significant effort to work out a payment schedule.\n   <em>\n    In re Gesualdi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890792\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/505/330/#p340\">\n    505 B.R. at 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Repaying the Perkins loan within three years of receiving his graduate degree is a positive; taking deferments and forbearances for almost half of the next fifteen years without achieving a significant employment change to increase income is not. It is a closer call whether Tuttle should have \"gotten real\" and moved on to some work for an employer that would allow him to make the loan payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Efforts to maintain/obtain employment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Another sign of good faith is that after Mr. Tuttle consolidated the Stafford loans, he enrolled in additional college credits to improve his employment prospects, and did not borrow for those additional credits. Exhibit 42. Mr. Tuttle testified that he drove a cab for a while in 2006, after taking the severance package from the trading company. His tenure with the workforce development agency lasted several years, but in 2011 or 2012 he decided against finding another employer and started his own business. He received a start-up grant, but over the course of three years his business did not catch fire.
