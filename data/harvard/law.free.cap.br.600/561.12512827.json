(\"Scottrade\"), and Michael Heridia (\"Heridia\"). Plaintiff asserted the following causes of action: violations of the Texas Securities Act, violations of equitable principles of trade and fair dealing, supervision violations, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent training and supervision, and participatory and vicarious liability. (ECF No. 44, Ex. B-1). The causes of action were \"related to [Plaintiff's] allegation that Scottrade, Rubicon, [Defendant], and Heridia made unsuitable investments, concentrating [Plaintiff's] portfolio in small cap and penny stocks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff also asserted that Defendant \"failed to rebalance [Plaintiff's] portfolio to reduce risk and volatility despite multiple requests.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant filed a Statement of Answer on January 23, 2017 that requested that Plaintiff take nothing by its claims, and that the FINRA Panel assess all costs associated with this claim against Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant appeared\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   at two pre-hearing sessions and eight hearing sessions in front of the all-public panel of the FINRA Office of Dispute Resolution (the \"FINRA Panel\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After considering \"the pleadings, testimony and evidence presented at the hearings,\" the FINRA Panel issued an Award (the \"FINRA Award\") on March 26, 2018 that was \"decided in full and final resolution of the issues submitted for determination.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The FINRA Award states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1.

On April 26, 2018, Defendant filed an Application to Confirm Arbitration Award in the 166th Judicial District of Bexar County, Texas (\"Bexar County District Court\"). Also on April 26, 2018, Defendant and co-debtor Sandra Sarran\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (the \"Bankruptcy Case\"). In the Bankruptcy Case, the Court granted a Motion for Annulment of Stay Nunc Pro Tunc under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) to allow Plaintiff to confirm the FINRA Award in state court. (Case No. 18-50979, ECF No. 26 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff initiated this adversary proceeding on June 29, 2018, based on allegations that the FINRA Award is non-dischargeable in Defendant's bankruptcy case pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) and (a)(19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 31, 2018, Defendant filed Defendant's First Amended Answer and Affirmative Defenses to Plaintiff's Original Complaint (ECF No. 9 ). On July 31, 2018, Defendant filed Debtor/Defendents' [sic] Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss or in the Alternative 12(e) Motion for More Definite Statement and Motion to Reinstate Stay (ECF No. 5 ) (\"Rule 12(b)(6) Motion\"), which was denied for reasons stated on the record at an oral ruling held on November 28, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 29 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 7, 2019, Plaintiff filed Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Motion for Summary Judgment\") (ECF No. 44 ). In the Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff seeks judgment that any and all amounts awarded to Plaintiff in the FINRA Arbitration are nondischargeable debts under \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(4)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (a)(19). The Motion for Summary Judgment also requests that Defendant pay all costs and attorneys' fees associated with work performed in the captioned adversary proceeding. On February 21, 2019, Defendant filed the Affidavit in Response (ECF No. 46 ). Defendant's Affidavit in Response argues that the FINRA Award did not contain findings of facts regarding wrongful behavior on his part, that Plaintiff has never submitted any facts to support its accusations of \"fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, churning, violations of securities statutes, and other types of wrongful conduct,\" and that punitive damages were specifically denied in the award itself. ( ECF No. 46, \u00b6 A). Defendant's Affidavit in Response\n   included a memorandum (the \"Memorandum\") citing to various cases that was prepared by a third-year student at St. Mary's University School of Law. On February 28, 2019, Plaintiff filed Plaintiff's Reply (ECF No. 47 ), which asserts that Defendant's Affidavit in Response is a flawed attempt to relitigate the liability that has already been established by the FINRA Award. Plaintiff's Reply also argues that Defendant's Affidavit in Response does not respond to the arguments made in the Motion for Summary Judgment, and that Court should disregard the attached Memorandum in its entirety under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 56(c)(4) and (e) because it is not based on Defendant's personal knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The Bankruptcy Court is the Appropriate Forum for Determining Dischargeability of the FINRA Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff contends that she is entitled to summary judgment that the $ 900,000 FINRA Award is non-dischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) and (a)(19). As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff asserts that the bankruptcy court is the appropriate forum for determining dischargeability of the FINRA Award. Plaintiff notes that Defendant has \"repeatedly stated\" that the FINRA Award is\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   dischargeable based on a letter issued by the FINRA Office of Dispute Resolution on May 3, 2018 (the \"FINRA Letter\") after the FINRA Award was issued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FINRA Letter provides that Defendant's association\n   with FINRA member firms would be suspended unless he demonstrated that he either:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   1. Paid the award in full;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   2. Entered into a full-executed settlement agreement with the claimant(s), and [his] obligations thereunder [were] current;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   3. Timely filed an action to vacate or modify an award and such motion [had] not been denied; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   4.

B-5). According to Plaintiff, the FINRA Letter simply outlines defenses to Defendant's suspension from FINRA but does not state affirmatively that the FINRA Award is dischargeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiff that the determination of whether a debt is nondischargeable is a matter of federal bankruptcy law.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Dennis v.

The Court also agrees with Plaintiff that the FINRA Letter merely outlines the defenses that Defendant could have raised to avoid having his FINRA membership suspended. The contents of the FINRA Letter are neither binding nor persuasive to the Court on the issue of non-dischargeability of the FINRA Award under \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(4) and 523(a)(19). The FINRA Letter's inquiry to Defendant as to whether the FINRA Award was discharged in bankruptcy has no impact on the Court's duty to assess the merits of Plaintiff's non-dischargeability claims against Defendant in this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Dischargeability of the FINRA Award Under \u00a7 523(a)(19)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Next, Plaintiff argues that the FINRA Award is conclusively non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(19) because the FINRA Panel has already determined Defendant's violations and proof of the entry of order of the violations has been tendered to this Court.

First, the Court finds that the FINRA Panel, a non-bankruptcy tribunal, has issued its FINRA Award determining that Defendant is liable for compensatory damages, costs, and attorneys' fees in relation to violations of securities laws in connection with the sale of a security. Second, the Court finds that the compensatory damages, costs, and attorneys' fees awarded to Plaintiff in the FINRA Award are memorialized in a judicial order that was entered in Bexar County District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court concludes that the FINRA Award arose, at least in part, in connection with Defendant's violation of Texas securities laws. In her Statement of Claim filed with the FINRA Office of Dispute Resolution, Plaintiff asserted that Defendant, in violation of the Texas Securities Act, \"offered and sold securities by means of untrue statements of material fact and/or omissions of material facts necessary in order to make statements made ... which caused [Plaintiff] to suffer injury.\" (ECF No, 44, Ex. B-4). Plaintiff's Statement of Claim also includes counts against Defendant alleging violations of equitable principles of trade and fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant filed a Statement of Answer in response to Plaintiff's Statement of Claim denying Plaintiff's allegations of Texas Securities Fraud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The FINRA Award reiterates that Plaintiff asserted causes of action in its Statement of Claim for \"violations of the Texas Securities Act, violation of principles of equitable trade and fair dealing, supervision violations, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent training and supervision, and participatory and vicarious liability\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"FINRA Claims\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The FINRA Panel, \"after considering the pleadings, the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, decided in full and final resolution of the issues submitted for determination\" that Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for $ 625,000.00 in compensatory damages, $ 250,000.00 in attorneys' fees, and $ 30,000.00 in costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court acknowledges Defendant's argument that the FINRA Award does not specifically indicate whether it was awarding damages, attorneys' fees, and costs based on certain or all the FINRA Claims. (ECF No. 5, p. 3.) Defendant, however, filed a Statement of Answer to the FINRA Claims denying the allegations made in Plaintiff's Statement of Claim and asserting various affirmative defenses. The FINRA Panel made determinations on the merits, and Defendant was given a meaningful opportunity to defend himself. The FINRA Award states that it was \"decided in full and final resolution of the issues submitted for determination.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Once \"a tribunal other than the bankruptcy court [determines] ... whether a federal or state securities violation or some type of related fraud has occurred,\" the Court should not disturb or attempt to relitigate those findings.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Minardi\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922524\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/536/171/#p191\">\n    536 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   192 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     In re Chan\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751002\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/355/494/#p503\">\n    355 B.R. 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503 (Bankr.
