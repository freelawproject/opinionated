Despite these benefits, involuntary bankruptcy petitions have \"serious consequences [for] the alleged debtor, such as loss of credit standing, inability to transfer assets and carry on business affairs, and public embarrassment.\" \"By giving creditors the ability to bring a debtor into bankruptcy, Congress created a power that could be abused.\" \"Such a remedy exists as an avenue of relief for the benefit of the overall creditor body.... [It] was not intended to redress the special grievances, no matter how legitimate, of particular creditors.... [Such creditors] must seek redress under state law, in the state courts[,] and not in the bankruptcy court.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Wilk Auslander LLP v.

Sprei testified that at all relevant times herein, he was \"making decisions\" on behalf of his investing \"group,\" comprised of the Petitioning Creditors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96:6-8; 10/31 Tr. (Sprei) 45:10, 64:23-25.) Sprei grew up in the same community as Brunner and has known him for many years. (10/31 Tr. (Sprei) 40:8-15; 10/30 Tr.

Miller has over twenty years' experience investing in real estate (10/31 Tr. (Miller) 79:20-22.) Some of Miller's investments, while held in his name, are funded by Leser, with Leser holding an interest. (10/30 Tr. (Miller) 71:14-20.) Miller is indebted to Leser for more than $ 8 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72:12-19.) Miller has known Brunner for nearly thirty years, since Brunner was \"very young.\" (10/31 Tr. (Miller) 66:5-10; 10/30 Tr.

(Leser Dep. Tr. 8:10-12, 10:7-10, 11:3-7.) Although Leser's testimony was evasive, it is clear that he has been very successful in commercial real estate and has raised millions of dollars investing in the Israeli bond market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-17; 10/30 Tr. (Brunner) 124:3-11.) Leser has known Brunner \"[s]ince he's a baby,\" for \"close to 30 years,\" and they have worked together in the past.

Under a contract of sale dated June 8, 2012 (the \"Contract of Sale\"), Brunner's company, Dupont Developers, agreed to purchase the Dupont Street Property from 49 Dupont Realty Corp. for approximately $ 20 million. (JTPO \u00b6 5(C); Ex. A (Contract of Sale); 10/30 Tr. (Brunner) 175: 9-24.) The Contract of Sale prohibited assignment, and for this reason subsequent transfers of the rights under the Contract of Sale were effectuated by the sale of the membership interest in the purchaser, Dupont Developers. (10/30 Tr. (Brunner) 157:20-158:8.) Certain environmental conditions present at the Dupont Street Property resulted in an order on consent and administrative settlement with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (\"NYSDEC\"), pursuant to which the seller, 49 Dupont Realty Corp., was required to take several actions, including a remediation program. (JPTO \u00b6 5(D).) Under the Contract of Sale, Dupont Developers agreed to assume 49 DuPont Realty Corp.'s obligations under the NYSDEC consent order. (JPTO \u00b6 5(E).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In June 2013, Brunner entered into a contract to sell the rights to purchase the Dupont Property to 49 Duponts Lofts, an entity owned by Miller (the \"June 2013 Contract\"). (Ex. B; 10/31 Tr. (Miller) 63:20-22.) At the time of the June 2013 Contract, a separate Brunner entity held the contract rights, through ownership of Dupont Developers, to purchase the Dupont Property. (Ex. B; 10/30 Tr. (Brunner) 155:17-24.) Through a series of transfers, Anmuth obtained the right to purchase under the Contract of Sale and was substituted as \"Assignor\" in the June 2013 Contract with 49 Dupont Lofts. (10/31 (Brunner) 156:9-16, 166:12-15.) Although the exact amount is disputed, all parties testified that certain payments were made by 49 Dupont Lofts to Brunner (or one of his entities) under the June 2013 Contract. Brunner testified that he received \"more than $ 2.5 million.\" (10/30 Tr. (Brunner) 162:19-20.) Miller and Sprei testified that they made several payments totaling \"close to five million dollars.\" (10/31 Tr. (Sprei) 16:8-11, (Miller) 64:13-16.) In January 2014, the June 2013\n   Contract was terminated and the parties to the June 2013 Contract reached an alternative agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The sale of the Dupont Street Property closed on May 19, 2014. (JPTO \u00b6 5(F).) At closing, in order to ensure their performance under the NYSDEC consent order, Dupont Developers agreed to provide standby letters of credit (\"SLOCs\") in favor of the seller, 49 Dupont Realty Corp., and to maintain the SLOCs until the remediation work was completed and a certificate of completion was issued by NYSDEC. (JPTO \u00b6 5(E).) Brunner testified that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The letter[s] of credit[ ] were put into place for the benefit of the seller of the property to guarantee him that the environmental liability that exists on th[e] property will properly be cleaned and there will be a letter of no further action from the [NYCDEC]...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [T]here were two mechanisms how the money of the letter[s] of credit [were] going to be utilized. Either Dupont Street Developers would clean up the property and the funds would be drawn down for the physical clean up and there was an agreement controlling how the funds were going to flow to clean it up. What benchmarks need to be met and -- for the clean up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Or if Dupont Street Developers, LLC defaults on the clean up,...the seller of the property, had a right to draw and take away the letter of credit and take away those funds in order to protect him from the liability....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (10/30 Tr. (Brunner) 178:13-179:5.) Three SLOCs were issued by Investors Bank for the account of Dupont Developers in favor of 49 Dupont Realty Corp. in the aggregate amount of $ 4.7 million. (JPTO \u00b6 5(E).) Investors Bank received cash collateral in the amount of $ 4,770,550 posted by Brunner or one of his entities (the \"Cash Collateral\"), and a personal guaranty from Brunner, to secure the SLOCs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The SLOCs were originally set to expire on May 20, 2015, but were extended for additional one-year periods in 2015, 2016 and 2017, with the final extension expiring on May 20, 2018. (JPTO \u00b6 5(F).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Subsequent to the closing, on September 18, 2014, Brunner, on behalf of Anmuth, executed an \"Agreement Regarding Letter of Credit\" (the \"L/C Agreement\"), providing that in the event the Cash Collateral is returned to Anmuth, \"Miller shall be entitled to... $ 4,353,500.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (JPTO \u00b6 5(G).) The L/C Agreement recites that \"Miller has an interest in the funds used as collateral for the Letters of Credit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Leser and Sprei are not parties to the L/C Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1(d).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Brunner testified that the L/C Agreement was executed the same day that he, Sprei, Leser, and Miller \"completed a long line of transaction\" and Brunner was requesting a \"full blown general release\" from the Petitioning Creditors. (10/30 Tr. (Brunner) 179:9-15.) According to Brunner, at that meeting, Miller made a \"personal\n   request\" of him, as Miller \"was having a difficult time financially....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 179:16-19.) Brunner testified that Miller \"asked...what if something does happen and [the Cash Collateral] does come to you? Do you agree that you'll give me that money?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 179:24-180:1.) Brunner testified that in order to secure the release, and because he knew that \"in no event does this money ever com[e] to me,\" he agreed to the L/C Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 179:19-180:6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Miller testified that the alleged $ 5 million he paid to Brunner was used to fund the Cash Collateral securing the SLOCs. (10/31 Tr. (Miller) 67:11-68:4.) Miller testified that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [Brunner] told me that we should give him the money for the [SLOCs]. And I put it up for him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. ...And did you believe that based upon that transaction and this agreement, that that money that was secured at Investors Bank, was money belonging to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (10/31 Tr. (Miller) 67:17-68:4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    State Court Litigation\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On October 19, 2015, Miller commenced an action against Anmuth in state court (the \"2015 Action\"), asserting that he loaned Brunner the money to fund the Cash Collateral for the SLOCs, and that because the SLOCs had expired and the Cash Collateral had been released to Anmuth, \"all of the preconditions for repayment of an amount totaling $ 4,353,500.00 to Miller, pursuant to the [L/C Agreement] have been satisfied.\" (JPTO \u00b6 (5)(I).) Miller commenced a second action in state court in 2018 (the \"2018 Action\"), premised on the same underlying facts as the 2015 Action, adding new claims and additional defendants, including Investors Bank and 49 Dupont Realty Corp. (JPTO \u00b6 5(K).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In 2016 and 2017, Miller unsuccessfully sought preliminary injunctions to enjoin Brunner, Anmuth, and any other entity acting in concert with them, from renewing the SLOCs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1(e) at 3 (May 29, 2018 State Court Decision).) On May 3, 2018, the court in the 2015 Action, upon Miller's emergency application and an emergency application filed by Brunner in response, issued a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\"), \"restraining any party, entity or person from drawing down on the letters of credit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On May 16, 2018, the state court held a combined hearing as to the continuation of the TRO issued in the 2015 Action and Miller's application for a TRO and preliminary injunction in the 2018 Action. By order dated May 16, 2018, the court vacated the TRO issued in the 2015 Action, denied the TRO sought in the 2018 Action, and scheduled a hearing for May 23, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) On May 18, 2018, in the 2018 Action, Miller moved by emergency application seeking reargument of the May 16, 2018 Order and a stay of the expiration of the SLOCs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On May 18, 2018, a TRO was granted in the 2018\n   Action pending the May 23, 2018 hearing date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   By Decision and Order dated May 29, 2018 in the 2018 Action (the \"5/29 Decision\"), the state court denied Miller's request to restrain the drawdown on the SLOCs and to restrain any disposition of the Cash Collateral on the following grounds: (i) Miller is neither party to, nor a beneficiary of, the SLOCs and has no relationship, contractual or otherwise, with Investors Bank or 49 Dupont Realty Corp.; (ii) although acknowledging the existence of Miller's claim, the court found that the L/C Agreement \"only proves that Miller has a contingent entitlement to much of the collateral and that entitlement is triggered when the collateral is returned to Anmuth,\" which \"triggering event has not occurred;\" and (iii) any harm that could result from Investors Bank's payment on the SLOCs is purely monetary and thus does not constitute irreparable harm. (Ex. 1(e) (5/29 Decision).) Additionally, the court ordered that the previously imposed order temporarily restraining the drawdown of the SLOCs would be vacated effective May 31, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Miller appealed the 5/29 Decision, and on May 31, 2018 filed a motion for a stay pending appeal with the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Second Department (the \"Appellate Court\"). (JPTO \u00b6 5(M).) At approximately 4:00 p.m. on May 31, 2018, the Appellate Court denied Miller's request for a stay pending appeal. (Ex. 1(f).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Petitioning Creditors admit that had an injunction been granted in the 5/29 Decision, or had the Appellate Court granted a stay of the 5/29 Decision pending appeal, they would not have filed the Involuntary Petitions.

(\"Pick\"), for the purpose of filing involuntary petitions against Anmuth and Dupont Developers. (JPTO \u00b6 5(N).) Sprei was the sole petitioning creditor present at the meeting with Pick. (JPTO \u00b6 5(O).) Pick testified that on the evening of May 31, 2018, while Sprei was in his office, he spoke with Miller and Leser by telephone. (10/30 Tr. (Pick) 16:25-17:1.) Pick testified that he explained to all three Petitioning Creditors the requirements necessary to file an involuntary petition and confirmed with each of them (i) that their claim was valid, undisputed, and non-contingent; and (ii) that Anmuth was not generally paying its debts as they become due. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:3-9, 19:21-24.) Pick further testified that he warned each Petitioning Creditor of the risks, including potential sanctions, associated with filing an involuntary petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:7-17:25, 19:21-22:9, 26:19-20.) Leser and Miller deny speaking with Pick and testified that on May 31, 2018, they only spoke with Sprei regarding the Involuntary Petitions. (10/31 Tr. (Miller) 72:3-4; Leser Dep. Tr. 90:19-94:6.) All parties agree that Sprei, with authorization, was making decisions on behalf of the Petitioning Creditors. (10/30 Tr.

Sprei testified that\n   the purpose of the filings against Anmuth and Dupont Developers was to prevent Investors Bank from transferring the Cash Collateral. (10/30 Tr. (Sprei) 83:18-20, 98:21-25.) He further testified that after filing the petitions against Anmuth and Dupont Developers, his attorneys contacted him and advised \"that the money was transferred and being held through an account called Quest, and the money's not being held by an account called Anmuth, so we believed that only way to freeze the Quest account is to file under Quest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96:24-97:10.) On June 4, 2018, four days after the petitions were filed against Anmuth and Dupont Developers, the Petitioning Creditors filed the involuntary chapter 7 petition against Quest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Invol. Pet., Quest ECF No. 1.) Although asked, Pick refused to sign or file the Quest petition. (JPTO \u00b6 5(R); 10/30 Tr. (Pick) 35:9-36:1.) Sprei filed the petition in person at the Bankruptcy Court. (10/30 Tr. (Sprei) 96:17-19.) The Petitioning Creditors did not serve any of the three involuntary petitions. (10/30 Tr. (Pick) 31:17-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Sprei signed all three petitions on his own behalf and, with authorization, on behalf of Leser. (10/30 Tr. (Sprei) 84:8-11; Leser Dep. Tr. 71:5-7.) Leser testified that he \"never saw\" the petitions before they were filed, did not consult an attorney, and that the \"case is run[ ] by Miller and Sprei.\" (Leser Dep. Tr. 34:24-35:18, 54:3-6, 60:21-24, 75:11-17, 104:14-105:5.) Miller testified that while he signed the Involuntary Petitions, he never consulted with an attorney, and he, \"relied on Sam [Sprei], what Sam [Sprei] told me to do, I did.\" (10/30 Tr. (Miller) 74:7-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The three involuntary petitions list identical claims, described as \"Loan/LC,\" in the amounts of $ 4,000,000 for Leser, $ 250,000 for Miller, and $ 150,000 for Sprei. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1(a); Ex. 1(b); Ex. 1(c).) According to the Petitioning Creditors, these amounts represent funds the Petitioning Creditors loaned to Brunner that were used as the Cash Collateral for the SLOCs. (10/31 Tr. (Miller) 67:11-68:4.) The claims asserted in the Involuntary Petitions are the same claims that were at issue in the 2015 Action and 2018 Action in state court, and the same claims that, hours earlier, the Appellate Court had found provided no basis for a stay of the drawdown of the SLOCs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The claims listed on the Involuntary Petitions were all subject to a bona fide dispute. (JPTO \u00b6 5(S).) The Petitioning Creditors conceded at the hearing on dismissal of the Involuntary Petitions, and again at trial, that they were ineligible to file the Involuntary Petitions for this reason. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 24, 2018 Tr. 5:15-19, Anmuth ECF No. 21 ; JPTO \u00b6 5(T).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   By letter dated June 4, 2018, the Alleged Debtors' counsel advised the Petitioning Creditors and Pick that they believed the Involuntary Petitions were frivolous and that they intended to vigorously oppose them. (Ex. 1(i) (the \"June 4 Letter\").) The Petitioning Creditors and Pick acknowledge receipt of the June 4 Letter and that they did not respond to it. (10/30 Tr. (Pick) 38:1-9, (Sprei) 104:3-8.) On June 28, 2018, the Alleged Debtors filed motions to dismiss the Involuntary Petitions and for sanctions. (Anmuth ECF No. 10 ; Quest ECF No. 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Post-Petition Conduct of Petitioning Creditor Sprei\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On multiple occasions after the Involuntary Petitions were filed, Sprei sent text messages to Brunner's business partner threatening to file an involuntary petition against Brunner individually. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. 3(j)-3(l).) For example, on July 1, 2018 at 3:01 a.m., three days after the Alleged Debtors moved to dismiss the Involuntary Petitions and for sanctions, Sprei wrote,\n   \"[w]ant to just let you know Monday I am filing in bankruptcy against [Brunner] personal and that means he can't do any more Bussines [sic] for a long time not playing around not going to waste more time....\" (Ex. 3(l).) In another post-filing message, sent the day before Sprei's deposition on October 16, 2018, Sprei threatened, \"it will become very dirty\" and \"verry [sic] ugly for [Brunner].\" (10/30 Tr. (Sprei) 113:13-114:5; Ex. 3; Ex. 3(m).) Although the Petitioning Creditors commenced these bankruptcy cases, and are the plaintiffs in state court actions, Sprei made multiple efforts to compel Brunner to litigate their issues in rabbinical court. (10/30 Tr. (Sprei) 118:8-14.) These efforts resulted in a letter being issued by rabbis criticizing Brunner for proceeding in civil court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118:20-22.) Sprei posted this letter on street sign poles and in synagogues in Brooklyn. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118:23-119:9.) Additionally, he hired a company to print leaflets denouncing Brunner that were disseminated in synagogues throughout Brooklyn.

Having received no reply to their June 4 Letter, on June 28, 2018, the Alleged Debtors filed motions to dismiss the Involuntary Petitions and for sanctions. (Anmuth ECF No. 10 ; Quest ECF No. 9.) On July 10, 2018, Pick moved to withdraw as counsel in the Anmuth case. (Anmuth ECF No. 12.) A hearing on the Dismissal Motion was held on July 24, 2018, in which the Petitioning Creditors appeared by new counsel, Tarter Krinsky &amp; Drogin LLP (\"TKD\"). At the July 24, 2018 hearing, the Petitioning Creditors, by TKD, consented to the dismissal of the Involuntary Petitions. (JPTO \u00b6 5(W).) On August 13, 2018 and August 15, 2018, Orders were entered in the Quest case and Anmuth case, respectively, dismissing the Involuntary Petitions and scheduling a hearing on the Sanctions Motion. Hearings were held on the Sanctions Motion on October 30, 2018 and concluded on October 31, 2018, after which the parties filed post-trial briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Parties' Contentions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Alleged Debtors' Contentions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Alleged Debtors contend that the Petitioning Creditors filed the Involuntary Petitions although they were fully aware that they were ineligible to do so, as their claims were clearly disputed, having been litigated in state court for years. Indeed, just hours prior to the filing, the state Appellate Court had denied the Petitioning Creditors' application for a stay. The Alleged Debtors further contend that the Petitioning Creditors acted maliciously, filing\n   the Involuntary Petitions as part of an overall strategy designed to embarrass, harass, and pressure Brunner, the Alleged Debtors' principal, in order to coerce a settlement. In addition to attorneys' fees and costs, the Alleged Debtors seek compensatory damages based on Quest's lost profits as a result of the filing, and punitive damages based on the Petitioning Creditors' bad faith, including their lack of remorse and continued threats of additional involuntary filings. The Alleged Debtors further seek an order declaring the dismissal of the Involuntary Petitions to be\n   <em>\n    nunc\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tunc\n   </em>\n   to the dates of filing and an order barring the Petitioning Creditors from participating in the filing of any involuntary bankruptcy petition in this district against Brunner, or any entity in which Brunner has an interest, without first obtaining leave of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Petitioning Creditors' Contentions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Petitioning Creditors contend that the Involuntary Petitions were not filed in bad faith because at the time of filing they were unaware of the requirements of \u00a7 303.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Petitioning Creditors, because they did not become aware of their ineligibility until after filing, the Involuntary Petitions were not filed in bad faith, as required for an award pursuant to \u00a7 303(i)(2). The Petitioning Creditors fault their counsel, Pick, for allegedly failing to advise them of the requirements and potential consequences associated with an involuntary bankruptcy petition. The Petitioning Creditors further assert that at the time of filing they genuinely believed their claims were undisputed. The Petitioning Creditors further contend that because they did not oppose the Alleged Debtors' motions to dismiss, the Alleged Debtors are not entitled to damages pursuant to \u00a7 303(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Section 303(i) of the Bankruptcy Code provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   If the court dismisses a petition under this section\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     other than on consent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of all petitioners and the debtor, and if the debtor does not waive the right to judgment under this subsection, the court\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   grant judgment--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (1) against the petitioners and in favor of the debtor for-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (A) costs; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (B) a reasonable attorney's fee; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (2) against any petitioner that filed the petition in bad faith, for-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (A) any damages proximately caused by such filing; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (B) punitive damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   It is settled law that an award under \u00a7 303(i) is within the discretion of the Bankruptcy Court.\n   <em>\n    SeeLubow Mach.

Indeed, after the motions to dismiss the Involuntary Petitions were filed, petitioning creditor Sprei, on July 1, threatened to file an involuntary petition against Brunner. (Ex. 3(l).) The dismissal of the Involuntary Petitions was not \"on consent,\" but rather, the Petitioning Creditors did not, because they could not, oppose dismissal.

That same day, Pick emailed Sprei pleading with him to \"please take this very seriously.\" (Ex. 3(c).)

Undoubtedly, after receiving the motions to dismiss and for sanctions and communicating with Pick, Sprei appreciated the seriousness of filing an involuntary petition.
