The Court held evidentiary hearings on the Motion on December 20, 2018, and January 16, 2019. As the Motion concerns the administration of the Estate, the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter, and this matter is a core proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157(a), 157(b)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the heart of this dispute are the interests in Debtors' residence located at 110 Addison Court, Roswell, Georgia 30097 (the \"Property\"). The Property was originally owned by Frankie and Herbert Marshall. (Doc. 48, at 11). In 2003, the Marshalls conveyed the Property to themselves and their daughter, Debtor Angela Ellen Morgan, as joint tenants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). That same year, the Marshalls and Mrs. Morgan entered into an agreement with Countrywide Bank (\"Countrywide\") whereby Mrs. Morgan would be responsible for monthly mortgage payments between $ 2,200 and $ 3,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Months later, Mr. Marshall received an advertisement from IndyMac Bank F.S.B. (\"IndyMac\"), offering to refinance the Property under better terms than those offered by Countrywide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 25, 2003, the Marshalls executed a security deed with IndyMac (the \"Marshall Security Deed\"). Due to an apparent oversight by IndyMac, Mrs. Morgan was not made a party to the Marshall Security Deed. However, Mrs. Morgan was apparently aware that her parents refinanced the Property and she began making payments to IndyMac. (Doc. 48, at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 11, 2008, IndyMac was closed by the Office of Thrift Supervision and placed in receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FDIC, Failed Bank Information, Information for IndyMac, F.S.B., and IndyMac Federal Bank, F.S.B., Pasadena, CA, https://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/indymac.html#Loan%20Custo mers (last visited March 29, 2019)). The FDIC designated Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (\"Deutsche\") as attorney-in-fact for IndyMac, and on February 5, 2010, Deutsche purportedly assigned the Marshall Security Deed to itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mrs. Morgan stopped making mortgage payments in 2008 and on March 6, 2012, Deutsche foreclosed on the Property. At that time, the Property was held by Mrs. Marshall and Mrs. Morgan as joint tenants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Mrs. Morgan was not a party to the Marshall Security Deed, Deutsche only foreclosed on Mrs. Marshall's interest. In 2014, after Mrs. Marshall passed, Mrs. Morgan conveyed her interest in the Property to herself and to her husband, Debtor Michael Morgan, as joint tenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 7, 2015, Deutsche initiated an action in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia (the \"State Court Action\"). (Doc. 48, at 6). Deutsche sought to have its lien equitably subrogated to the extent that IndyMac had paid Mrs. Morgan's liability on the note to Countrywide. Deutsche also alleged that it had \"advanced at least $ 71,395 in property taxes and hazard insurance for protection of the Property\" and was therefore entitled to an equitable lien. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13). Debtors responded that the assignment from IndyMac to Deutsche was invalid and, therefore, Deutsche had no interest in the Property. On September 23, 2016, the state court entered a summary judgment order finding that Deutsche was not entitled to equitable subrogation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state court also found that Debtors lacked standing to challenge the assignment from IndyMac to Deutsche. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). Because of an evidentiary error, the state court postponed addressing Deutsche's claim for an equitable lien based on taxes and insurance until trial. However, on October 13, 2016, before the court could hold a trial, Debtors filed for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and the State Court Action was stayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 14, 2017, the Trustee initiated an adversary proceeding to sell the Property free and clear of Deutsche's interest. (Adversary Proceeding No. 17-05239, Doc. 1 (the \"Adversary Proceeding\")). Deutsche filed an answer, raising a counterclaim for an equitable lien, which alleged that Deutsche had spent $ 90,075\n   on taxes, insurance, and homeowners' association dues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Trustee and Deutsche now propose to settle their disputes in the State Court Action and the Adversary Proceeding (the \"Settlement\"). (Doc. 83). Under the terms of the Settlement, Deutsche will pay the Trustee $ 245,000; the Trustee will convey the Estate's half interest in the Property to Deutsche; Deutsche and the Trustee will voluntarily dismiss with prejudice the State Court Action and the Adversary Proceeding;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Trustee will waive any claim the Estate has against Deutsche, Fidelity National Financial, Inc., and Monica K. Gilroy and the Gilroy Law Firm. (Doc. 83, at 4). Debtors oppose the Settlement and contend that the Trustee has failed to fully investigate the claims listed in Debtors' Schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

Probability of Success on the Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Debtors insist that the Trustee should initiate a quiet title action challenging Deutsche's interest in the Property and pursue tort claims against Deutsche and other defendants. However, the Trustee\n   is concerned that Debtors lack standing to challenge Deutsche's interest and that the tort claims listed in the Schedules are meritless. Furthermore, as the Trustee explained, the Settlement would protect the Estate from Deutsche's credible claim for an equitable lien against the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Debtors' Potential Lack of Standing to Challenge Deutsche's Interest in the Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Debtors allege that Deutsche did not have authority to assign the Marshall Security Deed from IndyMac to itself under the power of attorney granted to Deutsche by the FDIC. Accordingly, Debtors claim that Deutsche has no interest in the Property. The Trustee notes the existence of case law that holds that, even if an assignment of security deed is invalid, the borrower lacks standing to pursue such a claim because the borrower was neither a party to nor injured by the assignment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ames v.

On appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed, adopting the general rule that borrowers lack standing to challenge an assignment of their security deed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12644925\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/783/614/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12644925\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/783/614/\">\n    at 619-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   However,\n   <em>\n    Ames\n   </em>\n   also addressed two instances in which a debtor may have standing to challenge the assignment of a security deed. First, a debtor would have standing if the assignment breached a contractual or statutory duty owed to the debtor. In\n   <em>\n    Ames\n   </em>\n   , the deed gave WaMu unilateral authority to assign the deed to a third party and the assignment was authorized under Georgia law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12644925\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/783/614/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 619-20 (citing O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-64(c) ). The second source of standing arises when the debtor is a party or third-party beneficiary to the assignment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12644925\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/783/614/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 619-620 (citing O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-2-20 ). Regarding the standing of third-party beneficiaries, the court explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [challenging an assignment] may normally be done only by the assignor, because the debtor is not a third-party\n   beneficiary of the assignment\n   <em>\n    as a whole\n   </em>\n   and particularly is not intended to directly benefit from the transfer of the power of sale. Status as a third-party beneficiary does not imply standing to enforce every promise within a contract, including those not made for that party's benefit.

Like the Ameses, Debtors contend that the power of attorney conferred by the FDIC to Deutsche did not give Deutsche authority to assign the Marshall Security Deed to itself. Debtors do not allege that the Marshall Security Deed contained terms that restricted IndyMac's authority to transfer the deed or that the assignment violated Georgia law. Instead, Debtors only charge that Deutsche lacked authority to carry out the assignment.

Instead, Debtors only allege that Deutsche lacked authority to assign the Marshall Security Deed to itself.

As previously mentioned, Deutsche's only remaining claim in the State Court Action is for an equitable lien. The potential invalidity of the assignment may give the Trustee a defense to that claim but raising that defense does not open the door to bringing an affirmative counterclaim to contest Deutsche's interest in the Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LSREF2 Baron, LLC v.

Ga. 2013) (finding that a debtor lacked standing to pursue a counterclaim challenging the assignment of a security deed). Thus, even if the Trustee were able to raise a successful defense to Deutsche's equitable lien,\n   Deutsche would still own half of the Property under the Marshall Security Deed, and the Trustee has exercised his reasonable business judgment in deciding that the risk of proceeding with litigation and rejecting Deutsche's offer to purchase the Estate's interest in the Property is too great.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Debtors' Tort Claims Lack Evidentiary or Factual Support\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   With respect to the Estate's tort claims, the Trustee testified that he investigated those claims and found them to be meritless. The tort claims mostly involve the perceived wrongdoing of Deutsche during the foreclosure process and subsequent litigation. Debtors have had over two years to identify the facts behind these claims. Instead, Debtors have continued to make conclusory allegations and then claim they \"do not have the expertise for evaluating any such claims.\" (Doc. 94, at 18). Debtors' assertion that \"the total amount of damages that might be recovered might be $ 10,000,000 is not ridiculous,\" has no support in the record. (Doc. 94, at 19). Therefore, the Trustee's decision to waive Debtors' tort claims in favor of the Settlement was a reasonable choice made in the best interest of the Estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Deutsche is Waiving a Colorable Claim for an Equitable Lien\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   During the hearing, the Trustee also voiced concern that challenging Deutsche's interest in the Property might prompt Deutsche to retaliate by moving forward with its action for an equitable lien on the Property. That concern appears well-founded, as Deutsche raised that claim in the adversary proceeding. (AP No. 17-05239, Doc. 5, \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Deutsche's claim for an equitable lien finds support in Georgia case law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

In this case, Deutsche has filed a secured claim for $ 90,075, for paying Debtors' share of taxes, insurance, and homeowners association dues on the Property. (AP No. 17-05239, Doc. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 13). Because Deutsche paid these expenses when it was a mortgagee to the Marshalls and tenant in common to Debtors, Deutsche has a colorable claim for an equitable lien. Although the Estate may have a defense to Deutsche's equitable lien, Deutsche has alleged a plausible claim that threatens the Estate, and the weight the Trustee afforded that claim in deciding whether to accept the terms of the Settlement is reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Litigation Would be Complex and Costly and Would Delay the Return to Creditors\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the reasons outlined above, litigating the question of Deutsche's interest in the Property, any tort claims, and Deutsche's entitlement to an equitable lien would be complex and would involve events that occurred many years ago. At the hearing, the Trustee testified that he considered the fact that the costs of pursuing Debtors' claims could outweigh any potential recovery. That assessment is supported by evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   During the hearing, David Scott Murphy, the Trustee's appraisal expert, testified that the Property was worth about $ 305,000 on November 27, 2018. Under the Settlement, Deutsche will pay the Estate $ 245,000 in exchange for the Estate's interest in the Property and a release of all claims. Therefore, the most the Trustee could likely recover by challenging Deutsche's interest in the Property is an additional $ 60,000. Regardless of the outcome, the costs of litigating these claims and the harm done to creditors by further delay could exceed this benefit. The creditors of the Estate have already waited two and a half years for payment. It is reasonable and fair for the Trustee to accept the Settlement, which offers certainty and immediate funds for distribution to creditors, over continuing the litigation with a risk of no return at great expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Paramount Interest of the Estate's Creditors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Debtors are understandably frustrated that the Trustee has entered into a settlement to sell Debtors' interest in their home. However, in a Chapter 7 case, the trustee is a fiduciary of the estate's creditors and it is his duty to maximize distribution to the creditors in an expeditious manner.\n   <em>\n    In re Moon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11128816\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/258/828/#p832\">\n    258 B.R. 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 832 (Bankr.
