Debtor, Michael David Scott, commenced his bankruptcy case by filing for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ) on January 25, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Debtor owns\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   certain real property located at 8 Tiffany Road, Bourne, MA 02532 (the \"Property\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Schedule A/B: Property, 17-70045-JAD, ECF No. 234. Following the commencement of the Debtor's bankruptcy case, on February 8, 2017, U.S. Bank\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion of U.S. Bank, National Association, as Trustee Under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement Dated as of May 1, 2006, GSAMP Trust 2006-HE3, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-HE3 for Relief from the Automatic Stay under \u00a7 362 Pursuant to Bankruptcy Procedure Rule 4001\n   </em>\n   (\"Motion for Relief from Stay\") at Case No. 17-70045-JAD, ECF No. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the Motion for Relief from Stay, U.S. Bank asserted that it is the holder of a mortgage on the Property in the original principal amount of $ 511,200.00 dated December 8, 2005.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion for Relief from Stay at \u00b6 3.

The Stipulation directly references the Motion for Relief from Stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stipulation at \u00b6 10. Pursuant to the Stipulation, the parties agreed that the Debtor would have until December 15, 2017 to sell the Property, that if such sale were to occur the \"Loan\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   would be paid in full, but if no\n   sale took place by that date that U.S. Bank would be granted relief from the automatic stay.

Thus, the Debtor argues that U.S. Bank is in breach of the Stipulation because the creditor claims it is owed hundreds of thousands of dollars. Specifically, Debtor now seeks to enforce paragraph 1 of the Stipulation which reads as follows: \"On December 8, 2005, Debtor borrowed the original principal amount of $ 51,200.00 from SouthStar Funding, LLC ('\n    <em>\n     SouthStar\n    </em>\n    ').\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Motion to Enforce at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4 (emphasis omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    In their response, U.S. Bank argues that the \"$ 51,200\" figure referenced by the Debtor was a drafting error (or an \"Immaterial Error\").\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Opposition to Motion to Enforce Stipulation\n    </em>\n    (\"Opposition\"), ECF No. 66 at pg. 3, \u00b6 8.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    That error being the omission of a \"1\" from the correct $ 511,200 figure, to read instead \"$ 51,200.\" Moreover, U.S. Bank argues that the Immaterial Error, which was included in the recitals of the Stipulation only, has no effect because:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n    (1) the mis-statement of the Original Principal Amount was not any part of consideration for, nor a condition to, the Stipulation; (2) the Original Principal Amount is a matter of public record and was never disputed; and (3) [a Loan Modification Agreement] modified the principal amount in November 2011 making the Original Principal Amount irrelevant.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Opposition at pg. 4, \u00b6 5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    A hearing was held on the Motion to Enforce on February 21, 2019. The Court instructed that the parties each submit a supplemental brief addressing whether recitals/background information are an enforceable part of a contract.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Transcript of [59] Motion to Enforce Stipulation Agreement Filed by Plaintiff Status Conference, and [158] Motion to Invoke Judicial Estoppel Against U.S. Bank et al. and the Debtor Invokes Equitable Estoppel Filed by Plaintiff\n    </em>\n    (the \"Feb. 21, 2019 Tr.\"), 17-7008-JAD, ECF No. 69.

Here, the question is whether the alleged misstatement of the original loan balance is binding on the parties.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    The structure of the Stipulation is important to this analysis. The Stipulation itself contains an introductory paragraph and \"Background\" section of numbered paragraphs, followed by a \"Therefore\" clause. The \"Therefore\" clause reads as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    <strong>\n     NOW THEREFORE,\n    </strong>\n    the Parties hereby stipulate and agree as follows:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    A.

In other words, recitals ... cannot control the clearly expressed stipulations of the parties; and where the recitals are broader than the contract stipulations, the former will not extend the latter.\" (citation omitted) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    In advancing his Motion to Enforce, the Debtor does not argue that any ambiguity exists in the operative part of the Stipulation-i.e. the portion of the Stipulation preluded by the statement \"the Parties hereby stipulate and agree as follows[,]\"-which would require this Court to look to the recitals for clarification. In the absence of any averment of ambiguity, the Debtor has failed to show that the\n    recitals/background information control and that he is entitled to relief.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <strong>\n     ii.\n     <em>\n      The Loan Modification Agreement Moots Debtor's Argument\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Moreover, even if this Court were to find that the recital of the original principal amount of the loan being mistaken as $ 51,200.00 was binding on the parties, such recital would have no net effect as the Stipulation further recognizes in the \"Background\" section that the loan was modified by Loan Modification Agreement on November 29, 2011.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Stipulation at \u00b6 8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    With respect to the $ 51,200 figure that the Debtor relies upon, the Stipulation does not state that $ 51,200 is the current loan amount-it solely states that $ 51,200 was the original principal amount of the loan between the Debtor and SouthStar Funding, LLC. The Stipulation then goes on to state that \"[o]n November 29, 2011, the loan was modified by way of a Loan Modification Agreement.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Stipulation at \u00b6 8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Affording the same weight to this \"Loan Modification averment\" as it would to the \"Original Principal Balance averment,\" it appears to this Court that regardless of whether or not the Stipulation modified the original principal balance from $ 511,200 to $ 51,200, such adjustment would be irrelevant because the loan was modified from its original terms-which would include the original principal amount-by the Loan Modification Agreement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Objection, at pg. 2, \u00b6 2 (referencing the Loan Modification Agreement docketed at 17-70045-JAD, ECF No. 13, pgs. 30-39.) Thus, the terms of the Loan Modification Agreement would control.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The Court notes that a\n    <em>\n     Loan Modification Agreement\n    </em>\n    dated November 29, 2011 was attached as part of Exhibit \"A\" to U.S. Bank's Motion for Relief from Stay. This\n    <em>\n     Loan Modification Agreement\n    </em>\n    establishes a \"New Principal Balance\" of $ 663,416.47, with a \"Deferred Principal Balance\" of $ 245,416.47, and an \"Interest Bearing Principal Balance\" of $ 418,000.00.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Motion for Relief from Stay, Ex. A at pgs. 30-31.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The Debtor in his\n    <em>\n     Supplemental Motion to Enforce Stipulation Agreement\n    </em>\n    (\"Supplement,\" ECF No. 72) argues that the Loan Modification Agreement is irrelevant because it was \"pre-contractual conduct\" (i.e. pre-Stipulation).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Supplement at \u00b6 11. The Debtor then argues that to disregard a single recital (i.e. the recital listing the original principal balance at $ 51,200) would require all recitals to \"have no real meaning.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Supplement at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. However, that is exactly what the Debtor asks this Court to do-he asks this Court to disregard the recital acknowledging that the original principal balance, whatever the amount, was modified by the Loan Modification Agreement. Again, the Stipulation does not state that the original principal balance \"is\" or \"is modified to,\" it states that $ 51,200 was the original principal balance borrowed by the Debtor on\n    December 8, 2005, which was subsequently modified by agreement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Stipulation at \u00b6\u00b6 1 &amp; 8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Accordingly, even if this Court were to find that the recitals are binding on the parties-which it does not-the Court would still deny the Debtor's Motion to Enforce.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Based on the foregoing, the Court\n    <strong>\n     HEREBY ORDERS, ADJUDGES, AND DECREES\n    </strong>\n    that the Debtor's\n    <em>\n     Motion to Enforce Stipulation Agreement\n    </em>\n    (ECF No. 59) is\n    <strong>\n     DENIED.\n    </strong>\n    An Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall be entered.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-49\">\n     The numbering of paragraphs in the\n     <em>\n      Opposition to Motion to Enforce Stipulation\n     </em>\n     is irregular. The Opposition includes four sections (I through IV). Under \"I. Introduction\" the paragraphs are numbered 1 through 3. Under \"II. Facts\" the numbering of paragraphs is restarted at 1 and continues through 10, after 10 the numbering restarts at 4 and continues through 13. \"III. Argument\" picks up at 14 and continues through 21. Accordingly, references to the Opposition will contain both page and paragraph numbers.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-50\">\n     Although it is not the role of this Court to make arguments for the parties, the Court notes that \u00b6 E of the operative part of the Stipulation reads: \"If Debtor sells the Property, the sale proceeds will be used to pay the Loan in full[.]\" As set forth in footnote 3, \"Loan\" is a term defined in the recitals to include the \"Note\" which evidences the loan of monies from SouthStar Funding, LLC to Debtor. While \u00b6 E indirectly references the loan identified in \u00b6 1 (i.e. the recital subject of the Debtor's motion) the Court finds this reference insufficient to create an ambiguity since, as discussed more fully in the remainder of this\n     <em>\n      Memorandum Order\n     </em>\n     , (i) nothing in the Stipulation purports to establish the current amount due on the loan and (ii) the loan was modified from its original terms by the Loan Modification Agreement identified in \u00b6 8 of the Stipulation.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
