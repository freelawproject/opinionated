Were the withdrawn funds\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   part of the bankruptcy estate and therefore not subject to the claims of the chapter 7 Trustee? Or were the withdrawn funds part of the bankruptcy estate and therefore subject to the claims of the chapter 7 Trustee? This is a core proceeding and the parties have agreed that I have jurisdiction and the power to adjudicate this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Both Plaintiff, the chapter 7 Trustee (the \"Trustee\"), and Defendant, Peoples First Federal Credit Union (\"Peoples\"), have filed motions for summary judgment. I find and conclude that when Debtor withdrew the funds from Debtor's 401(k) account before filing her bankruptcy, the funds ceased being part of the 401(k) fund. At that time, they became property of Debtor, and hence, property of the estate when Debtor filed her bankruptcy petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Debtor's withdrawal of the funds was a hardship withdrawal intended for payment to Peoples to stop Peoples' foreclosure on her residence. Debtor gave the proceeds check to her attorney and instructed him to pay the funds to Peoples. Neither Debtor's intention to pay the funds to Peoples nor the Trustee's failure to object Debtor's claim of an exemption in her 401(k) account change my decision that the funds were property of the estate. For these reasons, I will grant the Trustee's motion\n   for summary judgment and deny Peoples' cross-motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     UNDISPUTED FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The facts are undisputed. Well before Debtor's bankruptcy filing, Debtor and her husband were in arrears on the mortgage held by Peoples on their home and Peoples had commenced foreclosure proceedings. To stop the foreclosure, Debtor decided to take a hardship withdrawal from her 401(k) account at Prudential and use the funds to satisfy Peoples' mortgage. Sometime before November 13, 2017, Debtor requested a hardship withdrawal from her Prudential 401(k) account. Prudential approved the request and sent Debtor a check in the amount of $ 45,965. This check was issued, dated, and mailed to Debtor on December 5, 2017. The check was delivered to Debtor's residence at 2:33 p.m. on December 7, 2017. Debtor filed her chapter 7 bankruptcy petition at 2:58 p.m. on December 7, 2017. Debtor endorsed the check and gave it to her attorney with instructions to pay the proceeds of the check to Peoples. Debtor's attorney deposited the check into his IOLTA checking account on December 11, 2017. Debtor's attorney paid the funds ($ 45,965) to Peoples on December 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Trustee filed the complaint initiating this adversary proceeding on June 6, 2018, seeking to avoid the transfer of the $ 45,965 to Peoples as an unauthorized post-petition transfer of property of the estate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20549\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Peoples filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on June 25, 2018 and I directed the parties to file briefs. I denied the motion to dismiss on September 18, 2018, and Peoples filed its answer to the complaint. The Trustee filed her motion for summary judgment on February 7, 2019, Peoples filed its cross-motion on February 8, 2019, and the parties filed post-motion briefs. The last brief was filed on March 25, 2019, and the matter is now ready for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A moving party is entitled to summary judgment only if \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

In this case, both parties moved for summary judgment, thereby establishing their agreement that no material fact is in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Section 549(a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that \"the trustee may avoid a transfer of property of the estate - (1) that occurs after the commencement of the case; and (2) that is not authorized under this title or by the court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20549\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The first question is whether a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding\n   whether the funds in issue were property of the estate at the time Debtor filed her bankruptcy petition. The parties do not agree that the funds in issue were property of the estate, but neither party argues that this question presents a question of fact. To the contrary, it is clearly a question of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Trustee argues that Debtor's pre-petition withdrawal of the funds took them out of the 401(k) account and made them property of Debtor and then property of the estate when Debtor filed her chapter 7 petition. The Trustee relies on\n   <em>\n    Marchand v. Whittick\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Whittick\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142627\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/547/628/\">\n    547 B.R. 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D.N.J. 2016), which is a case very similar to the one before me, to support her position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Peoples argues that I should apply the earmarking doctrine to conclude that the withdrawn funds never became property of the estate because Debtor earmarked the funds for payment to Peoples to settle the state court foreclosure proceeding and specifically instructed her attorney to deliver the funds to Peoples for that purpose. Peoples relies on numerous cases that recognize the earmarking doctrine as a judicially created doctrine that exempts from avoidance under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   certain pre-petition transfers made by a debtor that otherwise meet all of the elements of a preference under section 547.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

That exemption therefore stands. This does not mean, however, that the withdrawn funds were exempt and not property of the estate. As aptly stated by the court in\n   <em>\n    Walsh v.

What a debtor may exempt is property in which the debtor has an interest. Assuming that such a property interest exists, the\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   becomes exempt \"unless a party in interest objects\". Even if no such interest in property exists, the exemption is allowed when no party in interest objects. Such an exemption, however, is \"empty\", as there is no property \"of the kind\" to which the exemption can attach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This is what happened here. Because the Trustee did not object to Debtor's Amended Schedule C, which includes her 401(k) account, Debtor may exempt her interest in that account, whatever that interest might actually be. Debtor's declaration in her Amended Schedule C that the value of her 401(k) account was $ 63,024.17 does not make it so and does not magically restore back to the 401(k) account the funds that had been withdrawn from the 401(k) account pre-petition. Regardless whether the Trustee objected to the exemption, the withdrawn funds in question were not in Debtor's 401(k) account at the time Debtor filed her chapter 7 petition. Debtor's exemption of $ 63,024.17 that allegedly was in her 401(k) account is therefore \"empty\" to the extent that $ 63,024.17 did not exist in her 401(k) account when she filed her bankruptcy petition.\n   <em>\n    Kelin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2899334\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/341/521/#p525\">\n    341 B.R. at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

I will therefore grant the Trustee's motion for summary judgment and deny Peoples' cross-motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Peoples does not argue that the transfer was authorized by Title 11 or by the Court.
