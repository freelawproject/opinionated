FACTS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Debtor filed for chapter 13 relief and scheduled real property at 1392 Baxter Ridge Road, Lawrenceburg, Kentucky (\"Real Estate\"), and a 2007 Giles mobile home located thereon (\"Mobile Home\"). [ECF No. 18.] 21st Mortgage filed Proof of Claim No. 7 for $ 87,531.45 based on a note that is secured by liens on the Real Estate and the Mobile Home. The liens are not disputed, and the Mobile Home is treated as personal property under Kentucky law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Debtor's Initial Plan.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Debtor initially proposed a plan that valued 21st Mortgage's secured claim at $ 20,000.00, payable in equal monthly installments at 5.25% interest. [ECF No. 19.] 21st Mortgage objected to the proposed cram down value [ECF No. 30] and a hearing was scheduled to determine the amount of the secured claim pursuant to\n   \u00a7 506(a). [ECF Nos. 55 and 59.] The parties agreed before the hearing, and it was therefore ordered, that \"the value of the [Mobile Home] is $ 36,000.00 and the value of the [Real Estate] is $ 22,500.00 for a total value of $ 58,500.00.\" [ECF No. 67 (\"Agreed \u00a7 506(a) Valuation Order\").]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Debtor's First Amended Plan.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Debtor then filed its First Amended Plan. [ECF No. 72.] Instead of merely adjusting the initial secured value to the agreed secured value, the Debtor proposed to: (i) retain the Real Estate in exchange for equal monthly payments that total the agreed value of the Real Estate pursuant to \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B) ($ 22,500.00); and (ii) surrender the Mobile Home pursuant to \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(C). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Confirmation was denied because the First Amended Plan did not pay 21st Mortgage the value of its allowed secured claim as required by \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B). [ECF No. 94 at 6-7.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The proposal did not work because the Debtor was not entitled to immediately reduce the total amount of the allowed secured claim payable in subpart (B)(ii) by the \u00a7 506(a) value of surrendered property. Surrender of the Mobile Home pursuant to \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(C) is not the equivalent of a distribution of value in payment of the allowed secured claim.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.] The Amended Plan did not reflect this structure and the proposal would require the detailed analysis conducted in this Opinion. The Debtor was ordered to amend her plan to accurately reflect her intention, which she attempted to do in the Second Amended Plan.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Debtor's Memorandum attached to the Second Amended Plan explains that the Debtor is modifying 21st Mortgage's rights because the claim is not secured entirely by real estate that is the Debtor's principal residence. [ECF No. 99-1.]\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) (allowing modification). The proposed plan values the Real Estate and Mobile Home at $ 58,500.00 based on two December 2017 appraisals prepared for 21st Mortgage. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 99-1 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 90 and 91.] The appraised values are also the basis for the Agreed \u00a7 506(a) Valuation Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Debtor describes the proposed treatment of the 21st Mortgage allowed secured claim as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Specifically, the Debtor's amended chapter 13 plan proposes to pay 21st Mortgage $ 22,500.00 in monthly plan payments at the rate of $ 471.61, plus 5.25% interest. [Docket No. 99]. In addition, in the Special Provisions section of the amended plan the Debtor proposes to transfer to 21st Mortgage possession of the 2007 Giles manufactured home valued by 21st Mortgage's appraiser at $ 36,000.00. [Docket No. 99]. Collectively, 21st Mortgage is receiving \"property distributed under the plan\" in the full amount of the secured portion of its claim of $ 58,500.00 as of the effective date of the plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [ECF No. 99-1 at 2 (footnote omitted).] The plan does not disclose whether the Debtor intends to transfer title to the Mobile Home or just possession. The Debtor indicated at the confirmation hearing that she is willing to transfer title to the Mobile Home to effectuate a distribution under \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   21st Mortgage objects. [ECF No. 107.] It argues that \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) does not allow satisfaction of an allowed secured claim with non-cash property. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.] 21st Mortgage also argues that the valuation agreed on by the parties does not contemplate ownership costs, such as insurance and taxes, and distribution expenses, such as a commission or the cost of removal. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Chapter 13 Trustee does not recommend confirmation. [ECF No. 101.] The Trustee sees a conflict because Section II.A.2 implies the Debtor will retain the Mobile Home, which requires periodic payments, while Section VII.B indicates the\n   Debtor will transfer the Mobile Home to 21st Mortgage. The Trustee asks the Debtor to \"[a]mend the plan to clarify whether the debtor intends to pay the secured value of the claim at $ 36,000.00, as provided in section II.A.2, or surrender the collateral as stated in the special provision.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A confirmation hearing on the Second Amended Plan was held on February 21, 2019, and the matter was submitted for a decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The broad question in this case is whether the Debtor's proposed plan is confirmable pursuant to \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B). More specifically, may the Debtor propose a chapter 13 plan that pays part of the allowed secured claim of 21st Mortgage with property,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Mobile Home, and the balance with deferred cash payments? The Debtor may propose such a plan, provided the deferred cash payments equal the total allowed secured claim less the value of the property distributed at confirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Debtor's plan assigns a value of $ 36,000.00 to the Mobile Home, which represents the \u00a7 506(a)(2) value. This price is too high based on information available in the record. Section 506(a)(2) sets the value of the allowed secured claim; it does not address the value of property that is used to pay that allowed secured claim. The value of the Mobile Home as property distributed to pay the allowed secured claim pursuant to \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) is less than the \u00a7 506(a)(2) value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Therefore, the Second Amended Plan does not distribute property at least equal to the value of the allowed secured claim as required by \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) and is not confirmable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Second Amended Plan Is an Attempt to Comply with \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

A plan that does not conform to these requirements is not confirmable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The relationship between the Debtor and 21st Mortgage is defined by the terms of the note and security documents.

Section II.A.2 addresses requests to treat allowed secured claims under the cram down option in \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B). Pursuant to this section, the Debtor may retain collateral over an objection if 21st Mortgage retains its lien and receives value at least equal to the amount of the lender's allowed secured claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(B)(i) and (ii) ;\n   <em>\n    Rash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653579\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/953/#p957\">\n    520 U.S. at 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"440151\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/117/1879/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This is the typical cram down scenario contemplated by \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B). Read literally, Section II.A.2 also indicates the Debtor will retain the Mobile Home, but make no periodic payments based on the present value listed. This is not a typical cram down proposal and belies the Debtor's true goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Special Provision in Section VII.B of the Second Amended Plan, the Memorandum attached thereto, and the Debtor's arguments, explain the Debtor's actual proposal. Instead of paying the entire $ 58,500.00 allowed secured claim with periodic cash payments, the Debtor intends to treat the Mobile Home as \"property to be distributed under the plan\" pursuant to \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii). Section VII.B explains that \"$ 36,000.00 of secured value will be satisfied by the transfer of the 2007 Giles mobile home, [in] which Creditor has a security interest.\" [ECF No. 99 at 4.] The Debtor believes using the Mobile Home as payment will reduce the allowed secured claim to $ 22,500.00, which is then paid in equal monthly installments with interest\n   over the life of the plan under Section II.A.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The First Amended Plan was rejected because it did not accurately describe the Debtor's proposal. Here, the placement of the terms in the Second Amended Plan is not optimal. But all parties understand the Debtor's proposal is an attempt to comply with \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B). Also, the subsequent review confirms the Second Amended Plan is not confirmable. Therefore, forcing the Debtor to submit a revised plan before ruling, only to deny it, makes no sense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Debtor must satisfy subparts (i), (ii), and (iii) of \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B) to allow confirmation. Subpart (iii) is not an issue in this case because the deferred cash payments meet the requirements. The following discussion focuses on compliance with subparts (i) and (ii) and concludes the Debtor has not offered to distribute enough property to pay the allowed secured claim of 21st Mortgage, so the Debtor's proposal fails under \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

A simple appraisal may work for a house and lot, but a multi-acre, mixed use tract that is only partially conveyed in payment of a debt will require significant and costly proof. Transfer of a business would require analysis of the types of assets conveyed and valuations of parts or the whole. Also, it is possible that \"the property sought to be distributed under (B) may be so difficult to value that it may not be transferred under (B) because (B)(ii)'s valuation requirement could not be met.\"\n   <em>\n    Kerwin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513442,6527724\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/996/552/\">\n    996 F.2d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Valuations of mobile homes are common in this district and do not pose any significant difficulty. The problem with the Second Amended Plan is the Debtor's assumption that the value of the property distributed pursuant to \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) is the same as the value assigned to the Mobile Home to arrive at the value of the allowed secured claim pursuant to \u00a7 506(a). The valuation of an allowed secured claim required by \u00a7 506(a)(2) does not set the value of personal property distributed under \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) to pay that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The Mobile Home is personal property under Kentucky law, so \u00a7 506(a)(2) requires use of replacement value to determine the secured amount of the allowed claim. The Debtor and 21st Mortgage agreed the Mobile Home has a value of $ 36,000.00 for purposes of \u00a7 506(a) and the Real Estate is valued at $ 22,500.00, for a total allowed secured claim of $ 58,500.00. This calculation addresses one component of \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii), \"the allowed amount of such claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   But the replacement value standard is not the appropriate value for the Mobile Home as property distributed under \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) because \u00a7 506(a)(2) is premised on retention of the asset by the debtor. The genesis of \u00a7 506(a)(2) explains why that valuation is not the same as the value of property distributed pursuant to \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Rash\n   </em>\n   that replacement value is the appropriate valuation standard for a vehicle a debtor intends to retain and pay through deferred cash payments during the life of the plan.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653579\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/953/#p957\">\n    520 U.S. at 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"440151\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/117/1879/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Debtor assigns a value of $ 36,000.00 to the Mobile Home as an immediate distribution, leaving $ 22,500.00 of the allowed secured claim payable through deferred cash payments with interest. The record requires a conclusion that the distribution of the Mobile Home by transfer of title is not worth $ 36,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The \u00a7 506(a)(2) valuation omits expenses that affect the value of the Mobile Home for distribution purposes. The distribution valuation must consider costs of liquidation, such as a title examination, exercise of Uniform Commercial Code or other state law rights, and a broker's fee. 21st Mortgage would also incur costs of ownership while it is preparing to sell the Mobile Home, such as insurance, relocation expenses, and security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The agreed \u00a7 506(a)(2) value of the Mobile Home as part of the determination of the allowed secured claim does not consider all factors necessary to value the Mobile Home for purposes of distribution in payment of the allowed secured claim. Although this decision does not set a value for the Mobile Home, the record allows a conclusion that the value of the Mobile Home is less than the amount proposed by the Debtor because it omits key components that reduce the property's value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Therefore, 21st Mortgage's objection is sustained, and the Second Amended Plan is not confirmable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

This means the remaining allowed secured claim paid through deferred cash payments in Section II.A.2 of the plan is not sufficient.
