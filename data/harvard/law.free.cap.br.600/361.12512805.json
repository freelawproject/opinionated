(ECF No. 39-2 at 8 ). The terms of the lease provided Coushatta with royalty payments that are free from the costs of production. However, the royalty clause contains an exception: the parties must share production costs from \"unaffiliated third parties\" in which Goodrich does not have a \"beneficial interest.\" (ECF No. 38 at 4 ). Coushatta and Goodrich dispute the interpretation of this provision. Coushatta argues that its royalty payments are free from the costs of operating wells on the property, while Goodrich claims Coushatta must share operating expenses because they arise from an unaffiliated third party. (ECF Nos. 38 at 2-3; 39-2 at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Goodrich's motion for summary judgment is granted. Coushatta's motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Coushatta owns land and associated mineral interests in the Bossier and Bienville Parishes of Louisiana. (ECF No. 39-2 at 8 ). In February 2010, Goodrich entered into an Oil, Gas, and Mineral Lease with Goodrich Petroleum Corporation which entitled Coushatta to receive a 30% royalty payment and a one-time bonus payment of $ 2,000,000.00 upon execution. (ECF No. 39-2 at 8 ). This lease was renegotiated in May 2010 after Coushatta agreed to return the bonus payment in exchange for a higher royalty payment of 35.0%. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at 6 ). Both leases contain the following provision within \"Exhibit A\" which modifies the royalty clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The royalty interest of [Coushatta] provided for in this lease shall not be charged, and shall not bear, any costs\n   whatsoever in connection with the production, compression, gathering and transportation costs except charges incurred by [Goodrich] from unaffiliated Third Parties in which [Goodrich] does not have a beneficial interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (ECF No. 39-2 at 9 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   BHP Billiton Petroleum was retained as the operator for the lease and eventually drilled nine producing wells on Coushatta's property. (ECF No. 38 at 3 ). Oil and gas produced from these wells was sold and BHP then distributed Coushatta's royalty proceeds either directly to Coushatta, or to Goodrich who would then remit the proceeds to Coushatta. (ECF No. 38 at 4 ). In either case, Coushatta's royalty payments were proportionately reduced by the amount of BHP's production costs. (ECF No. 38 at 4 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   These royalty payments form the basis of this dispute. Coushatta initiated this adversary proceeding on January 8, 2018, alleging that Goodrich improperly withheld royalty payments due under this lease. (ECF No. 1 at 7-8 ). Coushatta argues that Goodrich is affiliated with, and holds a beneficial interest in, BHP based on marketing and contractual relationships. (ECF No. 39-2 at 17-18 ). Thus, allegedly under the language of the lease, Coushatta argues its royalty payments should be free from any costs attributable to BHP's operations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 39-2 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Goodrich disputes Coushatta's view, arguing that its business transactions with BHP were arm's length negotiations between separate companies without an affiliate relationship or beneficial interest. (ECF No. 38 at 9 ). To Goodrich, the royalty provision of the lease requires that Coushatta pay its proportionate share of BHP's costs. (ECF No. 38 at 8 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The District Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

(ECF Nos. 38 at 8, 39-2 at 17). However, they diverge regarding the proper interpretation of those terms. This dispute may be narrowed to the proper interpretation of two sections: \"unaffiliated Third Parties\" and \"beneficial interest.\" (ECF Nos. 38 at 7-9, 39-2 at 17-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   It is important to note that Coushatta does not allege that Goodrich received any preferential treatment from BHP. Goodrich pays its full, proportionate share of the BHP charges just as Coushatta must pay its full proportionate share. The absence of any preferential treatment by BHP to Goodrich (i) tends to demonstrate the absence of any affiliation; and (ii) destroys any equitable argument that Coushatta is being treated unfairly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In that light, the Court examines the contract between the parties and concludes that Coushatta has no good faith basis to assert its claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Unaffiliated Third Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The lease states that Coushatta \"shall not be charged, and shall not bear\" production costs, except for charges \"incurred by [Goodrich] from unaffiliated Third Parties....\" (ECF No. 39-2 at 9 ). Coushatta argues that as the operator of the wells, BHP falls outside of this exception. (ECF No. 39-2 at 17 ). Based on the unitization of the wells, Coushatta claims \"BHP ... became affiliated with everyone in that unit with the rights to receive monies and cost allocations.... BHP produces the wells for the benefit of itself and all other stakeholders in the units.\" (ECF No. 39-2 at 17-18 ). Goodrich adopts a literal interpretation of \"unaffiliated third parties,\" claiming that Goodrich and BHP are separate corporate entities and thus fall within the exception to production costs, to which Coushatta must contribute. (ECF No. 38 at 9 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   An affiliate is defined as \"a corporation that is related to another corporation by shareholdings or other means of control; a subsidiary, parent, or sibling corporation.\"\n   <em>\n    Affiliate\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). The definition of affiliate comports with Goodrich's interpretation of this term. Goodrich and BHP are separate corporate entities and have no parent-subsidiary relationship that would justify including BHP within the production cost carveout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Coushatta quotes the Merriam Webster definition of unaffiliated as \"not closely associated with, belonging to, or subordinate to another, not affiliated.\" (ECF No. 39-2 at 16-17 ). This definition further supports Goodrich's argument that it is unaffiliated with BHP. The use of \"belonging to\" and \"subordinate\" in the lay definition of unaffiliated indicates control between affiliated entities that is not present between BHP and Goodrich.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Coushatta also suggests that the closely aligned monetary interests between BHP\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   and Goodrich establish an affiliate relationship between the two. (ECF No. 39-2 at 17-18 ). Coushatta claims that an affiliate relationship exists based on the unitization of these wells, which requires that BHP produce minerals and hold Goodrich's assets for \"the benefit of itself and other stakeholders.\" (ECF No. 39-2 at 17-18 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Coushatta's argument is unpersuasive. Unitization consolidates individual interest holders, who are separately producing minerals from a common reservoir, under a single operator for the purpose of maximizing production from the reservoir.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. Fields\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"67142\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/229/197/#p199\">\n    229 F.2d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199-200 (5th Cir. 1956). The Court was unable to locate any case law (nor does Coushatta cite any) holding that unitization creates a parent-subsidiary relationship between two separate entities. A duty to prevent waste or act for the benefit of other interest holders similarly fails to invoke the control of a parent-subsidiary relationship referenced in the plain language of the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Coushatta also points to a natural gas marketing contract that appoints Petrohawk, a BHP affiliate, as Goodrich's agent as additional evidence of an affiliate relationship. (ECF No. 39-2 at 18 ). As with Coushatta's unitization argument, no authority is cited that transforms a contractual agency relationship into a parent-subsidiary relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Other provisions of the lease run contrary to Coushatta's broad interpretation of \"unaffiliated.\" Paragraph 4 of the lease requires that Coushatta pay \"its proportion of any expenses for treating the oil to make it marketable as crude.\" (ECF No. 39-6 at 1 ). This provision was modified by Exhibit A, which excepted Coushatta's royalty from \"charges incurred by [Goodrich] from unaffiliated Third Parties....\" (ECF No. 39-6 at 4 ). What appears to be a narrow exception to the lease provision would expand to eliminate paragraph 4 under Coushatta's broad interpretation. Coushatta would be exempted from paying its share of costs for every party that contracted or was connected to Goodrich, even without Goodrich's consent (such as through a unitization order). This would read paragraph 4 out of the lease, leading to an \"absurd consequence\" prohibited under Louisiana's contract interpretation rules.\n   <em>\n    Am. Totalisator Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514395\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/3/810/#p813\">\n    3 F.3d at 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Coushatta claims that the royalty provision in Exhibit A was included \"to re-define the concept of the royalty base,\" prevent self-dealing between Goodrich and BHP, and that its interpretation of the royalty clause reflects the intent of the parties. (ECF No. 39-2 at 19 ). However, the inclusion of the exception demonstrates the parties' intent that Coushatta bear costs of production, which is echoed in paragraph 4 of the lease. (ECF No. 39-6 at 1 ). Logically, if the parties intended to redefine the royalty base as Coushatta proposes, the clause would simply end after stating that Coushatta's royalty interests are free from the costs of production. It would not have included an exception that includes production costs for \"unaffiliated Third Parties\" without a \"beneficial interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Coushatta also cites the Fifth Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Columbine II Ltd. P'ship v. Energen Resources Corp.\n   </em>\n   to support its interpretation of the royalty provision.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1113137\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/129/119/#p122\">\n    129 F.

In\n   <em>\n    Columbine II\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling that Energen improperly deducted operating costs from Columbine's overriding royalty interest pursuant to a sublease agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1113137\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/129/119/#p122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Fifth Circuit based its decision on language in the sublease agreement that \"\n   <em>\n    expressly precludes\n   </em>\n   the deduction of post-production transportation costs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1113137\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/129/119/#p122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Coushatta claims that the holding of\n   <em>\n    Columbine II\n   </em>\n   parallels the royalty provision in Exhibit A, which states: \"the royalty interest ... shall not be charged, and shall not bear, any costs whatsoever....\" (ECF No. 39-2 at 21 ). However, Coushatta's argument ignores the remainder of the royalty provision, which imposes production costs on Coushatta's royalty when incurred by an \"unaffiliated Third Party\" without a \"beneficial interest.\" This exception distinguishes the royalty provision at issue from the one in\n   <em>\n    Columbine II\n   </em>\n   , which unequivocally precluded charging post-production costs.\n   <em>\n    Columbine II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1113137\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/129/119/#p122\">\n    129 F. App'x at 122-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, Coushatta has failed to establish that BHP is an affiliate of Goodrich or that the royalty provision in Exhibit A exempts its royalty interest from BHP's production costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Both Goodrich and Coushatta cite other authority such as the Louisiana corporate law, federal statutes, and the Bankruptcy Code to support their view of \"unaffiliated Third Party.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 43 at 10-12, 44 at 5-6). However, these arguments are moot under Louisiana's contract interpretation standard, which requires that the \"intent of [the contract's] parties must be sought within the four corners of the document.\"\n   <em>\n    Am. Totalisator Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514395\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/3/810/#p813\">\n    3 F.3d at 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Unaffiliated\" is unambiguous in the context of the lease and requires that control exist between entities before Coushatta receives its royalty free of production costs. Accordingly, the Court need not consider any uses of \"unaffiliated\" beyond the plain meaning in the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Beneficial Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The royalty provision in Exhibit A requires that Coushatta's royalty bear production costs except from \"unaffiliated third parties in which [Goodrich] does not have a\n   <em>\n    beneficial interest.\n   </em>\n   \" (ECF No. 39-2 at 9 ) (emphasis added). Coushatta claims that the unitization order and Goodrich's contractual relationships with BHP and its subsidiary, Petrohawk, also establishes Goodrich's beneficial interest in BHP. (ECF No. 39-2 at 18 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   A beneficial interest is defined as \"a right or expectancy in something (such as a trust or an estate), as opposed to legal title to that thing.\"\n   <em>\n    Beneficial interest\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). The term is commonly employed by trusts to allow the use of trust property or income while legal title to such property remains with the trust.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514395\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/3/810/#p813\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Coushatta purports that BHP's possession of oil and gas produced from the wells as well as Petrohawk's marketing agreements with Goodrich demonstrate such a beneficial interest. (ECF No. 39-2 at 18 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Coushatta has also adopted an overly broad view of \"beneficial interest\" in this clause. According to its definition a beneficial interest holder does not have legal title to the property.\n   <em>\n    Beneficial interest\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). However, Goodrich has an ownership interest in the oil and gas produced by BHP from the wells in question. Coushatta admits this stating, \"BHP is in possession of the production which\n   <em>\n    belongs to Goodrich.\n   </em>\n   \" (ECF No. 39-2 at 18 ) (emphasis added). With legal title to the production from the wells, Goodrich has no beneficial interest in BHP. Similarly, Petrohawk and Goodrich have a contractual relationship that obligates Petrohawk to market gas on behalf of Goodrich. (ECF No. 43 at 14 ). However, such a contractual relationship is distinguishable from the beneficiary and trustee relationship contemplated by the holder of a beneficial interest. Accordingly, Coushatta has failed to establish that Goodrich held a beneficial interest in BHP and is obligated to pay its share of production costs under the royalty provision of Exhibit A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court will issue a Judgment consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
