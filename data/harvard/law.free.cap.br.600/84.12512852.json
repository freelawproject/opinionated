Berger, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Larry and Terri Anderson filed a personal injury action against the debtor Trust\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on February 5, 2018, in Greene County, Missouri. In that action, the Andersons seek damages for injuries allegedly suffered by Mr. Anderson at one of Debtors' properties in 2015, prior to the commencement of Debtors' bankruptcy cases. Acknowledging that they have not filed a proof of claim against the Trust, the Andersons now move this Court to annul the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   modify the \u00a7 524 discharge injunction\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to allow their state court action to proceed-not to collect from the Trust, but rather to establish liability so that they may collect from the Trust's insurer, Travelers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trust opposes the Andersons' motion in briefs\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed jointly with creditor JD Holdings, L.L.C. (together with the Trust, the \"\n   <strong>\n    Joint Objectors\n   </strong>\n   \"), which is obligated to pay all allowed claims against Debtors pursuant to Debtors' confirmed Chapter 11 plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Joint Objectors' opposition to the Andersons' motion is due to the nature of Debtors' Insurance Program Agreement with Travelers (the \"\n   <strong>\n    IPA\n   </strong>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under a conventional insurance policy, premiums are paid up-front. Policies subject to the IPA, however, may include a yearly \"Retrospective Plan Premium Adjustment Amount\" (the \"Adjustment\") under which additional premiums, based in part on \"Incurred Losses,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   are paid by the insured after the applicable policy period. The Joint Objectors argue that any recovery the Andersons might obtain from Travelers would be charged to Debtors via the Adjustment, and that this economic effect on Debtors precludes stay annulment and modification of the discharge injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   However, on the record before this Court, it is impossible to determine whether the Andersons' theoretical recovery from Travelers would subsequently be charged to Debtors, as the record lacks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \u2022 the IPA for the applicable insurance period,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   note 5\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 the policy for the applicable insurance period,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 evidence as to when a loss attributable to the Andersons would be \"Incurred\" under the IPA;\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 a complete and accurate explanation of how the Adjustment is calculated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Therefore, and for the reasons stated below, the Andersons' motion will be granted to the extent necessary for them to obtain a final judgment in their Missouri action, but not to collect thereon.

Allowing the Missouri action to proceed will completely resolve the issue of liability on the Andersons' personal injury claims, which cannot be adjudicated by this Court (factor 1);\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   establishing liability without allowing collection on a judgment will not interfere with Debtors' bankruptcy case (factor 2); the Trust is not responsible for defense costs (factor 5);\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Missouri action essentially involves third parties (the\n   Andersons and Travelers), with the Trust participating in name only (factor 6); establishing liability will not prejudice any other interested party (factor 7); and judgment in favor of the Andersons would not be subject to equitable subordination or result in an avoidable judicial lien (factors 8 and 9). The Andersons have thus established cause for annulment of the automatic stay. Because the Joint Objectors base their response on a hypothetical cost to the Trust under documents not provided to the Court, the Joint Objectors have not demonstrated why the stay should not be retroactively annulled. Therefore, the motion for annulment of the stay will be granted to the extent necessary for the Andersons to obtain a final judgment in their Missouri action, but not to collect thereon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Modification of Discharge Injunction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under \u00a7 524(e), \"discharge of a debt of the debtor does not affect the liability of any other entity on, or the property of any other entity for, such debt.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   It is well established that this provision permits a creditor to bring or continue an action directly against the debtor for the purpose of establishing the debtor's liability when, as here, establishment of that liability is a prerequisite to recovery from another entity. Logically enough, this exception to section 524(a)'s post-discharge injunction hinges \"upon the condition that the debtor not be personally liable in a way that would interfere with the debtor's fresh start in life.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Walker v.
