Barash, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This adversary proceeding arises out of the prepetition acquisition of a secured loan by defendant Radians Wareham Holding, Inc. (\"RWHI\") and the prepetition exercise of remedies under that loan agreement against the chapter 11 debtors herein, Ironclad Performance Wear Corporation, a California corporation (\"ICPW CA\"), and Ironclad Performance Wear Corporation, a Nevada corporation (\"ICPW NV\") (collectively, the \"Debtors\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff herein, Matthew Pliskin (\"Plaintiff\"), is trustee under a trust created pursuant to a joint plan of liquidation (\"Plan\") confirmed in the above-referenced chapter 11 cases. Plaintiff is successor in interest to the official committee of equity holders for ICPW NV (\"Equity Committee\"), which commenced this adversary proceeding prior to confirmation of the Plan by filing the complaint herein (\"Complaint\"). Adv. Dkt. 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Complaint alleges that RWHI acquired the loan and exercised remedies thereunder in an effort to acquire the Debtors' business and in a manner that caused injury to the Debtors and the value of their business. Based on this premise, the Complaint asserts: (i) a cause of action for economic duress, (ii) a cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (iii) a cause of action for unjust enrichment, (iv) a cause of action for recovery, as an unauthorized transfer, of all funds paid to RWHI on its claims in the Debtors' cases, and (v) disallowance of the proof of claim filed by RWHI on account of the acquired loan. The Complaint also names as defendants RWHI's affiliates, Safety Supply Corporation (\"Safety Supply\"), and Radians, Inc. (\"Radians\") (together with Safety Supply and RWHI, \"Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants have filed their motion to dismiss the Complaint (the \"Motion to Dismiss\" or \"MTD\"). Adv. Dkt. 5. Defendants argue that Safety Supply and Radians should be dismissed from this lawsuit because the Complaint does not allege enough facts to support a claim against these affiliates of RWHI. Defendants further argue that all claims against them should be dismissed because: (i) the claims were released pursuant to the terms of a prepetition release executed by the Debtors, (ii) the claims were released pursuant to the terms of the agreed order approving the Debtor's postpetition financing, and (iii) the Complaint fails to adequately plead causes of action on which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court has reviewed and considered all the pleadings filed in support of and in opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, the oral arguments of counsel, and the documents identified in Section IV below. For the reasons set forth below, the Motion to Dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part, as specified below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 8, 2017 (\"Petition Date\"), the Debtors each filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. ICPW CA developed and manufactured high-performance task-specific gloves and apparel in a variety of end markets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Omnibus Declaration of L. Geoff Greulich in Support of Debtors' Emergency \"First Day\" Motions (\"Greulich Decl.\"), \u00b6 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ICPW NV was a publicly-traded company whose only business was owning all shares in ICPW CA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Greulich Decl., Case Dkt. 6, \u00b6 2. The Debtors' business was headquartered in Farmers Branch, Texas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In connection with commencement of these cases, the United States Trustee (\"UST\") appointed (1) the Equity Committee,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Case Dkt. 59; and (2) an official committee of unsecured creditors (\"Creditors' Committee\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Dkt. 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In late 2014, the Debtors obtained a revolving credit facility from Capital One, N.A. (\"Capital One\"), secured by substantially all of the Debtors' assets. Greulich Decl., Case Dkt. 6, \u00b6 12. On July 25, 2017, Capital One assigned the loan to RWHI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14. As of the Petition Date, RWHI was the Debtors' only secured creditor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 23. RWHI filed identical proofs of claim in each of the Debtors' cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Claim No. 20-1 in Case No. 1:17-bk-12408-MB; Claim No. 7-1 in Case No. 1:17-bk-12409-MB). Both proofs of claim asserted a claim amount of $ 3,464,093.28, owing as of the Petition Date (collectively, the \"Claim\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shortly before the Petition Date, the Debtors and RWHI entered into an asset purchase agreement (\"APA\") pursuant to which RWHI agreed to serve as a stalking horse, i.e., purchase the Debtors' assets subject to overbid and court approval. Greulich Decl., Case Dkt. 6, \u00b6 27. The APA provided for certain bidding procedures applicable to the process, and a breakup fee of $ 500,000 (\"Breakup Fee\") if RWHI was not the winning bidder in an auction for the Debtors' assets, or if the Debtors proceeded with a plan of reorganization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Greulich Decl. at 271-72..\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 28, 2017, the Court entered an order approving the form of the APA and the bidding procedures to which the Debtors and RWHI agreed, including the Breakup Fee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Dkt. 71 (\"Bidding Procedures Order\"). On October 30, 2017, the Court conducted an auction and thereafter approved the sale of substantially all the Debtors' assets to a purchaser\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   RWHI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sale Order, Case Dkt. 177. The winning bidder agreed to purchase substantially all of the Debtors' assets for $ 25,500,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That sale closed on November 14. 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Dkt. 237.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Also before the Petition Date, the Debtors and RWHI entered into the DIP Agreement, pursuant which RWHI agreed to provide postpetition financing while the Debtors marketed the opportunity to overbid for the assets. Greulich Decl., Case Dkt. 6, \u00b6 23. On October 6, 2017, the Court entered its final order approving the DIP Agreement, the form of which was agreed\n   to by the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Dkt. 87 (\"Final DIP Order\"). Among other things, the Final DIP Order contained language (i) granting standing to the Equity Committee to pursue certain claims of the Debtors' estates (the \"Estates\") against RWHI, provided an action on such claims was commenced within a specified time period, and (ii) subject to such rights, waiving certain claims against RWHI:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   kk. On or before the date that is sixty (60) days from the date of the entry of this Final Financing Order (the \"Lookback Period\"), the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors and the Official Committee of Equity Holders shall have standing individually and on behalf of Debtors' Estates to object to, challenge, or seek to avoid the amount, validity, or enforceability of the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt (or any portion thereof) or any of the liens and security interests created under the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt and to bring any other claim that they have against Radians, individually or on behalf of the Debtors' Estates (separately and collectively, a \"Challenge\"). If no such action, objection or other Challenge is commenced by either the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors or the Official Committee of Equity Holders within the Lookback Period, the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt will be deemed and adjudicated finally and indefeasibly as valid and enforceable, the liens and security interests created under the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt in the Collateral securing the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt will be deemed and adjudicated finally and indefeasibly as valid, enforceable and perfected liens and security interests in that Collateral, and any affirmative claim(s) or cause(s) of action of any kind against Radians with respect to the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt, or otherwise, and the liens and security interests securing the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt, or any payment received by Radians will be forever barred. As provided in this Final Financing Order, the Debtors have waived and released, and shall be forever barred from asserting, any right to object to, challenge or seek to avoid, the amount, validity, or enforceability of the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt or the liens and security interests in the Collateral securing the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt. Except as otherwise may have been determined by the Court in the proceedings referenced above, and subject to further Order of the Court, in the event any payment made to, or other amount or value received by Radians from or for the account of any of the Debtors is avoided, rescinded, set aside or must otherwise be returned or repaid by Radians, whether in the Cases or any other proceedings, the indebtedness repaid shall be allowed as a claim in accordance with existing law. Any of Radians' claims, liens, rights, and remedies under the Loan Documents which survive such action shall be reinstated and fully preserved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Case Dkt. 87 at 19 (Final DIP Order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 5, 2017, the Equity Committee filed the Complaint and initiated the instant adversary proceeding. The Court subsequently confirmed the Plan, which dissolved the Equity Committee, created a trust solely for the benefit of the shareholders of ICPW NV, and transferred to the trust the rights of the Equity Committee to prosecute this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Dkt. 438, 442. Thereafter, the parties entered into a stipulation substituting Matthew Pliskin, as trustee under the trust created by the Plan, as Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Dkt. 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   What follows are the relevant allegations from the Complaint. Safety Supply is the\n   parent company of RWHI and Radians. Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 4-6. Defendants acted under the same management and share responsibility for each other's actions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13. RWHI was paid $ 5,343,988.19 upon the closing of the sale of the Debtors' assets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants manufacture safety equipment and apparel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12. In 2007 or 2008, the representatives of the Debtors and RWHI met to discuss if the two businesses might benefit from a strategic transaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14. The Debtors decided not to pursue such a transaction, but over the next several years RWHI communicated its interest in acquiring the Debtors' brands or assets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Between November 2016 and April 2017, Capital One agreed to waive defaults when the Debtors breached the debt service coverage ratio (\"DSCR\") covenant of the Loan Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19. On April 11, 2017, Capital One agreed to replace the DSCR covenant with a 12-month trailing adjusted EBITDA covenant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In May 2017, Capital One demonstrated it was willing to work with the Debtors through financial difficulties when it extended the loan's maturity date to July 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In May 2017, RWHI prepared to go public with an offer to purchase ICPW NV's shares for 27.5 cents per share.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15. Around the time RWHI was preparing its stock purchase offer, the Debtors' board of directors received anonymous reports of accounting irregularities that resulted in inflated revenue figures on the Debtors' financial statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16. Upon investigating the reports, the Debtors filed a Form 8-K Report with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about July 6, 2017, dated June 29, 2017, disclosing the financial irregularities, the termination of the employment of the Debtors' chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and the appointment of new individuals to those positions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Days later, on July 10, 2017, RWHI's CEO wrote the Debtors' chairman to say RWHI did not want to wait for the financial reports to be restated, and RWHI was willing to consider increasing its 27.5 cents per share purchase offer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17. Meanwhile, RWHI contacted Capital One to express its interest in purchasing the Debtors' loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18. RWHI and Capital One quickly reached an agreement whereby RWHI would purchase the loan and waive any recourse against Capital One related to the uncertainties presented by the misstatements in the Debtors' financial statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20. RWHI purchased the loan from Capital One on July 25, 2017, and Radians wired to Capital One an amount of money equivalent to the outstanding balance on the loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21. Neither Defendants nor their managers had ever before acted as a commercial lender.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The next day, on July 26, 2017, counsel for RWHI sent the Debtors a letter declaring the Debtors in default under the loan due to the previously disclosed misstated financial reports, accelerating the loan, and demanding immediate payment of the $ 3,688,195.22 outstanding balance in full.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22. RWHI knew the Debtors had no means by which to pay the loan since the Debtors' last financial statements showed a cash balance of less than $ 300,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Over the next four weeks, the Debtors negotiated with several prospective lenders to either replace or supplement the existing debt, but RWHI did not allow that to happen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 23. Instead, RWHI agreed only to two one-week forbearances-one signed August 1, the other signed August 14-even though the Debtors told RWHI they needed two to three weeks to arrange financing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Meanwhile, RWHI continued to make offers to purchase the Debtors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   RWHI began sweeping cash from the Debtors' bank accounts on August 24, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24. RWHI knew the Debtors could not operate without cash, but it refused to stop sweeping the cash because it intended to force the Debtors to shut down or turn over their assets to RWHI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   RWHI's actions-in accelerating the loan, agreeing only to unworkable one-week forbearances, and sweeping the Debtors' bank accounts-were strictly for RWHI's own commercial advantage and were unjust, oppressive, and in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 25. Left with no funds and no other alternative, the Debtors informed RWHI that they intended to file for bankruptcy protection, and the parties negotiated an agreement whereby RWHI would be the stalking horse bidder in a bankruptcy sale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 26. Had RWHI not forced the Debtors into bankruptcy, the Debtors would have been able to negotiate refinancing of the loan or a sale of the Debtors' assets on terms more favorable than those realized in the bankruptcy auction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   RWHI improperly used the acceleration and cash sweeping provisions of the Loan Agreement to further RWHI's own economic interests because RWHI was only interested in acquiring the Debtors' assets.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 30-34. RWHI's actions forced the Debtors into bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In bankruptcy, the Debtors' assets were sold for a price that was less than the value of the assets before RWHI exercised these remedies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

It is a legal conclusion, which the Court is not bound to accept as true on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Third, the Complaint does not allege any meeting of the minds between the three Defendants regarding a common objective or course of action, the substance of their agreement, or that it was made by each participant with a specific intent \"to accomplish an unlawful purpose or to accomplish a lawful purpose by unlawful means.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The alleged fact that Safety Supply sought to purchase shares of ICPW NV arguably demonstrates that RWHI sought to use its wholly owned subsidiary to acquire the Debtors' business. It does not establish an agreement between the two entities to achieve any unlawful purpose or any lawful purpose by unlawful means. Likewise, the alleged fact that Radians wired the money used by RWHI to acquire the Debtors' loan from Capital One, demonstrates little more than that Radians facilitated the purchase of that loan on behalf of its wholly owned parent. It does not establish a meeting of the minds regarding either an unlawful purpose or a lawful purpose by unlawful means. As such, the Complaint fails to provide Defendants with \"fair notice\" of the civil conspiracy theory that was subsequently asserted in the Opposition or the \"grounds upon which [that theory] rests.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

Defendants' Arguments That the Entire Action is Barred\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff is barred from bringing the Complaint in its entirety for two separate reasons. First, Defendants\n   argue that the equity holders of ICPW-NV (a) have not suffered any direct injury that would confer standing on them to pursue any claim, and (b) under Texas law, they do not have standing to pursue a claim for injuries to either of the Debtors. Second, Defendants argue that the Debtors voluntarily released their claims against Defendants, both prepetition and postpetition. For this reason, Defendants argue, none of the claims asserted in the Complaint is an enforceable claim of the Estates. Each of these arguments is addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As noted, Plaintiff is the successor in interest to the Equity Committee. The beneficiaries of the trust for which Plaintiff serves as trustee are the former holders of the equity in ICPW-NV. Defendants rely on these facts to argue that Plaintiff does not have standing to pursue the claims asserted in the Complaint. Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot have standing because the equity holders have not been directly injured by Defendants and do not otherwise have standing as equity holders, under Texas law, to sue for damages to the corporation. But these arguments assume incorrectly that Plaintiff is asserting causes of action that originated with the equity holders themselves. To the contrary, the claims that Plaintiff is pursuing on behalf of the plan trust are claims of the Estates.\n   <em>\n    In re Spaulding Composites Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"869094\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/207/899/#p903\">\n    207 B.R. 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 903 (9th Cir. BAP 1997). The Equity Committee was granted the right to pursue claims of the Estates under the Final DIP Order, and that right was transferred to Plaintiff pursuant to the Plan.

This is because enforcement of the prepetition agreement in this manner-although the agreement did not mention specific rights in bankruptcy-would effectively waive the rights of a debtor to use the trust and injunction mechanism under Bankruptcy Code section 524(g).

These courts declined to enforce either (i) a prepetition waiver by the debtor of specifically-identified rights or protections under the Bankruptcy Code, or (ii) a prepetition waiver by the debtor of nonbankruptcy rights which, if enforced, would effectively deny the debtor rights or protections created by the Bankruptcy Code. None of these cases involve a debtor, its successor, or a third party being permitted to pursue nonbankruptcy claims that were released prepetition by the debtor in accordance with state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Here, the Prepetition Releases do not purport to affect the Debtors' rights under the Bankruptcy Code (e.g., preempting the automatic stay, granting a blocking right, precluding a bankruptcy trustee's avoidance powers, etc.), but instead release prepetition state law causes of action, such as the claims asserted in the Complaint for duress, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment claims. The prepetition release of these state-law claims may have had an economic impact on the Debtors and ultimately the Estates (when they later came into existence). But the prepetition release of those claims is not equivalent to the\n   <em>\n    express\n   </em>\n   waiver of statutory rights and protections under the Bankruptcy Code or even the\n   <em>\n    effective\n   </em>\n   waiver of such rights and protections. Instead, the releases resulted in certain assets (i.e., state law causes of action) not becoming part of the Estates.

The Court finds this argument unpersuasive. Having made clear that Plaintiff is only pursuing claims that were property of the Estates, see Opp. at 20, Plaintiff cannot now argue that these claims are free of any defenses to which they were subject when they were still in the hands of the Debtors or the Estates.

In other words, Plaintiff argues that the Debtors' injuries manifested themselves\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Prepetition Releases were executed.

Therefore, [the Debtors] on each of its own behalf and on behalf of each of its respective successors and assigns, hereby waives, releases and discharges [RWHI] ... from any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action on or before the date hereof and arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement, the Loan Documents and any other documents, instruments, agreements, dealings or other matters connected with this Agreement, including, without limitation, all known and unknown matters, claims, transactions or things occurring on or prior to the date hereof relating to this Agreement.

This broad release, if approved by the Court, would seem to preclude the Debtors, their successors, and their assigns from pursuing virtually any action against Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Accordingly, both the Equity Committee and the Creditors' Committee objected on multiple grounds to the motion to approve the DIP Agreement, Case Dkt. 7. The Equity Committee requested that \"any final [DIP] order incorporate additional language to clarify that the Equity Committee and creditors may pursue claims and causes of action in their individual capacity and on behalf of the estate to challenge the validity, perfection or enforceability of Radians' prepetition liens.\" Case Dkt. 86 at 6. The Equity Committee also requested that \"any waiver by the estates should not be effective until the Equity Committee and the Creditors' Committee have [had] sufficient time to investigate and challenge Radians' liens, if necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The\n   Creditors' Committee also objected to the DIP Release contained in section 11.13 of the DIP Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Dkt. 85 at 9-10. The Final DIP Order, of which all parties approved as to form, states that the parties resolved both Committees' objections, and the objections were withdrawn. Case Dkt. 87 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Lookback Provision at the end of the Final DIP Order provides for a 60-day lookback period in which the Committees would be permitted to pursue an action against RWHI regarding the amount, validity, or enforceability of the prepetition loan, or to bring any other claim that they have, individually or on behalf of the Estates. The language is tailored to address the Equity Committee's objection:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   kk. On or before the date that is sixty (60) days from the date of the entry of this Final Financing Order (the \"Lookback Period\"), the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors and the Official Committee of Equity Holders\n   <em>\n    shall have standing individually and on behalf of Debtors' Estates\n   </em>\n   to object to, challenge, or seek to avoid the amount, validity, or enforceability of the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt (or any portion thereof) or any of the liens and security interests created under the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt and\n   <em>\n    to bring any other claim that they have against Radians, individually or on behalf of the Debtors' Estates\n   </em>\n   (separately and collectively, a \"Challenge\"). If no such action, objection or other Challenge is commenced by either the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors or the Official Committee of Equity Holders within the Lookback Period, the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt will be deemed and adjudicated finally and indefeasibly as valid and enforceable, the liens and security interests created under the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt in the Collateral securing the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt will be deemed and adjudicated finally and indefeasibly as valid, enforceable and perfected liens and security interests in that Collateral, and any affirmative claim(s) or cause(s) of action of any kind against Radians with respect to the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt, or otherwise, and the liens and security interests securing the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt, or any payment received by Radians will be forever barred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 (emphasis added). The DIP Release also bars the Debtors' right to pursue an action against RWHI regarding the amount, validity, or enforceability of the prepetition loan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   As provided in this Final Financing Order, the Debtors have waived and released, and shall be forever barred from asserting, any right to object to, challenge or seek to avoid, the amount, validity, or enforceability of the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt or the liens and security interests in the Collateral securing the Pre-Bankruptcy Secured Debt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants now argue that the DIP Release bars this entire action, notwithstanding the Lookback Provision in the Final DIP Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Defendants are wrong. First, the provisions of the Final DIP Order take precedence over the DIP Agreement, which contains the DIP Release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final DIP Order at 8 (\"In the event of a conflict between the Loan Documents and this Final Financing Order, this Final Financing Order shall control.\"). Second, the Final DIP Order makes clear that, although the\n   <em>\n    Debtors\n   </em>\n   were waiving their rights against RWHI, the ability to bring a claim against RWHI on behalf of the\n   <em>\n    Estates\n   </em>\n   was preserved for a period of 60 days from the date of entry of the Final DIP Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other words, the DIP Release is subject\n   to the Lookback Provision. This is what the Court understood and intended when it approved the Final DIP Order, as revised to address and resolve the objections of the Committee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Final DIP Order was entered on October 6, 2017, and the Equity Committee timely filed the Complaint 60 days later, on December 5, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Moreover, Courts routinely approve provisions like the Lookback Provision where the claims released by a debtor are preserved for another entity to pursue on behalf of the debtor's estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Adelphia Commc'ns Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8918828\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/330/364/#p383\">\n    330 B.R. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 383-84 (Bankr.

Black's Law Dictionary defines \"threat\" in relevant part as \"a declaration, express or implied, of an intent to inflict loss or pain on another.\" Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). The Complaint describes the transmittal of a letter by RWHI one day after its acquisition of the loan, declaring a default and accelerating the loan balance. The Complaint also describes the subsequent exercise of RWHI's cash sweep remedy under the Loan Agreement. None of these actions is alleged to have contained or constituted a threat by RWHI to exercise a remedy or take some other action. Each of these actions was itself the exercise of a remedy of the Loan Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nance v.

The lender was not entitled to use its acceleration right offensively and for its own commercial advantage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   These cases, however, do not remedy Plaintiff's duress claim. Even if the Court assumes for the sake of argument that RWHI's default declaration and debt acceleration were undertaken in bad faith, the Complaint does not allege that RWHI ever\n   <em>\n    threatened\n   </em>\n   to exercise these remedies. RWHI just exercised them. The present circumstances are materially different than those presented in\n   <em>\n    Farah\n   </em>\n   , where the lender threatened to declare a default and accelerate the note if the borrower did not accede to the lender's demands. And they are even farther afield of\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , in which the Ninth Circuit held that the acceleration clause at issue was subject to the good faith requirement under the Texas Uniform Commercial Code but was not asked to address the requirements of a claim for duress under Texas law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing analysis, the Court is not persuaded that repleading the duress claim is futile and will grant Plaintiff leave to do so. Based on the facts alleged in the Complaint, it is at least plausible that RWHI's letter declaring a default and accelerating the debt under the Loan Agreement was an implicit threat by RWHI to exercise other remedies or take other actions against the Debtors. Plaintiff may be able to state a claim for duress under Texas law, if Plaintiff can allege that (1) the letter constituted a threat by RWHI to take action that it did not have a legal right to take; (2) the threat was of such a nature as to destroy the free agency of the Debtors; (3) the threat overcame the threatened party's\n   free will and caused it to do what it otherwise would not have done and was not legally bound to do; (4) the restraint caused by such threat was imminent; and (5) the threatened party had no present means of protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   To be clear, the Court is not prejudging these issues. The Court does not know if facts and law exist to substantiate such allegations. For instance, if RWHI made an implicit threat to exercise remedies other than acceleration under the Loan Agreement, it is not clear whether the exercise of such a remedy is subject to the same good faith requirement as acceleration. If Plaintiff determines to file an amended Complaint alleging the \"threat\" for purposes of the duress analysis was a threat to exercise the cash sweep or any other remedy, Plaintiff should be prepared to demonstrate why RWHI did not have a legal right to exercise that remedy under section 1.309 and/or otherwise applicable Texas law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Further, Plaintiff will need to allege facts that specifically address and satisfy\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the elements of a claim for duress under Texas law. The Complaint largely elides over those elements. For instance, the Complaint describes facts suggesting that RWHI acted in bad faith and for motives unrelated to enforcing the Loan Agreement as a creditor. The Complaint further alleges that the Debtors were harmed by RWHI's conduct. But the Complaint does not adequately allege that RWHI \"destroy[ed] the free agency \"of the Debtors, or \"overcame the [Debtors'] free will and caused [them] to do what [they] otherwise would not have done and was not legally bound to do.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The closest Plaintiff comes is to allege that RWHI's conduct \"forced\n   <em>\n    \"\n   </em>\n   the Debtors to file bankruptcy. But the term \"forced\" does not necessarily mean to destroy the free agency or overcome the free will of another party-a very specific standard articulated in the Texas case law. The term \"forced\" may mean merely \"done or produced with effort, exertion, or pressure.\" Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1996) at 455. It is not clear from the allegations in the Complaint that RWHI destroyed the Debtors' free agency and overcame their free will-rather than simply adding to the existing pressures facing the Debtors and/or hastening the filing of their bankruptcy cases. If Plaintiff intends to replead the duress cause of action, Plaintiff should consider and address the applicable standard under Texas law and plead facts sufficient to satisfy that standard, if they exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

FMC's claim of duress does not rest upon its pre-existing financial condition as the basis for Farah and other board members having submitted to the lenders' threats.

Since FMC's pre-existing financial condition is not relevant to its cause of action for duress, [the lenders' contention] is without merit.\").

Under the\n   <em>\n    Farah\n   </em>\n   application of the rule, Defendants need only be responsible for the Debtors' preexisting financial distress if Plaintiff has alleged that the Debtors' preexisting financial condition was the reason they submitted to duress. This is not the case. The Complaint alleges that the Debtors were forced to file for bankruptcy and surrender their assets as a result of RWHI's acceleration of the loan and sweeping of the Debtors' bank accounts. Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 22-28. The Complaint does not rely on the Debtors' preexisting financial condition as a basis for the duress claim; it relies strictly on RWHI's actions that allegedly forced the Debtors into bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   But even if financial distress is a required element of duress, as\n   <em>\n    First Texas\n   </em>\n   treated it, the Complaint sufficiently alleges RWHI's responsibility for the Debtors' financial distress. The Complaint alleges that (i) RWHI accelerated the loan and demanded payment of approximately $ 3.7 million even though RWHI knew the Debtors had a cash balance of less than $ 300,000, Complaint, \u00b6 22; (ii) the Debtors were negotiating with a number of other prospective lenders, but RWHI refused to allow the Debtors the time to arrange refinancing,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8467131\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/199/291/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 23; (iii) RWHI began sweeping the Debtors' bank accounts even though RWHI knew the Debtors could not operate without such cash,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8467131\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/199/291/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24; and (iv) this forced the Debtors to file for bankruptcy and surrender their assets,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8467131\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/199/291/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-28. These allegations, accepted as true, plausibly establish that RWHI's actions resulted in financial distress to the Debtors. The Defendants argue that the Debtors were already under financial distress, and, implicitly, that RWHI's actions did not worsen the Debtors' situation or accelerate its need for bankruptcy protection. But this is a Motion to Dismiss and the Defendants' argument is essentially a factual one. The Defendants' version of the facts cannot be determined on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Protection Through the Bankruptcy Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot state a claim for duress because the Debtors always had the option to seek the protections of bankruptcy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   Throughout the period from July 26, 2017 until September 1, 2017 and beyond, the [the Debtors] had experienced counsel representing the corporations. As is clear from the filing of the Bankruptcy Cases, the [the Debtors] had the ability to seek the protection of the United States Bankruptcy Court at any time\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   MTD at 19. There are two flaws with Defendants' argument. First, the Debtors' bankruptcy forms the basis of Plaintiff's claim for duress. The Complaint alleges that RWHI improperly used the acceleration and cash sweeping provisions to force the Debtors into bankruptcy, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, and in so doing, prevented the Debtors from obtaining out-of-court financing or otherwise engaging in strategic transactions on terms more favorable than those achieved in bankruptcy,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8467131\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/199/291/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 33.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8467131\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/199/291/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28. Thus, even if Debtors' bankruptcy filing provided the Debtors some form of protection, the Complaint alleges that the Debtors nevertheless were harmed by the bankruptcy process. In other words, Plaintiff is alleging that the Debtors were worse off because the Defendants' alleged duress caused the Debtors to go through a bankruptcy process that they otherwise would not have had to go through. Texas law clearly contemplates that compelling an entity to resort to bankruptcy may itself be compensable injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Nat. Bank of El Paso v. Farah Mfg. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9947142\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/678/661/#p686\">\n    678 S.W.2d at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Economic duress ... may be evidenced by forcing a victim to choose between distasteful and costly situations, i.e., bow to duress or face bankruptcy, loss of credit rating, or loss of profits from a venture.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Second, to the extent Defendants are arguing that the Debtors could have and should have sought bankruptcy protection sooner, that issue simply cannot be determined on the pleadings. The Complaint alleges that the parties negotiated from the time RWHI declared a default to the time it began sweeping the Debtors' bank accounts-during which time RWHI continued to make purchase offers to the Debtors. Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. Without considering the facts and circumstances surrounding the parties' behavior prepetition, it would be impossible to determine whether the Debtors could have sought bankruptcy protection sooner than they did.

Plaintiff argues that this violates the specific duty in section 1.309 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code not to exercise an acceleration clause or certain other enforcement provisions unless the RWHI believed in good faith that the prospect of payment or performance was impaired. Plaintiff also argues that this violates RWHI's more general duty under section 1.304 to act in good faith when performing and enforcing the Loan Agreement. Although not express, the Complaint appears to treat this cause of action as one sounding in tort. But there is no allegation that RWHI and the Debtors had any of the relationships that Texas law recognizes as a \"special relationship\" giving rise to potential tort liability for breach of the duty of good faith. To the contrary, the Complaint alleges that the contractual relationship between the Debtors and RWHI was that of lender and borrower under the Loan Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiff is alleging a tort for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the Loan Agreement, the Motion to Dismiss will be granted with prejudice.

If the Plaintiff elects to replead this claim, he should be sure to allege all of the elements of such a claim and allege facts to support those elements.

Even if Plaintiff can prove that the Forbearance Agreements are voidable because they were procured by duress, this does nothing to void the original Loan Agreement-the valid, express agreement that governed the debtor-creditor relationship between RWHI and the Debtors.

This section provides that if an objection to a claim is made, after notice and a hearing, the court shall allow such claim, except to the\n   extent any of a list of circumstances are present.
