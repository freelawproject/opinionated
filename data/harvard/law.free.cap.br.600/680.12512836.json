Mader Law Group, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. CIVRS1307958 (the \"\n   <em>\n    California Case\n   </em>\n   \") filed in the Superior Court of California, San Bernardino County (the \"\n   <em>\n    California Court\n   </em>\n   \"). The Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs engaged Defendants to provide legal representation in a potential loan modification for property located at 1415 W. 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   St., Upland, CA 91784 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Upland Property\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The allegations in the Amended Complaint largely follow (with a few notable exceptions discussed herein) the allegations set forth in the second amended complaint (the \"\n   <em>\n    California Complaint\n   </em>\n   \") filed in the California Case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because Plaintiffs sought legal assistance with the Upland Property immediately prior to a previously-scheduled trustee sale,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the proposed loan modification would have required a very short timeline. In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants personally (individually) accepted the legal engagement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   but quickly terminated\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the representation prior to the anticipated sale, causing mental anguish and other financial harm to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs sought stay relief in this Court to continue litigation of the California Case against both Defendants, which this Court granted (the \"\n   <em>\n    Stay Relief Orders\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Stay Relief Orders permitted Plaintiffs to prosecute the California Case through a final, non-appealable judgment, but did not permit Plaintiffs to execute upon any monetary amount awarded in a judgment, absent further order of this Court. Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), 1334(c)(2), and 1452(b), the Court also abstained\n   from liquidating any claims that Plaintiffs (as creditors in Defendants' Bankruptcy Cases) might have against Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 22, 2018, the California Court entered judgment by default in the California Case in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants (the \"\n   <em>\n    Default Judgment\n   </em>\n   \"). Amended Complaint, Exhibit C. The California Court also entered an \"Order for Factual Determinations\", which contains many legal conclusions designated as \"factual\" findings. Amended Complaint, Exhibit B. These findings are of little import to this Court's present decision, however, because the California Court vacated the Default Judgment pursuant to a Statement of Decision entered on April 12, 2018 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Statement of Decision\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The California Court's Statement of Decision vacated the Default Judgment, restricted the potential award of damages, and offered Plaintiffs two options:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   1) File an amended complaint within 30 days of April 12, 2018, and plead the amount of damages claimed in the 1st-13th and 16th-19th causes of action in the California Case, or\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   2) Within 30 days, accept the judgment as modified by the Statement of Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   If Plaintiffs chose Option 1, the Statement of Decision required Plaintiffs to serve an amended complaint and damage demand on Defendants, who then would have had the statutory period to file a responsive pleading. If Plaintiffs accepted Option 2, the Statement of Decision clarified that the modification set forth therein was based solely on the 14th/IIED cause of action and the amounts, as supported by the submitted evidence, and damages listed in the Statement of Damages, which provided a grand total judgment of $ 3,458,410.00. Pursuant to the Statement of Decision, upon entry of a new (modified) judgment (the \"\n   <em>\n    Proposed Modified Judgment\n   </em>\n   \"), Defendants were authorized to move for a new trial pursuant to applicable state law, including\n   <em>\n    Don v. Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2080165\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/131/695/\">\n    131 Cal.App.3d 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=182%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20581\">\n    182 Cal.Rptr. 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Cal. 1982).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs elected instead to take no action at all. As a result, as of the date of this Order, no final judgment has been entered liquidating any potential claim asserted by Plaintiffs in Defendants' Bankruptcy Cases. Both Plaintiffs and Defendants appealed the Statement of Decision to the Court of Appeal of California, 4th District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   All these events call into question Plaintiffs' status as creditors in Defendants' Bankruptcy Cases and, ultimately, Plaintiffs' standing to bring the Adversary Proceedings. The question of creditor status has been further muddied in these Adversary Proceedings by Plaintiffs' insistence upon repeatedly pleading allegations against Defendants likely based upon the actions of Mader Law Group, LLC (\"\n   <em>\n    MLG\n   </em>\n   \"), Defendants' prior employer and co-defendant in the California Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs relied heavily upon facts alleged in the California Complaint as\n   support for allegations in the Amended Complaint. Unfortunately, many key allegations in the Amended Complaint are inconsistent with allegations in the California Complaint. One of the most striking differences between the various iterations of Plaintiffs' allegations is the inclusion or omission of MLG as the alleged primary actor who caused Plaintiffs' injuries. This variance between the Amended Complaint and the California Complaint, when coupled with Plaintiffs' conflation of MLG (a corporate entity) with Defendants (as individual debtors), has created a morass of conflicting factual and legal allegations for the Court to sift through in determining whether summary judgment is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To avoid further confusion and properly focus the Court's inquiry upon Defendants in an individual capacity, rather than as employees or alleged agents of MLG, the Briefing Order explicitly directed Plaintiffs to submit a succinct statement (the \"\n   <em>\n    Statement\n   </em>\n   \") identifying the specific individual actions or inactions by Defendant Batcheler and Defendant Soden purportedly giving rise to a willful and malicious injury to Plaintiffs or their property. In sum, the Briefing Order directed the parties to submit all pertinent factual evidence and legal argument regarding three interrelated aspects of Plaintiffs' allegations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   1) The present status of the California Case (including any appeals), and the preclusive impact (if any) of findings, orders, or judgments entered in that case;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   2) Any additional rulings or findings from the Florida Bar Grievance Committee in connection with a bar complaint filed by Plaintiffs against Defendant Soden;\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   3) What specific actions or inactions Plaintiffs allege Defendant Batcheler and Defendant Soden performed\n   <em>\n    individually\n   </em>\n   resulting in a \"willful and malicious injury\" upon Plaintiffs or their property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties timely submitted memoranda and supporting documents (ECF No. 124, \"\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Memorandum\n   </em>\n   \" and ECF No. 125, \"\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Memorandum\n   </em>\n   \") and the Court took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After reviewing all relevant pleadings, including (but not limited to) the Amended Complaint, Converted Motion, Supplement, Response, Joint Stipulation, Reply, all supplemental briefing submitted pursuant to the Briefing Order, and all exhibits to each of these respective filings, the Court concludes that: (1) there is no genuine dispute as to the material facts relevant to Count IV and (2) both Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Two proceedings are particularly relevant\n   to this Court's analysis of collateral estoppel principles and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine: (i) the Grievance Committee proceedings (the \"\n   <em>\n    Grievance Proceedings\n   </em>\n   \") involving Defendant Soden and (ii) the California Case (including any appeals).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Grievance Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs engaged Defendants Batcheler and Soden (not MLG) to represent their legal interests with respect to the Upland Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   This allegation is belied by record evidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Plaintiffs have not submitted any conflicting proof of retention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court previously determined that Plaintiffs did not retain either Defendant individually as counsel in the Upland Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To the extent, nonetheless, that Plaintiffs could reasonably allege-despite the Court's findings in this Order-that they retained Defendant Soden to represent their interests in the Upland Action as their counsel, this Court is persuaded that further litigation initiated by Plaintiffs regarding Defendant Soden's conduct as an attorney is unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Grievance Committee's Letter Report to Defendant Soden specifically states that (i) Defendant Soden's conduct did not rise to the level of an ethical violation and (ii) no probable cause existed for further disciplinary proceedings. Adv. Proc. No. 17-1449, ECF No. 111, p. 182 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Letter Report to Plaintiff Garcia, ECF No. 111, p. 183. Plaintiffs have failed to submit any evidence of further proceedings or additional findings by the Grievance Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In order for collateral estoppel and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine to apply to the Grievance Report, the Court must find that (i) all four elements of collateral estoppel are present, and (ii) that the Grievance Report operates as final adjudication upon the merits of Plaintiffs' claims of attorney misconduct.\n   <em>\n    St. Laurent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514738\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/991/672/#p675\">\n    991 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   676 ;\n   <em>\n    Siegel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11153128\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/234/1163/#p1172\">\n    234 F.3d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The first three elements of collateral estoppel are easily satisfied. First, the issue of Soden's alleged conduct as an attorney was precisely the issue at stake in the Grievance Proceeding. Second, this issue was investigated pursuant to Florida Bar guidelines, thereby satisfying the \"actually litigated\" requirement of collateral estoppel. Third, the Grievance Committee's determination of the issue was a critical and necessary part of the decision set forth in the Grievance Reports. The fourth element, however, is problematic. It is unclear whether the standard of proof in the Grievance Proceeding was at least as stringent as the standard of proof in the Adversary Proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Rules Regulating the Florida Bar, Chapter 3 (describing grievance proceedings);\n   <em>\n    Florida Bar v. Vining\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11862680\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/707/670/#p672\">\n    707 So.2d 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 672-73 (Fla. 1998) (describing referee's consideration of evidence in disciplinary proceedings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In addition, precedential case law indicates that the Grievance Report does not\n   suffice as a final adjudication upon the merits.\n   <em>\n    Florida Bar v. Trazenfeld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9388909\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/833/734/#p738\">\n    833 So.2d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 738 (Fla. 2002) (finding res judicata did not apply to prior grievance proceeding). For these reasons, the Court concludes that collateral estoppel and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine are not automatically invoked by the mere existence of the Grievance Reports. This conclusion does not mean, however, that the Grievance Reports are of no probative value whatsoever to this Court's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Grievance Reports unequivocally state that the Grievance Committee found no probable cause for further disciplinary proceedings. Based upon this finding, combined with (a) Plaintiffs' failure to provide further findings by the Grievance Committee and (b) the absence of factual allegations in the Adversary Proceedings that are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   predicated upon theories of alter ego, the Court concludes that no material facts exist to support Plaintiffs' claims of attorney malfeasance as to Defendant Soden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Court is mindful that The Florida Bar functions as an arm of the Florida Supreme Court in making determinations regarding attorney discipline.\n   <em>\n    Jilani v.

The record reflects that all charges for obligations payable by Plaintiffs to MLG were reversed and Plaintiffs retained ownership of the Upland Property.

The Joint Stipulation acknowledges that Plaintiffs received the loan modification that they originally sought, and they still reside in the Upland Property. Joint Stipulation \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.

No exhibits are attached to Plaintiffs' Memorandum. Plaintiffs filed approximately 800 pages of documents as exhibits to the Response, many of which appear to have been previously filed as exhibits in another proceeding. The Court's review of the entire record indicates that many of the improper citations in Plaintiffs' Memorandum are likely citations to these other exhibits.
