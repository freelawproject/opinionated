(\"Motion,\" ECF Doc. # 54.) Bressler's counsel opposes the Motion, arguing that Carbon's time to object to discharge, or to seek an extension of time to do so, already expired. The Motion charges that Bressler's counsel orally agreed before the deadline expired to extend Carbon's time to object to a discharge, but Bressler's counsel never signed and returned a stipulation extending Carbon's time. Bressler's counsel unapologetically admits that he agreed but says that Carbon's counsel failed to follow-up and get a stipulation signed before the time expired. Therefore, Bressler's counsel argues that the Court cannot grant the requested relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   It is important to note that the Chapter 7 Trustee's time to object to Bressler's discharge under section 727(c) was extended by Stipulation and Order entered on March 6, 2019 (ECF Doc. # 78) to and including May 15, 2019, and therefore has not expired. The Chapter 7 Trustee has continued investigating whether to seek to deny Bressler's discharge, and indeed Carbon's counsel is cooperating with the Chapter 7 Trustee and his counsel in that investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court needs to address the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (1) Under the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules, has Carbon's time to object to Bressler's discharge, or to obtain an extension of time to do so, expired?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (2) Assuming the time has expired, does the Court have the authority to extend Carbon's time to object to Bressler's discharge on any equitable grounds?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (3) Assuming that Carbon's time to object to discharge has expired, under what circumstances, if any, may Carbon still object to Bressler's discharge?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The answer to the first question is clearly stated in the Code-the deadline to object to a discharge is 60 days after the\n   <em>\n    first date set\n   </em>\n   for the meeting of creditors under section 341, and any extension of the deadline to object to discharge must be sought from the Court before that deadline, or any already extended deadline, expires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The answer to the second question is that because any extension of the deadline to object to discharge must be sought from the Court before the deadline expires, a verbal agreement between counsel without a timely application to the Court before the deadline expires, cannot provide a basis to extend the deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The answer to the third question can be found in Bankruptcy Rule 4004(b)(2), which permits a motion to extend the time to object to discharge after the time for objection has expired if \"(A) the objection is based on facts that ... would provide a basis for revocation [of a discharge] under \u00a7 727(d) of the Code, and (B) the movant did not have knowledge of those facts in time to permit an objection.\" FED. R. BANKR. P. 4004(b)(2). Carbon's Motion is not based on that rule and whether Carbon will be able to satisfy the high threshold set in the rule is unknown at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For the reasons explained below, Carbon's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Bressler filed his Chapter 7 petition on October 12, 2018. (\"Petition,\" ECF Doc. # 1.) Before Bressler's bankruptcy filing, Carbon filed a civil suit against Bressler in the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, in an action styled,\n   <em>\n    Carbon Investment Partners, LLC, et al. v. Lee A. Bressler\n   </em>\n   , Case No. CJ-2018-1211. (ECF Doc. # 14-3.) The civil suit alleges that Bressler committed fraud and breached his fiduciary duty by making unauthorized trades while working as Carbon's Chief Investment Officer and portfolio manager. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 99-111) The trades allegedly resulted in the complete loss of an investment fund and \"massive\" losses to investors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Arbitration Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 30, 2018, Carbon filed an arbitration proceeding against Bressler asserting the same claims as those in the district court action. (ECF Doc # 14-4.) On December 7, 2018, this Court entered an order modifying the automatic stay \"to permit the AAA Arbitration to proceed until such time as a written award is rendered which decides its outcome[.]\" (ECF Doc. # 38, at 1.) The hearing on the merits in the arbitration was conducted March 18 through March 22, 2019. (ECF Doc. # 102-1, at 1.) The arbitrator issued a final award on April 30, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) The final award sustains Carbon's claims, finding by clear and convincing evidence that Bressler breached his fiduciary duties to Carbon and committed actionable fraud in his dealings with Carbon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Those findings are supported by evidence that Bressler opened secret accounts to conceal unauthorized trades, secured by Carbon's funds, and that the unauthorized trades exceeded Carbon's total assets under management by up to 3,000%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-16.) When the trades proved unsuccessful, not only did they wipe out the fund, but resulted in a multi-million-dollar deficiency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The arbitrator's award describes Bressler's conduct as \"willful [and] without remorse[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) The arbitrator awarded Carbon approximately $ 16.8 million, including approximately $ 12.7 million in compensatory damages and $ 2.5 million in punitive damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) The arbitration award has not yet been confirmed by any court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The 341 Meeting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Carbon filed the Motion to extend its time to object to Bressler's discharge on February 4, 2019, prior to the decision in the arbitration proceeding. (ECF Doc. # 54.) Carbon seeks to extend the time to object until May 15, 2019 (the current deadline for the Chapter 7 Trustee to object to a discharge) to file (a) an objection to the dischargeability of Carbon's debt owed by Bressler under section 523(c) and Bankruptcy Rule 4007 and (b) an objection to Bressler's discharge under section 727 and Bankruptcy Rule 4004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The date of Bressler's section 341 meeting (the \"341 Meeting\") determines Carbon's deadline to object to a discharge, or to obtain an extension of time to do so. The Clerk of the Court initially scheduled the 341 Meeting for November 16, 2018. A Notice of the 341 Meeting reflects this date. (\"Notice,\" ECF Doc. # 4 \u00b6 7.) The Notice also set the deadline to object to discharge as January 15, 2019. (Id. \u00b6 9.) The Notice was mailed to Carbon via first class mail at 316 N.W. 61\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   St., Oklahoma City, OK 73118-7418 on October 17, 2018. (ECF Doc. # 6, at 3.) Carbon does not deny receiving this Notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 14, 2018, the 341 Meeting was adjourned to December 7, 2018. (ECF Doc. # 26.) According to Bressler's counsel, \"[t]he Trustee convened the 341 Meeting on December 7, 2018, which [Carbon's] bankruptcy counsel attended and actively participated in, by questioning [Bressler] regarding certain of his financial affairs, some of which questions related to the pending arbitration proceeding [Carbon] had commenced prior to the [Petition] and which [Carbon] had obtained stay relief to prosecute.\" (ECF Doc. # 62 \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The following is a summary of the important dates in this Case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 October 12, 2018-Bressler files Petition\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 November 16, 2018-first date set for 341 Meeting\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 December 7, 2018-adjourned date for 341 Meeting\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 January 15, 2019-deadline to object to discharge as reflected in the Notice\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 February 4, 2019-filing of Motion to extend the deadline to object\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 February 5, 2019-60 days after the 341 Meeting was actually held.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Carbon argues that its deadline to object to Bressler's discharge was February 5, 2019, 60 days after the 341 Meeting was actually held, rather than January 15, 2019, 60 days after the first date set for the 341 Meeting. If Carbon is correct, its February 4, 2019 filing of the Motion was timely. If the 60-day period for objecting to a discharge is calculated from the date the 341 Meeting was initially set, the Motion is untimely. As the Court concludes below, unfortunately for Carbon, the deadline to object to discharge, or to obtain an extension to do so, must be calculated from the first date set for the 341 Meeting, even if the date of the meeting is adjourned to a later date. Carbon's time to object therefore expired on January 15, 2019, so its Motion is untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Carbon's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Carbon's counsel argues that there is a split of authority whether the deadline to file a complaint objecting to discharge expires 60 days after the first date set for the 341 Meeting, or 60 days after the meeting actually takes place. (Motion \u00b6 6.) Carbon acknowledges that a majority of courts interpret the deadline to be the earlier of the two dates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Carbon nonetheless urges the Court to adopt the minority position, so that it may now file a complaint objecting to discharge. Carbon references its \"good faith\" reliance on an alleged oral agreement with Bressler's counsel as an additional reason for extending the deadline to a later date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Bressler's Objection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Bressler's counsel acknowledges that he agreed to stipulate to extend the deadline to object to discharge before the deadline expired, but argues that Carbon had the burden to either \"obtain the stipulation\" or timely move for an extension, both of which it failed to do. (ECF Doc. # 62 \u00b6 21.) Bressler's counsel argues that the Bankruptcy Rules require Carbon to obtain\n   an extension of time within 60 days of the first date for which the 341 Meeting was scheduled, which was not done, and that he never agreed to stipulate to an extension after the 60-day period expired. Therefore, Bressler's counsel urges the Court to deny the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Carbon's Reply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Carbon's counsel's reply holds steadfast to its position that the deadline to file objections is 60 days after the meeting of creditors is actually held, rather than the date it was first scheduled. (\"Reply,\" ECF Doc. # 65 \u00b6\u00b6 5-10.) Counsel also advances three other arguments: first, that counsel for Carbon and Bressler entered into an oral agreement to extend the deadline that is binding and enforceable (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-19); second, that Bressler is now equitably estopped from arguing for a different deadline (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-27); and, third, that this Court has the power to equitably toll the deadline due to misconduct by Bressler (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Under section 523(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor is discharged from debts-even debts based on fraud, false representations, defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, or willful and malicious injury (all providing a basis to deny a discharge under section 523(a) )-unless a creditor requests that such debts be excepted from the discharge.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Objections to discharge must be brought in an adversary proceeding. FED. R. BANKR. P. 7001(6). The deadline to file an adversary proceeding seeking to deny a discharge is found in Bankruptcy Rule 4007. Rule 4007 provides that \"a complaint to determine the dischargeability of a debt under \u00a7 523(c) shall be filed no later than 60 days after\n   <em>\n    the first date set\n   </em>\n   for the meeting of creditors under \u00a7 341(a).\" FED. R. BANKR. P. 4007(c) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A creditor may object to a discharge for particular debts under section 523, or the creditor may object to a debtor's discharge more broadly. Section 727 contains numerous reasons for denial of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   discharge of debts.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Objections under section 727 also require an adversary complaint that \"shall be filed no later than 60 days after\n   <em>\n    the first date set\n   </em>\n   for the meeting of creditors under \u00a7 341(a).\" FED. R. BANKR. P. 4004(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Bankruptcy Rules 4004(b) and 4007(c) permit a party in interest, including a creditor, a Chapter 7 trustee or the U.S. Trustee, to seek an extension of time to object to a discharge based on sections 523 or 727, by filing a motion seeking such relief, or more frequently by stipulation between the debtor and the parties seeking the extension, so long as the court either grants the motion or approves the stipulation. But the motion or stipulation must \"be filed before the time [to file a complaint under \u00a7 523(c) and \u00a7 727 ] has expired.\" FED. R. BANKR. P. 4004(b)(1) &amp; 4007(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Carbon's Motion to Extend the Time to Object to Discharge is Untimely\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Despite the clear language in the rules, Carbon's counsel argues that the deadline to object should not be based on the first\n   date set for the 341 Meeting, but rather the date the meeting actually took place. Carbon cites three cases where courts interpreted the rules to mean that the 60-day deadline begins to run from the date a creditors' meaning is actually held. (Motion \u00b6 8) (citing to\n   <em>\n    Peerless Insurance Co. v. Miller\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Miller\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6456994\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/182/507/#p509\">\n    182 B.R. 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 509-10 (Bankr.

Keefe\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Keefe\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6116230\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/48/717/\">\n    48 B.R. 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D.S.D. 1985) ). Carbon argues these courts found \"that it is logical for the deadline to occur after the creditors' meeting so creditors have time to file objections based on information obtained from the debtor's examination.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Carbon's position is untenable, however. The cases cited by Carbon all pre-date the 1999 amendments to the applicable rules. Before 1999, Bankruptcy Rules 4004 and 4007 provided that the deadline was \"no later than 60 days following the first date set for the meeting of creditors\n   <em>\n    held pursuant to\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 341(a).\" FED. R. BANKR. P. 4004(a) &amp; 4007(c) (amended 1999) (emphasis added). The 1999 amendments removed the phrase \"held pursuant to\" and replaced it with the word \"under.\" According to the Advisory Committee notes, the purpose of the change was to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [C]larify that ... the deadline for filing a complaint objecting to discharge under \u00a7 727(a) [and the dischargeability of a debt under \u00a7 523(c) ] is 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors,\n   <em>\n    whether or not the meeting is held on that date. The time for filing the complaint is not affected by any delay in the commencement or conclusion of the meeting of creditors\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   FED. R. BANKR. P. 4004 &amp; 4007 advisory committee's note to 1999 amendment (emphasis added). As Collier's explains, \"by deleting the word\n   <em>\n    held\n   </em>\n   ... [t]he drafters presumably opted for the absolute certainty of such a fixed date rather than a date which might change one or more times depending upon the ultimate scheduling of the creditors' meeting.\" 9 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY \u00b6 4007.04 (16th ed. 2019). Advisory Committee notes, although not binding, are highly persuasive and are afforded substantial weight in interpreting federal rules.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Horenkamp v. Van Winkle &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9181061\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/402/1129/#p1132\">\n    402 F.3d 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1132 (11th Cir. 2005) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653959\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/1180/#p1188\">\n    568 F.3d 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1188 (10th Cir. 2009) ;\n   <em>\n    Burnley v.

The changes made to Rules 4004 and 4007 and accompanying advisory notes render Carbon's interpretation unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, even if this Court were faced with the pre-amendment language, it would not come to a different conclusion. Carbon's interpretation ignores the unambiguous language of the Rules. Both Rules state the deadline is 60 days from\n   <em>\n    the first date set\n   </em>\n   . There is no other logical interpretation of this phrase than the date for which the meeting was initially scheduled. If the drafters meant something different, they easily could have omitted the phrase \"the first date set\" and it would be clear that the time frame does not begin to run until the creditors' meeting is actually held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A cannon of statutory interpretation is that every word of a statute should be given effect, if possible.\n   <em>\n    Chickasaw Nation v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108010\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/84/#p94\">\n    534 U.S. 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108010\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/84/#p94\">\n    122 S.Ct. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108010\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/84/#p94\">\n    151 L.Ed.2d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). Courts may, however, reject words as mere surplusage if inadvertently inserted or repugnant to the rest of the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108010\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/84/#p94\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While this opinion deals with the interpretation of Bankruptcy Rules rather than a statute, the same principles apply. The phrase \"the first date set\" is not surplusage. It was not inadvertently inserted as it has a distinct purpose-establishing the deadline for\n   when objections to discharge must be filed. Nor is it repugnant. The phrase does not conflict with any other section of the Code or Rules. Therefore, the phrase \"the first date set\" should be given effect, meaning the deadline to object to discharge runs from the first date ever established for the initial meeting of creditors, not when the meeting is held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In addition, the \"logical\" interpretation advanced by Carbon ignores the fact creditors may request an extension of time to file complaints. That is the remedy available when a creditors' meeting is delayed, and a creditor requires additional time to determine whether it will object to discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Datson v. Cote (In re Datson)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6450859\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/197/1/#p4\">\n    197 B.R. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4 (D.

While Carbon may feel it has been duped by Bressler's counsel, Carbon's counsel was aware that it needed to extend the deadline as far back as December 20, 2018, 26 days before the deadline expired. (ECF Doc. # 54-2). Extensions are most often resolved by stipulation and order, as appears to have been promised here. Carbon, however, could have easily filed a motion to extend its time to object to discharge. It did not do so. Say what one will about the conduct of Bressler's counsel, he did no more than protect the interests of his client. The result is that Carbon's time to object to Bressler's discharge has expired unless Carbon is able to make use of Bankruptcy Rule 4004(b)(2). Thus, as of now at least, Carbon is time-barred in seeking to deny Bressler's discharge. Of course, the Chapter 7 Trustee may still file an adversary proceeding to deny Bressler a discharge under section 727(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Carbon is not entitled to equitable relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Notwithstanding the deadline for objecting to discharge, Carbon argues equitable\n   considerations support extending its time to object to Bressler's discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, Carbon argues that Bressler's counsel agreed to extend the deadline, and that agreement should be \"binding and enforceable.\" (Reply \u00b6 11-17.) Carbon cites Second Circuit caselaw as to whether a binding agreement was reached in the context of settlement of a contract dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winston v. Mediafare Entm't Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1521605\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/777/78/\">\n    777 F.2d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1985). The problem with Carbon's argument is that while any purported settlement agreement may be binding and enforceable between the parties, extending the deadline by motion or stipulation requires approval by the Court. As the court in\n   <em>\n    Schunck v. Santos (In re Santos)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6117628\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/112/1001/\">\n    112 B.R. 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. BAP 1990) stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [A] motion to extend the bar date must be filed prior to the expiration of the bar date and\n   <em>\n    only the court may extend the deadline\n   </em>\n   . To determine otherwise would allow the parties to determine among themselves to what extent the bar date would be extended and would remove the court control over extensions which is mandated by the rules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6117628\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/112/1001/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6117628\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/112/1001/\">\n    1007-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Since only the Court has the authority to extend the deadlines, a purported stipulation, without court approval, is ineffectual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Carbon next argues Bressler is equitably estopped from opposing the Motion. (Reply \u00b6 20-27.) This argument falls short for two reasons. First, even were that true, nothing stops this Court, because of the late filing, from denying Carbon's Motion\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , even if Carbon's Motion was unopposed. Second, equitable estoppel requires reasonable reliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Higgins v. Erickson (In re Higgins)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9455572\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/270/147/#p158\">\n    270 B.R. 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.2001) (\"To equitably estop a party from interposing the defense that an action is time-barred, 'a movant must show that (1) the non-movant made a definite misrepresentation of fact, and had reason to believe that the [movant] would rely on it; and (2) the [movant] reasonably relied on that misrepresentation to his detriment.' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Buttry v.

When faced with two choices, whether to protect an approaching deadline by filing a motion to extend or let the deadline pass in reliance on an unfulfilled promise by an adversary, the reasonable path is the conservative one-to protect the deadline. This is particularly true when an extension to the deadline requires court approval. It was the responsibility of Carbon's counsel, not Bressler's counsel, to protect Carbon's right to object to a discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Other courts faced with this issue have come to the same conclusion. In\n   <em>\n    In re Santos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6117628\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/112/1001/\">\n    112 B.R. at 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court stated, \"[a] plaintiff cannot reasonably rely upon the defendants' representation that they would extend a deadline when the applicable rules clearly provide that a motion to extend the bar date must be filed prior to the expiration of the bar date and only the court may extend the deadline.\" Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Dombroff v. Greene (In re Dombroff)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6468831\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/192/615/\">\n    192 B.R. 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 1996), the court held that a debtor's alleged agreement to extend time for a trustee's filing of its objection to the debtor's discharge did not estop the debtor from asserting the time limitation against the trustee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6468831\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/192/615/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6468831\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/192/615/\">\n    at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Dombroff\n   </em>\n   court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   The trustee was obligated to determine that the court had received and approved the stipulation before he reasonably could rely on the extension it proposed.... While the trustee may have relied on [debtor's] counsel, that reliance was unreasonable as a matter of law where the trustee had over a week to determine whether the court had granted the extension or, indeed, whether the\n   stipulation in fact had been filed with the court. He failed to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6468831\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/192/615/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This Court agrees with the rationale of both cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, even if equitable estoppel is an available defense, Carbon loses on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Carbon's third, and final argument, carries the most weight. It argues that the Court should equitably toll the deadline due to Bressler's conduct or alleged misconduct. In addition to agreeing to an extension of time to object to discharge, Carbon alleges that Bressler provided vague and incomplete responses at the 341 Meeting, frivolously objected to Carbon's Rule 2004 discovery, and willfully violated multiple discovery orders in the arbitration case, including spoliation of evidence by deleting evidence from his laptop computer. (Reply \u00b6\u00b6 34-37.) Some of these allegations could support a motion under Rule 4004(b)(2) to extend Carbon's time to object to discharge, even if Bressler opposed the motion. For example, Carbon could be entitled to extend the time if Bressler withheld information about property of the estate, or the estate's entitlement to such property, facts that have been alleged by the Chapter 7 Trustee in a recently filed adversary proceeding against Bressler's wife.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) &amp; (2). In the adversary complaint filed in this Court on May 2, 2019, the Trustee alleges that Bressler was the sole holder of a Santander Bank checking account, which Bressler failed to disclose in this Bankruptcy Case, and from which Bressler transferred nearly $ 1 million to purchase property that was placed solely in the name of his wife. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP 19-01127, \u00b6\u00b6 18-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Carbon cites to four cases to support the proposition that the Rules 4004 and 4007 deadlines can be tolled due to actions by a debtor. First, in\n   <em>\n    In re Albini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%20943908\">\n    2004 WL 943908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Bankr. D. Conn. Mar. 5, 2004), a bankruptcy court reopened a petition to permit a creditor, which had been served with notice of the 341 meeting, to file a complaint objecting to the dischargeability of its debt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. This was done after the deadline to object had expired. The court reopened the case, however, because the debtor provided inadequate creditor contact information in its creditor matrix, resulting in notices being sent to a creditor's generic corporate address, instead of a more particularized address that the debtor was aware of.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The debtor also failed, in an ongoing civil case between itself and the creditor, to give notice of the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The overall tenor of the\n   <em>\n    Albini\n   </em>\n   case was that the debtor was deceitful in notifying the creditor of the ongoing bankruptcy case and consciously attempted to promote inaction by the creditor.

D. Kan. Aug. 3, 2004), a bankruptcy court denied a debtor's motion to dismiss an adversary complaint that was filed by a bank after the time to object to discharge had expired. The debtor in that case personally guaranteed loans made to a company in which the debtor was the\n   majority shareholder and president. The loans were secured by inventory of the company, including fertilizer and chemicals. After the debtor filed its petition, however, the bank learned the collateral was mislabeled, watered down, contaminated, and worth only a fraction of what was represented to it by the company and debtor. The bank alleged in its adversary complaint that the debtor fraudulently caused the value of the inventory to be overstated to the bank, resulting in the bank extending credit to the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The court in that case did not toll the deadline but denied the motion to dismiss the late adversary complaint, and stated that if the bank's allegations were true and absent any evidence that the bank should have discovered the fraud sooner, the bank's delay in commencing the adversary proceeding should be excused.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   A third case,\n   <em>\n    DeAngelis v.

In contrast, Carbon was aware of Bressler's alleged fraud and fiduciary breaches and had commenced both a district court action and an arbitration proceeding prior to Bressler filing his bankruptcy petition. While Carbon also alludes to discovery violations by Bressler in the arbitration proceeding that occurred post-deadline (ECF Doc. # 85-2), Carbon fails to explain how Bressler's recalcitrance forms an independent basis for a denial of discharge under section 523(a) or 727, and it has not so far sought relief under Bankruptcy Rule 4004(b)(2). If Carbon believes that recently discovered facts support an extension of time to object to discharge under Bankruptcy Rule 4004(b)(2), it will need to file a motion seeking such relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Maughan\n   </em>\n   , the circuit court acknowledges certain situations where a creditor may have insufficient information to file a complaint, but, respectfully, the Court believes it dismisses too quickly the fact that courts can grant creditors additional time, if asked. \"[E]quitable tolling is a remedy reserved for extraordinary or exceptional circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Federal courts have exercised this doctrine where the movant had been misled or where evidence had been fraudulently concealed but have not been so generous where one does not act diligently in protecting his legal rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State of New York v.

Here, Carbon was aware of the deadline but failed to file a motion to extend its time to object. The applicable rules are clear.

The Panel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   [W]e believe that the plain language of these rules precludes the application of the doctrine of equitable tolling. The essence of the doctrine of equitable tolling is that a limitations period does not run against a plaintiff who is unaware of his cause of action and the doctrine is invoked when the defendant conceals or makes it impossible for the plaintiff to discover the facts underlying his cause of action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    In re Santos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6117628\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/112/1001/\">\n    112 B.R. at 1006-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). The Panel referenced the underlying purposes of the Bankruptcy Rules-the fresh start, prompt administration, finality and certainty of relief-as reasons to reject the doctrine. The Panel was concerned that applying equitable tolling would significantly impair those purposes because creditors could attempt to object to discharge years after the time to file a complaint expired, and that the better approach is for bankruptcy courts to liberally grant timely filed requests for extensions to the bar date.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6117628\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/112/1001/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court agrees that extensions should be granted liberally. However, the requests need to be timely made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the Court concludes Carbon's Motion to extend the deadline to object to Bressler's discharge of its debt is untimely and that equity does not compel the Court to permit a late filing.

NYSB Local Bankruptcy Rule 9006-2. Therefore, the motion to extend time may be filed before the deadline expires even though the Court does not rule on the motion until after the time expires.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Local Bankruptcy Rule 9006-2, discussed\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    n.1., extending a deadline if the motion is filed before the deadline expires, was added to the Local Rules in 2013, \"as an exercise of the Court's discretion to extend time under Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b) and to obviate the need for a 'bridge order' in certain circumstances.\" NYSB Local Bankruptcy Rule 9006-1, Comment. Therefore, the statement in\n    <em>\n     Dombroff\n    </em>\n    that the extension had to be granted before the expiration of the deadline is no longer correct if the motion to extend the deadline is filed before the deadline expires.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <em>\n     Rychalsky\n    </em>\n    was decided prior to the 2011 amendment to Rule 4004, which added the previously discussed subdivision (b).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.
