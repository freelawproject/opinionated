POSLUSNY, JR., U.S. Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court is the motion (the \"Motion\") filed by Zhi Chen (\"Chen\") and Henghe North American, Inc. (collectively, the \"Defendants\") for reconsideration of its previous motion to dismiss the complaint (\"Complaint\") filed by the foreign liquidators of Zhejiang Topoint Photovoltaic Co., Ltd. (\"Topoint\"). Although filed as a motion for reconsideration, the grounds for relief cited in the Motion are entirely new. The Motion argues this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Chapter 15 case, and therefore, the adversary proceeding, because the liquidation proceeding in China (\"Foreign Main Proceeding\") has concluded. As such, the Court treats this as a motion to dismiss the Chapter 15 case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. For the reasons discussed below, the Motion is Denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Topoint filed a Chapter 15 petition for recognition of the Foreign Main Proceeding on July 16, 2014. Case No, 14-24549 (the \"Main Case\") Dkt. No. 1. This Court issued an order recognizing the Foreign Main Proceeding on August 12, 2014 (the \"Recognition Order\"). Main Case Dkt. No. 37. Two years later, Topoint filed the Complaint against the Defendants for conversion, turnover, unjust enrichment, as well as a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Chen only, Dkt. No. 1. The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the Complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, or in the alternative, that the Court should abstain from exercising its jurisdiction. Dkt. No. 4. The Court issued an opinion and order (\"Previous Decision\") which granted the motion to dismiss, in part, and denied it, in part. Dkt. Nos. 20 and 21. Specifically, the Court denied the motion to dismiss as to the claim for unjust enrichment, but dismissed the claims for turnover, conversion and breach of fiduciary for failure to state a claim but allowed Topoint twenty-one days to file an amended complaint as to the claims for conversion and breach of fiduciary duty. The Defendants then filed this Motion. Dkt. No. 24.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Motion states that the Defendants have received new evidence that the Foreign Main Proceeding concluded on October 14, 2014, and is now closed. Dkt. No. 24. Attached to the Motion is a certification by Chen, with translated documents from the court in China including a copy of Topoint's plan of reorganization (\"Plan\"), as well as a copy of the order approving the Plan.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . According to Chen's translation, these documents show that Topoint's reorganization was concluded by order of the Foreign Court.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, the\n   Motion states that the implementation and supervisory periods for the Plan have expired and that the foreign administrator has been discharged and his term complete.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 10. The Motion further states that in 2016, Topoint was dissolved, and a new \"Topoint\" emerged, with a new corporate form, representatives and shareholders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Each of these allegations is alleged either directly in the certification submitted by Chen or in his translation of the court documents attached to the Motion. Because of these changes, the Defendants argue that this Court now lacks subject matter jurisdiction and that Topoint lacks the standing to bring the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Topoint filed opposition (the \"Opposition\") arguing that the Motion fails to meet the standards under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9023 and that the Court still has subject matter jurisdiction given the status of the Foreign Main Proceeding. Dkt. No. 30. Attached to the Opposition is a stamped certification (the \"Certification\"), purportedly from the court in China dated January 16, 2018, translated by Shanghai Lawtone Trans Co., Ltd.; and a certification by Jiangang Ou (\"Ou\"), stating that he is the authorized signatory for the foreign representative of Topoint.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The translated Certification states that \"Topoint was ... authorized ... by this Court to pursue ... 'overseas assets' ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Further that the disposition of recovered assets was still subject to the Foreign Court's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The Ou certification states that these orders are still in full force and effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Defendants' reply reiterates the arguments presented in the Motion and includes additional arguments that the Certification presented by Topoint is improper under Federal Rule of Evidence 804 and New Jersey Rule of Evidence 902 ; and may have been procured on an\n   <em>\n    ex\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    parte\n   </em>\n   basis. Additionally, the Defendants' reply argues that Topoint has failed to provide this Court with updates related to the Foreign Main Proceeding and should be dismissed under the public policy exception of section 1506 of the Bankruptcy Code. Finally, the reply argues that adjudication of this case would not sufficiently protect the interest of creditors in the United States as required by section 1521 of the Bankruptcy Code. Dkt. No. 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At a hearing on February 20, 2018 (\"February Hearing\"), the Court determined that although couched as a motion for reconsideration, the Motion should be considered as a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    February Hrg.\n   </em>\n   at 3:20. The Court further determined that evidence and witness testimony would be required instead of competing certifications and scheduled an evidentiary hearing for August 8, 2018 (\"August Hearing\").\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . At the August Hearing however, Topoint's witness was not present and the Court granted a motion to adjourn. Additionally, the Court discussed with the parties alternative options it was considering under section 1525 of the Bankruptcy Code to determine the status of the Foreign Main Proceeding.\n   <em>\n    August Hrg.\n   </em>\n   at 10:23. These options were to either communicate directly with the court in China handling the Foreign Main Proceeding (the \"Foreign Court\") by sending a letter inquiring into the status of the Foreign Main Proceeding, or to have the parties seek clarification of the Foreign Main Proceeding's status via filing motions before the Foreign Court.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The Court explained it was considering these options due to the conflicting certifications submitted by the parties, the likelihood that testimony would not be helpful to determining the Motion and the questions surrounding the admissibility of some of the documents submitted to the Court.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The Court also felt this action was necessary because\n   many of the documents submitted by the parties required translation from Mandarin to English. The Court allowed the parties time to confer regarding the of filing joint or individual motions in the Foreign Court and to file any responses they may have to the Court communicating directly with the Foreign Court. Dkt. No. 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Topoint consented to the Court's communication with the Foreign Court, Dkt. No. 39. The Defendants also consented and further stated that \"Defendants will not be participating in any extra-territorial motion practice, as Defendants have no objection to, and indeed prefer, that Your Honor initiate contact pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201525\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), in lieu of motions being filed in China ....\" Dkt. No. 40. However, the Defendants objected to the Plaintiff's request to \"provide input regarding the wording of communications among courts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201525\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201525\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Additionally, the Defendants noted that the Court may not have the authority to contact the Foreign Court, as Article 23 of the Civil Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China (\"Article 23\") requires any requests for judicial assistance to be through diplomatic channels. Specifically, the law provides that no foreign organization or individual may \"serve documents or make investigations and collect evidence within the territory of... China.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201525\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201525\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court found it did have authority to contact the Foreign Court pursuant to section 1525 of the Bankruptcy Code and permitted both parties input before sending a letter (\"Letter\"), written in English with a Mandarin translation, to the Foreign Court. Dkt. Nos. 53 and 60. As further discussed below, the Letter inquired as to the current status of the Foreign Main Proceeding and the entity, Topoint, Dkt. No. 60. The Foreign Court replied with a letter (\"Reply Letter\"), stating that although the case was closed, it was still supervising Topoint's execution of the Plan. Dkt. No. 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court published the Reply Letter on the Docket on February 19, 2019 and allowed the parties until March 12 to review and file any further responses. Topoint filed a response on March 12, arguing that the Reply Letter established that this Court continues to have jurisdiction. Dkt. No. 63. The Defendants filed a late response on March 20, which response attempted to introduce another order purportedly from the Foreign Court. Dkt. No. 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The following constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Motion argues the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Main Case because the Foreign Main Proceeding is now closed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. No. 24. Although the Motion was filed in the adversary proceeding it in fact challenges the Court's jurisdiction over the Main Case. The Court must consider the Motion in that light. To grant the Motion on the grounds alleged requires the Court to find that there is no active foreign proceeding, and that the Recognition Order must be terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Congress enacted\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   pursuant to Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution. Section 1334 is the sole source of subject matter jurisdiction in bankruptcy. Subsection (a) grants to the district courts \"original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title 11,\" and subsection (b) grants to the district courts \"original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b).

The Recognition Order recognized the Foreign Main Proceeding as qualifying under section 101(23).

However, a court's supervision and control does not necessarily require a court's active involvement in the case, but instead may be satisfied if parties have recourse to the courts in determining any questions that arise out of the winding up of a company, or the court's authority to review to the actions of liquidators.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Betcorp Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3319409\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/400/266/#p284\">\n    400 B.R. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 284 (Bankr.

The Reply Letter states that despite the Foreign Main Proceeding being \"closed,\" the Foreign Court is still overseeing matters. This is similar to many chapter 11 cases in the United States. Courts often close a Chapter 11 case after confirmation of a plan, but litigation in other forums continue, distributions are made to creditors according to the plan, and the bankruptcy court retains jurisdiction over the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donaldson v.

As such, the Court finds that the Foreign Main Proceeding continues to qualify as a foreign proceeding under section 101(23) ; and that this Court still has subject matter jurisdiction over the Main Case, and therefore this adversary proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 157(b)(2)(P).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Remaining Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As noted, the Defendants filed a late response which attached an Order from the Foreign Court stating that \"civil actions related to the debtor can only be filed with the [court that accepts the bankruptcy petition].\" Dkt. No. 64. The translation of that order from Mandarin to English was also attached (\"Translated Order\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   However, even if the Court were to consider the late response, it would not alter the Court's decision for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   To begin, the Translated Order requiring all actions involving a debtor be filed in the court handling its liquidation is not an uncommon provision in liquidation law, but usually does not apply to actions involving overseas assets. For example, section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code, requires any actions against a debtor be brought in the bankruptcy court where the debtor filed its petition.\n   <em>\n    In re Abreu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4040473\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/570/#p578\">\n    527 B.R. 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 578-79 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2015). However, this does not apply to certain actions which are required to be brought in other courts, particularly those brought by the Debtor, in an attempt to recover assets held in foreign countries.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Abreu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4040473\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/570/#p578\">\n    527 B.R. at 578-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( Section 362 does not address actions brought by the debtor which would inure to the benefit of the bankruptcy estate.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Additionally, Chapter 15 seeks to accomplish the primary goals of an ancillary proceeding through a legal regime that reconciles three related concepts: \"recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings;\n   <em>\n    access to judicial proceedings in the United States by duly appointed foreign representatives of foreign proceedings\n   </em>\n   ; and availability of specified relief upon recognition\n   of the foreign proceeding.\" 8 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 1501.01 (16th ed. 2018) (emphasis added). Thus, to adopt the Defendants' argument, would be to nullify one of the primary goals of Chapter 15. The Court does not read the Translated Order as stating that the foreign representatives cannot bring any actions in foreign countries, as this could cripple the effectiveness of recognizing any Chapter 15 cases from China.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Moreover, although the Defendants' reply states that \"Defendants have only recently been provided with the information,\" the Translated Order is dated June 25, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   More importantly, this Court's correspondence with the Foreign Court was after the Translated Order was entered and nothing in the Reply Letter indicates that the adversary proceeding was brought improperly. The Reply Letter states that the Foreign Court is aware that there was a proceeding before this Court to recover assets, and that any funds recovered from such action would be distributed to creditors of Topoint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4040473\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/570/#p578\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4040473\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/527/570/#p578\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Therefore, the Court finds the Translated Order does not apply to this proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Lastly, Topoint's Plan, as translated and submitted to this Court by the Defendants, contemplates actions in foreign countries to recover assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 24. As translated by Chen the Plan states that Topoint is responsible for the recovery and distribution of overseas assets and that \"Topoint shall actively advance the recovery of the oversea (sic) assets and report the progress to court.\" Dkt. No. 24 at 17. This indicates that the Foreign Court contemplated actions in other countries, that Topoint was responsible for bringing such actions, and that the Foreign Court would be receiving reports on the progress of such actions. Thus, the Court is not persuaded by the Defendants' argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As to the Defendants' remaining arguments, the Court finds, based upon the Reply Letter, that granting Topoint relief and permitting the adversary proceeding to continue will sufficiently protect the interest of creditors, including those located in the United States; and that any assets collected through this adversary proceeding will be distributed to the creditors of Topoint. The Court finds that \"Topoint\" has standing to bring these actions, based upon the certifications submitted to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, the Court finds the Defendants failed to establish any basis to revisit the Recognition Order based on the public policy exception of section 1506 of the Bankruptcy Code. In fact, Topoint's actions appear to be consistent with the United States public policy of maximizing assets for distribution to creditors, and not manifestly contrary to public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
