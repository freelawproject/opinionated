Daniel L. Hartnett appeared for Iowa-Nebraska State Bank (\"Bank\"). Wil Forker appeared for Donald Lieber (\"Debtor\"). The parties submitted briefs regarding this Motion. This is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Debtor defaulted on his mortgage with Bank on his Sioux City property. Bank foreclosed. Bank was the only bidder on the property at the foreclosure sale and now holds the Sheriff's Certificate of Purchase. Upon successful completion of the foreclosure sale, Iowa Code Chapter 628 allows Debtor a one (1) year redemption period. The redemption period was set to expire on July 12, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Debtor filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on June 5, 2018. Bank then filed this motion, arguing that the automatic stay of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   does not toll the one-year redemption period. Bank urges the Court to issue a declaration that the chapter 13 filing does not toll the redemption period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While Eighth Circuit case law holds that filing for bankruptcy does not toll the redemption period, Debtor argues that changes to the Bankruptcy Code in 1994 require a different result. Bank disagrees and argues that the changes to the Bankruptcy Code essentially codify the relevant case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that the filing of a chapter 13 bankruptcy petition and the applicable \u00a7 362 automatic stay does not toll the redemption period on a mortgage foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Debtor executed a note with Bank on May 4, 2015. The note was secured by a mortgage on Debtor's property. On March 22, 2017, Bank filed a foreclosure action against Debtor after he defaulted on the note. A Decree of Foreclosure was issued on April 25, 2017. The property at issue was sold at a foreclosure sale on July 12, 2017 where Bank was the only bidder. Bank has been issued a Sherriff's Certificate of Purchase to hold during the redemption period, which allows Debtor to redeem the property within one year under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20628.3\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 628.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The redemption period was to expire on July 12, 2018. On June 5, 2018, Debtor filed a Chapter 13 petition. Debtor filed a plan that seeks to cure deficient payments to the Bank over the life of the plan. He has not attempted to redeem the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The first issue in this case deals with the interface of the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provision and the Iowa Code's real estate redemption period.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20628.3\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 628.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   states that a \"debtor may redeem real property at any time within one year from the day of the sale....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20628.3\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 628.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).

If debtor does not redeem within one year, \u00a7 626.98 requires the sheriff to execute the Sherriff's Deed in favor of the holder of the Certificate of Purchase.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20626.98\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 626.98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Debtor did not redeem the property within one year of the foreclosure sale. Debtor argues, however, that the \u00a7 362 automatic stay tolls the redemption period-effectively extending his right to redeem the property beyond the one-year statutory window. Thus, the first issue in this case is whether the \u00a7 362 automatic stay tolls the redemption period under Iowa law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 1985, this Court answered a similar question.\n   <em>\n    In re Lally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6104194\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/51/204/\">\n    51 B.R. 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. N.D. Iowa 1985). In\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   , the Court determined that the redemption period in an Iowa foreclosure action is not tolled by the \u00a7 362 automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6104194\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/51/204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lally,\n   </em>\n   the Court relied on the Eighth Circuit's decision\n   in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

This Court found that the Eighth Circuit's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was applicable in\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   because the statutory schemes between Minnesota and Iowa were \"conceptually identical.\"\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6104194\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/51/204/\">\n    51 B.R. at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The current Iowa statutory scheme is the same as it was when\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   was decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   , this Court adopted the two-part test laid out in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , which requires the Court to: (1) \" 'identify the debtors' remaining interest in mortgaged property following a foreclosure sale and determine whether that interest constitutes property of the bankruptcy estate' \" and (2) \"determine how the automatic stay of \u00a7 362(a) applies to the property interest that was part of the bankruptcy estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6104194\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/51/204/\">\n    51 B.R. at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1899242,6127708\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/719/270/\">\n    719 F.2d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 1983) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under part one of the test, the Court must identify Debtor's interest and determine whether it constitutes property of the bankruptcy estate. \"[W]hatever rights the debtor has in property when his bankruptcy petition is filed continue in bankruptcy.\"\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6104194\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/51/204/\">\n    51 B.R. at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The foreclosure sale at issue here took place on July 12, 2017. Upon completion of the foreclosure sale, Debtor held only bare legal title and a statutory right of redemption under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20628\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , both of which were set to expired in one year. To exercise his right of redemption, Debtor was required to pay the Clerk's office in the county of the foreclosure the amount owed, plus reasonable fees before July 12, 2018.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20628\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Debtor did not redeem his property before filing bankruptcy on June 5, 2018. Therefore, Debtor's only interest at the time of his June 5, 2018 petition was bare legal titled and a statutory redemption interest, both of which were set to expire on July 12, 2018. In this instance, \" 'it is only the right of redemption, rather than the property itself, which passes into the bankruptcy estate if the redemption period has not expired at the time the bankruptcy petition is filed.' \"\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6104194\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/51/204/\">\n    51 B.R. at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1899242,6127708\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/719/270/\">\n    719 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   276 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under part two of the analysis, the Court must determine how the automatic stay of \u00a7 362(a) applies to that property interest. Section 362(a) prohibits the \"commencement or continuation... of a judicial, administrative, or other proceeding... against property of the estate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). The key phrase of \u00a7 362 is \"property of the estate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). As determined in step one, Debtor possessed only the bare legal right of redemption and had no equitable interest in the foreclosed property when he filed bankruptcy. Since Debtor possessed no equitable interest in the property, his right to the possessory interest in the property itself is not protected by the automatic stay. Thus, at the expiration of the redemption period, the action of granting a Sheriff's Deed to the Bank \"do[es] not affect\n   <strong>\n    property of the estate\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6104194\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/51/204/\">\n    51 B.R. at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). As such, the action would not violate the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Eighth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   addressed a similar tolling argument and ultimately held that \"the automatic stay could not be used to enlarge that property right created by state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6104194\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/51/204/\">\n    51 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   206 (citing\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1899242,6127708\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/719/270/\">\n    719 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   276 ). The same conclusion applies here. If this Court were to toll redemption rights upon a filing of bankruptcy, it would impermissibly enlarge state property rights beyond\n   the statutory period granted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20628\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Debtor does not directly dispute the conclusion this Court reached in\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   , but rather argues that the addition of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 gives him a separate right to cure the default on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00a7 1322(c) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2) and applicable nonbankruptcy law-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) a\n   <strong>\n    default\n   </strong>\n   with respect to, or that gave rise to, a lien on the debtor's principal residence\n   <strong>\n    may be cured\n   </strong>\n   under paragraph (3) or (5) of subsection (b)\n   <strong>\n    until such residence is sold at a foreclosure sale that is conducted in accordance with nonbankruptcy law\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (emphasis added). Debtor argues that the change in \u00a7 1322(c) gives him the power to \"cure\" or redeem on this mortgage debt until the sale is complete. Debtor argues the sale does not become complete until after the redemption period has expired. Therefore, Debtor argues that he had a right to cure under \u00a7 1322(c) when he filed for bankruptcy and that right was preserved beyond July 12, 2018. Debtor believes he preserved his right to cure under the language of \u00a7 1322(c)(1) because he immediately filed a plan proposing to cure the deficiency on his residence which had not yet been \"sold\" under Iowa law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Bank disagrees and argues that language now in \u00a7 1322(c)(1) essentially codified the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   . Bank contends that the language of \u00a7 1322(c) now explicitly recognizes that a debtor's ability to delay or modify the creditor's rights under bankruptcy law end at the time of the foreclosure sale. The debtor then has only the statutory redemption period under Iowa law to utilize. The Bank argues Debtor failed to redeem before the redemption period expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court first finds that the language of \u00a7 1322(c)(1) does not call\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   into question. That finding does not, however, entirely dispose of the issue. The language in \u00a7 1322(c)(1) has been interpreted as providing another right to cure, separate from a state law statutory redemption period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This issue was recently addressed at length in a well-written opinion by Bankruptcy Judge Richard D. Taylor in\n   <em>\n    In re Ausburn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338213\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/524/816/\">\n    524 B.R. 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

Section 301 will preempt conflicting state laws, and permit homeowners to present a plan to pay off their mortgage debt until the foreclosure sale actually occurs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    In re Jenkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4139611\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/422/175/#p179\">\n    422 B.R. 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179 (Bankr.E.D.Ark.2010) (citing 140 Cong.Rec.

Here, it is undisputed Debtor's equity of redemption terminated at the foreclosure sale. Debtor's statutory right is not tolled, as explained above, under the\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   test. Thus, it is no longer applicable. Debtor's only option then is to use the Bankruptcy Code's supplemental right to cure under \u00a7 1322(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   That right allows him to cure until the property is \"sold at a foreclosure sale.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).

Davis Bus. L.J. 461 (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court adopts the \"gavel rule\" and the property is considered \"sold\" on July 12, 2017-the date of the foreclosure sale. The plain meaning of the language \"sold at a foreclosure sale\" refers to a specific event and not a multi-step process.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Richter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347808\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/525/735/#p744\">\n    525 B.R. 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 744-45 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 2015) (adopting Gavel Rule).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lally\n   </em>\n   , this Court suggested debtor had only \"naked legal title\" when he filed bankruptcy near the end of his statutory redemption period.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6114643\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/38/622/#p625\">\n    38 B.R. 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 625-626 (Bankr.N.D.Iowa 1984). The Bank suggests this rule was first stated in\n   <em>\n    Conner v. Long\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4372323\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/iowa/63/295/\">\n    63 Iowa 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20N.W.%20221\">\n    19 N.W. 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223 (1884). As the Bank correctly points out, purchaser at the foreclosure sale obtains equitable title at the day of the foreclosure sale. It argues that the sale is completed at the time of the foreclosure sale because\n   the transfer of the sheriff's deed at the end of the redemption period is only a ministerial act not a necessary element to complete the sale.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20N.W.%20221\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court further notes that the provision of the Iowa Code section allowing for redemption itself contains language that could be viewed as impacting this issue. After providing a one-year statutory redemption period, \u00a7 628.3 further notes: \"Any real property redeemed by the debtor shall thereafter be free and clear from any liability for any unpaid portion of the judgment under which said real property was\n   <strong>\n    sold\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Emphasis added). This language links the time when the property was \"sold\" to the time of the foreclosure sale. Moreover, it is clear that Iowa law sets the termination of the equity of redemption and the beginning of the one-year statutory right of redemption to the date the property of the foreclosure sale.\n   <em>\n    Hawkeye Bank &amp; Trust v. Milburn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10609267\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/437/919/#p921\">\n    437 N.W.2d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 921 (Iowa 1989) ;\n   <em>\n    First Iowa State Bank v.

In this case, the sheriff's report of sale states that \"I sold\" the property on the date of the foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    WHEREFORE\n   </strong>\n   , Bank's Motion for Declaration that Redemption Period is Not Tolled and that Issuance of Sheriff's Deed Will Not Violate the Automatic Stay is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    FURTHER\n   </strong>\n   , judgment shall enter accordingly.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
