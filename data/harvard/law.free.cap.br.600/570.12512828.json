On December 13, 2018, the Court overruled Americredit's objection, and asked the parties to brief the issue of whether a chapter 13 plan modification becomes effective at the time of filing, upon the Court's approval, or at some\n   other time. Despite the Court's ruling, Americredit maintains that under res judicata, Ms. Smith cannot retroactively modify her confirmed plan to alter her contract interest rate or change the disbursing agent. Americredit further contends that the language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201329\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) does not allow Ms. Smith's proposed changes. In the alternative, Americredit proposes the date of filing as the time at which the modification would take effect if such modification were allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court approves Ms. Smith's modified plan, which is effective retroactively to the date it was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 19, 2015, Ms. Smith entered into a Motor Vehicle Retail Installment Sales Contract with Americredit Financial Services for the purchase of a 2016 Chrysler 200 for her personal use. (ECF No. 43-2 at 1 ). The amount financed was $ 31,722.98 at a 15.50% per annum interest rate. (ECF No. 43-2 at 1 ). The loan was payable in 72 monthly installments beginning on December 19, 2015. (ECF No. 43-2 at 1 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 8, 2016, Katie A. Smith filed chapter 13 bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 ). On March 2, 2016, Americredit Financial Services, Inc. filed a proof of claim in Ms. Smith's bankruptcy case, alleging a right to repayment of $ 31,445.64 based on Americredit's security interest in the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 2 at 7 ; ECF No. 63 at 2 ). At the time Americredit filed its proof of claim, Ms. Smith was current on her loan payments. (ECF No. 63 at 2 ). The Court confirmed Ms. Smith's chapter 13 Plan on April 26, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 28 ). Pursuant to the Plan, Ms. Smith was to act as the disbursing agent for Americredit's claim. Accordingly, Ms. Smith was to make payments to Americredit directly \"in accordance with [their] pre-petition contract[ ] ....\" (ECF No. 2 at 6 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Smith eventually fell behind on her payments to Americredit. (ECF No. 65 at 1 ; ECF No. 64 at 2 ). As a consequence, Americredit filed a Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay on August 16, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 43 ). Americredit alleges that at the time of its Motion, Ms. Smith had made direct payments to Americredit in the amount of $ 2,034.78 pursuant to the Plan. (ECF No. 64 at 2 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Americredit's Motion was resolved through an Agreed Order Conditioning the Automatic Stay, which the Court approved on September 14, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 47 ). Under the agreement, the parties stipulated that the total post-petition, delinquent amount owed was $ 2,253.62. (ECF No. 47 at 1 ). The agreement required that Ms. Smith complete one of the following actions within 14 days from the date of entry: (i) pay the entire stipulated post-petition, delinquent amount of $ 2,253.62, or (ii) file a Plan modification to include an interest rate of 6.0% on the agreed post-petition, delinquent amount owed. (ECF No. 47 at 1 ). The agreement further required that Ms. Smith resume regular payments on or before October 19, 2018. (ECF No. 47 at 1 ). Whether the payments were to be made directly or through the trustee was dependent on the terms of the modified plan. (ECF No. 47 at 1 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 20, 2018, Ms. Smith filed a proposed plan modification. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 49 ). The Modification provided that the Trustee would pay Americredit Financial Services $ 2,630.43 at 6.0% interest. On October 23, 2018, Ms. Smith filed an amendment to the Modification. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50 ). The Amended Modification corrected the cure amount to reflect the stipulated amount of $ 2,253.62 found in the Agreed Order. (ECF No. 50 at 1 ). The Amended Modification, like the original Modification, also provided payment of the postpetition, delinquent amount owed\n   through the Trustee. (ECF No. 50 at 8 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Americredit did not object to the Amended Modification \"because it comported with the terms of the Agreed Order.\" (ECF No. 64 at 3 ). The Court denied the proposed Amended Modification on November 13, 2018. (November 13, 2018 Hearing at 9:32 a.m.). The Court's denial was based on a lack of explanation for the Amended Modification. (November 13, 2018 Hearing at 9:32 a.m.). Additionally, the Court noted that the proposed modification failed to reflect distribution and payment of both the original amount and the arrearage amount to be made by the Trustee as was customary when a default occurs. (November 13, 2018 Hearing at 9:32 a.m.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response to the Court's denial, Ms. Smith filed a Second Modification on November 26, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 55 ). The Second Modification provided for payment of Americredit's entire remaining claim of $ 23,772.63 at 6.0% interest over 25 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 55 at 7 ). It further provided that the Trustee would disburse all payments due. (ECF No. 55 at 17 ). On December 6, 2018, Americredit filed an Objection to Ms. Smith's Second Modification. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 59 ). The Objection alleged that Ms. Smith could not amend her Plan to reduce Americredit's contract interest rate from 15.5% to 6.0% because the parties were bound by the terms of the Plan, and because \"[n]othing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201329\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   allows [Ms. Smith] to modify a confirmed plan to change the interest rate provided for in the Plan.\" (ECF No. 59 at 2 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Americredit further argued that the Second Modification fails to provide for adequate protection as required by Bankruptcy Local Rule 4001-1(e)(6). (ECF No. 59 at 2 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court held a hearing on Ms. Smith's Second Modification on December 13, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 62 ). At the hearing, the Court overruled Americredit's objection to Ms. Smith's Second Modification. (December 13, 2018 Hearing at 9:30 a.m.). The Court found there was no res judicata issue because \u00a7 1329 allows for plan modifications at any time, so long as the Plan meets the requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (December 13, 2018 Hearing at 9:30 a.m.). However, the Court reserved ruling on whether the Second Modification was effective on the date of the filing of the proposed modification, upon approval by the Court, or on some other date. The Court requested further briefing from the parties addressing when a modification becomes effective. (December 13, 2018 Hearing at 9:32 a.m.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Parties' Subsequent Briefing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Americredit objects to Ms. Smith's Second Modification on the basis of (i) res judicata principles and (ii) statutory interpretation. In its subsequent briefing, Americredit maintains that Ms. Smith's Second Modification should not be allowed because she is bound by the terms of her confirmed Plan, which allegedly binds Ms. Smith to the contractual interest rate of 15.5% on Americredit's claim. (ECF No. 64 at 5 ). Americredit argues that under res judicata, Ms. Smith is estopped from altering both the interest rate, and the disbursing agent by the terms of her Confirmed Plan. Specifically, Americredit indicates\n   that Ms. Smith cannot modify the Plan to name the Trustee as the disbursing agent for its claim, given that the Plan required direct payment from Ms. Smith. (ECF No. 64 at 7-9 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The second prong of Americredit's argument centers on the language of \u00a7 1329. Americredit argues that the statute's language does not allow or account for Ms. Smith's Second Modification-reducing the interest rate on its claim post-confirmation. (ECF No. 64 at 10-12 ). Specifically, it claims that modifying the amount of payment as set out in \u00a7 1329 includes nothing \"more than [a change to] the monthly payment to extend or reduce the\n   <em>\n    time\n   </em>\n   the claim was paid.\" (ECF No. 64 at 11 ) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, Americredit reads \u00a7 1329 as stating that modification of a monthly payment pursuant to \u00a7 1329(a) encompasses only a reduction or extension of time, not amount. Tied to this argument is prejudice to creditors \"who cannot move to modify a plan under \u00a7 1329(a)(1).\" (ECF No. 64 at 12 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, \"Americredit acknowledges that the Southern District Local Bankruptcy Rules do contemplate ... situation[s] where the debtor may amend the plan to change from direct payments to payments through the Trustee.\" (ECF No. 64 at 13 ). Americredit, however, maintains that \"there is a distinct quid pro quo for such a change\" in the form of adequate protection. (ECF No. 64 at 13 ). Citing Bankruptcy Local Rule 4001-1(e)(6), Americredit argues that it is entitled to \"a lump sum of $ 1,400.00 at or before the time of the confirmation\" of the Second Modification proposed by Ms. Smith, given the four monthly payments she missed prior to her first proposed modification. (ECF No. 64 at 13 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ms. Smith's briefing relies on this Court's previous ruling, granting her Second Modification. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 65 ). Ms. Smith's argument also focuses on \u00a7 1329(a)'s language but adopts the opposite view of Americredit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 65 ). She indicates that not only is such post-confirmation modification allowed, but that Americredit has benefitted from the high interest rate provided for under the original Plan from February 8, 2016 to November 26, 2018. (ECF No. 65 at 2 ). Ms. Smith further contends that, because approval of modifications under \u00a7 1329 is an equitable decision, the effective date of interest is November 26, 2018-the date her Second Modification was filed. (ECF No. 65 at 2 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The District Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Its argument hinges, however, on the premise that \"the exception is a limited one-it applies only to those modifications\n   <em>\n    expressly authorized\n   </em>\n   by section 1329(a).\" (ECF No. 64 at 6 ) (citations omitted) (emphasis added). The Court agrees that a plan may only be modified in accordance with \u00a7 1329(a) but disagrees with Americredit's tortured reading. Ms. Smith's original Plan provided for payment by her to Americredit. Because she missed several direct payments, she may now modify the payments to Americredit by \"increase[ing] or reduc[ing] the amount of payments on claims of a particular class provided for by the plan\" in accordance \u00a7 1329(a)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mendoza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11916283,377711\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/1264/\">\n    111 F.3d 1264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1268 (5th Cir. 1997) (\"[B]ankruptcy courts are empowered to modify a debtor's plan to include postpetition arrearages arising from a secured loan ....\").

It follows that under the plain language of \u00a7 1329, a debtor may modify a plan post-confirmation to not only extend or reduce time for payment, but also, separately, to increase or reduce the amount of payments on a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As mentioned above, Americredit disagrees with this reading of the statute. It argues that subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) must be read together, such that the modification of a monthly payment should only encompass a reduction or extension of time. (ECF No. 64 at 11 ). Americredit provides the following example to explain its interpretation of subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2): \"[I]f a debtor proposed paying a claim over 36 months but then lost his or her job, they could use \u00a7 1329 to reduce\n   the monthly payment so as to pay the claim over 60 months ....\" (ECF No. 64 at 11 ). Americredit is correct. However, Americredit's example only accounts for a modification of the\n   <em>\n    time\n   </em>\n   required for repayment. By extending the\n   <em>\n    time\n   </em>\n   of payment over a greater number of months, Americredit's example would proportionately reduce the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of each monthly payment. Time of payment is only accounted for in subsection (a)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1329(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   While it is true that extending the amount of time for payment will inevitably reduce a debtor's monthly payment amount, the converse is not necessarily true. A debtor could \"reduce the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of payments on claims of a particular class\" without having to extend or reduce the\n   <em>\n    time\n   </em>\n   for such payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1329(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plain language of the statute provides for such effect by placing the disjunctive \"or\" between the four subsections-any one of the four alternatives listed in \u00a7 1329(a) may be used to modify a plan post-confirmation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pacifica Found.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769229\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/726/#p739\">\n    438 U.S. at 739-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769229\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/726/#p739\">\n    98 S.Ct. 3026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Canons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings, unless the context dictates otherwise ....\"). Americredit's argument-that \u00a7 1329 is meant solely to \"reduce a monthly payment to extend or reduce the time the claim [is] paid\" reads subsection (a)(1) out of the statute. (ECF No. 64 at 11 ). Accordingly, Americredit's reading of the statute would run contrary to the ordinary-meaning rule, which mandates \"that every word and provision ... be given effect (\n   <em>\n    verba cum effectu sunt accipienda\n   </em>\n   ).\"\n   <em>\n    In re Crawford\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-53097,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204089241\">\n    2016 WL 4089241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (W.D.

Specifically, Americredit argues that the confirmed plan binds all parties and precludes the modification of the disbursing agent.

In light of the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Santillan\n   </em>\n   , the modification is retroactively effective to November 26, 2018-the date the modification was filed.\n   <em>\n    Santillan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204674573\">\n    2018 WL 4674573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at * 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Both the original and the amended modification provided for the payment of the original amount to be made directly by Ms. Smith to Americredit.

Americredit argues that the quoted language \"at least infer[s] that without such a provision in the confirmation order, such a change would not be allowed.\" (ECF No. 64 at 8 ). Americredit's argument is without force. In finding that a court\n    <em>\n     could\n    </em>\n    add the quoted language into a confirmation order, the court in\n    <em>\n     Foster\n    </em>\n    did not foreclose the possibility that the change could occur without a provision in the confirmation order, nor did it make the provision a requirement for a change in disbursing agent. In any event, it is transparently obvious that the Court could mandate the change as a condition of approving a proposed modified plan.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1322(a)(1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
