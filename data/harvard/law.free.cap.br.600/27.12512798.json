The Motion is opposed by the debtor, Class A Properties Five, LLC (the \"\n   <em>\n    Debtor\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Debtor, a single-asset real estate enterprise, had previously filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy relief in this court on March 14, 2018 (Case No. 18bk07311, the \"\n   <em>\n    First Case\n   </em>\n   \"), with the apparent goal of preventing Huntley, its sole creditor, from foreclosing on the property commonly located at 7030-32 Huntley Road, Carpentersville, Illinois 60110 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Property\n   </em>\n   \").

N.D. Ill. 2011) (Goldgar, J.) (recognizing same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Having conducted that review, except as expressly set forth herein, this Memorandum Decision constitutes the court's determination of the Motion and all related filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Debtor is a single-asset real estate enterprise engaged in commercial leasing of the Property. The Property is leased to gas station tenants and is encumbered by a mortgage secured by two notes assigned to Huntley. The balance remaining on the notes constitute the debt at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On January 11, 2018, Huntley commenced a foreclosure action in state court after the Debtor defaulted on the underlying notes for the second time, having failed to cure a previous default by the expiration of the forbearance period. Huntley filed a motion for default judgment on March 9, 2018 after the Debtor failed to appear in the foreclosure action or respond to the complaint in the preceding months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 14, 2018, four days after Huntley moved for default judgment in the foreclosure action, the Debtor filed the First Case, which was assigned to the undersigned. Huntley, now mortgagee-in-possession of the Property, was the only creditor scheduled by the Debtor in the First Case. The Debtor scheduled Huntley as a secured creditor with a claim of $ 1,842,336.00 secured by the Property, which the Debtor valued at $ 5,250,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Shortly after the Debtor filed the First Case, Huntley filed a motion seeking dismissal of the First Case with prejudice or relief from the automatic stay [Case No. 18bk07311, Dkt. No. 16] (the \"\n   <em>\n    First Dismissal Motion\n   </em>\n   \"). The First Dismissal Motion asserted a variety of arguments, each of which had at its nexus that the Debtor had filed the First Case in bad faith. With the First Dismissal Motion, Huntley included a proposed order dismissing the case with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On June 20, 2018, the court held an evidentiary hearing on the First Dismissal Motion in the First Case (the \"\n   <em>\n    Evidentiary Hearing\n   </em>\n   \"). Jorge Rojas, a self-designated manager of the Property, appeared as a representative of the Debtor. At the Evidentiary Hearing, the evidence showed, amongst other things, that the Debtor had grossly exaggerated the value of the Property, had filed the First Case on the eve of foreclosure and had no ongoing business. The evidence also showed that Mr. Rojas\n   was unable or unwilling to provide even a basic accounting of the Debtor's financial affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the conclusion of the Evidentiary Hearing, the court granted Huntley relief from the automatic stay under section 362(d) after finding that the Debtor could not provide adequate protection of Huntley's interest and that, although the Property may have been necessary for the Debtor, a single-asset real estate enterprise, to reorganize, the Debtor would be unable to propose an effective reorganization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In addition, the court analyzed the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    In re Tekena USA, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129944\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/419/341/#p346\">\n    419 B.R. 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2009) (Cox, J.), and found that the majority of factors suggested that the Debtor filed the First Case in bad faith, constituting cause for dismissal pursuant to section 1112(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. The court found, amongst other things, that the Debtor would be unable to propose a feasible reorganization plan, the Debtor filed solely to enact the automatic stay, the Debtor made little to no attempt to prosecute its case, and that the First Case was essentially a two-party dispute between the Debtor and Huntley. The court also concluded that Huntley's request to dismiss the First Case with prejudice was well taken. Therefore, the court ruled in favor of Huntley and entered an order in the form of that proposed by Huntley, dismissing the First Case with prejudice. At no time did the Debtor seek reconsideration of the dismissal with prejudice nor did the Debtor file an appeal of the Dismissal Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After the First Case was dismissed, Huntley filed a motion for summary judgment in the foreclosure case, which the state court scheduled for hearing on January 8, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On January 7, 2019, the day before the state court was scheduled to hear Huntley's summary judgment request, the Debtor, employing new counsel, filed another petition for chapter 11 relief commencing the above-captioned bankruptcy case, and the case was again assigned to the undersigned. The Debtor's petition in this case is again signed by Mr. Rojas as the alleged manager of the Debtor. The Debtor also scheduled Huntley as its sole creditor with a claim of $ 1,842,336.00 secured by the Property, which the Debtor again valued at $ 5,250,000.00. Shortly thereafter, on February 4, 2019, Huntley filed the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Before the court is Huntley's Motion, wherein Huntley asserts that the Debtor is precluded from filing this case because the Dismissal Order dismissed the First Case with prejudice. Huntley further asserts that the Debtor filed the present case in bad faith under the\n   <em>\n    Tekena\n   </em>\n   factors and that there is therefore cause to dismiss this case under section 1112(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. Alternatively, Huntley asserts that there are grounds to grant Huntley relief from the automatic stay with respect to the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In response, the Debtor argues that the Dismissal Order does not preclude the Debtor from filing this case as the most reasonable interpretation of the Dismissal Order is that it did nothing more than bar the Debtor from filing another bankruptcy petition for 180 days pursuant to section 109(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtor also asserts that it did not file this case in bad faith and therefore no cause for dismissal exists under section 1112(b). Further, should this case survive dismissal, the Debtor asserts that Huntley is not entitled to relief from the stay because there is equity in the Property pursuant to a recent appraisal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Motion requires the court to answer the following: Does the Dismissal Order preclude the filing of this case? To do so, the court must determine the meaning of the dismissal \"with prejudice\" in the Dismissal Order, including whether the use of such phrase is ambiguous. If the Dismissal Order is not ambiguous and the \"with prejudice\" dismissal is prejudicial, the inquiry is at an end and the case must be dismissed. If, on the other hand, the Dismissal Order is ambiguous, the court is then tasked with utilizing its available tools to resolve the ambiguity, if possible. Once again, should the Dismissal Order be interpreted to preclude this case, the inquiry is at an end. Only if the Dismissal Order cannot be interpreted to preclude this case, either because the ambiguity cannot be resolved or because the Dismissal Order unambiguously or after any ambiguity is resolved, does not preclude this case, must the court consider whether this case should independently be dismissed for bad faith. Last, the court will evaluate whether Huntley is entitled to stay relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Does the Dismissal Order Unambiguously Preclude this Case?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To enter into the inquiry required by the Motion, the court must interpret the Dismissal Order it entered in the First Case.

In so doing, the court notes that the order in question was drafted by Huntley and presented to court as a proposed order filed with the First Dismissal Motion.

To understand this phrase, therefore, the court must look outside the confines of the Dismissal Order itself. But where to look? Those familiar with the Bankruptcy Code and dismissal of cases would understand that such dismissal with prejudice is intended as a reference to section 349 of the Bankruptcy Code. Indeed, the First Dismissal Motion requested dismissal with prejudice under section 349.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Section 349 of the Bankruptcy Code states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Unless the court, for cause, orders otherwise, the dismissal of a case under this title does not bar the discharge, in a later case under this title, of debts that were dischargeable in the case dismissed; nor does the dismissal of a case under this title\n   <em>\n    prejudice the debtor\n   </em>\n   with regard to the filing of a subsequent petition under this title, except as provided in section 109(g) of this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20349\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). Plainly stated, section 349(a) mandates that, absent an order to the contrary, dismissal of a bankruptcy case does not impair the ability of the debtor to seek future bankruptcy relief unless such impairment arises pursuant to the terms of section 109(g) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Section 349(a) has at first a gating criterion, that the court, for cause, may order otherwise.\n   <em>\n    In re Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11129319\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/258/908/#p910\">\n    258 B.R. 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910 (Bankr.

Here there is no question that the court found cause at the Evidentiary Hearing and that the court in the Dismissal Order ordered otherwise. A finding of bad faith is sufficient cause to justify a dismissal that impairs future filings under section 349.\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11359048,11401765\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/304/743/\">\n    304 F.3d at 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the court expressly found bad faith at the Evidentiary Hearing, the gating criterion is met in the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Once the initial hurdle has been overcome, there are two types of future impairment that the court may order: (1) Barring a future discharge of debts that were dischargeable in the case dismissed; or (2) Prejudicing the debtor with respect to the filing of a subsequent bankruptcy petition.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20349\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Only the second of the two types of impairment in section 349(a) speaks to prejudice. As such, a quick glance at section 349(a) would lead one to conclude that \"with prejudice\" is a reference to the bar on future filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   court noted, however, that \"the term [with prejudice] is often used somewhat loosely to refer to any type of limitation upon the opportunity for future bankruptcy relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11129319\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/258/908/#p910\">\n    258 B.R. at 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite this broad usage, the\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   court found the phrase \"with prejudice\" is most often read as the first of the two impairments noted above-barring a future discharge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11129319\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/258/908/#p910\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On appeal, the Seventh Circuit appeared to adopt the lower court's reading, defining the dismissal thereunder with prejudice as a \"bar to the dischargeability of debts that would have been dischargeable in the dismissed proceeding ... or precluding the debtor from filing a subsequent petition related to those debts.\"\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11359048,11401765\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/304/743/\">\n    304 F.3d at 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   There is, therefore, ambiguity created by the use of the phrase \"with prejudice\" without further explanation. The statute would appear to use with prejudice to mean a bar on future filings, while the case law seems to support it meaning a bar on\n   future discharge of debts or both a bar on future discharge and a bar on future filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As not all readings of the phrase \"with prejudice\" include a bar against future filings, the court cannot conclude that the Dismissal Order unambiguously precludes this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Resolving the Ambiguity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As noted above, by using the phrase \"with prejudice\" in the Dismissal Order without explanation, the Dismissal Order fails to specify whether dismissal with prejudice means a bar on future filings as implied by the statute's use of the phrase, a bar on future discharge of debts as applied by the courts, or both. Each of these results falls within the auspices of section 349(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   That ambiguity, however, is easily resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The court, as noted by the cases cited above, is in the best position to interpret its own orders and the court concludes that the Dismissal Order effectuates a bar on refiling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court's own express statements on the record of the Evidentiary Hearing support this conclusion. Further, interpreting \"with prejudice\" to mean a bar on discharge would render the phrase meaningless under the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The court has a duty to adopt the meaning that \"renders [the Dismissal Order] more reasonable, effective and conclusive in the light of the facts and the law of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Hendrie v.

As the automatic stay limitations imposed under section 362(c)(3) and (c)(4) are only applicable to individual debtors,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court noted that barring the Debtor from filing subsequent petitions was the proper measure to prohibit further bad faith filings, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [What] we would have under these circumstances is the right to immediately file and invoke the automatic stay again. [Class A Properties Five, LLC] is not an\n   individual debtor, and, therefore [section 362](c)(3) and [section 362](c)(4) aren't applicable ... because of that, we'd be right back where are again, dealing with exactly the same issues again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Tr. at p. 126, June 20, 2018 [Case No. 18bk07311, Dkt.

The Debtor, as a business entity, cannot receive a discharge.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 1141(d)(3)(A). Therefore, the court's \"with prejudice\" designation could not be sensibly interpreted to bar the future discharge of the Debtor's debt in the First Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As such, the court concludes that the phrase \"with prejudice\" in the Dismissal Order was intended as a bar against future bankruptcy filings with respect to Huntley's debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Length of the Bar\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   This determination does not, rather unfortunately, end the inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Because the dismissal with prejudice was intended as a bar against future filings, a secondary question arises: How long of a bar was intended?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Debtor suggests that, as the Dismissal Order is silent as to the duration of the bar, the only fair result would be to limit the bar to 180 days as set forth in section 109(g) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The court does not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The court's remarks at the Evidentiary Hearing quoted above clearly indicate that the court intended the bar to be permanent as to this debt.

No. 58] (\"I am ... dismissing under [ section] 349(a) with prejudice, the prejudice being that the case with respect to this creditor cannot be commenced again.\"). While this may seem a harsh result, recall that the Debtor's operations are limited to the Property and the debt it seeks to address is the primary if not sole debt in the Debtor's case. Both the First Case and this case have prevented Huntley, a mortgagee-in-possession under Illinois law, from further exercising its state law remedies. Each case was commenced on the eve of Huntley obtaining relief from the state court regarding the Property. At the Evidentiary Hearing, the evidence showed that that the Debtor had grossly exaggerated the value of the Property, had filed on the eve of foreclosure and had no ongoing business. Permanent bars are clearly within the authority of the bankruptcy court under such circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Casse v.

Section 349(a) makes clear that, when dismissing a case, the power of the court to order otherwise combined with the use of \"nor\" in the statute both modifies the future discharge of debts and the future filing of bankruptcy cases. Section 349(a) can therefore be read as follows: (a) Unless the court, for cause, orders otherwise, the dismissal of a case under this title does not bar the discharge, in a later case under this title, of debts that were dischargeable in the case dismissed; and (b) Unless the court, for cause, orders otherwise, the dismissal of a case under this title prejudice the debtor with regard to the filing of a subsequent petition under this title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The reference to section 109(g) at the conclusion of section 349(a) has the clear and unambiguous effect of protecting section 109(g) from being limited by section 349(a) and not the opposite, limiting section 349(a) to the narrow scope of section 109(g).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Valentine Hill Farm LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12413236\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/580/815/#p820\">\n    580 B.R. 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 820 (Bankr.

While it appears that little has changed other than the filing of this case in violation of the bar in the Dismissal Order (a factor that would seem to be relevant to any section 1112 inquiry), the court need not reach those issues today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Relief from the Automatic Stay\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Because the court determines that this case must be dismissed, it is not necessary for the court to determine whether Huntley is entitled to modify the automatic stay as Huntley is not restrained by such stay upon the dismissal of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, the court finds that the Debtor was precluded from filing this case and therefore dismissal is required by the terms of the court's previous Dismissal Order. By separate order issued concurrently herewith, this case will be dismissed. Under the terms of the Dismissal Order, the Debtor remains\n   barred from filing another bankruptcy case with respect to Huntley's debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The matter coming on for consideration is the Motion of 7030-32 Huntley Road, LLC to Dismiss Second Chapter 11 Case, or, in the Alternative, to Modify the Automatic Stay to Permit the Foreclosure Action to Proceed and to Permit 7030-32 Huntley Road, LLC to Exercise its Non-Bankruptcy Law Rights and Remedies [Dkt.

The Debtor and its counsel participated at the Evidentiary Hearing where the request for dismissal with prejudice was before the court. Mr. Rojas was also present. Each party was fully aware of the court's stated purpose in dismissing the First Case. No appeal was filed and at no point did the Debtor request clarification or reconsideration of the Dismissal Order. The Debtor's arguments herein that it understood the Dismissal Order differently strain credulity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    While the term \"individual\" is not defined in the Bankruptcy Code, \"person\" is defined to include an individual, partnership, and corporation.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (41).
