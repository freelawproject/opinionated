The unclaimed funds were rents his chapter 7 trustee collected from Pena's rental properties before the trustee abandoned those properties. The trustee initially tried to pay the rents to the creditors holding security interests in the underlying rental properties, but the secured creditors never cashed the trustee's checks. The trustee thereafter voided the checks and deposited the funds in the court's registry in accordance with \u00a7 347(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pena claims that, because his former secured creditors are no longer entitled to the unclaimed funds, the monies should be paid to him instead. Pena argues that the trustee abandoned the rents when she abandoned the underlying rental properties. He reasons that, as a result, the estate has no interest in the funds the trustee deposited into the court's registry. We disagree. The chapter 7 trustee has administered these rents, and they remain property of the estate. As a result, ownership of the funds has never reverted to the debtor. None of Pena's other arguments on appeal have any merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the bankruptcy court's order denying Pena's application for unclaimed funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pena commenced his bankruptcy case by filing a voluntary chapter 11 petition in April 2012. At the time he filed his bankruptcy,\n   Pena owned 30 parcels of real property, 29 of which were rental properties. In June 2012, the bankruptcy court sua sponte converted the case from chapter 11 to chapter 7 because of Pena's unauthorized use of cash collateral. Trudi G. Manfredo was appointed to serve as the chapter 7 trustee. Pena appealed the conversion order first to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California and then to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. He lost both appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After conversion, Manfredo sought to abandon the rental properties. The bankruptcy court ruled, however, that during the pendency of the debtor's appeals, it lacked jurisdiction to order relief from stay or abandonment with respect to any of Pena's real property. Instead, the bankruptcy court entered an order under \u00a7 721 authorizing Manfredo to manage Pena's rental properties, including their maintenance and the collection of rents. Pursuant to that order, Manfredo managed the rental properties until Pena lost both appeals. Manfredo collected the rents from the rental properties, deposited them into the estate's account, and disbursed them in accordance with her duties as chapter 7 trustee. After the Ninth Circuit affirmed conversion of the case to chapter 7, Manfredo abandoned the rental properties and shortly thereafter ceased collection of rents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The unclaimed funds at issue represent rents Manfredo collected from rental properties throughout California. Two of the properties were located in Compton, California. The other rental properties at issue were in Visalia, Corcoran, and Tulare, California. Each property was encumbered by a deed of trust, and the rents from the properties were treated as cash collateral of the respective secured creditors while Manfredo administered the properties. Manfredo abandoned the Tulare property in July 2014, and abandoned the other properties in August 2014. During the second half of 2015, several months before the bankruptcy case was closed, Manfredo sought to pay the secured creditors a combined total of $ 51,777.03 comprised of rents collected from the properties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Manfredo's cash disbursement records reflect that she tried unsuccessfully to pay these amounts to the secured creditors several times. After those attempts failed, in February 2016, Manfredo paid the $ 51,777.03 in rent proceeds into the court registry. Manfredo's actions concerning the unclaimed funds were disclosed in her Final Account and Distribution Report (\"Final Account\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although Manfredo administered the rents on behalf of the secured creditors, the case was administered as a no asset case, and the Final Account proposed no distribution to Pena's unsecured creditors. Manfredo served the notice of the Final Account on all parties in interest, including Pena. The notice advised that if no objections were filed, a final decree would be entered and the case closed without further order. Neither Pena, nor anyone else,\n   objected to the Final Account. The bankruptcy court entered a final decree and closed Pena's bankruptcy case on December 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Well over a year after the case was closed, on March 1, 2018, Pena filed an application seeking to recover the unclaimed funds without reopening the bankruptcy case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Pena, none of the secured creditors could establish a present entitlement to the unclaimed funds because the subject properties had been foreclosed upon or Pena was current on his mortgage payments. Pena stated that he conveyed the Compton properties to a third party in September 2014. He also advised that the secured creditors of the Visalia and Corcoran properties foreclosed on these properties in 2016. Nothing in the record demonstrates what happened to the Tulare property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pena further argued that, as a result of Manfredo's abandonment of the rental properties in 2014, the rental properties - and the rents Manfredo collected - should be treated \"as if no bankruptcy case had been filed,\" in which case he would have been entitled to collect and use all rents absent any event of default under his security agreements with his secured creditors. Therefore, Pena concluded that he, and not his unsecured creditors, was entitled to the unclaimed funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Pena served the application on the secured creditors, but received no objections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Still, the bankruptcy court disagreed with Pena. According to the court, Manfredo's disbursement of the rents into the court's registry as unclaimed funds when the secured creditors failed to cash their disbursement checks was consistent with her statutory obligations under \u00a7 347.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the bankruptcy court held that, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202042\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the secured creditors had five years to claim the funds. The court noted that this time period was not close to running. If the five-year time period elapsed without the secured creditors successfully claiming the funds, the bankruptcy court opined that the funds should escheat to the United States.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202042\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   More importantly, the bankruptcy court ruled that, as between Pena and his bankruptcy estate, the bankruptcy estate was entitled to the rents. The bankruptcy court rejected Pena's assertion that the unclaimed\n   rents collected from the properties had been abandoned along with the properties in 2014, noting that rents were separate property of the estate under \u00a7 541(a)(6). The court explained that, under the distribution scheme imposed by \u00a7 726(a), it was the estate's unsecured creditors, not Pena, that were entitled to unclaimed rents if the secured creditors no longer had any entitlement to those funds. The court noted that Pena had disclosed $ 411,000 in unsecured debt that remained unpaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 29, 2018, the bankruptcy court entered an order denying Pena's application.

As part of her management of the rental properties, Manfredo transmitted the collected rents to Pena's secured creditors. After she abandoned the rental properties, Manfredo transmitted the remaining collected rents in the same manner. Pena never objected to any of Manfredo's transmittals to the secured creditors. In fact, he repeatedly has conceded in his appeal brief that the rents Manfredo collected and successfully distributed to the secured creditors were estate property. This is consistent with \u00a7 541(a)(6), which defines property of the estate to include: \"[p]roceeds, product, offspring,\n   <strong>\n    rents\n   </strong>\n   , or profits of or from property of the estate, except such as are earnings from services performed by an individual debtor after the commencement of the case.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After the secured creditors failed to cash the unclaimed funds checks identified\n   above, Manfredo took action consistent with \u00a7 347(a) and Rule 3011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   When a creditor fails to cash a chapter 7 trustee disbursement check within 90 days of the final distribution, the trustee must stop payment on the check and pay the funds into the court registry as unclaimed funds. \u00a7 347(a); Rule 3011;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2 Collier, at 26.18[4]; Trustee's Handbook, at p. 4-33.

The Secured Creditors' Entitlement To The Rents.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Pena does not seriously dispute that Manfredo properly administered the unclaimed rents. Citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202041\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2042, he contends that the unclaimed rents now belong to him because the secured creditors no longer are the rightful owners of the unclaimed rents. Pena argues that, after the bankruptcy estate abandoned the real properties, the Compton properties were conveyed to a third party, and the Visalia and Corcoran properties were foreclosed. He argues that the secured creditors cannot prove a present entitlement to the funds, and this is why they never cashed the payments and never objected to his application for the funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As a general proposition of law Pena is correct that, if the secured creditors sought to collect the unclaimed funds\n   deposited into the registry, they must prove they have \"a 'present entitlement to the unclaimed funds sought.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3648554\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/346/557/#p559\">\n    346 B.R. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559 (Bankr.

Here, however, the secured creditors are not seeking to recover the unclaimed rents. Rather, Pena asserts that he is entitled to the unclaimed rents. Pena reasons that, since the secured creditors can no longer establish a present entitlement to these funds, state law governs and requires that the monies must be distributed to him. We need not determine what rights the secured creditors may currently have to the unclaimed rents because they remain property of the bankruptcy estate over which Pena has no interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Estate's Abandonment Of The Rental Properties Did Not Abandon Its Interest In The Collected Rents.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Pena acknowledges that the bankruptcy estate had an interest in the rents prior to abandonment of the rental properties. He contends, however, that Manfredo abandoned any interest in the rents when she abandoned the real property. Since the secured creditors can no longer prove a present entitlement to the proceeds, and the bankruptcy estate abandoned any interest it had in the unclaimed rents, Pena reasons that the funds belong to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Abandonment is the \"formal relinquishment of the property at issue from the bankruptcy estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Catalano v. C.I.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9398765,9396702\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/682/\">\n    279 F.3d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 685 (9th Cir. 2002). Abandonment of an estate asset is governed by \u00a7 554, and can occur in one of three ways: (1) the bankruptcy trustee can obtain bankruptcy court authority to abandon the asset (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 554(a)); (2) another party in interest can seek to compel the trustee to abandon the asset (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 554(b)); or (3) abandonment may occur by operation of law - also known as a \"technical abandonment\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 554(c)). No other party has sought abandonment of the rents under \u00a7 554(b). While Pena does refer to the abandonment of the unclaimed rents upon the closing of the case, he has not asserted any argument that the estate technically abandoned the unclaimed rents under \u00a7 554(c). Nor does the record provide any support for technical abandonment, as Manfredo administered the rents by paying the secured creditors she understood had rights in the cash collateral at the time she closed the bankruptcy case. This leaves abandonment under \u00a7 554(a) as the basis for Pena's interest in the unclaimed rents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Pena contends that Manfredo's abandonment of the underlying rental properties must be given nunc pro tunc effect to the petition date. He argues that, if the rental properties are deemed to have been abandoned retroactively to the bankruptcy filing, this divests the bankruptcy estate of any interest in not only the rental properties themselves, but also the rents derived from those properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As a general rule Pena is correct that \"[u]pon abandonment, the debtor's interest in the property is restored\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   as of the filing of the bankruptcy petition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Catalano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9398765,9396702\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/682/\">\n    279 F.3d at 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The purposes of retroactive vesting include to protect against the running of the statute of limitations, and to compensate the trustee for any cost he may have incurred in maintaining the property during his custody of it.\"\n   <em>\n    Morlan v.

The required notice of abandonment stated only that the estate \"intends to and will abandon the following described real properties as burdensome and inconsequential value to the estate ....\" The subsequent notices filed by Manfredo to effectuate the abandonments similarly were limited to abandonments of the rental properties. None of the notices ever mentioned the rents the estate had collected. Manfredo never sought, or gave notice of any intent, to abandon the remaining rents the estate had collected. Her actions speak loudly to a contrary intent as she was attempting to distribute the collected rents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Pena does not distinguish between the unclaimed rents and the abandoned rental properties from which they were derived. He contends that abandonment of the\n   rental properties resulted in abandonment of the rents. However, they are not the same. Section 541(a)(6) independently categorizes proceeds from property of the estate. As distinct property of the estate, a trustee must clearly state her intent to abandon such rents under \u00a7 554(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In an unpublished decision, the District Court for the Central District of California recently considered whether the abandonment of rental properties precluded the chapter 7 trustee from denying the debtors their discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(2) for improperly transferring post-petition rents.\n   <em>\n    In re Pham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%2077505\">\n    2019 WL 77505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *3-5. In\n   <em>\n    Pham\n   </em>\n   , the debtors argued that the trustee could not prove they had transferred property of the estate because the trustee had abandoned the rental properties that generated the rents. The bankruptcy court rejected the debtors' argument, noting that the notice of abandonment referred only to the rental properties and not the rents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Moreover, the bankruptcy court found it telling that the trustee had made demand on the debtors for the turnover of the missing rents, further evincing an intent not to abandon the rents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On appeal, the district court affirmed the denial of the discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(2) based on the debtor's transfer of property of the estate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The court found that the rental proceeds were separate interests distinct from the real property, and agreed that the record failed to establish any intent to abandon the rental proceeds. Explaining its reasoning, the district court noted that \"numerous courts have held that the abandonment of real property does not also abandon personal property that is related to, but separable from the real property, such as rental proceeds or insurance policies.\"\n   <em>\n    Pham,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%2077505\">\n    2019 WL 77505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pierson v.

In both cases, the trustees sought to abandon real property while attempting to administer rents from those properties. In\n   <em>\n    Pham\n   </em>\n   , the trustee was seeking turnover of the rents from the debtor. Here, Manfredo actually had collected the rents and was attempting to distribute them based on the interests as they existed at the time she closed the case. In neither situation did the trustee mention the rents within the notices of abandonment. Manfredo, like the trustee in\n   <em>\n    Pham\n   </em>\n   , did not abandon the rents she was attempting to administer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Pena focuses upon the secured creditors' present entitlement to the unclaimed rents, but the bankruptcy court did not rule on this issue. Rather, it found that Pena was not entitled to the funds. Because the unclaimed rents remain property of the bankruptcy estate, the bankruptcy court did not err in denying Pena's application to recover those funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Designation Of The Bankruptcy As A No Asset Case Is Irrelevant To The Determination Of The Property Of The Estate.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Pena also makes much of Manfredo's designation of his case as a no asset chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The designation of\n   the case as a no asset case was based on the trustee's understanding that the secured creditors held continuing security interests against the rental properties and all rents she collected that were generated by those encumbered properties. This assumption was manifested in the trustee's Final Account. No one, including Pena, objected to the trustee's proposed distribution to the secured creditors. If these lenders no longer have secured claims against the remaining rents, and those funds actually are now unencumbered, they nonetheless remain property of the estate available for distribution pursuant to the statutory scheme Congress enacted for chapter 7 cases, as set forth in \u00a7 726(a).\n   <em>\n    Viegelahn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116248\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1829/#p1835\">\n    135 S. Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1835 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elliot v. Four Seasons Props.

The fact that some additional action is required to properly administer these rents in light of Manfredo's prior Final Account does not alter the nature of the unclaimed funds as property of the estate. Rather, a party in interest such as an unsecured creditor or the United States Trustee should be afforded the opportunity to reopen the bankruptcy case, establish that the unclaimed rents are not encumbered, and modify the Final Account to permit distribution of the unclaimed rents to the unpaid creditors pursuant to \u00a7 726(a). That distribution scheme contemplates payment in full of all creditors, including interest, before the debtor can receive any distribution from the estate's assets.\n   <em>\n    Viegelahn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116248\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1829/#p1835\">\n    135 S.

The difference between these two amounts - $ 6,091.91 - roughly equals the aggregate amount of rents collected from the Tulare property that later became unclaimed funds ($ 6,091.89). Pena did not submit with his application any evidence or law pertaining to Tulare property or the $ 6,091.89. Furthermore, the certificate of service accompanying his application reflects that Pena did not attempt to serve any parties who might have claimed an interest in the Tulare property or the rents derived from that property. Pena does not mention the Tulare property in his brief on appeal either, further suggesting that he seeks to recover the unclaimed rents on the other properties but not those related to the Tulare property.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Pena also served his application on Manfredo, who did not file a response either.

But whereas the equities in\n    <em>\n     Hat\n    </em>\n    supported retroactive abandonment of the farms and crops to prevent the estate from receiving a windfall from the debtor's efforts, in this case the windfall would result if Pena was to recover the rents while his unsecured creditors receive nothing.
