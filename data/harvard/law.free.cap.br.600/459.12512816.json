First, the order considers Debtor's Request for Entry of Discharge Forthwith Pursuant to\n   Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4004(c) filed by Archie Joel Champion, III (\"Debtor\"). Second, the order addresses the timeliness of the United States Trustee's (\"UST's\") Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative to Convert the Case to Chapter 11.

The final consent order (\"Consent Order\") prepared by the UST extended \"[t]he time for the [UST] to file a complaint objecting to the entry of a discharge or to file a motion to dismiss under \u00a7 707 ... to June 11, 2018.\" Dckt.

The Rules provide the Court shall enter a debtor's discharge \"forthwith\" unless an applicable Rule 4004(c)(1) exception applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4004(c)(1). The UST and the Banks argue \"forthwith\" does not mean \"immediately,\" rather it means \"reasonable under the circumstances.\" Since the\n   Banks' and the UST's \u00a7 707(a) motions to dismiss were pending before the discharge was entered, they contend the motions delay entry of the discharge. If necessary, the UST also requests the Court use its equitable powers under \u00a7 105 and Rule 9006(b)(1) to toll the deadline set forth in the Consent Order or otherwise deem the UST's motion as timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Debtor's Request for Entry of Discharge Forthwith\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Rule 4004(c)(1) mandates: \"[i]n a chapter 7 case, on expiration of the times fixed for objecting to discharge and for filing a motion to dismiss the case under Rule 1017(e), the court shall forthwith grant the discharge, except that the court shall not grant the discharge if ... a motion to dismiss the case under \u00a7 707 is pending.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4004(c)(1)(D). Subsection (c)(1)(D) was amended in 2002 to expressly provide that a pending \u00a7 707 motion to dismiss postpones the entry of a discharge, and the Advisory Committee notes explain the amendment was added:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   to provide that the filing of a motion to dismiss under \u00a7 707 of the Bankruptcy Code postpones the entry of the discharge. Under the [pre-2002] version of the rule, only motions to dismiss brought under \u00a7 707(b) cause[d] the postponement of the discharge. This amendment would change the result in cases such as\n   <em>\n    In re Tanenbaum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"269291\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/210/182/\">\n    210 B.R. 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

The pendency of such [\u00a7 523] complaints is not a sufficient reason to delay a debtor's discharge under the rule ....

Similarly, Rule 4004(b)(2) and (c)(1)(E) contemplate a gap period where a motion to extend the time to file an objection to discharge may be filed after the time for objection has expired, but before discharge is granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   addition, Rule 9022 (a)'s use of \"forthwith\" and \"immediately\" supports \"forthwith\" being defined as \"within a reasonable time under the circumstances\" rather than instanter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Forthwith\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This case highlights the tensions between a debtor's entitlement to a prompt fresh start and ensuring only eligible debtors receive discharges. These concepts are cornerstones of the bankruptcy system. While creditors and other parties in interest must diligently protect their rights, only the honest but unfortunate debtor is entitled to a prompt discharge. The advent of electronic filing heightens this tension. The Court is aware the Case Management/Electronic Case Files (\"CM/ECF\") system may be set to enter discharges automatically; however, there still is a need for manual quality control measures to be taken \"forthwith\" to prevent the improper entry of discharges. Although improperly issued discharge orders may be revoked or vacated, they create their own difficulties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   After considering the matter, the Court concludes \"forthwith\" does not mean \"immediately.\" Rather, as stated in\n   <em>\n    In re Coggin\n   </em>\n   , it means \"as soon as practicable.\"\n   <em>\n    Coggin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6117954,10535988\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/30/1443/\">\n    30 F.3d at 1449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on this definition, given the facts and circumstances submitted in this case, the Court finds the delay from the expiration of the June 11th deadline to June 14th does not fail to comply with the \"forthwith\" requirement of Rule 4004(c)(1). Rightly or wrongly, the Rules and Code do not set a deadline to file a \u00a7 707(a) motion and the Banks' motions were filed prior to the entry of discharge and within the \"forthwith\" window. While Debtor may be correct that a \u00a7 707(a) motion to dismiss may be moot if filed after discharge is entered; in this case, the Banks' motions were filed prior to entry of the discharge and therefore the motions are not moot. For these reasons, the Court concludes, under the Rules and the Code, the Banks' \u00a7 707(a) motions to dismiss delay the entry of discharge in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The UST's Consent Order and Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Consent Order entered between Debtor and the UST provides \"[t]hat the time for the [UST] to file a complaint objecting to the entry of discharge or to file a motion to dismiss\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     under \u00a7 707\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was extended to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     June 11, 2018\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" Dckt.
