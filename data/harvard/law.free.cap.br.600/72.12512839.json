The debtors proposed to modify their confirmed plan to surrender their residence to the lender. Trustee opposed the motion as untimely, because it was filed seven months after the debtors had completed their plan payments to Trustee. The bankruptcy court held that, because the debtors had not cured their prepetition mortgage arrears as provided for in the plan, the payments under the plan were not complete; therefore, the motion to modify was timely under \u00a7 1329(a). The court allowed the plan modification under \u00a7 1329(c) to surrender the residence, even though the 60-month time period set forth in \u00a7 1329(c) had already expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We agree with the bankruptcy court that the debtors' plan payments were not complete for purposes of \u00a7 1329(a).

Accordingly, we REVERSE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   David and Christina Mrdutt filed their chapter 13 bankruptcy case on November 30, 2011. Their residence, valued at $ 235,000, was encumbered by two deeds of trust in favor of Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo filed two related secured proofs of claim: one for $ 406,299.67 for the first lien (the primary mortgage), which included nearly $ 65,000 in prepetition arrears; and one for $ 42,427.01 for the second lien (a HELOC). The Mrdutts later obtained an order avoiding the wholly unsecured second lien, which was contingent upon their completion of a chapter 13 plan and receiving discharges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to plan confirmation, the Mrdutts filed a declaration required by local guidelines stating that their request to Wells Fargo to modify the primary mortgage loan was still pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Months later, with the loan modification still pending, the bankruptcy court confirmed the Mrdutts' second amended chapter 13 plan on December 11, 2012 (\"Plan\"). The 60-month Plan provided $ 0 for allowed general unsecured claims. The Plan also provided that all prepetition mortgage arrears would be cured if Wells Fargo approved the loan modification; if Wells Fargo disapproved it, the Mrdutts would file a modified plan to pay the arrears. The Mrdutts also agreed to make all postpetition mortgage payments directly to Wells Fargo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following confirmation, the Mrdutts continued to make regular payments to Trustee and the case proceeded uneventfully until after they made their final Plan payment to her in October 2016, which she distributed in November. In December 2016, Mr. Mrdutt wrote a letter to the bankruptcy judge asking her to stop Wells Fargo from foreclosing on the residence. Sadly, Mrs. Mrdutt had passed away from cancer. Mr. Mrdutt explained that Wells Fargo was refusing to deal with him for a\n   loan modification because the loan was in Mrs. Mrdutt's name only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2017, Wells Fargo moved for relief from stay to foreclose its first lien on the residence. The Mrdutts had failed to make postpetition mortgage payments totaling $ 123,819. The outstanding debt for the primary mortgage was now $ 536,861. The residence was still valued at $ 235,000. The bankruptcy court granted stay relief but ordered that its effectiveness was stayed until entry of the Mrdutts' discharges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June 2017, Trustee filed notices of plan completion and requested that the case be closed without discharge. Trustee asserted that the Mrdutts were not entitled to a discharge because they had failed to deal with their prepetition mortgage arrears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response, the Mrdutts\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   moved to modify their Plan (\"Motion to Modify\"). Because they ultimately did not receive the loan modification, they wished to modify the Plan to surrender the residence. Trustee argued that the Motion to Modify was untimely, because plan payments had been completed months prior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After a hearing, the bankruptcy court granted the Motion to Modify, finding that it was timely under \u00a7 1329(a) and that the Mrdutts could surrender the residence even though the 60-month time period under \u00a7 1329(c) had expired. Trustee timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Sommer eds. 16th ed. 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under the Plan, the Mrdutts agreed to cure their prepetition mortgage arrears either through a loan modification or a modified plan. They also agreed to make all postpetition mortgage payments directly to Wells Fargo. When the loan modification failed, the Mrdutts sought to modify the Plan to surrender the residence to Wells Fargo sixty-seven months after the first Plan payment was due and after they had made all sixty Plan payments to Trustee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Mrdutts acknowledged that the Code did not necessarily support their position. Nevertheless, they were seeking a way to get a discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Section 1329 provides that the bankruptcy court may modify a confirmed plan \"[a]t any time after confirmation of the plan, but before the\n   <strong>\n    completion of payments under such plan\n   </strong>\n   [.]\" \u00a7 1329(a) (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Danielson v.

Trustee maintains that only payments to the chapter 13 trustee are \"payments under such plan\" and that plan payments are \"complete\" once the debtor has made all plan payments to the trustee. We must determine what constitutes \"payments under such plan\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1329(a). Is it limited to those payments made to the trustee or does it include a debtor's direct payments to creditors?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   While no controlling authority defines payments for purposes of plan modification under \u00a7 1329(a), courts have held in the discharge context of \u00a7 1328(a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   that a debtor's direct payments to a creditor for a debt treated by the plan are payments under the plan. Precisely, when the chapter 13 plan provides for the curing of prepetition mortgage arrears and a debtor's direct postpetition maintenance payments in accordance with \u00a7 1322(b)(5), such direct payments are \"payments under the plan.\" And if the debtor does not complete \"all payments under the plan,\" the debtor is not entitled to a discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    In re Coughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269405\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/461/#p474\">\n    568 B.R. 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 474 (Bankr.

In a conduit district, where all payments to creditors are made by the chapter 13 trustee, postpetition mortgage payments would unquestionably be payments under the plan. But in a non-conduit or direct-pay district, postpetition mortgage payments made directly by the debtor would not be considered payments under the plan. The trustee in a conduit district would quickly observe the debtor's failure to pay the mortgage and could seek dismissal, if the debtor did not seek to modify the plan. In a non-conduit district, the debtor would know he stopped paying the mortgage, but, absent a motion for relief from stay from the mortgage creditor, the trustee, the court and other creditors would not know of the default, at least not until the trustee files her notice of final cure payment and the mortgage creditor responds with its statement in accordance with Rule 3002.1(g). As the\n   <em>\n    Coughlin\n   </em>\n   court correctly observed, whether postpetition mortgage payments are paid directly by the debtor or paid by the chapter 13 trustee should not be dispositive of granting a discharge under \u00a7 1328(a).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269405\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/461/#p474\">\n    568 B.R. at 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The computation of disposable income to pay creditors under \u00a7 1325(b) takes into account the promised direct payments for housing, including \u00a7 1322(b)(5) maintenance payments. Debtors who fail to make these payments, which often amount to tens of thousands of dollars, benefit from years of living without mortgage payments at the expense of creditors.

Although the language in \u00a7 1328(a) is slightly different from that in \u00a7 1329(a) - \u00a7 1328(a) uses the phrase \"payments under\n   <strong>\n    the\n   </strong>\n   plan\" while \u00a7 1329(a) uses the phrase \"payments under\n   <strong>\n    such\n   </strong>\n   plan\" - we see no reason to interpret\n   these phrases differently.

Further,\n   <em>\n    Fridley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Escarcega\n   </em>\n   simply recognized the temporal requirements of chapter 13 plans and that payments under a plan must continue for the duration provided for in the initial plan, absent modification, before they can be considered \"complete\" for purposes of discharge and modification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Escarcega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268930\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/573/219/\">\n    573 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   240 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Fridley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5546579\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/380/538/\">\n    380 B.R. at 543-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These cases did not hold that \"completion of payments\" for purposes of \u00a7 1329(a) means only those payments a debtor makes to the chapter 13 trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Even if Trustee were correct that the payments were complete when the Mrdutts made their final payment to her, we would still disagree with Trustee's conclusion. In effect, the Plan required the Mrdutts to make monthly payments in a fixed amount\n   <strong>\n    plus\n   </strong>\n   an additional amount necessary to cure their prepetition arrears, unless they obtained a loan modification that eliminated the arrears. These additional monthly payments were required payments even though the Mrdutts did not take the required steps to quantify them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Trustee's arguments are also undermined by her action of filing the notices of plan completion. In those notices, Trustee asserted that the Mrdutts were not entitled to a discharge because they had failed to deal with their prepetition mortgage arrears. In other words, the notices suggest that Plan payments were not complete for purposes of a discharge under \u00a7 1328(a) because of the uncured arrears. If that is true, then why should they be considered complete for purposes of plan modification under \u00a7 1329(a)? It makes little sense to say that a debtor's plan payments are complete for determining whether the debtor has timely moved to modify the plan, but to say they are not complete for the purpose of denying the debtor a discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Plan provided for the curing of the Mrdutts' prepetition mortgage arrears by either a loan modification or a modified plan and for direct postpetition mortgage payments to Wells Fargo. We conclude that all of these payments were \"payments under such plan\" for purposes of \u00a7 1329(a). Because the Mrdutts failed to satisfy the obligation of their prepetition arrears, and also failed to make their direct postpetition mortgage payments, their Plan payments were not \"complete\" under \u00a7 1329(a). Accordingly, we agree with the bankruptcy court that the Motion to Modify was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Trustee argues that the court had no statutory authority to approve a modified plan that provided for payments several months beyond the 60-month time limit. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   No fewer than three Code provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 1322(d), 1325(b)(4), and 1329(c), prohibit a plan exceeding five years in length. Section 1329(c) specifically prohibits the court from approving a plan modification that would \"provide for payments\" beyond five years. Here, the 60-month period for the Plan expired in October 2016; the Motion to Modify was filed in June 2017, the 67th month after which the Mrdutts' first Plan payment came due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Although we held in\n   <em>\n    Profit\n   </em>\n   that the trustee's motion to modify was timely under \u00a7 1329(a) due to incomplete plan payments, we also held that the trustee's modification request failed because it required payments in excess of the 60-month time limitation in \u00a7 1329(c) and its counterpart, \u00a7 1322(d). 283 B.R. at 573-74.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Heinzle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4300248\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/511/69/#p78\">\n    511 B.R. at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (modification may not occur after completion of the 60-month term for plan payments);\n   <em>\n    In re Goude\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6437254\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/201/275/#p277\">\n    201 B.R. at 276-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing case because plan could not be modified since the 60-month period had expired and plan could not be extended to include payment of priority tax claims).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Mrdutts sought to modify the Plan to surrender the residence in satisfaction of the Wells Fargo debt.

The Mrdutts asked the bankruptcy court to modify a confirmed plan to surrender an asset of the estate and extinguish a secured claim seven months after the 60-month period had already expired. The court had no authority to modify a plan that allowed for payment beyond the 60-month time limit.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We do not ignore the sad facts of this case and the bankruptcy court's understandable desire to do equity. But the Mrdutts should have been more proactive in their bankruptcy case and sought relief from the court when it was apparent that the loan modification with Wells Fargo was futile. The same goes for Wells Fargo, which sat idly by and did not seek relief from stay until after the Mrdutts had made all of their Plan payments to Trustee and the postpetition mortgage arrears were so astronomical. However, for the reasons stated above, we REVERSE.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Unless specified otherwise, all chapter and section references are to the Bankruptcy Code,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -1532, and all \"Rule\" references are to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The Mrdutts' \"cure and maintain\" plan for a long-term mortgage debt is authorized by \u00a7 1322(b)(5), which allows a debtor's plan to provide for the curing of any prepetition default within a reasonable time and maintaining postpetition mortgage payments while the case is pending.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cohen v.
