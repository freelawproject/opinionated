The SSA claim herein is based on the identical claim ruled on in 2009, the imposition and collection of the $ 49,327.17 restitution award. The parties are the same - the government and the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The SSA is barred from re-litigating the terms under which the Debtor has to repay the obligation in issue. It could have asked the District Court in 2009 to order that all future benefits due to the Debtor be withheld until the obligation was satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Laches\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Laches is based on the notion that those who sleep on their rights, lose them. It addresses delay in the pursuit of a right when a party must assert that right in order to benefit from it. For laches to apply the party asserting the defense must demonstrate an unreasonable lack of diligence by the party against whom the doctrine is asserted and prejudice arising therefrom. The SSA could have earlier sought withholding of all of the Debtor's benefits until the restitution award was satisfied and it could have objected to the plan before it was confirmed. The government chose to rely on the recoupment doctrine which the District Court has rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The debtor can show prejudice. Either he supports himself by having part of his monthly benefit satisfy the SSA overpayment obligation as provided for in the confirmed plan, or have all of it satisfy the SSA overpayment obligation. Clearly, he would be prejudiced if required to forego the entire benefit.

It was also pointed out that the programs are funded separately, have different eligibility criteria and serve different populations. Payroll taxes fund the OASDI program while Congress appropriates funds from general revenue for the SSI program. For that reason the defense of recoupment does not lie. However, setoff is available.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Section 1320b-17 allows but does not require SSA to withhold the maximum amount of current benefits under one Social Security program to recover a past overpayment under another Social Security program, even where the overpayment arose from the recipient's fraud. For that reason \"SSA's withholding of Thigpen's OASDI benefits to recover its prior SSI overpayments is a setoff not a recoupment, and therefore that SSA's withholding is not exempt from the automatic stay.\"\n    <em>\n     Thigpen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512182\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/590/810/#p816\">\n     590 B.R. at 818\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <strong>\n     Setoff in Bankruptcy\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The right of setoff is of equitable origin, designed to facilitate the adjustment of mutual debts.

However, the District Court has dispensed with that position, finding that recoupment does not lie herein.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The automatic stay will not be lifted. The movant has not shown that the Debtor lacks equity in the property in issue, his SSA benefit, nor has it shown that the property interest is not necessary to an effective reorganization. The SSA is protected while the monthly payments are being made toward the Debtor's non-dischargeable debt.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The court finds that it would be inequitable to now modify the automatic stay when the government could have sought 100% of the Debtor's future benefits at the 2009 sentencing on the criminal charge or pre-confirmation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    In the exercise of its discretion, the court denies the Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-58\">\n     A different District Judge has ruled that recoupment is not available in a similar situation.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      United States of America v.
