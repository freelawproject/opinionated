Plaintiff objected to Claim No. 4 on the ground that it was time-barred and unenforceable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant did not file a timely response.

In response to Claim No. 5, Plaintiff initiated this adversary proceeding on January 3, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff asserted seven causes of action, six of which are class action causes of action. Count I, an objection to Claim No. 5 as unenforceable and time-barred, is the only individual cause of action. At the time she filed and served her initial complaint, Plaintiff filed and served a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, seeking summary judgment as to Count I only.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant filed a response stating that it did not contest disallowance of Claim No. 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court entered an Order Granting Summary Judgment as to Court I, which disallowed Claim No. 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 13, 2019, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The relevant facts alleged in the Amended Complaint are: (1) Defendant extended a credit card to Plaintiff; (2) Plaintiff incurred debt to Defendant on that account (the \"Debt\"); (3) the Debt has been in default since June 30, 2015; and (4) Defendant filed Claim No. 5 based on the Debt. In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff seeks certification of two classes. Class I being \"All current and former debtors in any bankruptcy action pending, at any time, before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland in whose proceeding a proof of claim was submitted by [Defendant] on or after October 1, 2016, on a time barred consumer debt.\" Class II being a subset of Class I including only debtors in cases \"in which any monies were paid out unto and/or received by [Defendant].\" On behalf of those alleged classes, Plaintiff asserts five causes of action. Plaintiff seeks declaratory judgment that Defendant's practice of filing proofs of claims for time-barred debt is a violation of Maryland law. Plaintiff seeks an injunction enjoining Defendant from continuing such practice. Plaintiff asserts two causes of action for monetary damages asserting that such practice violates the Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act (\"MCDCA\") and the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (\"MCPA\"). Finally, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant was unjustly enriched through such practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant moves the Court to dismiss all of Plaintiff's remaining causes of action set forth in the Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can\n   be granted. Defendant argues that binding precedent upholds a creditor's right to file a proof of claim on stale debt. Defendant asserts that expiration of the limitations period terminates the remedy for nonpayment of a debt but does not extinguish the right to payment thereon. Plaintiff responds that, as of October 1, 2016, Maryland law provides for the termination of the right and remedy upon expiration of the applicable limitations period. Defendant also moves the Court to impose sanctions on Plaintiff, arguing that Plaintiff's class action causes of action are frivolous and harassing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Discussion.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The instant motions present two distinct, yet related, issues to the Court.

It is the design of the Act of Limitations to protect and shield debtors in such a situation; and consistent with this principle and this view, the decisions have been made, that the acknowledgment or admission of the debtor will take the case out of the Act of Limitations, because if the money is still due and owing,\n   the defendant has not suffered from lapse of time, nor has any inconvenience resulted to him therefrom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 764 (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barney v.

Plaintiff's claims for declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and unjust enrichment presume a violation of either the MCDCA, MCPA, or Maryland common law of similar effect. The MCDCA provides, in relevant part, that, \"[i]n collecting or attempting to collect an alleged debt a collector may not, ... [c]laim, attempt, or threaten to enforce a right with knowledge that the right does not exist.\" Md. Com. Law Code Ann. \u00a7 14-202(8). The MCPA prohibits the use of \"unfair, abusive, or deceptive trade practices ... in ... [t]he collection of consumer debts.\" Md. Com. Law Code Ann. \u00a7 13-303(5). \"Unfair, abusive, or deceptive trade practices\" is defined to include violations of the MCDCA. Md. Com. Law Code Ann. \u00a7 13-301(14)(iii). Plaintiff asserts that new statutory provisions effective October 1, 2016 effectively extinguish the right to payment upon expiration of the limitations period. Accordingly, Plaintiff argues that Defendant's filing of Claim No. 5 violated the MCDCA and MCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On October 1, 2016, the Maryland legislature enacted new statutory provisions governing consumer debt collection actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-1201\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . Those statutes provide that \"[a] creditor or a collector may not initiate a consumer debt collection action after the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the consumer debt collection action.\" Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-1202(a). The statute further provides that, \"on the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the consumer debt collection action, any subsequent payment toward, written or oral affirmation of, or any other activity on the debt may not revive or extend the limitations period.\" Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-1202(b)(1) (effective through October 1, 2018). As used therein, \" '[c]onsumer debt collection action' means any judicial action or arbitration proceeding in which a claim is asserted to collect a consumer debt.\" Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-1201(f)(1). Whereas, \"consumer debt\" is a debt arising from a \"consumer transaction,\" which is \"any transaction involving a person seeking or acquiring real or personal property, services, money, or credit for personal, family, or household purposes.\" Md.

In reviewing Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-1201\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., the Court does not see evidence of intent to abrogate the common law rule that the right to payment survives the expiration of the limitations period. By comparison, the statutory provisions in Mississippi and Wisconsin could not be clearer of those legislatures' intent to abrogate that common law rule. Conversely, Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-1202(b)(1), in providing that \"payment toward, written or oral affirmation of, or any other activity on the debt\" does not revive or extend the limitations period clearly abrogates a different common law rule that such activity would revive the limitations period. However, the language of that provision reaffirms the continuing existence of the right to payment beyond the limitations period. Specifically, the provision provides that payment or promise thereof does not revive the \"limitations period,\" as opposed to the debt or right to payment. Such language makes sense because the right to payment remains alive and in no need of revival under the common law rule. Further, the legislature refers to the right to payment following the expiration of the limitations period without equivocation or clarification, as \"the debt,\" which suggests its continued existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds and concludes that Defendant holds an unenforceable right to payment on the Debt even after the expiration of the three-year limitations period. As such, the Court further finds and concludes that Defendant was within its rights under bankruptcy law to file Claim No. 5. Accordingly, to the extent Defendant ran afoul of the MCDCA, MCPA, or other Maryland law in\n   doing so, which the Court concludes is not at all, federal bankruptcy law preempts the MCDCA, MCPA, and other Maryland law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

R. Bankr. P. 9011(b)(1). A presenting attorney further certifies that \"the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011(b)(2). Rule 9011(c) further provides that, \"[i]f, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines that subdivision (b) has been violated, the court may, ... impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated subdivision (b) or are responsible for the violation.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011(c). Monetary sanctions awarded under Rule 9011(c) must be \"limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated,\" which may include an award of reasonable attorney's fees.

D. Md. 2018). Nonetheless, the Court is not aware of any court addressing the effect of Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-1201\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . on the common law rule that expiration of the limitations period extinguishes the remedy for nonpayment, but not the right to payment.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Potterton v.

Indeed, Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-1202(b) abrogates a related common law rule that partially paying or promising to pay a time-barred debt revives the limitations period. Further, both the Maryland Court of Appeals,\n   in\n   <em>\n    Potterton\n   </em>\n   , and the Fourth Circuit, in\n   <em>\n    Dubois\n   </em>\n   , referred to this possible resurrection of the limitations period as indicative of the right to payment's continuing existence. Accordingly, Plaintiff's argument that Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.
