Black, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 28, 2018, Rose Moses Woodford (the \"Debtor\") filed a voluntary Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in this Court. After the Court denied confirmation of her first Chapter 13 Plan, the Debtor initiated this adversary proceeding on January 21, 2019. In her complaint, the Debtor claims that Capital Bank, NA (the \"Bank\") required Sherwood D. Woodford, the Debtor's then husband, to execute a Deed of Trust (\"DOT\") on the Woodfords' principal residence (the \"Property\") in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\"ECOA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201691\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1691f, and that any lien claimed by the Bank is therefore\n   void.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Bank filed a Motion to Dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In support, the Bank argues that the ECOA does not apply in this situation or, alternatively, that the lien on the Property falls into an exception within the ECOA. The Court held a hearing on this matter on April 8, 2019 at which the Debtor and Capital Bank, NA appeared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The lien at issue arose from a promissory note (the \"Note\") executed and delivered to the Bank on April 8, 2011 on behalf of Walker International Incorporated (\"Walker International\") in exchange for a loan to be used in the company's operation. (ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 10.) Although the Debtor alleges that her daughter and son-in-law had exclusive control over the operations of Walker International, she nonetheless served as the company's president and executed the Note on behalf of the company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Contemporaneously with the execution of the Note, the Debtor executed a commercial guaranty for the benefit of the Bank. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Debtor suggests that the Note and guaranty resulted from an \"informal\" application for credit on behalf of Walker International. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Rather than preparing a formal credit application, the Bank's loan officer simply relied on information that had been prepared for another lender and concluded that the Bank would extend credit to Walker International secured by a lien against only the company's inventory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At signing, the Bank nonetheless required the Debtor and Mr. Woodford to execute and deliver a DOT granting a lien in favor of the Bank in the Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) According to the complaint, it did so \"without making any inquiry as to the Debtor's individual creditworthiness\" and, as a result, the Debtor asserts that the Bank violated the anti-discrimination provisions of the ECOA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response, the Bank suggests that the ECOA does not apply to the Debtor and that the statute contains exceptions for this situation. (ECF No. 4, at 1.) Even accepting the Debtor's allegations as true, the Bank argues that Debtor has failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction of this matter by virtue of the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 157(a) and the delegation made to this Court by Order from the District Court on December 6, 1994, and Rule 3 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia.

Thus, to state a claim for a violation of \u00a7 202.7(d)(1), the Debtor must allege facts which, taken as true, establish that (1) she was an \"applicant\"; (2) the Bank did not determine she was uncreditworthy; and (3) the Bank nonetheless required her husband to sign a \"credit instrument.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20202.7\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 202.7(d)(1). In its defense, a creditor may then point to one of several exceptions to this rule, including \u00a7 202.7(d)(4) which allows a creditor to obtain a spouse's signature as necessary to create a valid lien in property offered as collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As stated above, the Debtor argues that the Bank violated the ECOA by requiring her husband to execute a DOT as collateral securing the loan for which she applied on behalf of Walker International, and for which the Bank never made a determination that the Debtor or Walker International were not independently creditworthy. Accordingly, she asks the Court to invalidate the lien created by the DOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In response, the Bank asserts that \u00a7 202.7(d)(1) does not apply because the Debtor, as guarantor of the loan, was not an \"applicant\" for the purposes of the ECOA, and that the Bank never required Mr. Woodford to sign a \"credit instrument\" as prohibited by the regulation. Alternatively, the Bank argues that it merely required Mr. Woodford to execute an instrument to create a valid interest in collateral as allowed by \u00a7 202.7(d)(4).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20202.7\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(4) (\"[A] creditor may require the signature of the applicant's spouse or other person on any instrument necessary ... to make the property being offered as security available to satisfy the debt in the event of default, for example, an instrument to create a valid lien ....\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ballard v.

Rather than creating a personal obligation, the DOT created merely an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   obligation in Mr. Woodford's real property.

(ECF No. 4-5.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The Debtor attempts to distinguish\n    <em>\n     Evans\n    </em>\n    by suggesting that she never offered the Property at issue here as security for the loan, and that the Bank instead requested such as collateral. (ECF No. 10.) This argument attacks the exception found in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20202.7\">\n     12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.7\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(4) and\n    <em>\n     Evans\n    </em>\n    ' reasoning as to whether the lender in that case could require an applicant's spouse to sign a DOT. Section 202.7(d)(4) allows a creditor to \"require the signature of the applicant's spouse or other person on any instrument necessary ... to make\n    <em>\n     the property being offered as security\n    </em>\n    available to satisfy the debt in the event of default.\" Thus, the Debtor argues that she never offered the Property such that the exception does not apply. However, because the Court finds that a DOT is not a \"credit instrument\" for the purposes of \u00a7 202.7(d)(1), it need not consider whether the DOT falls into the exception of \u00a7 202.7(d)(4). Consequently, the assertion that the Debtor never \"offered\" the Property as collateral is of no moment here. The Court also need not reach the issue as to whether the Debtor has standing, as the trustee of the trust currently owning the real estate is not a party to this litigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The Court also questions whether the Debtor, as guarantor of the loan to Walker International, is an \"applicant\" under the ECOA.
