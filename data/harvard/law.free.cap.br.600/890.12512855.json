Kimball, Judge United States Bankruptcy Court\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 13, 2019, British American Insurance Company Limited, as plaintiff in the above-captioned adversary proceeding and judgment creditor, filed a motion asking this court to determine whether a proceeding supplementary, pursued against Sylvia Baldini, is a core matter subject to entry of final orders and judgment by this court. ECF No. 824.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the court rules that there is federal bankruptcy jurisdiction over the plaintiff's proceeding supplementary against Ms. Baldini, based in fraudulent transfer, solely on the basis that it is \"related to\" a case under title 11. While labelled as a \"core\" proceeding under the applicable statute, the fraudulent transfer claim against Ms. Baldini must be treated as a non-core proceeding. Absent consent of the parties, which it appears does not exist, this court may not enter final orders or judgment in the matter. Ms. Baldini has asked the district court to withdraw the reference to rule on her motion to dismiss the notice to appear in the proceeding supplementary. The district court has discretion whether to deny that motion, in which case this court will enter a proposed ruling on the motion to dismiss for review by the district court, or to grant that motion, in which case the district court will act on the motion to dismiss in the first instance. In light of the broad\n   discretion afforded to the district court, and the role of this court in this related to matter, this court expresses no preference in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court recognized the petitioner/plaintiff by order entered March 22, 2010. ECF No. 65, Case No. 09-31881. The plaintiff filed a complaint commencing this adversary proceeding on December 22, 2011 and filed an amended complaint on July 29, 2013. ECF Nos. 1 and 310.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lawrence Duprey was one of several defendants in this adversary proceeding. Mr. Duprey is married to Ms. Baldini.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 1, 2017, the court entered judgment against Mr. Duprey in the amount of $ 122,636,450.34. ECF No. 540. On April 17, 2018, the court entered an additional judgment against Mr. Duprey, for sanctions, in the amount of $ 24,283.20. ECF No. 650. Neither of these judgments has been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff contends that Mr. Duprey fraudulently transferred assets to Ms. Baldini. The plaintiff is pursuing proceedings supplementary against Ms. Baldini. ECF Nos. 669 and 777. This court authorized the issuance of a notice to appear to Ms. Baldini. ECF No. 803. The plaintiff filed and served on Ms. Baldini a notice to appear and an amended notice to appear. ECF Nos. 804 and 807.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ms. Baldini responded with a motion to dismiss the notice to appear and a motion asking the district court to withdraw the reference. ECF Nos. 814 and 816. While Ms. Baldini explicitly objects to this court conducting a jury trial in the proceeding supplementary, the motion to withdraw the reference does not seek withdrawal of the reference so that the district court may conduct a jury trial. Ms. Baldini seeks withdrawal of the reference so that the district court \"may consider Baldini's legal defenses and rule upon her Motion to Dismiss the Notice to Appear with prejudice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It appears that Ms. Baldini would prefer that the district court rule on her motion to dismiss the notice to appear rather than this court prepare a proposed order on that motion for consideration by the district court. In Ms. Baldini's motion to dismiss, her primary argument is that the plaintiff's claim against her, based in fraudulent transfer, is time barred. When this court heard the plaintiff's request for authority to serve Ms. Baldini with the notice to appear, Ms. Baldini made that same argument. The court overruled her objection based on the only available Florida appellate case law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Ms. Baldini already knows that this court is likely to propose denial of her motion to dismiss, she asks the district court to short circuit the process by withdrawing the reference and ruling on the issue directly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the present motion, the plaintiff asks this court to enter an order \"finding that the fraudulent transfer proceedings supplementary asserted against Baldini are core matters.\" ECF No. 824.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   BANKRUPTCY JURISDICTION, CORE MATTERS, AND ARTICLE III CONCERNS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pursuant to Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, Congress enacted\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 1334 is the sole source of subject matter jurisdiction in bankruptcy.

A \"related to\" matter is one which does not find its source in the Bankruptcy Code, and could be pursued outside a title 11 case, but which nonetheless bears a connection with the title 11 case sufficient to bring it within federal bankruptcy jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

This has been accomplished in every district in the United States by standing orders of reference. On March 27, 2012, the district court for the Southern District of Florida issued a revised Order of Reference, Administrative Order 2012-25 (the \"Standing Order\"). The Standing Order refers to the bankruptcy court in this district any and all cases and proceedings covered by federal bankruptcy jurisdiction. The district court may for cause shown withdraw, in whole or in part, any case or proceeding referred to the bankruptcy court under the Standing Order.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Not all matters referred to the bankruptcy court are subject to entry of final orders or judgments in the bankruptcy court.

The supplementary proceeding does not arise under a provision of the Bankruptcy Code, so it is not a proceeding arising under title 11. Nor is it an action that may only be brought in a bankruptcy case, so it is not a proceeding arising in a case under title 11. Outside of chapter 15, an action aimed at augmenting the assets under administration falls under the court's related to jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,4332163\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/462/\">\n    564 U.S. at 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,6049563,4332163\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2594/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Granfinanciera, S.A. v.

Technically, then, Congress included the plaintiff's proceeding supplementary against Ms. Baldini as a core matter. But this is not determinative on the question of whether this court has the power to enter final orders and judgment in the matter. The plaintiff's proceeding supplementary against Ms. Baldini aims only to augment the estate administered by the plaintiff. It does not \"stem from the bankruptcy itself\" nor would it \"necessarily be resolved in the claims allowance process.\"\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,4332163\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/462/\">\n    564 U.S. at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,6049563,4332163\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2594/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This is in contrast with section 157(c)(2), addressing non-core matters, which requires only \"consent.\" As noted above, the parties may consent to the bankruptcy court entering final orders in non-core matters by failing to object in a timely manner. It is unclear whether the same analysis applies in the context of consent to a jury trial before the bankruptcy court under section 157(e). To avoid questions on this issue, this court typically requires that each party expressly consent in writing or on the record if they wish this court to preside over a jury trial. In any case, jury trials before the bankruptcy court are rare in this district and elsewhere.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
