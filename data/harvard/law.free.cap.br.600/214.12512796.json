Plaintiffs KeyBank National Association and Fifth Third Bank initially brought this action in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, New York County, asserting state law claims for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, tortious interference with contract, and a declaratory judgment against Defendant Franklin Advisers, Inc. and seven mutual funds (collectively, \"Defendants\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' decision to enter into a financing agreement with the Chapter 11 debtor, in which Plaintiffs declined to partake, violated the terms of an earlier financing agreement between Plaintiffs, Defendants, the debtor, and related parties. After Plaintiffs filed their Complaints, Defendants timely removed these actions to this Court, pursuant to the bankruptcy removal statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201452\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Now before the Court is a threshold dispute over where these cases should proceed: Plaintiffs seek to have these actions remanded to New York State Court, while Defendants seek to have them transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. For the reasons that follow, these cases will be consolidated and both parties' motions denied, such that this case will proceed in this Court, where it will be referred to the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, pursuant to the Amended Standing Order of Reference Re: Title 11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 31, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In June 2013, Appvion Inc. and certain of its affiliates (together, \"Appvion\") entered\n   into a credit agreement with several lenders (the \"pre-petition credit agreement\"), including Plaintiffs and seven of the eight Defendants in these cases, among others (the \"pre-petition lenders\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A few years later, on October 1, 2017 (the \"Petition Date\"), Appvion filed petitions to commence reorganization under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the \"Bankruptcy Court\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Appvion, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-12082 (Bankr.

As a result, Appvion became a debtor in possession (\"DIP\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, $ 253.3 million remained outstanding under the pre-petition credit agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Like many Chapter 11 debtors-in-possession, Appvion needed further credit to complete its reorganization. To that end, on October 2, 2017, Appvion sought the Bankruptcy Court's permission to obtain post-petition financing through a proposed debtor-in-possession credit agreement (the \"Original DIP Agreement\") with certain of the pre-petition lenders, including Plaintiffs and six of the Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20364\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (authorizing debtors-in-possession to obtain, after notice and a hearing, certain post-petition financing from lenders, in exchange for providing lenders with various security enhancements, such as priority claims to, and liens on, the DIP collateral); Fed.

The Original DIP Agreement was intended to replace the pre-petition credit agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Original DIP Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fundamentally, the Original DIP Agreement proposed to (1) convert approximately $ 240 million of outstanding loans under the pre-petition credit agreement into post-petition loans, which is commonly referred to in bankruptcy as a \"roll-up\" (the \"Original Roll-Up Loans\"); and (2) to provide Appvion with $ 85 million of new financing (the \"Original New Money Loans\") (together, the \"DIP Loans\"). Plaintiffs did not participate in the financing of the Original New Money Loans. In exchange for providing the DIP Loans, the loans would be given, among other things, \"superpriority\" status and senior security liens on all of the DIP Collateral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20364\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (providing that these protections are available to creditors who provide post-petition financing).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 3, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Original DIP Agreement on an interim basis, and on October 31, 2017, after a final hearing, the Bankruptcy Court issued a final order (the \"Original DIP Order\") approving the Original DIP Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Original DIP Order, Oct. 31, 2017, KeyBank Compl., Ex. A (Dkt. 1-1); Fifth Third Compl., Ex. A (Dkt 1-1). The terms of the Original DIP Agreement and Original DIP Order most relevant to these cases provide as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) the Original Roll-Up Loans and Original New Money Loans are to be secured by liens of equal priority and are entitled to\n   <em>\n    pari passu\n   </em>\n   (i.e., equal) payment priority unless the Roll Up Lenders agree otherwise (the \"\n   <em>\n    pari passu\n   </em>\n   treatment provision\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (2) any modification of the Original DIP Order must not affect lien priority or payment priority of the DIP Loans, and any lien priming requires KeyBank and Fifth Third to Consent (the \"priming lien prohibition\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (3) any disproportionate payment received by any lender must be shared\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   with all of the other DIP Lenders (the \"\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   sharing requirement\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (4) any material amendment or modification to the Original DIP Order requires Plaintiffs' consent (the \"material modification consent provision\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (5) any waivers, modifications, or amendments that would reduce the principal of any DIP Loan require the consent of each Lender entitled to such amount (the \"principal payment reduction bar\"); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (6) the release of all or substantially all of the collateral in any transaction or series of related transaction requires the written consent of each DIP Lender (the \"collateral release prohibition\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' subsequent conduct in the bankruptcy proceeding, as detailed below, breached each of these provisions of the Original DIP Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Stalking Horse Purchase and Sale Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the end of 2017, Appvion defaulted on certain of its obligations under the Original DIP Agreement. Defendants and Appvion then negotiated a series of transactions in January 2018 to keep Appvion alive. Under these proposed transactions: (1) Defendants would direct the agent of the Original\n   DIP Agreement to waive Appvion's defaults thereunder; (2) Defendants would guarantee to provide $ 15 million in additional new money loans; and (3) Defendants would direct the DIP agent to facilitate the formation of an entity to serve as a stalking horse bidder in an auction for substantially all of Appvion's assets-upon approval of the Bankruptcy Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the proposed stalking horse bid, the $ 85 million of the Original New Money Loans would be assumed by the purchaser, while the holders of the $ 240 million in Original Roll-Up Loans, including Plaintiffs, would receive equity in the acquired company as part of a credit bid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 8, 2018, Appvion filed the \"sale motion\" seeking the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the Stalking Horse Purchase Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs objected to the Sale Motion. Because the Original New Money Loans would be assumed by the Stalking Horse Purchaser, while the Original Roll-Up Loans would be subject to a credit bid, Plaintiffs argued that this effectively prioritized the Original New Money Loans over the Original Roll-Up Loans, in violation of several terms of the Original DIP Agreement. In response, Defendants withdrew their proposal and revised it in a supposed effort to accommodate Plaintiffs' objections over the disparate treatment of the Original Roll-Up and New Money loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Amended DIP Agreement &amp; Revised Stalking Horse Procedures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Appvion and Defendants ultimately revised their proposed agreement so that the Stalking Horse Purchaser would no longer directly assume the $ 85 million in Original New Money loans. Instead, they would seek to amend the Original DIP Agreement so that the $ 85 million of Original New Money Loans would be rolled up into a new $ 100 million loan, with the extra $ 15 million constituting additional new money loans from Defendants. This new $ 100 million loan would serve as a new debtor-in-possession credit facility (the \"New DIP Facility\") with priority claims to, and liens on, the DIP Collateral senior to the existing claims and liens of the Original Roll-Up Loans. The Stalking Horse Purchaser would then assume the New DIP Facility, as opposed to any of the Original DIP Loans, while the Original Roll-Up Loans would be subject to a credit bid for equity in the Stalking Horse Purchaser. Thus, under these revisions, the Original Roll-Up Loans would become subordinate to the New DIP Facility, which would be made up in part of the Original New Money Loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 5, 2018, Appvion filed a revised Stalking Horse Purchase Agreement as well as a motion seeking approval of the Amended DIP Agreement that would incorporate the above amendments into the Original DIP Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appvion Mot. to Approve DIP Financing (Bankr. Dkt. 520); Revised Asset Purchase Agreement (Bankr. Dkt. 530). After an interim hearing on March 12, 2018, and a final hearing on March 29, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court approved the proposed Amended DIP Agreement. Importantly, however,\n   the Bankruptcy Court expressly stated that its rulings did not affect any inter-lender rights that KeyBank or Fifth Third Bank may possess against other parties to the Original DIP Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 12, 2018, Interim Hr'g Tr., Amended DIP Authorization, at 82:15-20, Shamah Decl. Ex. B (KeyBank Dkt. 26-2; Fifth Third Dkt. 25-2). Similarly, the Bankruptcy Court's Amended DIP Order provided that its findings were \"without prejudice to the claims and causes of action asserted or that may be asserted\" in this litigation, which had been filed in New York County Supreme Court earlier that day, \"provided, however, that the plaintiffs in the litigations agree that no claim or cause of action ... shall constitute a collateral attack on approval of the [New] DIP Facility ... and the [Amended] DIP Order[.]\" Amended DIP Order, Rider A, Shamah Decl., Ex. F (KeyBank Dkt. 26-6; Fifth Third Dkt. 25-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    D. This Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As noted above, hours prior to the Bankruptcy Court's entry of the Amended DIP Order, KeyBank and Fifth Third Bank commenced two separate actions against Defendants in New York Supreme Court asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and tortious interference of contract, all arising out of Defendants' decision to enter into the Amended DIP Agreement which Plaintiffs allege violated the Original DIP Agreement. Plaintiffs also sought a declaratory judgment that Defendants' conduct was prohibited by the Original DIP Agreement, that the Original Roll-Up Loans must be treated the same as the Original New Money Loans, and that Defendants must share any payments on the Original New Money Loans equally with Plaintiffs and other lenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On April 27, 2018, Defendants removed the state court actions to this Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1446, 1452 and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9027.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal (KeyBank Dkt. 1; Fifth Third Dkt. 1). On May 14, 2018, Defendants filed a motion to transfer these cases to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware so that they could then be referred to the Delaware Bankruptcy Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Standing Order of Reference (D. Del. Feb. 29, 2012). On the same day, the Bankruptcy Court also entered an order approving and authorizing Appvion's motion to sell substantially all of its assets to AHC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gordon Decl. Ex. A (KeyBank Dkt. 31). On June 12, 2018, Plaintiffs responded to Defendants' motion to transfer by simultaneously opposing the motion and moving this Court to remand the actions back to the New York State Court. Defendants also filed an unopposed letter motion to consolidate these cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On August 14, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court entered the \"Plan Confirmation Order\" approving Appvion's liquidation plans, the effective date of which occurred on August 24, 2018, when a liquidating trust was created.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr.

The factual allegations, the legal claims and the relief sought are all identical, as are the legal issues. Except for the difference in Plaintiffs' names, Defendants have filed identical briefs in both actions. Plaintiffs have filed separate briefing, authored by different counsel, but nevertheless join in and adopt each other's memoranda in support of their motions.

Indeed, Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    Baker,\n   </em>\n   in support of those arguments, and quote that case for the proposition that \"arising under\" jurisdiction turns on \"whether claims that appear to be based in\n   state law are really an extension\" of bankruptcy proceedings.

First, the contracts at issue in both of those cases were\n   <em>\n    pre-petition\n   </em>\n   credit agreements that did not depend upon the entry of bankruptcy court orders to become enforceable, and the plaintiffs were not asserting that the defendants breached obligations under any bankruptcy court orders. In addition, neither opinion concerned a dispute over whether a federal court would have subject matter jurisdiction over the claims arising from those credit agreements. Rather, before both bankruptcy courts were objections of pre-petition lenders to pending decisions on whether to approve certain credit bids of the debtors' assets. To the extent the pre-petition creditors were arguing over how proceeds from the sale of the debtors' assets would be distributed amongst themselves, the\n   <em>\n    In re Metaldyne Corp.\n   </em>\n   court held that such a dispute was not properly before it \"if [it] ever could properly be brought before th[e] [c]ourt.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4103444\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/409/671/\">\n    409 B.R. at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, Defendants argue that the phrase \"any such action\" encompasses only those actions between \"the borrower and each other loan party.\" The Court is not persuaded. The phrase \"any such action\" refers to the preceding phrase, \"any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement,\" and is not limited to those only between \"the borrower and each other loan party.\" The final clause makes clear that \"\n   <em>\n    each of the parties\n   </em>\n   \" to the DIP Agreement-which includes Plaintiffs and Defendants, and not simply \"the borrower and each other loan party\"-agrees that disputes arising out of the DIP Agreement must be litigated in New York state or federal court.

Resolution of the dispute in\n   <em>\n    Delaware Trust\n   </em>\n   was deemed to potentially \"affect the rights and prioritization among creditors\" to the property of the bankruptcy estate,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5916780\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/534/500/#p514\">\n    534 B.R. at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Argosy\n   </em>\n   , the Court found that the parties still had potential indemnification claims against the debtor that could impact future administration of the estate,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20140730\">\n    2019 WL 140730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Thus, in those cases, the public interest in having the bankruptcy proceedings centralized-so that the assets of the estates could be administered without undue interference stemming from the outcome of litigation in other forums-outweighed the fact that the plaintiffs had chosen their forum outside of the bankruptcy proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Credit Suisse AG v.

Sept. 9, 2015) (concluding that enforcing a mandatory forum selection clause in an inter-creditor agreement \"would not serve the interests of justice\" because plaintiff was seeking to enforce rights that could \"jeopardize the legitimacy of the Debtors' reorganization\" in contrast to cases that do not \"interfere[ ] with the bankruptcy process\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   By contrast, the parties here do not dispute that resolution of this case will not impact the distribution of assets remaining in the debtor's estate. Moreover, not only is the governing forum selection clause mandatory, but the parties agreed to be bound by it\n   <em>\n    in the bankruptcy proceedings.\n   </em>\n   The forum selection clauses in\n   <em>\n    Delaware Trust\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Argosy\n   </em>\n   , on the other hand, were permissive, and were created in\n   <em>\n    pre-petition\n   </em>\n   contracts. The public interest in centralizing this dispute with the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings is thus relatively weak, while the countervailing interest in enforcing the parties' choice of forum is strong, given that the parties agreed that the New York courts would be the only forums to hear this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Judicial economy and the overall interests of justice are the remaining avenues with which this Court could consider overriding the parties' forum selection clause, but they provide an insufficient basis for doing so. Although the Delaware Bankruptcy Court is already familiar with the legal issues in this case, and although adjudicating this case requires interpreting that court's prior orders, this Court is confident that the bankruptcy courts in this district are equally capable of efficiently resolving this dispute. Tellingly, Defendants have not cited any authority, and the Court has found none, in which a mandatory forum selection clause entered into as part of a post-petition agreement was overridden in the interests of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Thus, even though the Court has found that \"arising in\" jurisdiction exists in this case, which would strongly suggest that the Bankruptcy Court from which it arose is the preferred forum,\n   <em>\n    Winstar Holdings LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204323003\">\n    2007 WL 4323003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6, in light of the forum selection clause, the Court cannot conclude that such a countervailing interest outweighs the interest in enforcing the parties' agreement to have this dispute heard in the New York.
