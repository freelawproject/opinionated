In count I, the Trustee asserted a claim for relief under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 542 and 553,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking to recover from BPPR the sum of $ 31,434.17-the amount the bank withdrew, pre-bankruptcy, from the savings account of the debtor, Juan Enrique Cruz Rivera (the \"Debtor\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Trustee asserted that BPPR was not entitled to the seized funds because it failed to perfect a security interest in the savings account in accordance with the requirements of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, and because the funds were not freely available for withdrawal by the Debtor-a prerequisite to a bank's ability to exercise a right of setoff. Needless to say, BPPR disagreed with both the Trustee's assertions. The bankruptcy court ruled that BPPR enjoyed a perfected security interest in the savings account. As a result, the court did not address the Trustee's alternative claim as to the unavailability of BPPR's setoff rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The bankruptcy court also granted summary judgment in favor of BPPR on count II of the complaint, in which the Trustee asserted a preference claim under \u00a7 547.

Pre-bankruptcy Events\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 19, 2012, BPPR loaned the Debtor $ 31,434.17. In a loan agreement memorializing this transaction, the Debtor agreed to make 83 monthly payments of $ 78.59 each, beginning on November 19, 2012, and a final lump sum payment of $ 31,512.76 on October 19, 2019. The Debtor authorized BPPR to debit the payments from his BPPR savings account ending in 6280. On the same date, the Debtor also\n   signed a pledge agreement, whereby he secured his obligations under the loan agreement with his BPPR savings account ending in 1438 (the \"1438 account\"). The pledge agreement was not notarized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Debtor defaulted in his monthly payment obligation to BPPR for the months of February and March 2015. Consequently, on April 30, 2015, BPPR debited the 1438 account in the amount of $ 31,434.17, thereby paying off the outstanding balance of the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Bankruptcy Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Less than a week later, on May 5, 2015, the Debtor filed a petition for relief under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. On his schedules accompanying the petition, the Debtor listed approximately $ 77,000.00 in assets, and $ 185,000.00 in liabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 6, 2017, the Trustee commenced an adversary proceeding against BPPR. In count I of her complaint, the Trustee alleged that BPPR's debiting the 1438 account was an improper setoff because the 1438 account had been pledged to BPPR as collateral for the loan to the Debtor and was unavailable to the Debtor, making it \"a special purpose deposit\" not subject to setoff under the Puerto Rico Civil Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her prayer for relief, the Trustee requested an order pursuant to \u00a7 542 directing BPPR to turn over to her the offset amount of $ 31,434.17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. BPPR's Answer and the Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   BPPR answered the complaint, asserting several affirmative defenses, including that: (1) its claim was fully secured; (2) the complaint \"was barred by the doctrine of setoff and/or recoupment\"; and (3) the pledge agreement complied with the provisions of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Trustee then followed with a motion for summary judgment accompanied by a supporting statement of uncontested facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   She reiterated that the funds in the 1438 account were not subject to setoff because they \"were frozen\" and \"[un]available for use or for withdrawal at will.\" This, the Trustee claimed, made the 1438 account a special purpose account, rather than a general purpose account. She elaborated: \"If [ ] the bank holds a special purpose deposit like a trust fund, its obligation is not one of a general debtor, but rather a trustee. The funds are not owed to the depositor but owned by it[.]\" Under such circumstances, the Trustee argued, the required mutuality for a right to setoff was absent. To support this claim, the Trustee relied upon\n   <em>\n    Constructora Maza, Inc. v. Banco de Ponce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6543909,1392039\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/616/573/\">\n    616 F.2d 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 579 (1st Cir. 1980) (stating a \"bank's right to set-off is limited to deposits made in good faith, in the ordinary course of business, and subject to withdrawal at the will of the depositor\"). The Trustee also raised a new claim. Asserting her strong arm powers under \u00a7 544(a)(1), the Trustee sought to \"avoid\" the pledge agreement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   because it was not notarized and thus failed to satisfy the authentication requirement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=P.R.%20Laws%20Ann.%20tit.%2031%2C%20%C2%A7%205023\">\n    P.R.

Significantly, BPPR acknowledged that it had \"placed a hold on [the 1438 account] for a total amount of $ 31,434.17 as [a] guarantee for the personal loan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   BPPR maintained that the pledge agreement satisfied the requirements for a valid pledge prescribed in Article 1756 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=P.R.%20Laws%20Ann.%20tit.%2031%2C%20%C2%A7%205001\">\n    P.R.

BPPR claimed that the \"Debtor gave his consent by signing the loan note and pledge agreement for BPPR to hold the amount of $ 31,434.17 as a guarantee for the approved personal loan.\" BPPR argued that the Debtor \"could continue using [the 1438 account] by depositing and withdrawing monies in excess of the guaranteed amount.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   BPPR also challenged the Trustee's authentication argument, asserting that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico held in\n   <em>\n    Ramos Mimoso v.

BPPR attempted to reconcile the inherent inconsistency in its position by explaining that it looked to the Puerto Rico Civil Code merely to supply the definition of a pledge and then turned to the PR UCC to establish that it had a perfected security interest in the 1438 account, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Section 2264 of the [PR UCC] establishes that a security interest in a deposit\n   account is perfected by control of the collateral.

The Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After the bankruptcy court received the motion for summary judgment and cross-motion, it entered an order directing the parties \"to file opposing [statements of] material facts\" pursuant to Rule 56(c) of the Local Civil Rules for the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. In response, the Trustee and BPPR filed a \"joint motion in compliance,\" representing that the cross-motions did \"not require opposing statements since there [were] no material facts in controversy and the remaining unresolved dispute [was] primarily legal.\" Thereafter, the bankruptcy court, relying on the \"stipulated [ ] salient\" facts set forth in the parties' respective statements of uncontested material facts, and without a hearing, entered the Order that is the subject of this appeal.\n   <em>\n    Wiscovitch v.

The court then ruled that BPPR \"had a valid and enforceable lien on the Debtor's savings\n   account\" which was not subject to avoidance under \u00a7 544(a) and, therefore, it was unnecessary to address the Trustee's request for turnover.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.

Having concluded its analysis with a\n   determination that BPPR's security interest was perfected in accordance with the PR UCC and thus BPPR as a secured creditor was entitled to apply the funds in the 1438 account upon the Debtor's default, the bankruptcy court did not need to consider or apply the setoff requirements of Puerto Rico's Civil Code discussed above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Cruz Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203702481\">\n    2018 WL 3702481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Our own examination of the record reveals no dispute between the parties that the funds on deposit in the 1438 account were unavailable to the Debtor for withdrawal at will.

Consistent with this representation, BPPR acknowledged in its statement of uncontested facts that it had placed \"a hold\" on the 1438 account \"for a total amount of $ 31,434.17 as [a] guarantee\" for the loan. Because the 1438 account was a special account, the requisite mutuality was not present and setoff was not permitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Ben Franklin Retail Store, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6457559\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/202/955/#p957\">\n    202 B.R. at 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Trustee was, therefore, entitled to summary judgment with respect to the setoff issue. The difficulty, however, is that if BPPR's security interest in the 1438 account was valid and unavoidable by the Trustee, the unavailability of setoff rights becomes irrelevant. This was the conclusion of the bankruptcy court, but we are unable to determine if it was properly reached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   While we conclude that BPPR could not exercise setoff rights against the 1438 account, we are unable to conclude from the record before us whether BPPR's security interest in the account was avoidable by the Trustee.

Moreover, although the Trustee furnished translations of the Spanish-language exhibits to the summary judgment motion on appeal-including English-language versions of the note and pledge agreement-we may not consider them for two reasons. First, our review is limited to the evidentiary record compiled in the bankruptcy court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Crefisa, Inc. v. Wash. Mut. Bank, F.A. (In re Colonial Mortg.

We note, however, that even if we were to conclude that the Trustee had waived the argument, the nature of de novo review would nonetheless require us to reach the issue of whether the bankruptcy court correctly determined, as a matter of law, that the PR UCC governs, or whether the underlying transaction is excluded from the scope of the PR UCC.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Knight Kitchen Music v.
