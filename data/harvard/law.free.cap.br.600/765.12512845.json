The court conducted a hearing in Raleigh, North Carolina on November 5, 2018. James B. Angell, Esq. appeared for the Trustee, and George M. Oliver, Esq. appeared for Landress. Based upon the pleadings and the affidavits and answers to interrogatories and admissions filed with the court, the court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  This matter is a core proceeding pursuant to\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , and the court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n  <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20151\">\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 157, and 1334.

The court appointed the Trustee as Chapter 11 trustee on August 28, 2015. On April 25, 2016, upon motion of the Trustee, the court converted the case to a case under Chapter 7 and appointed the Trustee to fulfill the duties as provided in\n  <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n   11 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n  </extracted-citation>\n  .\n </opinion>\n <attorneys id=\"p-12\">\n  The Debtor was one of three managing partners of MMJ Partners, LLP (\"MMJ\"), formerly known as Parish Capital Advisors, LLP from April 2, 2012 until this case converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding. Charles E. Merritt (\"Merritt\") and David Jeffrey (\"Jeffrey\") are the remaining two managing partners of MMJ. MMJ is a Delaware limited liability partnership with its principal business office in Durham, North Carolina. MMJ filed a Statement of Qualification with the Delaware Secretary of State\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  on May 18, 2006 under its former name of Parish Capital Advisors, LLP and updated its name to MMJ with a Certificate of Amendment filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on April 5, 2012. The MMJ Partnership Agreement (\"Partnership Agreement\") states that it \"shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.\" According to Merritt, MMJ manages investments in other entities and \"invests money for the purpose of earning a profit from the efforts of others.\" Neither the Trustee or Landress presented evidence that MMJ is not in good standing with the Delaware Secretary of State.\n </attorneys>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   6 Del.

On December 23, 2013, TOS borrowed the amount of $ 850,000.00 from Mutsy I, LLC (\"Mutsy\") pursuant to a Secured Convertible Promissory Note (\"Note\"). Mutsy is wholly owned and managed by Landress. On December 23, 2013, Mutsy advanced the amount of $ 820,000.00\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to TOS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In conjunction with the loan from Mutsy to TOS, the Debtor executed a Personal Guaranty\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a Security Agreement, both dated December 23, 2013. The Security Agreement purported to grant to Mutsy a security interest in \"(a) all right, title and interest of [the Debtor] in, to and under the MMJ Partnership Agreement and the partnership interests owned by [the Debtor] in MMJ; (b) all dividends and distributions payable in respect of such partnership interests and (c) all proceeds of the foregoing\" to secure payment of the Note. The Security Agreement states that it \"shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to conflicts of law rules ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Security Agreement states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [The Debtor] is the owner of the Collateral (or, in the case of after-acquired Collateral, at the time [the Debtor] acquires rights in the Collateral, will be the owner thereof) and that no other Person has (or in the case of after-acquired Collateral, at the time the [Debtor] acquires rights therein, will have) any right, title, claim or interest (by way of Lien or otherwise) in, against or to the Collateral, other than Permitted Liens; ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [T]he execution ... of this Agreement, and the performance and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not violate any provision of, or result in the breach ... of ... any material contract to which [the Debtor] is a party or by which [the Debtor] is bound;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [N]o consent, approval, ... or authorization of ... any ... other person or entity (including, without limitation, the shareholders of any entity) is required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than as have been obtained or made; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [The Debtor] hereby agrees (a) to perform all acts that may be necessary to maintain, preserve, protect and perfect the Collateral, the Lien granted to Secured Party therein and the perfection of such Lien ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Landress, a resident of California, was in Florida when the attorney-in-fact for Mutsy executed the Security Agreement in New York. Neither Landress nor the Debtor resides in New York, but the Debtor, a resident of North Carolina, was in New York on vacation with his children when he signed the Security Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Debtor did not provide Landress or Mutsy with a copy of the Partnership Agreement prior to the closing of the loan. The Partnership Agreement defines a \"Partnership Interest\" as all of a partner's interests in MMJ, including the economic interest (the right to distributions) and management rights. Net profits, as defined by the Partnership Agreement, are distributed to partners' capital accounts, and transferees of partnership interests succeed to the capital account if a transfer of an interest is made in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement. The Partnership Agreement further limits distribution rights to \"Persons shown in the Required Records to be Partners on the actual date of distribution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The definition of a \"transfer\" within the Partnership Agreement includes an \"attempt to create or grant a security interest.\" The Partnership Agreement states\n   that \"[a]ny Transfer or purported Transfer of a Partnership Interest shall be null and void unless made strictly in accordance with the terms and conditions of [the Partnership Agreement] .... [N]o Partner or other holder of a Partnership Interest may pledge or hypothecate its Partnership Interest to secure a debt or other obligation of any Person without the consent of the Board.\" The \"Board\" is defined within the Partnership Agreement as \"a group comprising all Managing Partners,\" and if one partner has a direct or indirect interest in a matter, the remaining, disinterested managing partners must make whatever determination is before the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Except for transfers permitted under the Partnership Agreement provisions governing transfers upon incapacity or death and transfers to a partner's control affiliate,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   a Person holding a Partnership Interest may Transfer his Partnership Interest, or any part thereof, only pursuant to a written, bona fide offer to purchase such Partnership Interest solely for cash ... and only if such Partner ... prior to acceptance of such Third Party Offer, delivers a written offer ... to sell the ... Partnership Interest ... to each of the Managing Partners ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Partnership Agreement also states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Any Transfer of a Partnership Interest to a Person that is not a Partner prior to such Transfer shall be effective to give the Transferee only the right to receive the allocations of Net Profits and Net Losses and distributions to which the Transferor would have been entitled if the Transfer had not been made, and shall not be effective to admit the Transferee as a Partner.\n   <em>\n    The Partnership need not give effect to a Transferee's rights under this Section 12.4(a) until it has notice of the Transfer and, if the Partnership requests, reasonable proof of the Transfer.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to Merritt's affidavit, the Partnership Agreement's restrictions on transfers of partnership interests in MMJ are in place because of the following factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1. The Partnership Agreement deems confidential certain commercially valuable information about affiliate entities; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2. The Partnership Agreement requires partners to make certain capital contributions to MMJ.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Merritt asserts \"[i]t would be detrimental to the other Partners in the Partnership if a Partner were unable to fund a capital contribution.\" It would follow that if a partner could unilaterally grant a lien on distributions, then that partner's ability to fund capital contributions could also be compromised. A partnership agreement that fails to recognize these potential problems may be woefully inadequate to protect the longevity of that partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Trustee states as an undisputed fact that Mutsy was unaware of the restriction on the transfer of the Debtor's interest in MMJ when the Debtor signed the Security Agreement. In his affidavit, the Debtor asserts that he told Landress on December 23, 2013 (the date of the closing) that the pledge of his interest in MMJ was subject to the consent of the other partners of MMJ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 14, 2014, Landress\n   emailed the Debtor and requested a copy of the signed Partnership Agreement. On February 14, 2014, Landress again requested the signed Partnership Agreement and requested the \"consent [of the other partners to the terms of the Security Agreement] - per consent plan we agreed you would follow.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Note had an initial maturity date of April 30, 2014. On April 16, 2014, an attorney for Landress sent to the Debtor a proposed \"Allonge\" meant to incorporate into the Security Agreement \"MMJ and its partners' approval of the pledge of collateral and ... an executed copy of the MMJ Partnership Agreement ....\" In May of 2014, another attorney for Landress sent an email to the Debtor requesting \"true, accurate and complete copies of all documents that reflect[ed the Debtor's] interests in MMJ and all other entities. That attorney also requested \"the name, phone number, and an email address for every MMJ partner and every other interested party ....\" Landress again asked the Debtor for a copy of the Partnership Agreement on September 9, 2014 and also requested an \"accounting of all income to and distributions from the MMJ Partnership to the partners that occurred in 2013 and 2014.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Debtor informed Landress on September 11, 2014 that he could not \"pledge MMJ.\" The Debtor emailed the Partnership Agreement to Landress on September 30, 2014. Sometime after the Debtor filed his bankruptcy petition, Landress also sent a text message to the Debtor stating \"Just so we're clear, I funded on your assurance that you'd get the MMJ consents immediately after closing. No brainer was your term. I don't recall that changing until, a good while later, you told me they declined.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Neither Merritt nor Jeffrey consented to the Debtor's pledging his interest in MMJ, as collateral for a loan or otherwise, either before the Debtor filed his bankruptcy petition on December 8, 2014, or post-petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At some point, Landress executed a Secured Convertible Promissory Note Assignment Agreement and Notice transferring Mutsy's interest in the Note to Landress, with an effective date of December 23, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It appears from Landress' responses to the Trustee's request for production of documents that Landress may have filed a financing statement to perfect his purported lien on the Debtor's interest in MMJ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Landress filed Proof of Claim 29-1 (\"Claim\") on August 1, 2016, asserting a secured claim in the amount of $ 1,275,000.00 based on the Note and Security Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Trustee filed an Objection to the Claim on December 13, 2016, asserting various grounds for disallowance of the Claim, including that the Partnership Agreement \"states that [the Debtor] cannot pledge or assign his partnership interest\n   without unanimous consent of other MMJ partners, which did not occur.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Landress filed a Response to the Objection on February 16, 2017, asserting that New York law, which is identified in the Security Agreement as governing law, \"serves to override contractual restrictions on assignment and pledges in an agreement between an account debtor (including a partnership) and assignor (including a partner of a partnership).\" At the hearing on the Motion, Landress also asserted that North Carolina law that was in effect in December 2013 also overrode contractual restrictions on assignment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specially, Landress asserts that as of the date of the Note and Security Agreement, the prohibitive terms within the Partnership Agreement did not preclude the Debtor from assigning his interest in MMJ to secure the Note under the North Carolina law in effect at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The parties have treated the Objection as a contested matter pursuant to Rule 9014 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, and the Trustee has engaged in discovery. Landress has had the opportunity to undertake discovery with respect to the Debtor, but he has not conducted that discovery. Pursuant to Rule 9014(c), Rule 7056 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, which incorporates Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and governs summary judgment, applies to contested matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Trustee asserts that no genuine issue of material fact exists regarding two grounds for sustaining the Objection. First, the Trustee asserts the undisputed facts show \"Mutsy and [the Debtor] had an express agreement that the Security Agreement would not be effective until the partners of MMJ consented to the transfer.\" Second, the Trustee asserts no genuine issue of material fact exists related to whether the Claim is secured, because the Debtor did not successfully pledge his partnership interest or related distributions as security for payment of the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To support his propositions, the Trustee has filed affidavits from the Debtor and Merritt. The Merritt affidavit includes as an attachment the Partnership Agreement which governed MMJ at the time the Debtor executed the Security Agreement. The Trustee also has filed Landress' answers to the Trustee's interrogatories and request for admissions and production of documents. Landress filed an affidavit supporting his position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 56, \"summary judgment is proper 'if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\n   a judgment as a matter of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

The court must examine whether the Debtor successfully pledged his interest despite the restrictions contained in the Partnership Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As a starting point to an examination into whether the Debtor's pledge of his interest in MMJ is effective, the court must determine which state's substantive law governs its analysis. \"A bankruptcy court may ... face situations in which the applicable federal law incorporates matters which are the subject of state law.

If the court were to find the Debtor successfully pledged his interest in MMJ as security for the Note, then Landress would have a lien on distributions from MMJ, and under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the distributions are inextricably linked to capital contributions from the MMJ partners. The interest of MMJ in maintaining consistency between the contributors of capital and the recipients of distributions is sufficiently related to the internal affairs of MMJ to require application of the internal affairs doctrine. It is therefore worth briefly examining the result from application of the New York and North Carolina adoptions of the UCC, because if the result were the same no matter which law applied, then the court's application of the internal affairs doctrine would be unnecessary. Assuming the provisions of UCC \u00a7\u00a7 9-406 and 9-408, as adopted by and effective in December 2013 in New York and North Carolina, apply to anti-assignment provisions in agreements between partners of a partnership,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the following outcomes are possible:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   1. If the partnership interest were treated as a payment intangible with no governance rights in MMJ associated with it, \u00a7 9-406(d) would invalidate any provision within the Partnership Agreement which \"prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of ... the account debtor\" to \"the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in ... the payment intangible [partnership interest].\" UCC \u00a7 9-406. Under a liberal reading of \u00a7 9-406, ignoring that the Partnership Agreement requires approval of the managing partners (acting as the board), and not MMJ itself for the creation of a security interest in a partner's interest, application of New York or North Carolina law could conceivably yield the result in the Debtor being able to override the terms of the Partnership Agreement and encumber the economic distributions associated with his partnership interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   2.
