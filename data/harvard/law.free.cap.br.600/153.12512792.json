The account consists of a nonqualified, tax deferred annuity with a surrender value of $ 105,000. Mr. Soori opposed the Trustee's objection, and on January 23, 2019, the Court held a final hearing and took this contested matter under advisement. In reaching its determination, the Court has carefully considered the parties' relevant filings and respective arguments, their agreed statement of undisputed facts and attached exhibits, the various state exemption statutes in issue, and applicable case law. The Court concludes that the Fidelity account and the annuity it contains are not exempt from the bankruptcy estate under the Rhode Island statutes upon which Mr. Soori relies. He may, however, exempt $ 6,400 of the annuity's liquidated proceeds under R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 9-26-4(16), the state catch-all exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

This is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) and (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Relevant Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Despite the Court's urgings to the contrary, and except for a brief period, Mr.\n   Soori has represented himself. Getting to the point where this matter is ripe for final determination has followed a long, winding, and bumpy road. Along the way the parties have amended and refined their respective arguments. For brevity's sake, the Court will avoid discussing all the twists and turns and limit the background information to what is particularly germane to its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Soori and his wife Stephanie Tamgho filed their joint voluntary petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on April 10, 2017 (\"Filing Date\"). About a month later the Debtors amended their bankruptcy schedules (\"Amended Schedules,\" Doc. # 21). On Amended Schedule A/B: Property, under the category of \"deposits of money,\" the Debtors listed a \"Fidelity Trust/UTMA Account[ ]: 323026826\" (\"Fidelity Account\"). On Amended Schedule C: Property Exempt, they claimed an exemption in the Fidelity Account for an \"unknown amount.\" The Debtors also indicated that there may be other accounts at various financial institutions that were established for Mr. Soori's benefit when he was a minor, but they provided no specific information about these possible accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In accordance with her duties, the Trustee contacted various financial institutions to locate other potential accounts and obtain information about the Fidelity Account. In due course, the Trustee learned that the Fidelity Account actually contained a nonqualified, tax deferred variable annuity (\"Annuity\"). On June 6, 2018, with the assistance of counsel at the time, the Debtors filed their second amended bankruptcy schedules (\"Second Amended Schedules,\" Doc. # 63). On Second Amended Schedule A/B, the Debtors accurately list the Fidelity Account as consisting of the Annuity. On Second Amended Schedule C, the Debtors elect state and federal non-bankruptcy exemptions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) and claim the full amount of the Fidelity Account and the Annuity proceeds as exempt under R.I.

Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The facts relevant to the analysis of this matter are not in dispute. The Court makes the following findings of fact based on the Agreed Statement of Facts, Disputed Facts and Supporting Documents (\"Agreed Statement,\" Doc. # 108) submitted by the parties, the exhibits attached to the Agreed Statement, which include the application for the purchase of the annuity\n   and the annuity contract, and other exhibits attached to the parties' various filings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Soori was born on March 15, 1983. In Omaha, Nebraska, on April 1, 1998, Mr. Soori's father, Gamini S. Sooriyaarachchi, completed and submitted an application to purchase a \"Variable and Fixed Annuity Issued and Administered by Fidelity Investment\" for Mr. Soori's benefit (\"Application,\" Doc. # 108, Exhibit A). On April 6, 1998, Mr. Soori's father opened the UGMA/UTMA Fidelity Account with Fidelity Investment Life Insurance (\"Fidelity\"), in the name of \"Gamini S. Sooriyaarachchi as custodian for Marcus C.B. Soori-arachi,\" account number 323026826. That same day he purchased the non-qualified deferred variable Annuity for $ 10,040.77, which is held in the Fidelity Account. The terms of the Annuity are governed by the deferred annuity contract issued by Fidelity also on April 6, 1998 (\"Annuity Contract,\" Doc. # 108, Exhibit B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the Annuity Contract, the maturity date of the Annuity is April 1, 2068. On that date, the designated annuitant may make an election of payment distributions if the Annuity Contract has not previously been liquidated. The Application and the Annuity Contract designate Mr. Soori as the annuitant (\"Annuitant\"). As the Annuitant, Mr. Soori had the right to access the Fidelity Account and liquidate the Annuity for its surrender value when he turned 19 on March 15, 2002. Notwithstanding, the Annuity remains in full force and effect and no funds have been withdrawn from the Fidelity Account since its inception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Annuity Contract includes a death benefit payable to the designated beneficiary of the Annuity. The beneficiary receives the funds upon the death of the Annuity owner and Annuitant named on the Application. The Application and Annuity Contract identify Mr. Soori as the Annuity owner (\"Owner\") and his probate estate as the primary beneficiary (\"Beneficiary\") entitled to receive the Annuity proceeds upon his death. These designations have never been changed since the issuance of the Annuity Contract and the Annuity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 17, 2017, the Trustee notified Fidelity of Mr. Soori's bankruptcy filing and requested that the ownership of the Fidelity Account be updated to reflect that Mr. Soori was no longer a minor. Based on this information, Fidelity amended the owner of the Fidelity Account from \"Gamini S. Sooriyaarachchi as custodian for\" Marcus Soori to simply Marcus Soori. This change was effective on October 30, 2017, and Mr. Soori, individually, was the\n   designated Owner and Annuitant of the Annuity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In summary, Mr. Soori is the Annuity Owner and Annuitant, and his probate estate is the designated Beneficiary of the Annuity and entitled to its proceeds upon Mr. Soori's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Positions of the Parties\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Exemption Under RIGL \u00a7 27-4-11\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Trustee objects to the exemption of the Fidelity Account under RIGL \u00a7 27-4-11, contending that it only applies to life insurance policies and is limited to protecting life insurance proceeds from the claims of the insured's creditors. (Doc. ## 65, 114). In support, the Trustee refers to the separate definitions of \"annuities\" and \"life insurance\" in RIGL \u00a7 27-4-0.1(a) and (c). She also cites the Rhode Island Superior Court case of\n   <em>\n    Rhode Island Hospital Trust National Bank v. Silverman\n   </em>\n   , in which that court applied RIGL \u00a7 27-4-11 to prevent an insured's creditors from attaching the life insurance policy's unexercised cash surrender value. No. C.A. PC 1994-1182,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%20220786\">\n    2002 WL 220786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (R.I. Super. Feb. 5, 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In opposition, Mr. Soori maintains that RIGL \u00a7 27-4-11 applies to\n   <em>\n    any type\n   </em>\n   of insurance product. (Doc. # 66). He initially argued that the Annuity was a life insurance policy covered by the statute because it contained a death benefit, but now asserts that the Annuity is exempt because it is a type of insurance and falls within the ambit of the statute. To bolster his argument, he relies on the first five words of the statute: \"[i]f a policy of insurance ...,\" the use of the term \"insurer\" in the definition of annuities in RIGL \u00a7 27-4-0.1(a), as well as regulations of the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation and information on the agency's website, which includes a discussion about annuities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Soori also argues that RIGL \u00a7 27-4-11 protects the Fidelity Account from the claims of his creditors because the Trustee's allegedly improper post-petition actions changed his status as a \"beneficiary\" under the Annuity Contract to that of an owner and \"insured\" as referenced in RIGL \u00a7 27-4-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Exemption Under RIGL \u00a7 27-18-24\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Next, the Trustee objects to Mr. Soori's exemption of the Fidelity Account under\n   RIGL \u00a7 27-18-24, arguing that the statute is inapplicable because the Annuity Contract is not a \"policy of accident and sickness.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. ## 65, 114). She points out that the Annuity Contract does not reference loss or death of any person due to illness or accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   It appears Mr. Soori has conceded this point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. ## 66, 73, 120. While he references RIGL \u00a7 27-18-24 in rejecting the Trustee's argument that an annuity is not an insurance policy, he does not address the statute in any further detail. Little discussion of this exemption claim is required by the Court. It is abundantly clear that the statute does not apply because the Annuity Contract is not an insurance policy covering loss resulting from \"accident or sickness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Exemption Under RIGL \u00a7 27-4-12\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Trustee's final argument is that RIGL \u00a7 27-4-12 does not protect the Annuity proceeds and surrender value from the claims of Mr. Soori's creditors because he is and has always been the Owner of the Annuity under the Annuity Contract, and the statute only protects the proceeds from the claims of the named Beneficiary's creditors. She also maintains that informing Fidelity of Mr. Soori's attainment of the age of majority did not result in an improper change of ownership, nor did it impact his alleged \"beneficiary status\" under Nebraska's UTMA or the Annuity Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Soori counters that the Fidelity Account is fully exempt under this statute because he was the UTMA/UGMA beneficiary of the Fidelity Account on the Filing Date. Citing Nebraska's Uniform Transfers to Minors Act codified in Neb. Rev. St. \u00a7\u00a7 43-2701 to 43-2724 (\"Nebraska's UTMA\"), he argues that this statute controls his designation as the beneficiary of the Fidelity Account and \"supersedes any definition of 'beneficiary' in the [A]nnuity [C]ontract.\" (Doc. ## 73, 120). The Trustee's post-petition actions resulting in the reissuance of the Annuity Contract in his name, he asserts, did not comply with Nebraska's UTMA. Thus, he posits that he was and remains the beneficiary of the Fidelity Account and the account is exempt under RIGL \u00a7 27-4-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Contrary to his argument, the \"Protection of Proceeds\" provision has never restricted Mr. Soori's rights because he has always been the Owner and Annuitant under the Annuity Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Because the custodial property-the Fidelity Account, the Annuity, and the Annuity Contract-were indefeasibly vested in Mr. Soori and only managed by his custodian father until Mr. Soori's 19\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   birthday, the Trustee's post-petition notification to Fidelity of Mr. Soori's adulthood was entirely appropriate. Nor was the reissuance of the Annuity Contract to reflect Mr. Soori's exclusive ownership of the Annuity improper. Fidelity's actions did not constitute an actual or invalid change of ownership under the Annuity Contract as Mr. Soori asserts. Further, in no way did reissuance of the contract result in Mr. Soori's removal as a previously designated minor beneficiary under Nebraska's UTMA because the custodianship was only effective while he remained a minor. Hence, the actions of the Trustee and Fidelity were administrative acts in compliance with Nebraska's UTMA requirements and in furtherance of its purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    3.

This statute states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Any policy of life or endowment insurance or any annuity contract may provide that the proceeds of or payments under it shall not be subject to transfer, anticipation, or commutation or encumbrance by any beneficiary other than the insured or the purchaser of the annuity, and shall not be subject to the claims of a creditor of any beneficiary or any legal process against the beneficiary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   RIGL \u00a7 27-4-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This anti-alienation statute appears to be the only specific Rhode Island exemption that applies to nonqualified annuities such as Mr. Soori's Annuity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RIGL \u00a7 9-26-4(11) and (12) (exempting certain qualified\n   <em>\n    retirement\n   </em>\n   annuities from claims of creditors). Although there is no Rhode Island case law or legislative commentary addressing RIGL \u00a7 27-4-12's application, the statute's plain and unambiguous language shows the legislature's intent to protect annuity proceeds and payments from improvident actions by beneficiaries and out of the reach of their creditors.

Considering this background and the General Assembly's enactment of RIGL \u00a7 27-4-12 in 1931, it is likely that it was initially intended to \"protect life insurance proceeds paid by an insurance company to a beneficiary, in installments or through an annuity, from the creditors of that beneficiary.\"\n   <em>\n    May\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151648\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/478/431/#p436\">\n    478 B.R. at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing legislative policy of\n   similar Colorado exemption statute enacted in 1925).

On the Filing Date, Mr. Soori was the adult Owner under the Annuity Contract with the contractual rights to assign the Annuity, designate beneficiaries under the Annuity, and surrender the Annuity and receive the liquidation proceeds. Because his probate estate is the named Beneficiary under the Annuity Contract, he may not avail himself of the benefits the Annuity Contract's Protection of Proceeds provision and RIGL \u00a7 27-4-12's protection afforded the Annuity Beneficiary. The Court's conclusion effectuates the terms of the Annuity Contract and the statute's limited application to named annuity beneficiaries. By excluding the \"insured or the purchaser of the annuity\" from the category of persons within the scope of an annuity anti-alienation provision, RIGL \u00a7 27-4-12 acknowledges the contractual rights of an annuity's owner, while limiting its protection of the annuity proceeds to the named annuity beneficiaries who, as non-owners, lack the power to exercise dominion and control over an annuity policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.
