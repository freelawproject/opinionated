Whether Debtor's Actions Constitute Fraud Under Section 727(d)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 727(d)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code states that the Court \"shall revoke a discharge\" if (1) the debtor obtained the discharge through fraud; and (2) the requesting party did not know of the fraud prior to the granting of the discharge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under section 727(d)(1), it is the debtor's fraud in obtaining the discharge that qualifies as grounds for revocation, and not the debtor's fraud vis-\u00e0-vis the creditor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Generally, it is insufficient that a debtor's fraud rendered a particular debt nondischargeable; the claimant must allege that the entire discharge would not have been granted but for the debtor's fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The types of fraud that would have prevented a debtor from receiving a discharge in the first place are contained within section 727(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   The list includes: transferring property within one year of the bankruptcy with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor; concealing, destroying, or falsifying records of the debtor's financial condition or business transactions; making a false oath; withholding recorded information; and failing to explain a loss of assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such actions are different from the acts listed in section 523\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   which will result in the denial of the discharge of a particular debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, Orozco's claim for revocation of discharge relates back to Franco's alleged fraudulent listing of Eureste's address in time to permit a timely filing of a proof of claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, Orozco's claim would result in the denial of the discharge of a particular debt, and is not the type of conduct that would result in the denial of the entire discharge under section 727. As such, Orozco's section 727 claim must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Assuming arguendo, that Orozco's complaint is the type of conduct that would normally result in the denial of the entire discharge, Orozco fails to establish that Franco committed fraud under section 727. To establish fraud under section 727(d)(1), Orozco bears the burden in showing that Franco's mistake in misspelling Eureste's address was knowingly and fraudulently made, and that the mistake was material.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   An omission or mistake is material if it bears a relationship to the debtor's estate, or concerns the disposition of his property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Orozco can sustain his burden of proving fraud by demonstrating either that Franco was aware of the misspelled address, and that the failure to correctly list the address could seriously mislead Orozco, or that Franco acted so recklessly in misspelling the address that fraud is implied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the revocation of a discharge under section 727(d) is an extraordinary remedy to be sparingly applied, it is construed strictly against any objecting party and liberally in favor of the debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Proving that a debtor's actions were taken knowingly and with fraudulent intent is not a simple matter, for it is rare that one will willingly provide direct evidence of fraudulent intent. Absent a showing of actual intent to deceive, fraudulent intent may be proved by showing a reckless indifference for the truth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such fraudulent intent can often be found through an examination of a course of conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    The Cadle Company v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held that the debtors demonstrated a reckless disregard for the truth in connection with numerous false statements in their original and amended bankruptcy petitions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not only did the debtors' original and amended schedules contain numerous false statements, the debtors failed to amend their schedules to correct their errors and omissions, and failed to review their schedules to ensure they were accurate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such conduct was enough to revoke the debtors'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   discharge under section 727.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   While it may be impossible to produce Schedules that contain no mistaken information, and mistakes are per se not enough to bar a discharge, a pattern of withholding information and thwarting the bankruptcy process may indicate fraudulent intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Here, this Court finds that Orozco has failed to present sufficient evidence that Franco's discharge was obtained through fraud. Unlike\n   <em>\n    The Cadle Company\n   </em>\n   where there were numerous false statements, errors, and omissions within the debtors' schedules, what is before this Court is a singular instance of Eureste's address being altered by one-letter. Even though Franco had notice through the state court proceeding that Eureste's proper address was 122 Tuam St., Ste. 100, Houston, Texas 77006,\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   a simple typographical error of the street name \"\n   <em>\n    Yuam\n   </em>\n   ,\" in and of itself does not establish actual fraud or reckless indifference to the truth for this Court. Here, the burden of proof rests on Orozco to prove that Franco was aware of the misspelled address, or that he acted so recklessly in misspelling the address that fraud is implied. Orozco has failed to present any evidence that Franco engaged in a course of conduct that would lead to a finding of fraud by this Court. The only error in Franco's Schedules was the misspelling of Eureste's street name.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the fact that Trevino's letter to Eureste was addressed with the incorrect \"\n   <em>\n    Yuam\n   </em>\n   \" address and still confirmed delivered further cuts against Orozco's argument that Franco engaged in fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the revocation of a discharge under section 727(d) is to be strictly construed against the objecting party, and Orozco has failed to carry his burden of proving that Franco's act of misspelling Eureste's address rises to the level of fraud contemplated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Orozco's request for revocation of Franco's discharge cannot survive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under section 727(d)(1), the Court shall revoke a discharge if the debtor obtained the discharge through fraud, and the requesting party did not know of the fraud prior to the granting of the discharge. The fraud under section 727(d) must be fraud relating to the entire discharge, and cannot be fraud upon an individual creditor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Orozco's fraud claim relates only specifically to himself as a creditor. As such, Franco's conduct is not the type of conduct that would result in the denial of the debtor's entire discharge under section 727. Even assuming that Orozco states a valid section 727(d) claim, Franco's conduct does not rise to the level of fraud as to warrant a revocation of a discharge under section 727(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A revocation of a discharge under section 727(d) is an extraordinary remedy that is to be used sparingly, and is construed strictly against the objecting party and liberally in favor of the debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   order to establish fraud under section 727(d)(1), Orozco must show that Franco's act or mistake of misspelling Eureste's address was made with fraudulent intent. Fraudulent intent is usually shown through an examination of a course of conduct, involving multiple errors and omissions. Here, the only evidence that Orozco brought before this Court is that Franco misspelled \"Tuam\" and nothing more. On its own, this is not enough to establish that Franco engaged in fraudulent intent under section 727(d). Because Orozco has failed to carry his burden in showing that Franco obtained a discharge through fraud, Orozco's claim for revocation of Franco's discharge must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <em>\n     Grogan v.
