[SHR Bankr., dkt. nos. 151, 156.] In the Sales Motion, the Trustee sought approval to sell the Tehani for $ 32,500.00 and the Trailer for $ 2,500.00 to Aloha Ocean Excursions, LLC (\"AOE\" or \"the Buyer\").

[Dkt. nos. 14, 33.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] The primary basis of the 3/14/17 Order was the fact that Barnes did not obtain a stay of the 5/9/16 Bankruptcy Order.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20988655\">\n    2017 WL 988655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 31, 2017, Barnes filed a motion for reconsideration of the 3/14/17 Order and an errata to the motion for reconsideration.

The Mandate was issued on the same date as the Ninth Circuit Order.

On remand, the bankruptcy court concluded that, because of the Ninth Circuit's reversal of the dismissal of Barnes's claims against the Tehani, Barnes had prudential standing to seek a stay of the sale of the Tehani pending appeal.

As to the second holding, the Ninth Circuit noted a maritime lien: 1) \"accompanies the property into the hands of a bona fide purchaser[, and] can be executed and divested only by a proceeding in rem\"; and 2) \"cannot be extinguished except through the application of admiralty law.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516838\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/517/#p523\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516838\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/517/#p523\">\n     at 534\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

While the bankruptcy court noted, in its 12/14/18 Remand Decision, that the Ninth Circuit held that the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate Barnes's maritime lien, [12/14/18 Remand Decision at 7,] a closer look at why the bankruptcy court was without jurisdiction is instructive. The Ninth Circuit stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    The bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Barnes's maritime lien\n    <strong>\n     because the admiralty court had already obtained jurisdiction over the Tehani\n    </strong>\n    . \"As between two courts of concurrent and co-ordinate jurisdiction, having like jurisdiction over the subject-matter in controversy, the court which first obtains jurisdiction is entitled to retain it without interference, and cannot be deprived of its right to do so because it may not have first obtained physical possession of the property in dispute.\"\n    <em>\n     Moran v.
