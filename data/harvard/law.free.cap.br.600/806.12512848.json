Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 18, 2015, Debtor filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Doc. 1. The Internal Revenue Service and Creditor Central Trenching, Inc. were among five creditors that filed proofs of claim. The IRS's amended claim\n   identifies total tax liabilities of $ 130,247.45 for tax years 2011-2014, with a priority claim of $ 119,534.10. Claim No. 1-3. Central Trenching filed a general unsecured claim in the sum of $ 276,699.29 arising from a 2014 judgment against Debtor and in favor of Central Trenching. Claim No. 6-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In October 2015, Bankruptcy Trustee Gene Doeling initiated a lawsuit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that Central Trenching's levy against $ 347,743.18 on deposit in Debtor's bank account and the subsequent transfer of funds to Central Trenching was an avoidable preference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. No. 15-7022. In its answer, Central Trenching admitted receiving the funds, but it claimed the funds related solely to work it performed for Debtor and were impressed with an equitable lien in Central Trenching's favor. Adv. No. 15-7022, Doc. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The day before the scheduled trial on the preference action, the Trustee and Central Trenching settled the adversary proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv.

Doc. 121. In its objection, Central Trenching asserts that the IRS's priority claim in the sum of $ 119,534.10 is \"overstated as a consequence of the failure of the [IRS] to acknowledge and accept the amended 2013 tax return filed by Debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   More specifically, Central Trenching argues that Debtor's tax liability for 2013 should be amended to reduce the IRS's claim from $ 119,534.10 to an amount not greater than $ 52,955.89.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 121.

Doc. 136. In its response, the United States argues that the Court should overrule Central Trenching's objection for three reasons: first, Central Trenching has not met its burden to come forward with sufficient evidence to rebut the validity of the IRS's claim; second, Central Trenching lacks standing to object; and third, the objection serves no bankruptcy purpose, and therefore, the Court should abstain from considering it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the alternative, the United States requests the Court require Central Trenching to state with particularity the basis of its objection and provide the IRS a discovery period to evaluate the objection.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court held a hearing on the objection on December 4, 2018. At the hearing, the Court raised its concern that Central Trenching does not have standing to contest Debtor's tax liability. The Court provided the parties an opportunity to brief this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Central Trenching filed its post-hearing brief on January 11, 2019. Doc. 144. In its brief, Central Trenching argues that it has standing to object to the IRS's proof of claim because it is a \"party in interest\" under section 502. It requests the Court sustain its objection and \"determine the propriety of the IRS's claim\" under Bankruptcy Code section 505(a), which empowers a bankruptcy court to determine a debtor's tax liability. Doc. 144 at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its post-hearing brief filed on February 1, 2019, the United States argues that Central Trenching does not have standing to bring a section 505 claim and has not sought derivative standing to bring its objection on behalf of the estate. Doc. 145. It also reasserts its request that this Court abstain from hearing Central Trenching's challenge to Debtor's tax liability. For the reasons that follow, Central Trenching's objection to Claim No. 1-3 is overruled because it does not have standing to challenge Debtor's tax liability under section 505. Even if Central Trenching had standing, the Court would abstain from determining Debtor's tax liability under section 505(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

According to the IRS, Debtor reported a large carryback loss for a 2015 tax year Schedule C business in his amended 2013 return (which Central Trenching filed on his behalf). Doc. 136 at 13. The IRS maintains that \"to substantiate this loss, rebut the IRS claim, and establish the correct tax liability, Central Trenching would, at a minimum, likely have to provide documentary support for each item on the 2015 Schedule C (including all of the reported business expenses) and each item on the 2013 return.\" Doc. 136 at 13. Based on the nature of this process, it is apparent that Debtor's tax liability, if incorrect, is either based on Debtor's failure to properly document and report his income and expenses or on the IRS's failure to properly calculate Debtor's tax liability. The dispute is between the IRS and Debtor or the bankruptcy estate. If the IRS overtaxed Debtor, the resulting injury is to Debtor and his bankruptcy estate. Central Trenching's injury-the inability to collect the debt Debtor owes to it-cannot be fairly traced to the \"challenged action of the [IRS],\" as opposed to \"the independent action of some third party not before the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Simon v.

First, undertaking a section 505(a) analysis will not result in any benefit to the bankruptcy estate. Regardless of the Court's determination of Debtor's tax obligation, no additional assets will be made available for distribution to unsecured creditors with allowed claims. The Trustee filed his final report in September 2018 indicating he fully administered the bankruptcy estate and realized gross receipts of $ 181,109.16, which includes the $ 115,000 he recovered from Central Trenching.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 119.

Unsecured creditors, who do not receive a distribution under the Trustee's current proposal, would not benefit from a section 505 review.

The federal income tax liability of Debtor and his business, PKS II Industries, is at issue. According to the IRS, resolving the dispute in this case would require the Court to undertake a fact-intensive review of PKS II Industries' liability for tax year 2013 and determine how the 2013 assessment may impact or offset liability for tax years 2012 and/or 2014.

Debtor is not a party to this matter; he has not joined Central Trenching's objection, filed an objection or joined in Central Trenching's request for a determination of his tax liability under section 505.

Under such definition, the debtor's creditors are the primary parties in interest.\"). Central Trenching is no longer a creditor in Debtor's bankruptcy case. Central Trenching initially filed a proof of claim but later withdrew it in conjunction with its settlement of the adversary proceeding. \"Without an allowed claim, most courts hold that a party generally does not have the requisite pecuniary interest to be a 'party in interest.' \"\n    <em>\n     Maynard Sav.

Since Central Trenching no longer holds an allowed claim or ownership interest in estate assets, it would not be entitled to share in estate assets collected by the Trustee (unless the terms of the parties' settlement agreement is triggered-i.e., all creditors are paid in full or Debtor's tax liability is reduced). If the Court or the IRS reduces Debtor's prepetition tax liability, the Trustee will reimburse Central Trenching for the sum of the reduction under the Settlement Agreement. It is not clear whether its rights under this contract qualify Central Trenching as a \"party in interest\" under section 502.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Sandpoint Cattle Co., LLC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342685\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/556/408/#p417\">\n     556 B.R. 408\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 417 (Bankr.
