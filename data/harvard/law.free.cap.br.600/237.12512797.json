The Foreign Representative seeks recognition of the Brazilian RJ Proceeding for each of the Chapter 15 Debtors as either a foreign main proceeding or, in the alternative, as a foreign nonmain proceeding, pursuant to chapter 15 of title 11 of the United States Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1532 (the \"Bankruptcy Code\"). The Court must therefore determine the center of main interests (the \"COMI\") for each Chapter 15 Debtor in the enterprise group to determine whether-and to what extent-it should grant recognition of the Brazilian RJ Proceeding with respect to each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When deciding whether to grant recognition of a foreign proceeding, whether as a foreign main or foreign nonmain proceeding, the Court begins with the statutorily prescribed presumption that the COMI of each foreign debtor entity is the place where that entity has its registered office. Of these Chapter 15 Debtors, two have registered offices in Luxembourg, one has a registered office in the Cayman Islands, one has a registered office in Brazil, and six have registered offices in the British Virgin Islands. Because the Foreign\n   Representative seeks recognition of the Brazilian RJ Proceeding as main (or nonmain in the alternative), the Foreign Representative bears the burden of providing sufficient evidence to rebut the registered office presumption for each of the Chapter 15 Debtors that is incorporated outside of Brazil.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a broad overview, the Chapter 15 Debtors are members of an integrated enterprise group known as the Constellation Group.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the Constellation Group is discussed as a group entity at times throughout this opinion's opening sections for context, it is important to bear in mind that the Court's recognition is granted on an individual debtor by debtor basis. The Constellation Group's tripartite business enterprise consists of (i) offshore drilling, (ii) onshore drilling, and (iii) investments in several joint ventures and associated entities related to the operation of floating production storage and offloading units (\"FPSOs\"). The Chapter 15 Debtors are a subset of the Constellation Group. The ten Chapter 15 Debtors along with their direct and indirect affiliates comprise the Constellation Group (\"Constellation Group\"), and the Chapter 15 Debtors along with their affiliates that are debtors in the RJ Proceeding are referred to as the RJ Debtors (\"RJ Debtors\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Constellation Group's current financial distress is attributable, in large part, to the cyclical nature of the deepwater drilling market, which entered a sustained down cycle and created a number of major bankruptcies in the sector.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   By the time of filing, seven of the Constellation Group's eight offshore drilling rigs were either no longer contracted or soon to come off contracts. As of November 30, 2018, the Constellation Group was liable for approximately US$ 1.5 billion in aggregate outstanding third-party financial indebtedness (including accrued interest) under four credit facilities and two bond issuances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 29, 2019, Alperton Capital Ltd. (\"Alperton\"), a contingent creditor of one of the ten Chapter 15 Debtors (Constellation Overseas), filed its\n   <em>\n    Limited Objection of Alperton to the Petition for Recognition of the Brazilian RJ Proceeding\n   </em>\n   . (\"Alperton Objection,\" ECF Doc. # 35.) Alperton's limited objection contends that the Chapter 15 Debtors \"have not satisfied their burden of proof that the location of\n   the Debtors' [COMI] is in Brazil and Alperton objects to recognition of the RJ Proceeding as a foreign main proceeding.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    \u00b6 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In support of the Alperton Objection, Alperton submits and incorporates by reference the Declaration of Andrew G. Dietderich, which was filed concurrently therewith. (\"Dietderich Decl.,\" ECF Doc. # 36.) On February 4, 2019, counsel for Alperton filed the Second Declaration of Andrew G. Dietderich. (\"Second Dietderich Decl.,\" ECF Doc. # 44.) Additionally, the Chapter 15 Debtors and Alperton agreed to a\n   <em>\n    Joint Stipulation of Undisputed Facts\n   </em>\n   , dated February 5, 2019, in lieu of cross-examination of the Debtors' declarants. (\"Stipulation,\" ECF Doc. # 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 5, 2019, the Court held the hearing on the Chapter 15 Debtors' Petition (the \"Recognition Hearing\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Hr'g Tr.,\" ECF Doc. # 59.) At the Recognition Hearing, the Court received evidence and heard oral argument regarding the Verified Petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court reserved judgment on recognition of the Verified Petition and directed the parties to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding recognition of the Brazilian RJ Proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 74:2-7, 156:11-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Alperton does not object to recognition of the Brazilian RJ Proceeding as a foreign\n   <em>\n    nonmain\n   </em>\n   proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:7-11 (\"[W]e have no objection to the recognition of the Brazilian RJ as a foreign non-main.\").) Rather, Alperton argues that the COMI for the entire Constellation Group is not in Brazil. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:24-25 (\"[W]e believe COMI is not in Brazil for the group.\").) It argues that the \"COMI for all ten foreign debtors in the international group is Luxembourg.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96:3-4.) Additionally, Alperton asks that \"the Court allow the Brazilian court in the RJ Proceedings the opportunity to decide the question of COMI, and recognize the RJ Proceeding in these Chapter 15 Cases for the time being as\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   a foreign non-main proceeding or a foreign main proceeding ....\" (Alperton Objection \u00b6 9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Brazilian Court of Appeals recently announced a decision to dismiss the RJ Proceeding with respect to two of the Chapter 15 Debtors-Arazi and Olinda Star-and an additional RJ Debtor-Lancaster Projects Corp. The Foreign Representative informed the Court that it intends to seek a clarification of this judgment, implying that the Brazilian Court of Appeals' dismissal is not final. However, until the Brazilian Courts determine whether the Chapter 15 Debtors Arazi and Olinda Star are proper parties in the Brazilian RJ Proceeding, this\n   Court will not decide whether the proceedings are main or nonmain with respect to them. If any other Chapter 15 Debtors are subsequently dismissed from the Brazilian RJ Proceedings, the Court may modify its present decision regarding recognition respecting those entities pursuant to section 1519(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the Recognition Hearing the Court also questioned Alperton's standing to object to recognition of any of the Chapter 15 Debtors other than Constellation Overseas, an entity with which it is a contingent creditor based on a pending arbitration claim. (Hr'g Tr. 22:16-19, 23:8-10.) Alperton requested the opportunity to brief the issue, but ultimately conceded that based upon the facts in the record, it did not have standing with respect to any Chapter 15 Debtor other than Constellation Overseas. The Court nonetheless analyzes the evidence and objections to recognition raised by Alperton. This requires the Court to analyze whether a proceeding should be recognized as main, nonmain, or not recognized at all,\n   <em>\n    regardless of whether objections have been raised\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Ocean Rig UDW Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 570 B.R. at 692 (considering an objecting party's arguments to deny recognition on the merits, even though the Court found the objecting party had failed to establish standing because the Court had an independent obligation to establish that recognition was proper).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The ultimate issue presently before the Court is how to apply the Chapter 15 COMI standards to each Chapter 15 Debtor in a highly interrelated enterprise group whose management and operations are increasingly becoming detached from any specific locale as the business aims towards increased globalization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons further discussed below, the Court now grants recognition as a foreign nonmain proceeding for Parent/Constellation, and grants recognition as a foreign main proceeding for Petr\u00f3leo Constellation, Constellation Overseas, Alpha Star, Gold Star, Lone Star, Star Int'l, and Snover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   There is a total of ten Chapter 15 Debtors seeking recognition in these consolidated Chapter 15 Cases. The Chapter 15 Debtors (and their countries of incorporation in parenthesis) are: (1) Servicos de Petr\u00f3leo Constellation S.A. (Brazil), (2) Lone Star Offshore Ltd. (BVI), (3) Gold Star Equities Ltd. (BVI), (4) Olinda Star Ltd. (BVI), (5) Star International Drilling Limited, (Cayman Islands) (6) Alpha Star Equities Ltd. (BVI), (7) Snover International Inc. (BVI), (8) Arazi S.a.r.l. (Luxembourg), (9) Constellation Oil Services Holding S.A. (Luxembourg), and (10) Constellation Overseas Ltd (BVI). (Verified Petition at 1 n.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Events Leading Up to the Brazilian RJ Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The sharp decline in oil prices over recent years led to reduced capital spending\n   and credit as well as an oversupply of rigs in the oil and gas industry. Oil prices began to decline rapidly in mid-2014, eventually reaching less than $ 30 per barrel in early 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) As a consequence, exploration and production companies reduced their capital spending, yielding an oversupply in the offshore rig industry and a corresponding decrease in the daily fees earned by each individual drilling unit (referred to as \"dayrates\" in Parent/Constellation's notes offering memoranda discussed below) and revenues generated from them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Reduced revenues that resulted from reduced dayrates in turn further damaged oil and gas companies by reducing their creditworthiness and restricting their access to the credit markets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At roughly the same time as oil prices began plummeting, the Brazilian economy entered a recession. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.) The recession, political instability, and budget deficits affecting Brazil chilled foreign investments in Brazilian operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Constellation Group's key assets are nine onshore drilling rigs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   eight offshore rigs and drillships,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and five FPSO units\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"JV FPSOs\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) Of the twenty-two drilling rigs that the Constellation Group owns, twenty were located in Brazil as of the petition date and either served, or had recently served, customers in the Brazilian market under Brazilian law governed contracts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 62, 69.) This is why the Constellation Group was profoundly affected by the Brazilian market's downturn. As of the petition date, only one of the Constellation Group's nine onshore drilling rigs was under contract and only five of the Constellation Group's eight offshore rigs were under contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \"Certified Translation of the RJ Petition,\" ECF Doc. # 7-2, Pet'r Ex. 2 at 39.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Constellation Group's losses in new investments and lowered dayrates meant that the Constellation Group was no longer able to fund the investments it incurred when the oil market was in an upswing. In 2012, when the price of a barrel of oil had risen to over $ 125, the Constellation Group, along with much of the industry, experienced tremendous growth and incurred new debt obligations to expand its operations and investments, including the A/L/B Project Financings, which are discussed below and were used to finance the acquisition of the\n   <em>\n    Amaralina Star\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Laguna Star\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Brava Star\n   </em>\n   drillships. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Constellation Group's incurring of greater leverage prior to the oil downturn compounded cash flow issues for the group enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Chapter 15 Debtors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Each Chapter 15 Debtor will be described\n   <em>\n    individually\n   </em>\n   in detail in section II.I below. However, a brief overview of the Constellation Group as an enterprise group is discussed first in this overview of the parties. Although the Court must make a COMI determination for each Chapter 15 Debtor individually, shared functions of the group are relevant to that analysis to the extent they exist, and an understanding of the holding structure of the group is also necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Structure of the Constellation Group\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Parent/Constellation serves as the ultimate parent holding company at the apex of the entire Constellation Group. (Verified Petition \u00b6 4 (Organizational Chart).) Parent/Constellation is an entity organized under the laws of Luxembourg with its registered office in Luxembourg, and is the direct or indirect parent to the other nine Chapter 15 Debtors in these Chapter 15 Cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Parent/Constellation is the indirect parent of the BVI incorporated entity Constellation Overseas. Constellation Overseas, in turn, holds all of the remaining seven Chapter 15 Debtors that presently remain subject to the Brazilian RJ Proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Constellation Overseas holds the five BVI incorporated Chapter 15 Debtors, the Cayman Chapter 15 Debtor, and is the indirect parent of Petr\u00f3leo Constellation, the Brazilian Chapter 15 Debtor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Management of the Constellation Group\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Foreign Representative argues that the Constellation Group shares a single senior executive management team. This is supported by the evidence. One of Parent/Constellation's notes offerings, for instance, describes a group of \"senior management\" who will be \"responsible for the day to day management of\n   <em>\n    our\n   </em>\n   operations.\" (\"2019 Offering Memorandum,\" ECF Doc. # 42-1, Pet'r Ex. 4 at 118 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2019 Offering Memorandum at 4 (defining \"our\" as referring to Parent/Constellation together with its affiliates throughout the document).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The senior management team listed in the 2019 Notes Offering Memorandum consists of a CEO, CFO, COO, Chief FPSO Operations Officer, CCO, Chief Administrative Director, and General Counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118.) This group of senior management is listed first in the 2019 Notes Offering Memorandum's section titled \"Management,\" before the document goes on to discuss the board of directors of Parent/Constellation. This objective evidence in the record makes it clear that a senior executive management team does, in fact, govern the operations of the entire enterprise group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The CEO and the CFO-each described as serving the entire Constellation Group-are based in London and are employed by a non-Chapter 15 Debtor Constellation Oil Services U.K. Ltd. (Stipulation \u00b6 4; Verified Petition at 14 n.14.) The CCO, COO and General Counsel are based in Brazil; these Brazilian based individuals exercise their activities from the Chapter 15 Debtor Petr\u00f3leo Constellation. (Stipulation \u00b6 5.) The other two members of the senior management team described in the 2019 Notes Offering Memorandum-the Chief FPSO Operations Officer and the Chief Administrative Director-are not mentioned in the Stipulation. However, both individuals received degrees from\n   Brazilian institutions, had most of their work experience in Brazil, and appeared to be based in Brazil at the time of the issuance of the offering memorandum. (2019 Notes Offering Memorandum at 119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Foreign Representative also argues that the operational and day-to-day management of the entire Constellation Group are predominately conducted from Brazil. (Verified Petition \u00b6 63.) This is supported by the Offering Memorandum for the 2019 Notes. It provides, \"\n   <em>\n    [w]e\n   </em>\n   are a market leading\n   <em>\n    Brazilian-controlled\n   </em>\n   provider of offshore oil and gas contract drilling and FPSO services in Brazil.\" (2019 Notes Offering Memorandum at 15 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2019 Notes Offering Memorandum at 4 (defining \"we\" as the entire Constellation Group.).) Another of Parent/Constellation's debt documents shows that the Constellation Group's drilling rigs, which are the primary revenue drivers for the group, were predominately located in Brazil and chartered to Brazilian customer Petrobras. (\"Original Exchange Offer Memorandum,\" ECF Doc. # 43-1, Pet'r Ex. 6, at 230, 296.) Further evidence of the location of daily operations will be discussed in greater detail with respect to each entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Employees of the Constellation Group\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Petitioner describes the entire Constellation Group as \"employ[ing] over 1,200 individuals, with the vast majority (approximately 93%) located in Brazil.\" (Verified Petition \u00b6 7.) Although there is a lack of clarity provided by the Foreign Representative regarding which Chapter 15 Debtors employ these individuals, this lack of clarity is echoed in the various offering memoranda of the notes issued by Parent/Constellation. For example, one memorandum states \"\n   <em>\n    [w]e\n   </em>\n   employ skilled personnel to operate and provide support for our rigs. As of December 31, 2016,\n   <em>\n    we\n   </em>\n   had a total of 1,885 employees, 99% of which were Brazilian nationals.\" (Original Exchange Offer Memorandum at 23 (emphasis added).) Parent/Constellation's notes offerings all explain that \"[t]he terms 'our company,' 'we,' 'our,' or 'us,' as used herein, refer to [Parent/Constellation]\n   <em>\n    and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise stated or indicated by context.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \"Supplemental Exchange Offer Memorandum,\" ECF Doc. # 42-2, Pet'r Ex. 5 at 3 (including the same quote in the introduction); 2019 Notes Offering Memorandum (also including the same quote in the introduction).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Original Exchange Offer Memorandum of Parent/Constellation also explains, \"[a]s of December 31, 2016,\n   <em>\n    we\n   </em>\n   had a total of 1,885 employees working across six sites, four of which are located in Brazil and one of which is located in the United Kingdom.\" (Original Exchange Offer Memorandum at 123 (emphasis added).) The Original Exchange Offer Memorandum goes on to provide a table with a breakdown of employees of the Constellation Group by location. In 2016, \"QGOG-Brazil\" employed 1,850 workers across three Brazilian locations, \"Constellation Services\" employed 16 workers in Brazil, \"Constellation Panama Corp.\" employed 15 workers in Panama, and \"QGOG Constellation UK\" employed 4 workers in the United Kingdom.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alperton Objection \u00b6 1.) Alperton is a contingent and unliquidated creditor of the Chapter 15 Debtor Constellation Overseas, pending the outcome of arbitration in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 59:4-9, 59:12-14.)

(Original Exchange Offer Memorandum at 108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In addition, the Shareholders' Agreements include covenants relating to the separateness and corporate governance of the Disputed Companies. For example, section 4.8 of each of the Shareholders' Agreements states that each of Constellation Overseas and Alperton will cause the directors each appoints to act in the best interests of each Disputed Company (as opposed to the best interests of the Constellation Group as a whole). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"SHA 1,\" ECF Doc. # 36-1 \u00a7 4.8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SHA 1 at 1 (defining Company for purposes of the SHA 1); \"SHA 2,\" ECF Doc. # 36-2 \u00a7 4.8; SHA 2 at 1 (defining Company for purposes of SHA 2.)

As a result of an ongoing dispute between Alperton and Constellation Overseas, arbitration concerning the joint venture commenced on August 7, 2018 and a panel (the \"Tribunal\") was constituted on December 19, 2018.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Alperton asserts that there is no \"deadlock,\" that Alperton's rights as a shareholder have been ignored and that Constellation Overseas committed fraud and overcharged the Disputed Companies by \"potentially hundreds of millions of dollars over a multi-year period.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Brazilian RJ Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On December 6, 2018, each of the Chapter 15 Debtors and the RJ Debtors initiated bankruptcy proceedings in Brazil by filing the RJ Petition with the Brazilian Court. (Verified Petition at 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Certified Translation of the RJ Petition at 64.) The RJ Petition requests that the Brazilian Court substantially consolidate the judicial reorganization of the entire group; this request is based upon the support of creditors. (Certified Translation of the RJ Petition \u00b6 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Brazilian Court entered an order formally accepting the RJ Debtors into the Brazilian Proceeding and authorizing the requested \"substantial consolidation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Although the RJ Debtors are being consolidated for the purposes of voting on the RJ Debtors' plan of reorganization in the RJ Proceeding (the \"RJ Plan\"), the RJ Plan is not premised on \"substantive consolidation,\" as that term is used in the United States (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the RJ Plan does not pool all debtors' assets and liabilities for purposes of pro rata distributions). (\"Petitioner's March 25, 2019 MOL,\" ECF Doc. # 72 \u00b6 4.) Whether the creditors will, in fact, vote as a group will be put to the vote of the group of creditors; consolidating group voting will not be ordered by the Brazilian court. (\"Majority Opinion English Translation,\" ECF Doc. # 79-1 at 70.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the purpose of this opinion is to determine the COMI of each of the Chapter 15 Debtors and that determination is separate from this Court's decision whether to recognize and enforce any plan\n   that may be approved by creditors and the Brazilian Court in the Brazilian RJ Proceeding. If a future plan is approved in Brazil and includes substantive consolidation of the debtors' assets and liabilities, such that interest owners and creditors of any of the substantively consolidated entities are unfairly diluted, this Court will need to scrutinize whether the plan can be recognized and enforced in the United States consistent with principles of comity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Appellate proceedings are still pending in Brazil. Several recent decisions appear to have determined that the Brazilian RJ Proceedings of several of companies within the group must be dismissed because they are not eligible to file within Brazil. On January 28, 2019, Alperton filed an interlocutory appeal in the Brazilian Proceeding with the Court of Appeals of the State of Rio de Janeiro (the \"Brazilian Court of Appeals\"). (Hr'g Tr. 132:22-23.) Among other relief, Alperton requests that the Brazilian Court of Appeals: (i) dismiss the Brazilian Proceeding as it applies to each Disputed Company on the ground that there was no proper corporate authority to file the Disputed Companies (neither of which are Chapter 15 Debtors) in the RJ Proceeding, (ii) enter an order declaring that the Brazilian Court is not competent to process the Brazilian RJ Proceeding as a main proceeding, and (iii) to order the RJ petitioners to produce the documentation required under Brazilian bankruptcy law, which Alperton alleges they have failed to provide the Brazilian Court. (Alperton Objection \u00b6 29.) In the alternative, Alperton says that it requests that the Brazilian Court of Appeals overturn the \"substantive consolidation order\" and separate the Brazilian Proceeding of the Disputed Companies from the Brazilian Proceeding of the other RJ Debtors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Alperton also requests that the Brazilian Court of Appeals recognize the primacy of the arbitral Tribunal constituted on December 19, 2018 in New York to resolve the ownership dispute between Alperton and Constellation Overseas and not authorize the consummation of any restructuring that would be irreconcilable with an arbitral award confirming Alperton's ownership interest in the Disputed Companies.

(\"April 3 Status Update,\" ECF Doc. # 73 \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Brazilian Court of Appeals held a hearing to rule on the merits of the Brazilian Public Prosecutor's appeal on March 26, 2019.

In advance of the filing of the English translation resulting from that hearing, the Foreign Representative informed the Court that at the March 26 hearing, the Brazilian Court of Appeals determined that three of the RJ Debtors should be removed from the Brazilian RJ Proceeding.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verified Petition \u00b6 19.) For instance, the Verified Petition begins by providing that the Constellation Group's controlling shareholder is LUX Oil and Gas International S.a.r.l.

In doing so, the sentence implicitly presumes that\n   <em>\n    Parent/Constellation\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Constellation Group\n   </em>\n   are equivalent entities (indeed, it combines their stocks to reach 100% ownership for each of capital and voting stock).

The Verified Petition explains that as of November 30, 2018, the Constellation Group, as a whole, \"was liable for approximately $ 1.5 billion in aggregate outstanding third-party financial indebtedness (including accrued interest) under four credit facilities and two bond issuances (the 'Prepetition Debt').\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)

Parent/Constellation's noteholders rejected the exchange as proposed in the Original Exchange Offer Memorandum and an ad hoc group of holders formed (the \"2019 Group\") to seek better terms for new notes. (Verified Petition \u00b6 26.) Following multiple rounds of negotiations, Parent/Constellation issued the Supplemental Exchange Offer Memorandum setting forth the revised terms of the 2024 Notes, including changes to interest rates, guarantees, security, disclosures, and covenants.

The Supplemental Exchange Offer Memorandum updated and amended the Original Exchange Offer Memorandum with the terms set forth therein, and otherwise maintained the terms of the Original Exchange Offer Memorandum, which were not modified. (Supplemental Exchange Offer Memorandum at 2 (\"[E]xcept as set forth herein, the contents of the Offering Memorandum, including the terms of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation, remain as set forth therein.\").) The noteholders accepted this revised exchange offer, which ultimately exchanged 86.4% of Parent/Constellation's 2019 Notes for an equal aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verified Petition \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Unfortunately, the maturity extensions achieved by the exchange were not sufficient to solve all of the Constellation Group's financial issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Thus, in the months leading up to the commencement of the Brazilian RJ Proceeding, the Constellation Group sought to obtain a comprehensive restructuring of its debt obligations. Those restructurings ultimately resulted in the PSA. Under the PSA, the Constellation Group essentially entered the Brazilian RJ Proceeding with a pre-negotiated restructuring deal.

(PSA at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In another example of entity blurring, the Verified Petition explains the terms of the PSA as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Consenting A/L/B Lenders have agreed to re-lend approximately $ 39 million in funds that were escrowed in August and September of 2018, Bradesco agreed to provide a $ 15 million letter of credit, and the shareholders agreed to invest $ 27 million of new money at closing, all to ensure that\n   the Constellation Group had ample liquidity to survive a prolonged downturn in the market post-restructuring.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Notably, the Verified Petition does not clarify the specific entities or accounts that received access to funds or letters of credit through the PSA. Again, the Petitioner presented the evidence to the Court in terms of the Constellation Group as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Alperton also noted several provisions in the PSA that affect their potential interests in the Disputed Companies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alperton FOF \u00b6 32.) The PSA provides for cross-collateralizing the Brava Project Loan Facility and the A&amp;L Project Loan Facility.

If performed in accordance with its terms, the PSA would provide lenders under the Brava Project Loan Facility with liens on each of the\n   <em>\n    Amaralina Star\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Laguna Star\n   </em>\n   vessels and a pledge on 100% of the shares of each of Laguna Star Ltd. and Amaralina Star Ltd. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The PSA requires as a condition precedent to the implementation of the restructuring transactions that the Chapter 15 Debtors (and later another group of the RJ Debtors) receive an order from this Court granting recognition of the Brazilian RJ Proceeding with respect to those entities. (Verified Petition \u00b6 31;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PSA at 8 (defining the Chapter 15 Debtors as the Initial Chapter 15 Filing Entities);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PSA at 9 (defining the Subsequent Chapter 15 Filing Entities).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In parallel with the negotiations towards the PSA, the Constellation Group also engaged in negotiations with Bradesco that led to Parent/Constellation becoming a guarantor of Constellation Overseas debt. Specifically, Bradesco agreed to several extensions of the final maturity payments under the Bradesco Working Capital Facilities in exchange for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Parent/Constellation becoming a guarantor for the obligations of Constellation Overseas under the Bradesco Working Capital Facilities.

Galdino Declaration on Brazilian Bankruptcy Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Flavio Galdino, counsel for the Constellation Group in the Brazilian Proceeding, provided a declaration pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\"Galdino Declaration,\" ECF Doc. # 4, Pet'r Ex. 15.) Galdino declares that \"Brazil has not adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency and currently has no statutory definition of center of main interests ('COMI') for the purposes of establishing the competent country of jurisdiction for the main insolvency proceedings either of a company or of a group of companies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) According to Galdino, under Brazilian law, \"[a]n entity commences an RJ by filing a petition with the business court (the 'RJ Court') in the jurisdiction in which it maintains its principal place of business ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Galdino further explains that the Brazilian Court's jurisdictional requirement is referred to as\n   <em>\n    principal estabelecimento,\n   </em>\n   and Brazilian Court's must find that a debtor or group of debtors have their\n   <em>\n    principal estabelecimento\n   </em>\n   in Brazil. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) That said, he also explains that\n   <em>\n    principal estabelecimento\n   </em>\n   is interpreted broadly and that the RJ Court can focus on either the location of a debtor's assets and operations or on the location of management and decision makers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   With respect to what Galdino refers to as \"substantive consolidation\" as it is \"referred to in the United States,\" Galdino notes that while some RJ Courts have allowed substantive consolidation, \"[w]hether a court will allow substantive consolidation is a fact-intensive determination heavily dependent upon the nature of the relationship among the affiliated debtors\n   and any interrelated debt subject to restructuring.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Alperton's Proposed Findings of Fact highlights this portion of the Galdino Declaration and emphasizes that substantive consolidation of creditors for negotiation and voting on a single plan has, in fact, been allowed in Brazil and could be allowed here. (Alperton FOF \u00b6 38.) However, the Court emphasizes that this opinion will only determine recognition of the\n   <em>\n    proceedings\n   </em>\n   ; the decisions reached in this opinion do not assure that further discretionary relief will follow-such as this Court's recognition and enforcement of any plan that may be approved in Brazil. Indeed, ample precedent dictates that the Court may refuse to recognize and enforce a plan if approval was obtained by an unfair voting system, even when the plan is approved in a country that usually enjoys comity from the United States.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ad Hoc Grp. of Vitro Noteholders v.

(Stipulation \u00b6 7.) Parent/Constellation is a holding and financing company that owns equity interests in subsidiaries in the Constellation Group and engages in the necessary activities for borrowing and guaranteeing debt. (Verified Petition \u00b6 75.) The Court finds that Parent/Constellation's registered office is in Luxembourg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Parent/Constellation's board of directors is composed of six members. (Stipulation \u00b6 1.) Three directors are residents and citizens of Brazil; two are residents and citizens of Luxembourg; and one is a resident and citizen of Switzerland. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Parent/Constellation holds its board of directors' meetings and shareholder meetings in Luxembourg, as required for companies incorporated under Luxembourg law. (Stipulation \u00b6 6; Hr'g Tr. 50: 6-10.) The Original Exchange Offer Memorandum states, \"[i]n accordance with Luxembourg law, [Parent/Constellation's] Board of Directors is the sole responsible body for managing [Parent/Constellation and its consolidated subsidiaries'] affairs and ensuring that [Parent/Constellation and its consolidated subsidiaries'] operations are organized in a satisfactory manner.\" (Original Exchange Offer Memorandum at 131.) The 2019 Notes Offering Memorandum further states that Parent/Constellation's \"Board of Directors is empowered to take any action necessary or desirable for carrying out [its] corporate objective, except for the powers specifically allocated to the general meeting of [its] shareholders by Luxembourg law and/or by [its] Articles.\" (2019 Notes Offering Memorandum at 121.) The Court finds that Parent/Constellation's management is located in Luxembourg, where the board of directors conducts business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As a holding company, Parent/Constellation does not have any assets other than its ownership interests in its subsidiaries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.) The 2019 Notes Offering Memorandum explains: \"The issuer is a holding company, and all of its assets are held by its direct and indirect subsidiaries.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Supplemental Exchange Offering Memorandum describes Parent/Constellation's operations by explaining, \"[Parent/Constellation] is incorporated in the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg,\n   <em>\n    and [Parent/Constellation] conducts most of its business from Brazil\n   </em>\n   .\" (Supplemental\n   Exchange Offering Memorandum at 21 (emphasis added).) The Original Exchange Offer Memorandum states, \"[t]he issuer is a holding company with no independent operations or assets and it is dependent on cash flow generated by its subsidiaries.\" (Original Exchange Offer Memorandum at 53.) It goes on to explain, \"[r]epayment of our indebtedness, including the New Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Parent/Constellation's key indirect assets are its drilling rigs, which, with the exception of the\n   <em>\n    Olinda Star\n   </em>\n   and one of its onshore drilling rigs, were all located in Brazil as of the Petition Date. (Verified Petition \u00b6\u00b6 9, 14-18.) At the Hearing, Alperton suggested that, as of the Petition Date, several of the drilling rigs were operating on the high seas and were not located in Brazil. (Hr'g Tr. 108:18-24.) However, the evidence in the record demonstrates that 20 of the 22 drilling rigs were located in Brazil as of the petition date; the two that were not in Brazil were in India and Paraguay. (Verified Petition \u00b6\u00b6 9, 14-18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Certified Translation of the RJ Petition at 39.) The Verified Petition explains: \"The Offshore Drilling Rigs and Onshore Drilling Rigs are the Company's primary operating assets. Seven of the eight Offshore Drilling Rigs are presently located in Brazil, eight of its nine Onshore Drilling Rigs are located in Brazil, and all of the JV FPSO Units in which it holds an interest are located in Brazil.\" (Verified Petition \u00b6 9.) Based on the foregoing evidence, the Court finds that Parent/Constellation's assets are primarily located in Brazil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Parent/Constellation has no officers. (2019 Offering Memorandum at 118 (\"There are no statutory officers under Luxembourg law ... members of senior management set forth below currently serve as senior managers of QGOG\n   <em>\n    and will be responsible for the day-to-day management of our operations\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Stipulation \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.) Parent/Constellation makes use of the Constellation Group's shared corporate management team, its operational management team, and its employees, who are employed by Parent/Constellation's direct or indirect subsidiaries. As discussed above, the shared corporate management team are located in both London and Brazil. The court finds that the location of executive management team of Parent/Constellation is split between London and Brazil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Parent/Constellation is the issuer of the 2019 Notes and the 2024 Notes; it is also guarantor of the A/L/B Project Financings and guarantor of the Bradesco Working Capital Facilities. (Stipulation \u00b6\u00b6 8-11.) The indenture trustees of the 2019 Notes and the 2024 Notes are located in New York and there is no evidence in the record regarding the location of the beneficial holders of the 2019 Notes and 2024 Notes, other than a holder of 2019 Notes that is a Brazilian national located in New York. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Noteholder Letter,\" ECF Doc. # 38.) There is no evidence in the record that any of Parent/Constellation's creditors are located in Luxembourg or Brazil. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Notice List,\" ECF Doc. # 7-6 at 8-9.) As such, the Court finds that the location of most of Parent/Constellation's creditors is indeterminate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Supplemental Exchange Offer states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   The Company [defined to be the issuer, Parent/Constellation]\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Arazi\n   are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, and as such, any insolvency proceedings applicable to them are in principle governed by Luxembourg law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   (Supplemental Exchange Offer Memorandum at 21.) Further, the Supplemental Exchange Offer explains that the section titled \"Certain Luxembourg Insolvency Law Considerations\" in the 2019 Notes Offering Memorandum should be read as applicable to \"both the Company and Arazi.\" (Supplemental Exchange Offer Memorandum at 22.) The Supplemental Exchange Offer Memorandum also explicitly explains to investors that restructuring proceedings could be commenced in Brazil due to the Constellation Group's significant ties there, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   [I]n the event of any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceedings involving us or any of our subsidiaries, bankruptcy laws other than those of the United States could apply.... [I]n the event that we do experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction insolvency proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of such proceedings, but it may include, among other jurisdictions, Brazil, where certain decisions of the Company\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   are made, certain members of the Company's management are located and the location of substantially all of the Company's business is conducted (and, therefore, from which substantially all of the operating revenues that may be available to service the Company's obligations under the New Notes are currently derived).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   (Supplemental Exchange Offer Memorandum at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Supplemental Exchange Offer Memorandum further explains risks associated with Brazilian insolvency proceedings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   In Brazil, the right of the Collateral Trustee to repossess and dispose of the Collateral securing the New Notes upon acceleration may be significantly impaired by applicable bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings were commenced by or against the issuer or the Subsidiary Guarantors prior to or possibly even after the time that the Collateral Trustee repossesses and disposes of the Collateral. In the event of a cross-border insolvency, Brazilian courts may impair the seizure of the Drilling Rigs located in Brazil, in order to protect the business activities in Brazil and/or ensure the payment of the relevant debt in accordance with Brazilian laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   In addition, in case of judicial reorganization or liquidation under Brazilian law, it is impossible to estimate the period that payments under the New Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding. With respect to the judicial reorganization, the debtor may continue to retain and to use the collateral and the proceeds, products, rents or profits therefrom. The judicial reorganization proceeding binds all pre-filing secured debts, even those not yet due, and they will be paid in accordance with the restructuring plan submitted by the debtor, which must be approved by the majority of creditors in a creditors' meeting and, subsequently,\n   ratified by the Brazilian court. In certain circumstances, the Brazilian bankruptcy law also grants the debtor the possibility to cram down the plan. The reorganization plan results in the replacement and renewal of all debts existing prior to the filing of the reorganization, and is binding on the debtor and all creditors subject to it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   In relation to a bankruptcy proceeding, the Collateral Trustee is prohibited from repossessing or disposing of the Collateral securing the New Notes because all assets of the debtor, including the Collateral, will be sold in order to pay the creditors according to the priority order established in the Brazilian bankruptcy law. Secured debt have priority in the ranking and are paid just after labors' claims, up to the amount of the Collateral. Any shortfall will be classified as \"unsecured debt\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Court therefore finds that the objective indicia of Parent/Constellation's creditors' expectations of an insolvency proceeding's location could be in either Brazil or Luxembourg. However, unlike Parent/Constellation's subsidiaries, Parent/Constellation is the original issuer of both the 2019 and 2024 Notes. Even though the memoranda for these notes frequently discusses the entire Constellation Group, which it refers to as \"we,\" \"us,\"\n   <em>\n    etc.\n   </em>\n   , this does not change the fact that the issuer listed at the beginning of each of the notes is described as a public limited liability company incorporated in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2019 Notes Offering Memorandum at 3; Original Exchange Offer Memorandum at 2; Supplemental Exchange Offer Memorandum at 2.) As such, the Court finds that the objective expectations of creditors with respect to Parent/Constellation's COMI should be determined to be predominately in Luxembourg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   New York law is the governing law of all of the Prepetition Debt of the Constellation Group, which Parent/Constellation either issued or now guarantees. (Verified Petition \u00b6 20; Alperton FOF \u00b6 62.) Alperton asserts that New York is the jurisdiction whose law would apply to most of Parent/Constellation's disputes. (Alperton FOF \u00b6 101.) The documentation relevant to all prepetition debt is in English. While there is no evidence in the record of a current dispute about Luxembourg law, Luxembourg law is an unavoidable part of the reorganization for Parent/Constellation, because Luxembourg law will determine,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   : (i) the fiduciary duties applicable to Parent/Constellation's board, (ii) the extent to which foreign proceedings outside Luxembourg are consistent or inconsistent with these fiduciary duties, and (iii) the authority for and validity of any actions taken by Parent/Constellation under corporate law. (Alperton FOF \u00b6 102.) The Court therefore determines that while many countries laws could govern the range of feasible disputes that Parent/Constellation could be involved in, Luxembourg law should be considered the most relevant law governing Parent/Constellation's disputes for purposes of the COMI determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Alpha Star\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Chapter 15 Debtors Alpha Star, Gold Star, Olinda Star, Lone Star, and Star Int'l are the offshore rig owners (\"Offshore Rig Owner Debtors\"). (Verified Petition at 13.) Alpha Star owns the\n   <em>\n    Alpha Star\n   </em>\n   offshore drilling rig, which is not presently under contract and is being maintained in a shipyard in Brazil. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 14.) The Alpha Star is classified as capable of ultra-deepwater drilling.

(Stipulation \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Alpha Star's offshore rig is operated and maintained by Chapter 15 Debtor Petr\u00f3leo Constellation and other Brazilian subsidiaries pursuant to operating and maintenance agreements, through its operational management team and operational staff located in the Brazilian offices. (Verified Petition \u00b6 70.) The Original Exchange Offer Memorandum explains that QGOG (which is the former name of Chapter 15 Debtor Petr\u00f3leo Constellation)\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   agreed to manage, be technically responsible for, and/or perform the activities and works of maintenance necessary to maintain and preserve\n   <em>\n    Alpha Star\n   </em>\n   and all its parts, components, and equipment. (Original Exchange Offer Memorandum at 118.) The operations of Alpha Star are therefore predominately in Brazil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Alpha Star is a guarantor of the 2024 Notes issued by Parent/Constellation. (Stipulation \u00b6 10.) The indenture trustees of the 2024 Notes are in New York. Otherwise, there is no evidence in the record regarding the location of the beneficial holders of the 2024 Notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The expectations of the creditors of the 2024 Notes, the key creditor constituency of the offshore drilling rigs, may be objectively determinable by reference to the offering memoranda related to the 2024 notes. The initial offering document described the Constellation Group by explaining \"[w]e are a market leading provider of offshore oil and gas contract drilling and FPSO services in Brazil.\" (Original Exchange Offer Memorandum at 20.) The overview section of the document further explains \"[i]n particular, we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the ultra-deepwater drilling activity in Brazil ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Since Alpha Star owns an ultra-deepwater rig, this would have put 2024 Note purchasers on notice that\n   <em>\n    Alpha Star\n   </em>\n   was not only located in Brazil, but also had its future operations in Brazil. Indeed, a map provided in the same document shows that\n   <em>\n    Alpha Star\n   </em>\n   is located off the coast of Brazil. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108.) The document states that all of the Offshore Drilling Rigs other than\n   <em>\n    Olinda Star\n   </em>\n   are under charter contracts with Petrobras. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, the offering expressly refers several times to the chartering and operations of the offshore drilling rigs, explaining that those rigs operated \"mainly in Brazil\" and were currently chartered \"mainly to [Petrobras].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 230, 296.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The Supplemental Exchange Offer to the Original Exchange Offer Memorandum conveys to the holders of the 2024 Notes that insolvency proceedings may be commenced in Brazil and explains the consequences that a Brazilian restructuring or liquidation proceeding could have on their ability to enforce their collateral, including the mortgages granted to them over the offshore drilling rigs.

For example, because the\n   <em>\n    Alpha Star\n   </em>\n   rig is in Brazil, the arrest and seizure of the rig would take place under Brazilian law and require a judicial order issued by a Brazilian Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) The same paragraph explains that there could be third-party claims under maritime liens such as ports and maritime costs and taxes; seamen's wages; salvage and general average; repairs, supplies and necessaries contracted outside the mortgaged drilling rigs' home port; collision and tort liens; and simple and general damages to the drilling rigs.

(Verified Petition \u00b6 71.) Snover sits within the Constellation Group's onshore drilling operation segment.

(Stipulation \u00b6 2.) The record contains no evidence that any of Snover's decisions are made from Luxembourg. (FRFOF at 42 n.29.) Snover's active Onshore Rig is operated by, and its inactive Onshore Rigs are maintained by, Debtor Petr\u00f3leo Constellation through the Group's operational management team located in Brazil. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) The Court therefore finds that Snover's day-to-day management, like that of other drillship owning entities is in Brazil. Snover's senior management is best described as the senior executive team of the Constellation Group, which is located in both London and Brazil. Cumulatively, given that this entity is a drillship owner and makes use of predominately Brazilian employees, daily management, and given that most of the Constellation Group's executive management team is located in Brazil, the Court finds that Snover's senior management is best described as located in Brazil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   All of Snover's onshore drilling rigs are located in Brazil.

Snover is a fully integrated participant in the Constellation Group's onshore drilling operations-operations that take place primarily in Brazil, utilize Brazilian employees, and are accordingly subject to certain Brazilian legal and regulatory regimes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) Its assets, consisting of onshore drilling rigs, are all located in Brazil, and its revenues ultimately derive from operations with primarily Brazilian customers under the customer contracts which historically have been primarily governed by Brazilian law.

The location of the majority of Snover's creditors is therefore not strong evidence in favor of any particular COMI for Snover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   As a guarantor of the 2024 Notes, Snover's creditors were advised that their investment was essentially an investment in Brazil and were expressly cautioned that insolvency proceedings could take place in Brazil due to the strong ties to Brazil disclosed in the various offering memoranda.

Because their money is ultimately at stake, one generally should defer, therefore, to the creditors' acquiescence in or support of a proposed COMI. It is reasonable to assume that the debtor and its creditors (and shareholders, if they have an economic stake in the proceeding) can, absent an improper purpose, best determine how to maximize the efficiency of a liquidation or reorganization and, ultimately, the value of the debtor, assuming also, of course, that chapter 15 requires the court to protect the legitimate interests of dissenters (even to the extent of enabling the modification of a recognition order under Bankruptcy Code section 1517(d) ), particularly where other objective factors point to a different COMI. Relatedly, if the parties in interest are in a legitimate dispute over the debtor's COMI, it is probably safe to assume that promoting cooperation among courts and the parties will play a greater role than artificially choosing one proceeding as a \"primary\" proceeding.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because Parent/Constellation is ultimately a parent company that exists for the task of high level management of all subsidiaries, it makes sense that the location from which the board of directors conducts its activities should weigh more heavily than the daily operational staff's location-which is spread between two nations, in any case and therefore would not provide a strong weight against finding management to be principally located in Luxembourg.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, because Parent/Constellation is a Luxembourg incorporated entity, that depends upon Luxembourg law for its existence and its corporate operations, the Court found that Luxembourg law should be considered the law that would apply to\n   <em>\n    most\n   </em>\n   of Parent/Constellation's disputes.

(Stipulation \u00b6 7.) The meaning of the phrase \"central administration\" under Luxembourg tax law is not before the Court, but the fact that Parent/Constellation takes the position with Luxembourg authorities that its \"central administration\" is in Luxembourg, for tax or any other purpose, is itself readily ascertainable evidence to third parties of a connection to Luxembourg beyond a letter box.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Additionally, when the Constellation Group makes important decisions, it issues press releases from its Luxembourg office. These press releases are available to the public on the Constellation Group's website and are therefore in the \"public domain.\" (Alperton FOF \u00b6 94.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, when the Constellation Group announced its restructuring on December 6, 2018, it issued a press release from Luxembourg. When an issue was identified with the 2017 consolidated financial statements for Parent (encompassing the financial statements for its subsidiaries, including each of the Chapter 15 Debtors), Parent issued a press release from Luxembourg notifying users of the financial statements that they should not place reliance on them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, an interested third party that visits and reads these press releases would readily ascertain that the Parent/Constellation is headquartered in, and makes key decisions from, Luxembourg. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) As an extension, it seems reasonable that-at the very least-these press releases would put interested third parties on notice that Parent/Constellation makes key decisions from Luxembourg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   In sum, while creditors were notified of the underlying operations of the Constellation Group as being in Brazil, the offering memoranda clearly express that Parent/Constellation is a Luxembourg company. Given that Luxembourg was chosen and well publicized to creditors as the jurisdiction from which ultimate board meetings, tax laws, and corporate laws would take place, the Court found that objective creditors expectations of Parent/Constellation's COMI weighs in favor of a Luxembourg COMI.

(Stipulation \u00b6 2.) It benefits from the day-to-day operational management of the Brazilian Offices, which, together with those in the Panama offices, co-ordinate its operational management activities with the activities of its affiliates. (FRFOF at 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   The Brazilian Offices are of particular importance to the management of Constellation Overseas, because its role in the Constellation Group-in addition to acting as a holding and financing company-is to centralize treasury services. (FRFOF \u00b6 143.) As holding company of several Chapter 15 Debtors and an integrated member of the Constellation Group, Constellation Overseas relies on persons employed by its affiliates, most of whom are Brazilian citizens working at Brazilian Offices. (\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 II.B.1(c).) Although the Brazilian office's functions are carried out predominately by Petr\u00f3leo Constellation, this does not fully detract from the Brazilian office's inclusion in the COMI consideration for Constellation Overseas or other affiliates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re British Am.

Its direct ownership of assets is therefore the equity in these companies that it holds in the BVI. Given its role as a holding company, it has no employees, officers, or customers of its own, instead its limited functions are to own equity in subsidiaries, guarantee debt and centralize certain treasury functions to support subsidiaries operating and generating revenue in Brazil. (FRFOF \u00b6 150.) However, for a holding company, the location of its subsidiaries and the location of their principal assets is relevant to the COMI analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Inversora Electrica de Buenos Aires S.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12132972\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/560/650/#p655\">\n    560 B.R. at 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(FRFOF \u00b6 150.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Because the assets held by Constellation Overseas are all of the Constellation Group's rigs, which with the exception of Olinda Star are located in Brazil, this factor weighs in favor of a COMI in Brazil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    The Location of the Majority of the Debtor's Creditors or of a Majority of Creditors who would Be Affected by the Case is Neutral\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   Constellation Overseas has obligations under the 2024 Notes and is an obligor under the 2019 Notes.

(FRFOF \u00b6 166.) Thus, the Court draws no conclusion relevant to a finding of COMI for obligors of this debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Constellation Overseas is also an obligor under the Bradesco Working Capital Facility. (FRFOF \u00b6 167.) Bradesco is a local Brazilian bank and the Group's ongoing unsecured working capital lender. (FRFOF \u00b6 167.) The Bradesco Working Capital Facility was advanced by Bradesco's Cayman branch, but originated by principals based in Brazil.

Thus, the location of this creditor may either weigh in favor of a COMI in Brazil or the Cayman Islands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   Constellation Overseas also has obligations under the A/L/B facility. The lenders on the A/L/B facility are a syndicate of various international financial institutions, none of which are located in Luxembourg or Brazil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   Finally, Alperton is a contingent, unliquidated creditor of Constellation Overseas. (\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 II.B.2.) Alperton's principals and beneficial owners are Brazilian nationals and their business with Constellation Overseas is rooted in serving Brazilian customers and accessing Brazilian markets. (FRFOF \u00b6 168.) Thus, for purposes of this element in the COMI analysis, the potential creditor Alperton is located in Brazil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   In sum, there is no clear location of a majority of Constellation Overseas' creditors. This factor is neutral in the COMI analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    The Jurisdiction Whose Law Would Apply to Most Disputes Weighs Weakly in Favor of a COMI in BVI\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Constellation Overseas has a primary interest in the operational business activities of the Constellation Group, which are almost exclusively centered in Brazil and, therefore, is greatly impacted by Brazil's regulations and laws. (FRFOF \u00b6 158.) By virtue of being incorporated in the BVI, Constellation Overseas is subject to the BVI's laws, regulations, and jurisdiction, including with respect to potential corporate disputes. It is also subject to BVI law with respect to potential tax disputes. (FRFOF \u00b6 158.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   New York is the governing law of all of the Prepetition Debt of the Constellation Group. (Verified Petition \u00b6 20; Alperton FOF \u00b6 62.) New York law also governs the Shareholders' Agreement between Alperton and Constellation Overseas. (Alperton FOF \u00b6 63.) Alperton's claims against Constellation Overseas to be resolved by the arbitral tribunal are, therefore, New York\n   law governed claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Alperton FOF \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   As an entity that is ultimately owned (though through a non-debtor intermediary) by a Parent incorporated and acting under the Law of Luxembourg, Constellation Overseas is also impacted by Luxembourg law. Thus, one could view Constellation Overseas as receiving a trickle-down effect from Luxembourg law and a bottom-up effect from Brazilian law, but the company always maintains the direct governance of BVI law. Thus, on balance, this factor likely loosely weighs in favor of a BVI COMI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   f.\n   <em>\n    The Reasonable Expectations of Interested Third Parties Weighs in Favor of a COMI in Brazil\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   An important element for each of the BVI incorporated Chapter 15 Debtors is the support of the JPLs. The JPLs are independent, court-appointed officers who favor recognition of the Brazilian RJ Proceeding as a foreign main proceeding. (FRFOF \u00b6 176.) The JPLs are officers of the BVI Court whose function is to represent the collective interests of the creditors of each debtor for which they are appointed by overseeing and protecting their interests in the restructuring process. In this way, they arguably serve as a collective voice for the creditors of the BVI debtors. The JPLs Support Statement provided that \"It is the understanding of the BVI JPLs ... that Brazil is the 'center of main interests' or 'COMI' of each of the BVI Debtors for the purposes of U.S. restructuring law.\" (JPL Support Statement, ECF Doc. # 31-3 \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   Creditors' reasonable expectations are a factor in COMI analysis. The Offering Memoranda are indicia of the Noteholders' objectively ascertainable expectations. Many disclosures within the Offering Memoranda would have put Noteholders on notice that their investment was, in substance, Brazilian-centered. The Offering Memoranda also informed Noteholders that the vast majority of revenues that would repay their notes were derived in Brazil from Brazilian operations with Brazilian customers and contracts and operations governed and regulated by Brazilian laws. (FRFOF \u00b6 170.) That said, Noteholders were also aware of the ultimate reality described in the Notes-that the Constellation Group is a highly integrated group of companies with its parent in Luxembourg, its main source of revenues in Brazil, and several of its subsidiaries place of incorporation in the BVI. Thus, Noteholders could have reasonably foreseen Brazilian, Luxembourg, and BVI proceedings affecting Constellation Overseas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   If anything weighs heavily for Constellation Overseas' COMI to be located in Brazil, it is the factor of creditor support. As the\n   <em>\n    SPhinX\n   </em>\n   Court explained, \"[b]ecause their money is ultimately at stake, one generally should defer ... to the creditors' acquiescence in or support of a proposed COMI ... [they] can ... best determine how to maximize the efficiency ... of a reorganization and ultimately, the value of the debtor.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8451127\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/351/103/#p122\">\n    351 B.R. at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Bradesco and the Consenting A/L/B Lenders collectively hold over 60% of the Constellation Group's debts and Constellation Overseas is an obligor and/or grantor to both the A/L/B Lenders and Bradesco. These two groups of creditors collectively, therefore, have the most at stake in these proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   Each of them expressed their support of COMI in Brazil. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bradesco Support Statement (\"Bradesco's expectation and understanding is, and always has been, that Constellation Overseas' and its Debtor affiliates' center of main interests is in Brazil.\"); \"A/L/B Lender Support Statement,\" ECF. Doc. # 8 \u00b6 3 (\"The A/L/B Lenders have always understood and operated with the expectation that the center of main interests ('COMI') of each Debtor was and remains located firmly in Brazil.\").) Further, the 2024 Ad Hoc Group-who hold a majority of the 2024 Notes-also support the finding of COMI in Brazil for each of the Debtors incorporated outside of Brazil. (FRFOF \u00b6 175.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   Because the offering memoranda of the notes heavily discuss the Constellation Group's economic base in Brazil, the BVI JPLs have expressed their support of a Brazilian COMI, and all creditors other than Alperton have expressed support for Brazil as the COMI of Constellation Overseas, this factor weighs in favor of a COMI in Brazil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   g.\n   <em>\n    The Nerve Center Analysis Weighs in Favor of Brazil\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   Constellation Overseas is a holding/financing company that centralizes treasury and financial services for certain companies in the Constellation Group. (FRFOF at 66.) It is a mid-level holding company that Parent/Constellation fully owns through a non-debtor intermediary. (Alpterton FOF \u00b6 124.) In\n   <em>\n    OAS\n   </em>\n   , the SPV debtor's parent was the debtor's sole shareholder and had the power to \"determine the outcome of any action requiring shareholder approval, including transaction with related parties, acquisitions and dispositions of assets and the timing and payment of any future dividends.\"\n   <em>\n    In re OAS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222238\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/533/83/#p83\">\n    533 B.R. at 101-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In noting that the COMI of the SPV depended upon the location of the nerve center of the corporate group the SPV served, the\n   <em>\n    OAS\n   </em>\n   Court held that the SPV debtor's COMI was with its parent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222238\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/533/83/#p83\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Constellation Overseas is an SPV that is controlled and partially managed by its parent (management is described as partial, since day-to-day operations of the Constellation Group entities takes place in Brazil and Constellation Overseas' sole director is not located in Luxembourg). Thus, the nerve-center test should point towards Luxembourg, as in\n   <em>\n    OAS\n   </em>\n   , since the Parent of this SPV is in Luxembourg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   Ultimately, determining the COMI of Constellation Overseas is the most difficult of the Court's recognition determinations. From the perspective of technical, top-down legal control, the Parent/Constellation, which is based in Luxembourg \"controls\" the company. That said, from a realistic consideration of the perspective of the true seat of Constellation Overseas, it is difficult to overlook the fact that its revenues used to pay creditors\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the day-to-day management of those revenue streams come from Brazil. Essentially, the Court is asked, with respect to Constellation Overseas, to choose between the importance of high-level management or the location of the management of the generation of actual positive cash flows (as opposed to debt incursion) for the group of companies. Given the relatively equal pulls of the analysis in favor of Luxembourg or Brazil, the Court's determination here essentially makes one of two conclusions: (1) a determination that senior management should always be considered more important in similar cases or (2) a determination that when a proper analysis of COMI has been conducted and it leads to essentially a toss-up between locales as the \"ultimate-seat,\" the Court should allow the weight of the relevant factors in evidence to determine the outcome. Because there appears to be such strong creditor support in favor of a Brazilian COMI\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Constellation\n   Overseas has significant management, interest, and revenue generation in Brazil, the Court finds that the weight of evidence favors a COMI in Brazil. Although Constellation/Parent indirectly owns Constellation Overseas and the Court found Constellation/Parent's COMI to be in Luxembourg, this location of the parent company's management should not be a strong enough factor to sway all of the other factors that point toward Brazilian recognition (particularly when half of Parent's Board of Directors are Brazilian citizens) for Constellation Overseas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Indeed, Alperton seeks to oversimplify the COMI analysis for the Group of companies by essentially equating the COMI of the ultimate parent as the de-facto COMI for the group. In its proposed findings of fact, where it argues that all Chapter 15 Debtors other than Petr\u00f3leo Constellation have a Luxembourg COMI, Alperton asserts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-283\">\n   The fact that each of Constellation Overseas, the Drillship Subsidiaries and Snover has the same sole director illustrates that the decision making for these entities is not done at the Drillship Subsidiary or the Constellation Overseas levels. Instead, they are ultimately wholly owned, controlled and managed by Parent and, as a result, the COMI of each of these entities also lies with Parent in Luxembourg.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   (Alperton FOF \u00b6 128.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   However, this would be fundamentally improper as a governing rule; it is simply untrue that looking at the location of the board of directors for a group of companies, in isolation, can be determinative of the COMI of each company within the group. It overlooks the important fact that board meetings are for most large companies, far less routine or central to management than the work performed by the executives of a company. It overlooks the fact that 98.7% of the Constellation Group's revenue is generated in Brazil, the vast majority of the Group's 1,200 employees are in Brazil, Brazil law regulates the operation of most of the Group's physical assets, most of the strategic day to day operations for the Group take place in Brazil, and more of Parent/Constellation's board members reside in Brazil than in Luxembourg. To suggest that the true COMI of the entire group is in Brazil based on the number and location of board members of the subsidiaries combined with the fact that the Parent's COMI is Luxembourg misinterprets the law. If anything, the case law asks the Court to look at a spectrum of factors-including non-board management, the location of assets, the expectations of creditors, the desires of creditors, and the jurisdiction with the greatest interest in the outcome etc. When the Court considers the spectrum of these factors with respect to Constellation Overseas, Brazil seems to be the real COMI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Alpha Star's COMI is in Brazil\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   Based upon the Court's foregoing findings of fact related to Alpha Star and the most relevant COMI factors, discussed below, the Court finds that Alpha Star's COMI is located in Brazil at this time as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Location of the Debtor's Place of Incorporation is the BVI\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   Alpha Star is incorporated in the BVI.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Alpha Star also benefits from the Constellation Group's shared management in Brazil that is responsible for its shared financial, legal, investor relations services and operational co-ordination activities.

The location of the sole director of each of these entities in the Cayman Islands is outweighed by the importance of the day-to-day management in Brazil, particularly where few factors point to the Cayman Islands and no party in interest (including the JPLs) suggests the Cayman Islands as the COMI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   The central coordination of the rigs in Brazil is also important as weighed against Alperton's suggestion that the COMI of these drillship subsidiary entities should be in Luxembourg. In addition to arguing that their sole director located in the Cayman Islands suggests that these entities should have a COMI in Luxembourg, Alperton argues that\n   <em>\n    Oi\n   </em>\n   supports a finding of COMI in Luxembourg for these entities, because in\n   <em>\n    Oi\n   </em>\n   the court considered that the larger corporate group was \"headquartered and managed from the principal executive office of Oi in Rio de Janeiro Brazil.\" (Alpteron FOF \u00b6 129 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Oi Brasil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268677\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/578/169/#p213\">\n    578 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   227 ).) However, Alperton's own quote seems to support a COMI in Brazil for these entities in the sense that the\n   <em>\n    Oi\n   </em>\n   court looked to the principal\n   <em>\n    executive office\n   </em>\n   of the group of companies (not the location of the headquarters).
