The debtor (\"\n   <em>\n    Debtor\n   </em>\n   \") seeks an order from this Court determining that the (i) entry of a final judgment (the \"\n   <em>\n    Final Judgment\n   </em>\n   \") in Debtor's state court divorce proceeding and (ii) filing of a motion to compel in that same proceeding by Debtor's ex-wife, Susan Vigder (the \"\n   <em>\n    Ex-Wife\n   </em>\n   \"), violated the automatic stay. As a result, the Debtor argues that the Final Judgment is either void or voidable. In addition, based upon an\n   <em>\n    ore tenus\n   </em>\n   motion, Debtor seeks an order to show cause why the ex-wife's marital attorney, Grant J. Gisondo (\"\n   <em>\n    Attorney Gisondo\n   </em>\n   \"), should not be held in contempt and sanctioned for violating the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court denies the Motion to the extent it seeks to void the final judgment and deem its entry a stay violation, but grants the Motion to the extent it seeks to stay collection activities to enforce payment of Ex-Wife's legal fees. In addition, the Court will issue an order to show cause why Attorney Gisondo should not be held in contempt for violating the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Divorce Proceeding\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After eight years of contentious litigation, the Circuit Court in and for Palm Beach County, Florida (the \"\n   <em>\n    State Court\n   </em>\n   \") conducted a hearing in the couple's divorce proceeding on November 27, 2018. At the conclusion of that hearing, the State Court issued an oral ruling stating that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   : (1) the parties were officially divorced; (2) Ex-Wife would receive the marital home as her past due and future alimony; and (3) Attorney Gisondo was entitled to legal fees in the amount of $ 20,000, which the State Court directed Debtor to pay (the \"\n   <em>\n    Oral Ruling\n   </em>\n   \"). The State Court\n   judge requested that Attorney Gisondo prepare a written final judgment, circulate it to Debtor's marital counsel, Stuart House (\"\n   <em>\n    Attorney House\n   </em>\n   \"), and submit it for entry upon the State Court docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Attorney Gisondo prepared a draft judgment (the \"\n   <em>\n    Draft Judgment\n   </em>\n   \") and sent it to Attorney House, who failed to timely respond with his comments. At Ex-Wife's urging, Attorney Gisondo scheduled a hearing on January 16, 2019 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Final Hearing\n   </em>\n   \") to present the Draft Judgment to the State Court and thereby assure its entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Bankruptcy Filing and the Post-Petition Final Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Immediately prior to the Final Hearing, Debtor filed a voluntary petition under chapter 11 on January 9, 2019 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Petition Date\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Exhibit 1. That same day, Debtor's bankruptcy counsel, Angelo Gasparri (\"\n   <em>\n    Attorney Gasparri\n   </em>\n   \"), filed a suggestion of bankruptcy on the State Court docket and served a copy of it on \"all parties who have made an appearance on [sic] the case via the Florida E-Filing Portal.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Exhibit 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Attorney Gisondo did not advise Ex-Wife about the bankruptcy filing, nor did any attorney or party present at the Final Hearing mention the commencement of Debtor's bankruptcy case (the \"\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Case\n   </em>\n   \"). During the Final Hearing, the State Court found that the Draft Judgment accurately memorialized the prior Oral Ruling. The State Court judge signed the Draft Judgment and directed the clerk of the State Court to enter it upon the docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Final Judgment recounts the history of the couple's divorce proceeding and describes testimony by Debtor, Debtor's accountant, and Ex-Wife during several evidentiary hearings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Exhibit 4, at 2. The State Court found Debtor's testimony regarding his allegedly distressed financial condition not to be credible and similarly questioned the veracity of the testimony offered by Debtor's accountant on the same issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The State Court expressed concern about Ex-Wife's ability to collect future alimony if the court awarded her periodic payments, particularly given that Debtor was already $ 89,000 in arrears on his existing temporary alimony payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. As a result, in the Final Judgment, the State Court ordered the marriage dissolved, gave Ex-Wife title to the marital home as her past-due and future alimony, awarded Ex-Wife's counsel $ 20,000 in legal fees, and ordered Debtor to pay those fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   One month after entry of the Final Judgment (which was also approximately one month after the Petition Date), Debtor had still failed to execute the quitclaim deed in favor of Ex-Wife and likewise had not paid Attorney Gisondo's court-ordered legal fees. On February 28, 2019, Ex-Wife filed a motion (the \"\n   <em>\n    Motion to Compel\n   </em>\n   \") in the State Court seeking to compel Debtor to perform the acts mandated by the Final Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Exhibit 11. Although Attorney Gasparri emailed Attorney Gisondo requesting withdrawal of the Motion to Compel, Attorney Gisondo failed to comply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Exhibit 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Debtor's Schedules and SOFA\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Debtor filed his initial schedules of assets and liabilities and statement of financial affairs in this bankruptcy case on January 23, 2019. In Schedule A, Debtor indicated that he did not own any real property. Debtor also neglected to include his Ex-Wife as a creditor in his schedules and in his creditor's matrix, and omitted the pendency of the divorce proceeding from his schedule of pending litigation. Because of those omissions, Ex-Wife did not receive notice from this Court regarding\n   the commencement of Debtor's Bankruptcy Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Immediately after Debtor's receipt of the Motion to Compel in the divorce proceeding, he amended his schedules to include (i) an interest in the marital home on Schedule A, (ii) his Ex-Wife as a creditor for past due alimony owed to her in Schedule F, (iii) the divorce proceeding as pending litigation in his Statement of Financial Affairs, and (iv) his Ex-Wife upon the creditor matrix.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Sanctions Motion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   One day later, on March 1, 2019, Debtor filed the Motion seeking sanctions for violation of the automatic stay pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k) against Ex-Wife. Debtor premises his arguments upon the postpetition entry of the Final Judgment on the State Court docket and the postpetition filing of the Motion to Compel. Because both acts occurred postpetition, Debtor contends that (i) the Final Judgment is void or voidable, and (ii) both Ex-Wife and Attorney Gisondo violated the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Appearing pro se in the Bankruptcy Case, Ex-Wife filed several versions of a response to the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 46, 48 and 60. Ex-Wife titled her filings as either a \"response\" to the Motion or a \"motion to dismiss\" the Motion and included a request that the automatic stay be lifted. At a preliminary hearing conducted on March 26, 2019, the Court determined that the complexity of the factual issues warranted an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Evidentiary Hearing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court conducted the evidentiary hearing on April 3, 2019. At the commencement of the April 3 hearing, the Court inquired why Attorney Gasparri had failed to subpoena Attorney Gisondo to appear at the hearing, considering Debtor's request for sanctions against him. Attorney Gasparri admitted that this failure was an oversight. Because Debtor's apparent goal was to obtain sanctions against both Ex-Wife and Attorney Gisondo, the Court announced that Attorney Gisondo's absence prevented the parties from proceeding with an evidentiary hearing on the Motion at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Since all other parties were present, the Court offered Debtor the opportunity to proceed immediately with a hearing on the Motion on the condition that Debtor waive sanctions in connection with a stay violation. Alternatively, the Court offered to continue the evidentiary hearing so that Attorney Gasparri could correct his oversight and subpoena all required parties. After consulting with Debtor, Attorney Gasparri announced that Debtor agreed to waive his request for sanctions so that he might proceed with the Evidentiary Hearing that same day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During the Evidentiary Hearing, both Debtor and Ex-Wife submitted exhibits and testified in support of their respective positions. The Court observed that, during testimony, Debtor appeared uncertain about certain facts relating to his Bankruptcy Case and was noticeably evasive in response to questions about the Oral Ruling and the Final Judgment. By contrast, the Ex-Wife was forthright and clear in recounting the factual history of the couple's marriage and marital dispute, succinctly relaying facts that were obviously uncomfortable for her to describe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After Debtor and Ex-Wife completed their testimony, Debtor's counsel moved,\n   <em>\n    ore tenus\n   </em>\n   , for an order to show cause why Attorney Gisondo should not be held in contempt for violating the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the end of the hearing, the Court took the matter under advisement. After considering the Motion, the Responses, the exhibits introduced and testimony adduced during the evidentiary hearing, as well as arguments of the parties, for the reasons stated below, the Court grants, in part, and denies, in part, the Motion, and grants Debtor's\n   <em>\n    ore tenus\n   </em>\n   motion for an order to show cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jurisdictional Statement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

The stay bars the continuation of any litigation seeking a recovery from the debtor or asserting a claim against estate property until the case is disposed of by the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carver v.

The first exception excludes any civil action seeking the dissolution of a marriage, except to the extent that the action seeks to determine the division of bankruptcy estate property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 362(b)(2)(A)(iv). The second exception covers the establishment or modification of an order for a domestic support obligation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 362(b)(2)(A)(ii). The third exception permits collection of a domestic support obligation from property that is not property of the estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 362(b)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court must determine whether postpetition entry of the Final Judgment violated the automatic stay by (i) granting Ex-Wife sole title to the marital home as\n   her alimony, (ii) liquidating her attorney's claim for fees due by Debtor, and (iii) directing Debtor to pay those fees. Debtor asserts that Ex-Wife (through counsel) violated the stay twice: first, when Attorney Gisondo presented the Final Judgment for entry by the State Court, and second, when Attorney Gisondo filed the Motion to Compel commanding Debtor's compliance with the Final Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Ex-Wife contends that no stay violation occurred because the State Court pronounced its judgment in the divorce proceeding in the Oral Ruling, which was issued well before the Petition Date. Further advancing that argument, Ex-Wife insists that the State Court's entry of the Final Judgment was merely a ministerial act that related back to the November 13, 2018 hearing. Finally, Ex-Wife argues that, if this Court concludes that a stay violation occurred, the Court should nonetheless permit retroactive relief from the automatic stay to validate the Final Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Ex-Wife claims that Debtor's actions after the Oral Ruling support her contention that entry of the Final Judgment did not circumvent the automatic stay. On December 20, 2018, prior to the Petition Date, Debtor filed a verified motion to stay entry of Final Judgment and re-open presentation of evidence in the State Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ex-Wife believes that this filing demonstrates Debtor's understanding of the Oral Ruling's finality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As part of its analysis of any potential stay violation, the Court must initially determine whether the State Court's award of title to the marital home as Ex-Wife's alimony, and the award of legal fees to Ex-Wife's marital counsel, each constituted domestic support obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Domestic Support Obligations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Through its enactment of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Congress ensured that the federal district court, acting through the bankruptcy court, has exclusive jurisdiction over a debtor's assets upon the filing of a bankruptcy case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) and \u00a7 157. However, Congress also clarified that the state court retains jurisdiction over the dissolution of a marriage. The state court's jurisdiction encompasses the division of marital assets as well as the establishment and amendment of domestic support obligations. Because the plain language of \u00a7 362(b)(2) exempts domestic support obligations from operation of the automatic stay, the Court must first analyze whether both the award of title to the marital home and entitlement to legal fees constitute domestic support obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(ii) and (iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   What is a domestic support obligation?

The State Court's award of title to the marital home to Ex-Wife was clearly fashioned as an equitable remedy. In the transcript of the November 27, 2018 hearing held in State Court, the State Court judge expressed his concern that Debtor would default on the payment of a monetary award of alimony, as he was already in arrears in the amount of $ 89,000 for past due alimony as of the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex-Wife's Exhibit C, at pp. 8-17. To avoid the necessity of Ex-Wife having to regularly enforce payment of a monetary award of alimony, the State Court fashioned an equitable remedy and awarded Ex-Wife title to the marital home in lieu of past due and future alimony.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Final Judgment also awarded legal fees to Ex-Wife's counsel and directed Debtor to pay those fees to such counsel. This award raises the question of whether the legal fees payable by a debtor for his ex-spouse's counsel gives rise to a domestic support obligation. In analyzing this issue, courts have considered whether the attorneys' fees were incurred in connection with obtaining alimony or child support from the payor spouse, and whether the fees were ordered to be paid by the payor spouse because of the relative financial condition of each of the spouses. As noted by the court in\n   <em>\n    In re Palomino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750258\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/355/349/\">\n    355 B.R. 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

In that instance, the former spouse will be impacted if the debt is discharged and therefore it is reasonable to treat it in substance as a debt \"owed to her\" under the statute. However, if only the debtor is obligated and discharge will have no financial impact on the former wife, this Court finds no reasoned basis for expanding the \"debt to\" element in the statute in order to apply \u00a7 523(a)(5) solely for the protection of third party professionals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2953865\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/365/251/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2953865\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/365/251/\">\n    at 256-257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In the Final Judgment, the State Court found that, based upon the relative financial condition of Debtor and Ex-Wife, \"the Wife has a need for the Husband's contribution towards her attorney's fees, and the Husband has the ability to pay.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Exhibit 4, at \u00b6 21. The State Court made this finding after noting that Ex-Wife has a \"meager income of $ 819.00 per month\" while Debtor appears to be making enough income through his businesses that he can fund living expenses of $ 6,554.00 per month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court finds that the State Court's liquidation of Ex-Wife's legal fees created an additional domestic support obligation because the fees were incurred in connection with the establishment of alimony due to Ex-Wife. It is clear from the remarks made by the State Court judge about the respective financial conditions of Debtor and Ex-Wife that the judge believed that Debtor was in a better financial position than Ex-Wife to pay such fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex-Wife's Exhibit C, at pp. 8-17. Because Ex-Wife retained her marital counsel, Ex-Wife continues to be liable for the legal fees due her counsel if Debtor fails to pay such fees. As a result, the Court concludes that the legal fees due Ex-Wife's counsel constitute an additional domestic support obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Property of the Estate\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Debtor argues that even if the award of title to the marital home constitutes a domestic support obligation, Debtor's interest in the marital home is property of the estate pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Debtor exhibited this position in at least two ways. First, on December 20, 2018, Debtor filed a verified motion to stay entry of final judgment and to re-open testimony and evidence (the\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Motion to Stay\n   </em>\n   \") in the State Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex-Wife's Exhibit A. The filing of the Motion to Stay demonstrates that Debtor understood that he had lost any interest in the marital home based upon the Oral Ruling. Second, Debtor failed to list an interest in the marital home in his original schedules of assets and liabilities filed in this Court under penalty of perjury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 12 (also identified as Ex-Wife's Exhibit F), at p. 3. By not scheduling the marital home on Schedule A as real property in which he had a legal or equitable interest, Debtor implicitly conceded that the marital home was not property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   However, approximately one month after Debtor filed his original schedules, Debtor filed an amended set of schedules. In his amendment, Debtor included the marital home as an asset, the past due alimony owed to Ex-Wife as a debt, and Ex-Wife as a party entitled to notice on the creditor matrix in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 31 (also identified as Debtor's Exhibit 5), at pp. 3, 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court cannot help but consider the timing of these amended schedules in the context of the relief sought by Debtor. When Ex-Wife and her counsel filed the Motion to Compel seeking an order directing Debtor to execute the quitclaim deed to the marital home in favor of Ex-Wife and to pay Ex-Wife's attorney's fees, Debtor must have finally realized that the Final Judgment had been entered after the Petition Date, and apparently developed his argument that a stay violation had occurred. There was only one problem. Debtor had not listed the marital home as an asset of his bankruptcy estate, nor his Ex-Wife as a creditor to whom alimony was due. In order to seek sanctions against Ex-Wife and her counsel, Debtor had to first amend his schedules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Exhibit 5, at p. 3, 10. The amendment allowed Debtor to argue that a stay violation had occurred, and provided a basis to file the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The question then arises whether a subsequent amendment to Debtor's schedules that added the marital home as property of the estate could retroactively create a stay violation, or whether Debtor is judicially estopped from arguing that a stay violation occurred when Ex-Wife and her counsel acted in reliance on Debtor's original schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court finds that Debtor's eleventh-hour amendment to his schedules contradicts both the Motion to Stay and his original schedules, which he filed under penalty of perjury. Further, for the Debtor to suddenly adopt the stance that the marital home constituted property of the estate appears to be a change of position arising in the exigency of the moment, and indicates an intention to make a mockery of the judicial system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Facts and circumstances demonstrating Debtor's intent to use his bankruptcy case as a \"weapon\" against Ex-Wife include Debtor's (i) relative level of sophistication,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ii) decision to amend the schedules within days of filing a motion for sanctions against Ex-Wife, (iii) lack of prior disclosure despite Debtor's active participation in the divorce proceedings over the course of the eight years preceding the Petition Date, (iv) failure to list Ex-Wife on the creditor matrix prior to the amendment, (v) timely disclosure of other pending litigation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   but not litigation regarding his asserted interest in the marital home, and (vi) lack of credible testimony regarding the reason for the original omissions.\n   <em>\n    Slater v. U.S. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266500,12270199\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1174/\">\n    871 F.3d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1185 (11th Cir. 2017). Collectively, the Court finds that these facts unequivocally indicate Debtor's intent to make a mockery of the judicial system.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266500,12270199\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court therefore concludes that Debtor's last-minute amendment to his schedules did not create a stay violation where one previously had not occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Another reason exists for the marital home not to be considered property of the estate. Accepting as true Debtor's assertion that the Oral Ruling was ineffective as a ruling of the State Court and the Final Judgment is void (which the Court does not adopt), then the Court must also find that dissolution of Debtor and Ex-Wife's marriage was equally ineffective. In that instance, the marital home would constitute tenancy by the entirety property, as it was owned by Debtor and Ex-Wife as husband and wife, without an express contrary intent to hold title to the property in another fashion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Exhibit 8;\n   <em>\n    Dillworth v.

Following this analysis, if this Court adopted Debtor's position that the Oral Ruling was ineffective and the Final Judgment is void, then Debtor and Ex-Wife's marriage would not be dissolved, and the marital home would continue to be owned by them as tenants by the entireties. As tenancy by the entirety property, the marital home would not be property of the estate because Debtor is the sole debtor in his Bankruptcy Case.\n   <em>\n    Kossow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8954133\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/325/478/\">\n    325 B.R. at 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under this logic, the Final Judgment would not have violated\n   the stay with respect to the award of title to the marital home as alimony, as the marital home would not have been deemed property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   However, the Court is not swayed by Debtor's argument. The Court finds that, based upon Debtor filing the Motion to Stay in State Court following the Oral Ruling and the omission of the marital home on his original schedules, Debtor is judicially estopped from claiming the marital home as property of the estate. The Court further finds that the State Court's award of title to the marital home to Ex-Wife as alimony did not violate the automatic stay because it did not involve the division of property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Final Judgment qualified under the exception to the automatic stay solely to the extent that it addressed dissolution of the marriage and payment of the alimony as a domestic support obligation. The domestic support obligation consisted of alimony payable through the transfer of title to the marital home previously owned by Debtor and Ex-Wife as tenants by the entireties, and, as discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the liquidation of the legal fees due Attorney Gisondo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Necessity of Stay Relief\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Debtor failed to list the marital home in his original schedules as property of the estate and waited until January 23, 2019 to file those schedules. As of the date of the Final Hearing, the only information that Ex-Wife's marital attorney had about Debtor's bankruptcy was simply that it had been filed. The filing and service of the suggestion of bankruptcy on Ex-Wife's attorney through the Florida E-Filing portal provided her sole form and manner of notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Receipt of the suggestion of bankruptcy should have impelled Attorney Gisondo to immediately seek relief from the automatic stay to proceed with the Final Hearing, submission of the Final Judgment, and filing of the Motion to Compel. Although stay relief was not required with respect to the portion of the Final Judgment ordering dissolution of Debtor's and Ex-Wife's marriage, it would have nonetheless been appropriate for Attorney Gisondo to seek stay relief for two reasons. First, as of the date of the Final Hearing, Attorney Gisondo could not have known whether Debtor was asserting an interest in the marital home because Debtor had not yet filed his initial schedules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the proposed Final Judgment liquidated Ex-Wife's attorneys' fees, and both the Final Judgment and the Motion to Compel directed Debtor to pay those fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Section 362(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a petition filed under section 301, 302, or 303 of this title ... operates as a stay, applicable to all entities, of- (6) any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Attorney Gisondo knew that the proposed Final Judgment awarded title to the marital home to Ex-Wife and liquidated his fees for representing Ex-Wife with a direction to Debtor to pay such fees. The exception from the automatic stay for dissolution proceedings extends to the declaration of dissolution of the marriage but does not encompass a division of marital property that is property of the estate or the payment of a domestic support obligation from property of the estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carver v.

As a result, Attorney Gisondo should have sought stay relief to ensure that entry of the Final Judgment would not violate the automatic stay. Attorney Gisondo's failure to seek stay relief prior to filing the Motion to Compel further demonstrates that this filing and the submission of the Final Judgment were both willful acts that violated the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   To establish a willful violation of the automatic stay, the movant bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) a bankruptcy petition was filed; (2) the violator received notice of the petition; and (3) the violator's actions were in willful violation of the automatic stay.

Second, Debtor created the situation that resulted in the stay violation by not informing all parties of his Bankruptcy Case at the Final Hearing, and failing to include the marital home in his initial schedules. Third, given the eight years that Debtor and Ex-Wife have been litigating over their divorce, it is not far-fetched to view this Bankruptcy Case as just another weapon in Debtor's arsenal to avoid paying alimony to Ex-Wife and the legal fees due to her counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   If the Ex-Wife had filed a motion for stay relief prior to the Final Hearing, this Court likely would have granted relief to permit exactly what happened: dissolution of the marriage, award of alimony, direction to Debtor to execute the deed transferring title to the marital home to Ex-Wife, and liquidation of the legal fees due to Attorney Gisondo. What the Court would not have permitted is a direction to Debtor to\n   <em>\n    immediately\n   </em>\n   pay the legal fees due to Attorney Gisondo.

She asserts that the Oral Ruling was effective as an order of the State Court immediately upon issuance at the Final Hearing. Under this theory, the subsequent entry of the Final Judgment was merely a ministerial act that did not violate the automatic stay, much like the filing of a document to perfect a security interest or lien on property pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Several Florida appellate courts have considered arguments of this nature in the context of a motion for recusal of a trial judge.

The Final Judgment is valid and enforceable to the extent that it provides for: (a) the dissolution of the marriage of Debtor and Ex-Wife; (b) the award of lump sum alimony in the form of Debtor's one-half interest in the marital home; (c) the distribution of the\n   <em>\n    custodia legis\n   </em>\n   funds, including the determination of any pending charging liens; (d) the liquidation of the attorney's fees due to Ex-Wife's marital attorney; (e) the determination that such fees are the obligation of Debtor; (f) the restoration of Ex-Wife's maiden name; and (g) the reservation of jurisdiction by the State Court, except to the extent that any ruling of the State Court potentially affects property of Debtor's bankruptcy estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   4.

Flagler Drive, Courtroom 801A, West Palm Beach, Florida to show cause why he should not be (a) held in contempt of court as a result of the violation of the automatic stay arising from (i) the filing of the Motion to Compel and refusal to withdraw such motion, and (ii) his failure to file a motion seeking relief from the automatic stay in this Court prior to submitting the Final Judgment to the State Court, and (b) sanctioned in the sum of $ 1,050 to compensate Debtor's counsel for the cost of preparing and attending the evidentiary hearing on the Motion, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED in the Southern District of Florida on May 3, 2019.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    By proceeding on April 3, 2019, Debtor limited his request for relief under the Motion to a determination of whether (i) the Final Judgment was potentially void or voidable, and (ii) the filing of the Motion to Compel violated the automatic stay.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    During Debtor's testimony, he was unable to remember that the marital home was omitted from his original schedules and that it was only added as property of the estate on his amended schedules. During Ex-Wife's testimony, she revealed that she had bought the marital home in 1983, prior to her marriage to Debtor. Within two months after they married, Debtor demanded that Ex-Wife put the house in both of their names, or he would have the marriage annulled. Ex-Wife acquiesced to Debtor's demand to quitclaim an interest in the marital home to the two of them, as husband and wife, because she was so desperate to make her marriage to work.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    The State Court denied the motion on January 16, 2019.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    The Final Judgment includes a division of funds (identified as the \"custodia legis funds\") held in the State Court registry.
