Holman is the administrator of the estate of Elaine Cook (\"Cook\"), deceased. Holman is suing Johnson &amp; Johnson (\"J &amp; J\") (and others) on various legal theories, all arising under state law, to recover damages against J &amp; J for its role in allegedly causing cancer-related injuries to Cook. The injuries allegedly arise out of exposure to talc used in J &amp; J's products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   J &amp; J allegedly acquired most or all of its talc from Imerys, a company now in bankruptcy in the District of Delaware.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   J &amp; J argues that removal of the state law claims to this court is proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201452\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) due to the pending Imerys bankruptcy case and the existence of \"related to\" bankruptcy jurisdiction over the state law claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Several Preliminary Matters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Several preliminary matters need to be addressed at the outset. First, in reaching its decision, this court will apply the law of the Seventh Circuit, even though Imerys's bankruptcy case is pending in the Third Circuit. Under section 1452(a), this court must look to its own jurisdiction, and section 1452(b) similarly speaks of the court to which the claims have been removed as being the proper court to equitably remand the claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201452\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (b) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cabibi v. Avon Prod., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV1903037CJCJCX,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201976438\">\n    2019 WL 1976438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (C.D. Cal. May 3, 2019) (looking to the law of the Ninth Circuit notwithstanding the fact that Imerys's bankruptcy case is pending in the Third Circuit).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, J &amp; J urges this court to defer ruling until after the Delaware District Court rules on the pending section 157(b)(5) motion. But J &amp; J has removed the claims to this court under section 1452(a). Section 1452(a) prompts an inquiry into this court's\n   <em>\n    jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   , and section 1452(b) prompts an inquiry into whether it is prudent for this court to exercise jurisdiction even if it exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201452\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (b). Section 157(b)(5), by contrast, is not jurisdictional at all; that section relates only to the proper federal trial venue for personal injury and wrongful death tort claims.\n   <em>\n    Stern v. Marshall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,4332163\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/462/\">\n    564 U.S. 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479-80,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,6049563,4332163\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2594/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,4332163\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/462/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (holding that\n   section 157(b)(5) is not jurisdictional). Accordingly, this court believes that the interplay between sections 157(b)(5) and 1452 does not give this court a sound legal reason to delay a jurisdictional inquiry under section 1452, especially where such a delay would likely operate to the prejudice of the state court plaintiff. This court therefore declines to stay the resolution of this matter pending the outcome of the section 157(b)(5) motion in Delaware.\n   <em>\n    Cabibi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201976438\">\n    2019 WL 1976438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 n.2 ;\n   <em>\n    Holman v.

Mo. Jan. 25, 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, the parties raise legal questions about whether mandatory abstention is appropriate in this case and whether J &amp; J has complied with the proper time limits in removing the state law claims to this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), 157(b)(2)(B), 157(b)(4);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), (3) ; Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9027(a)(2). Because this court rules below that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, and because the court further rules that it would equitably remand the claims to state court under section 1452(b) even if subject matter jurisdiction did exist, the court does not reach the merits of these other points of contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The problem with this argument is that J &amp; J points to general statements that the shared policies exist, but J &amp; J does not point to specific language in any particular policies themselves. It is therefore not possible for the court to conclude, for jurisdictional purposes, that J &amp; J and Imerys do\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   share insurance subject to the same cap that will be affected by the Holman lawsuit. J &amp; J's shared insurance argument thus does not support the existence of \"related to\" jurisdiction over the state law claims asserted in the Holman lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Combustion Eng'g, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139100,9171516\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/190/\">\n    391 F.3d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232-33 (3d Cir. 2004) ;\n   <em>\n    FedPak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6465203,7634099\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/207/\">\n    80 F.3d at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (expressly stating that the test for \"related to\" jurisdiction in the Seventh Circuit is more limited than the \"sweeping\" test articulated in the Third).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The argument generally runs as follows. Since Imerys's pre-petition contractual right to insurance proceeds would be property of its bankruptcy estate, the requisite nexus for \"related to\" jurisdiction might be established if J &amp; J could draw on the same insurance pool to cover expenses/liability stemming from the Holman lawsuit, since to draw on a common insurance fund with a shared cap would tend to decrease the value of the insurance to the Imerys estate.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dow Corning Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6475184,452766\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/482/\">\n    86 F.3d 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 494 (6th Cir. 1996) (discussing a similar argument).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Even in the Third Circuit it would likely be improper to base \"related to\" jurisdiction on shared insurance without evidence as to the precise terms and scope of the shared insurance policies at issue.\n   <em>\n    Combustion Eng'g\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139100,9171516\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/190/\">\n    391 F.3d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232-33 (3d Cir. 2004).

The only evidence that J &amp; J primarily points to is comprised of statements that the shared policies exist (along with a 2001 supply agreement requiring one of the Imerys entities to maintain insurance naming J &amp; J as an insured).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal, Docket No. 1, at \u00b6 20 (referencing a memorandum of law attached as an exhibit); Mem.

The cases relied upon by J &amp; J for this proposition, such as\n   <em>\n    Dow Corning\n   </em>\n   , themselves rely on the very broad and sweeping test for \"related to\" jurisdiction that has been expressly rejected by the Seventh Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dow Corning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6475184,452766\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/482/\">\n    86 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   489 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FedPak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6465203,7634099\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/207/\">\n    80 F.3d at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting this sweeping test).

J &amp; J's Response, Docket No. 17-1, at 21. At least one court of appeals has noted that an \"identity of interest\" between the debtor and the non-debtor party is usually found to exist in certain cases\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     because of\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   possible indemnity claims or shared insurance policies.\n   <em>\n    Combustion Eng'g\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139100,9171516\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/190/\">\n    391 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   225 n.35, 230-31. This court has already concluded above that the existence of indemnification agreements and the\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   existence of shared insurance are not enough to establish \"related to\" jurisdiction in this circuit for the purposes of removal under section 1452(a). It would be anomalous and inconsistent to now rule that \"related to\" jurisdiction exists under an \"identity of interest\" theory where the success of that theory depends on the very indemnification agreements and possible shared insurance agreements already ruled to be insufficient to establish jurisdiction. Hence, this court concludes that \"related to\" jurisdiction does not exist based upon any identity of interest theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, this court concludes that it does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the removed state law claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Accordingly, factor 5 favors remand, since there is no other federal jurisdictional basis for the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Factor 6 also favors remand. Factor 6 demands an inquiry into \"the degree of relatedness or remoteness of the proceeding to the main bankruptcy case.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac. R.

Imerys is not a defendant. The main impact on the estate would be from (1) indemnification agreements, which would allow J &amp; J to assert a claim against the Imerys estate, and from (2)\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   shared insurance agreements, which could potentially deplete the amount of insurance funds directly available to the Imerys estate. J &amp; J, however, has not alleged that it has filed a claim or that it is deemed to have a claim against the Imerys estate for any indemnification obligations. J &amp; J has also not provided concrete proof of shared insurance. While the Holman lawsuit\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have a conceivable impact on Imerys's bankruptcy case, the suit would still be remote from the Imerys bankruptcy. Accordingly, factor 6 favors remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Factor 7 prompts this court to look at \"the substance rather than form of an asserted 'core' proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac.

There are no core bankruptcy matters from which to sever the state law claims; as indicated above in connection with factor 2, these state law claims do not, on their own, present issues of bankruptcy law. Even if it were assumed that core bankruptcy matters were implicated by the Holman lawsuit, it would be entirely feasible to allow judgments to be entered in state court against J &amp; J. J\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   &amp; J is not a debtor in bankruptcy; the bankruptcy court presiding over the Imerys bankruptcy would likely never be called upon to directly enforce any judgment against J &amp; J. And if the court were called upon to enforce any such judgment against J &amp; J, and if jurisdiction existed under section 1334 for the bankruptcy court to enforce any such judgment against J &amp; J, it is hard to see why it would not be feasible for that court to do so. Factor 8 favors remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Factor 9 directs the court to look at \"the burden of [the bankruptcy court's] docket.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac. R. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6527354,10514579\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/6/1184/\">\n    6 F.3d at 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is nothing to indicate that this court's docket is currently unduly burdened or that the Holman lawsuit (considered either in isolation or in connection with the related removed proceedings) would cause such an undue burden. Factor 9 counsels against remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Factor 10 prompts an inquiry into \"the likelihood that the commencement of the proceeding in bankruptcy court involves forum shopping by one of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac. R. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6527354,10514579\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/6/1184/\">\n    6 F.3d at 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Due to the prior attempt to bring the Holman lawsuit to federal court using a different jurisdictional hook, this factor favors remand. But not by much. This court is not presently in a position to know precisely what J &amp; J's subjective removal motivations are.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Factor 11 asks the court to address \"the existence of a right to a jury trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac. R. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6527354,10514579\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/6/1184/\">\n    6 F.3d at 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Presumably the existence of such a right favors remand. This factor should not weigh heavily in the balance, however, due to the likelihood that a jury trial would also exist in federal court should the claims not be remanded. The federal constitutional jury guarantee appears to be broader than its Illinois counterpart.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Heinold Commodities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"478219\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/163/33/\">\n    163 Ill.2d 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20Ill.%20Dec.%20443\">\n    205 Ill.Dec. 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=643%20N.E.2d%20734\">\n    643 N.E.2d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753 (1994) (describing the two constitutional rights). Further, it is very unlikely, given that the Holman claims are asserted\n   <em>\n    against J &amp; J\n   </em>\n   and not against a debtor in bankruptcy (Imerys), that any jury trial right could be limited in federal court due to Imerys's pending bankruptcy case; that is, these state law claims are not being asserted against Imerys's estate or as part of dischargeability proceedings, where an otherwise inviolable jury trial right on state common law issues might be lost.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Granfinanciera, S.A. v.

It is also possible (even likely) that these state law claims are personal injury / wrongful death tort claims, meaning that any jury trial right would be preserved in federal court even if they were being asserted as claims against Imerys's estate and/or in dischargeability proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201411\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, because both\n   parties' rights to a jury trial would likely not be curtailed in federal court, this factor is neutral, even if all of the state law claims carry with them jury trial rights under Illinois law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Factor 12 asks about the \"presence in the proceeding of nondebtor parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac.

This factor favors remand. The debtor (Imerys) is not present at all in the proceeding. The proceeding is one being brought by a non-debtor against non-debtors. Accordingly, this factor favors remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   To sum up, then, seven factors favor remand, three are more or less neutral, and two favor not remanding the claims. At bottom, these claims are state law claims being brought by a non-debtor against non-debtors. The claims had been pending in state court prior to the commencement of Imerys's bankruptcy case.

Perhaps it is possible that if Imerys is sued in other litigation based on talc claims, J &amp; J might owe Imerys under an indemnification agreement.

The letter, however, is very equivocal: the insurer specifically states that it \"cannot presently confirm\" whether there is even a successor-in-interest at all to the originally insured entity (\"Windsor Minerals\"), let alone whether that successor-in-interest is one the Imerys entities.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Travelers Letter, Docket No. 1, Ex.
