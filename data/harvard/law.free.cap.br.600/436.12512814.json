Hammons dated December 28, 1989, as Amended and Restated (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Trust\n   </strong>\n   \") and a number of its subsidiaries and affiliates. In 2016, the Trust employed UBS Securities LLC as Debtors' financial advisor pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20328\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This matter now comes before the Court on UBS's application for fees and expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Creditor JD Holdings, L.L.C., which is obligated under Debtors' confirmed joint Chapter 11 plans to pay those fees and expenses to the extent awarded by the Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   opposes UBS's application and moves for a scheduling order, arguing that the application cannot be resolved without discovery and/or summary judgment. For the reasons set forth in this order, UBS's fee application will be granted in part and denied in part, and JD Holdings' motion for scheduling order will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Procedure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As an initial matter, this order must address a procedural issue raised by JD Holdings. JD Holdings is correct that its objection to UBS's fee application creates a contested matter governed by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, JD Holdings continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   The current posture at best, Your Honor, for UBS, I suppose would be - - and I believe the Court alluded to this previously - - akin to a motion for judgment on the pleadings, but I think it's important to remember that there is no rule. The rule for judgment on the pleadings does not apply in this bankruptcy court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because the rule for judgment on the pleadings ( Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), made applicable to adversary proceedings through Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7012 ) is not among the rules listed in Rule 9014(c) as applicable to a contested matter, JD Holdings concludes that this Court cannot resolve this contested matter absent a separate motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   JD Holdings' argument fails because contested matters are raised by motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014(a), and a motion is not a \"pleading\" as that term is used in the federal rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sunlight Saunas, Inc. v. Sundance Sauna, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3103598\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/427/1022/#p1029\">\n    427 F.Supp.2d 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1029 (D. Kan. 2006).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7007(a) (\"Pleadings\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7007(b) (\"Motions and Other Papers\"). Thus, the rule for judgment on the pleadings does not apply to this motion because that rule, by definition of a \"pleading,\" does not apply to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   motion. Under JD Holdings' interpretation of Rule 9014, every motion to which a party in interest has objected would require up to four months of discovery and a separate motion for summary judgment in order for the bankruptcy court to rule-an absurd result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The better interpretation is this: Rule 9014(a) mandates \"reasonable notice and an opportunity for hearing\" in a contested matter, both of which have occurred here. Because application of the rules listed in Rule 9014(c), including Rule 7056, is discretionary, no more is necessarily required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014(c) (\"Except as otherwise provided in this rule, and\n   <em>\n    unless the court directs otherwise\n   </em>\n   , the following rules shall apply ....\") (emphasis added). If this Court can permissibly rule on UBS's fee application now, it will do so. Alternatively, if the fee application and objection thereto should be considered \"pleadings,\" this Court has the discretion to direct that Rule 7012 shall apply to this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014(c) (\"The court may at any stage in a particular matter direct that one or more of the other rules in Part VII shall apply.\"). Either way, a separate motion for summary judgment is unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   John Q. Hammons, a hotel developer, created the Trust in 1989. In 2005, Mr. Hammons and the Trust entered into an agreement with JD Holdings that granted JD Holdings a right of first refusal on the sale of Debtors' hotels (the \"\n   <strong>\n    ROFR\n   </strong>\n   \"). JD Holdings subsequently sued the Trust and other Debtors for breach of the ROFR in the Delaware Court of Chancery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Debtors filed their Chapter 11 petitions on June 26, 2016. JD Holdings moved to dismiss the petitions or, in the alternative, for stay relief to pursue the Delaware litigation. This Court denied the motion, and JD Holdings appealed the order with the Tenth Circuit BAP. Meanwhile, Debtors rejected the ROFR and set out to sell their assets, including 35 hotels, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . JD Holdings appealed the order allowing rejection of the ROFR as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In September 2016, the Trust hired UBS to provide financial advisory services to Debtors in connection with their Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The letter agreement between the Trust and UBS (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Agreement\n   </strong>\n   \") entitles UBS to (\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 a \"Restructuring Transaction Fee\" upon consummation of a \"Restructuring Transaction\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 a \"Sale Transaction Fee\" upon consummation of a \"Sale Transaction\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 a \"Monthly Advisory Fee\" of $ 175,000;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 reasonable expenses, including reasonable legal fees, incurred by UBS\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   in entering into and performing services under the Agreement; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 costs and expenses incurred by UBS to enforce its rights under the Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   By order dated October 19, 2016 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Approval Order\n   </strong>\n   \"), this Court granted Debtors' application to employ UBS under \u00a7 328. The Approval Order provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   4. UBS is hereby engaged by the Debtors pursuant to \u00a7 328 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   5. The terms and provisions of UBS's engagement as well as the payments for services and success fees are reasonable and are hereby approved pursuant to \u00a7 328 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   6. The Debtors are authorized to pay all fees and expenses of UBS on the terms and conditions of [the Agreement], including but not limited to payment of any success fee from the proceeds of asset sales, restructuring or any financing transaction, as applicable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   7. UBS shall not be required to maintain time records for its services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Following entry of the Approval Order, UBS conducted \"extensive and robust marketing efforts\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   on Debtors' behalf. However, Debtors' planned asset sale under \u00a7 363 stalled when they could not find a company willing to provide title insurance to a buyer pending resolution of JD Holdings' appeals. Although Debtors identified a possible supplemental insurance product from Concord Specialty Risk that might have solved the title insurance issue for potential buyers other than JD Holdings (whom Concord refused to insure because its appeals caused the need for supplemental insurance in the first place), Debtors had not reached an agreement with Concord when their exclusive period in which to file a plan of reorganization began to run out. Consequently, on December 20, 2017, Debtors filed a disclosure statement and proposed plan under which Debtors' assets would not be sold-and creditors would not be paid-until 270 days after JD Holdings' appeals had concluded, which Debtors predicted would take place sometime in the year 2020.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On January 30, 2018, this Court denied approval of Debtors' disclosure statement as not containing the \"adequate information\" required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The Court reasoned that Debtors' disclosure statement lacked adequate information because it (1) listed \"as-improved\" hotel values without accounting for the significant capital expenditures necessary to reach those values and (2) relied on overly-optimistic financial projections rather than Debtors' actual financial performance. The Court also denied approval of Debtors' disclosure statement because their proposed plan was patently unconfirmable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court reasoned that the plan was unconfirmable because it (1) was not feasible, as its success hinged on the outcome of Debtors' litigation with JD Holdings over the allowance of JD Holdings' claims; and (2) denied impaired creditors a vote in violation of \u00a7 1129(a)(8). The next day, the Court terminated Debtors' exclusivity period (which would otherwise have ended on February 26, 2018) and ordered Debtors and JD Holdings to return to mediation. Five days later, JD Holdings filed its own plans of reorganization, under which it would pay all \"Allowed Claims\" in exchange for all of Debtors' \"Assets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Following a successful mediation, Debtors and JD Holdings entered into a Plan\n   Support Agreement (\"\n   <strong>\n    PSA\n   </strong>\n   \") under which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Debtors agreed to support confirmation of JD Holdings' proposed plans. The PSA included a Settlement Agreement between Debtors and JD Holdings. This Court approved the PSA under Rule 9019 on February 28, 2018, approved JD Holdings' amended disclosure statement on March 23, 2018, and confirmed the Joint Plans on May 11, 2018. Debtors' counsel argued in favor of the PSA, the disclosure statement, and the Joint Plans at each relevant hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   JD Holdings' counsel acknowledged Debtors' contributions at the March 23, 2018 disclosure statement hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   First, since the last hearing, I want to bring you up to speed. One, we want to thank the Debtor[s] for their [cooperation], both counsel, advisors, and the principals have been available to us, have been cooperating, sharing information, telling us where the bodies are buried, telling us what we have to deal with, helping us understand the structure, and working towards confirmation of the plan and implementation of the plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   So I'm also happy to announce that we have attached a form of the asset purchase agreement to the disclosure statement, again because of the cooperation, we all sat down and worked very hard on moving that forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   So the Debtor has been a very big partner with us in going forward at this point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   So since cooperation and peace broke out between the Debtors and JD Holdings, that has had an infectious effect on the rest of the case and things are going the way one would hope.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   and again at the April 27, 2018 plan confirmation hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   I also want to thank Mr. Shaiken, who is not here, for his hard work, Mr. Zluticky who has been working very [ ] hard for us, Mr. Strauss, the principals, Ms. Dowdy and Mr. Groves. We worked in the spirit of cooperation for the last six weeks very carefully, very closely together, to get to this point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Tenth Circuit BAP described the Joint Plans' progress as of August 2018:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   After entry of the order approving the PSA and the order confirming the Joint Plans, JDH and its affiliates: (a) paid more than 296 claims in full totaling some $ 397 million, paid the principal balance of two additional loans in the amount of approximately $ 252 million, and paid approximately $ 390 million to [commercial mortgage-backed securities lenders], such payments totaling more than $ 823 million; (b) acquired management companies that continue to employ thousands of employees at the 35 hotels that JDH and its affiliates acquired or intend to acquire pursuant to the confirmed Joint Plans; (c) acquired 27 of the hotels to be acquired by them under the Joint Plans; and (d) closed on a financing arrangement with Goldman Sachs through which JDH and its affiliates have drawn down approximately $ 635 million used to pay off mortgage loans on hotels it acquired pursuant to the\n   confirmed Joint Plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Although Debtors and JD Holdings have not yet closed on eight hotels subject to commercial mortgage-backed securities loans, JD Holdings is currently managing those hotels and making payments on the loans. All economic benefits from those hotels, and from all other assets whose transfer under the Joint Plans has been delayed by litigation (such as Debtors' interest in W &amp; H Realty, LLC), are now flowing to JD Holdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   JD Holdings' objection to UBS's fee application presents three issues. First, is UBS entitled to the fees and expenses it requests under the terms and conditions of the Agreement? Second, have those terms and conditions proved improvident under \u00a7 328 ? Third, does JD Holdings' objection merit discovery?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Entitlement to Fees and Expenses Under the Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   UBS requests payment of the following fees and expenses under the Agreement: (1) \"Transaction Fees,\" consisting of a Restructuring Transaction Fee and a Sale Transaction Fee; (2) unpaid Monthly Advisory Fees, if any; and (3) unpaid expenses (including legal fees). JD Holdings argues that UBS should not be awarded the fees and expenses it requests because (1) UBS breached the Agreement's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and (2) UBS is not entitled to the fees and expenses under the language of the Agreement and Approval Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Agreement is governed by New York law. \"[T]here exists under New York law an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, pursuant to which neither party to a contract shall do anything which has the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    M/A-COM Sec.

The Agreement defines \"\n   <strong>\n    Restructuring Transaction\n   </strong>\n   \" and \"\n   <strong>\n    Sale Transaction\n   </strong>\n   \":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   As used in this Agreement, the term \"\n   <em>\n    Restructuring Transaction\n   </em>\n   \") means,\n   <em>\n    whether effected directly or indirectly by the Company\n   </em>\n   and/or through an affiliate and/or a subsidiary, any restructuring, reorganization, rescheduling, refinancing or recapitalization or the Company's (or any other Debtor's or any of their respective subsidiaries) liabilities, including contingent liabilities (whether on or off balance sheet), whether through a plan of reorganization or liquidation, a comprehensive settlement arrangement, including with respect to any material litigation, an exchange, consent solicitation, repurchase, or repayment of any such liabilities, or any modification, amendment, deferral, forgiveness, restructuring, recapitalization, rescheduling, moratorium, or adjustment of the terms and/or conditions of any such liabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   As used in this Agreement, the term \"\n   <em>\n    Sale Transaction\n   </em>\n   \" means in one transaction or a series of transactions or potential transactions: ...\n   <em>\n    the marketing for, and the sale, transfer or other disposition of\n   </em>\n   any portion of the capital stock or assets of the Company, any other Debtor or any of their respective subsidiaries by way of a tender or exchange offer, option, negotiated purchase, leveraged buyout, lease or license, minority investment or partnership, joint or collaborative venture or otherwise ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   JD Holdings opposes both fees. First, JD Holdings argues that no Restructuring Transaction has occurred because the restructuring of Debtors' liabilities under the Joint Plans was not \"effected directly or indirectly\" by the Trust. This argument fails because the Trust\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   effect a restructuring of Debtors' liabilities through its execution of the Settlement Agreement and PSA, its cooperation with JD Holdings, and its support of the Joint Plans, as previously acknowledged by counsel for JD Holdings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Next, JD Holdings argues that no Sale Transaction has occurred because there was no connection between the marketing conducted by UBS and the disposition of Debtors' assets under the Joint Plans. This argument fails because a plain reading of the Agreement's definition of \"Sale Transaction\" does not require any\n   <em>\n    causal connection\n   </em>\n   between marketing and disposition; rather, it requires simply marketing\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   disposition, both of which have occurred. UBS and the Trust, both sophisticated parties represented by highly competent counsel, could have defined \"Sale Transaction\" to require a causal connection between the two. They did not.

However, since JD Holdings concedes that the term is itself unambiguous,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is unnecessary and, in fact, impermissible, to consult parol evidence-such as court transcripts and earlier drafts of the Agreement-as to whether that term contains a causal-connection requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schron v.

The plain meaning of \"Sale Transaction\" as defined in the Agreement contains no such requirement. This Court's inquiry ends there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, JD Holdings argues that neither a Restructuring Transaction nor a Sale Transaction will be \"consummated\" until the Joint Plans are \"fully executed.\" However,\n   the Joint Plans extinguish Debtors' liabilities and transfer liability for all Allowed Claims to JD Holdings. A Restructuring Transaction was thus consummated on May 17, 2018, when the Joint Plans became effective. Furthermore, the Joint Plans transferred an immediate equitable interest in all of Debtors' assets\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   to JD Holdings; the economic benefits from all assets, even those to which JD Holdings does not yet have legal title, are flowing to JD Holdings under the Joint Plans. In consideration for those assets, JD Holdings has assumed liability for all Allowed Claims. Whether JD Holdings has yet to pay some\n   <em>\n    creditors\n   </em>\n   is beside the point; the transfer of consideration from JD Holdings to\n   <em>\n    Debtors\n   </em>\n   , in the form of assumption of liability, is complete. Under these circumstances, a Sale Transaction was also consummated on May 17, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Because the Agreement provides that UBS is entitled to a\n   <strong>\n    Restructuring Transaction Fee\n   </strong>\n   of $ 7,000,000 upon consummation of a Restructuring Transaction, UBS will be awarded $ 7,000,000 as a Restructuring Transaction Fee. Calculation of the\n   <strong>\n    Sale Transaction Fee\n   </strong>\n   , which employs a sliding, percentage-based schedule, is not so simple:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Upon consummation of a Sale Transaction, whether in connection with the consummation of a Restructuring Transaction or not, an amount to be determined according to the following schedule (the \"Sale Transaction Fee\"), subject to a minimum Sale Transaction Fee of $ 3,000,000:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   1.5% of Sale Transaction Value (as defined in Annex A) for amounts up to and including $ 300 million; plus\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   1.0% of Sale Transaction Value for amounts in excess of $ 300 million and up to and including $ 600 million; plus\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   0.75% of Sale Transaction Value for amount[s] in excess of $ 600 million and up to and including $ 1 billion; plus\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   0.5% of Sale Transaction Value for amounts in excess of $ 1 billion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   If a Sale Transaction involves all or substantially all of the capital stock or assets of the Debtors, such Sale Transaction Fee shall be offset dollar for dollar against the Restructuring Transaction Fee otherwise payable in respect thereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Neither party has used Annex A of the Agreement to calculate a Sale Transaction Value. UBS argues that its Sale Transaction Fee should be calculated using an \"implied\" Sale Transaction Value of $ 1.2 billion. The Court declines to adopt this value for two reasons: (a) the $ 1.2 billion figure, which includes over $ 150 million in disputed claims, estimated amounts, and general reserve, is obviously inaccurate; and (b) Annex A states precisely how the Sale Transaction Value is to be calculated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, although UBS will be awarded a Sale Transaction Fee, this portion of UBS's fee application will remain under advisement. The parties must first come to an agreement as to (a) a Sale Transaction Value, calculated pursuant to Annex A as of March 8, 2019; and (b) a Sale Transaction Fee based on that amount, with any disputes to be resolved by this Court. These amounts may be recalculated after Debtors' remaining assets are sold, bearing in mind that all transactions shall be considered part of a single Sale Transaction\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   in calculating the Sale\n   Transaction Fee. Per the Agreement, this Fee shall be offset dollar-for-dollar by the Restructuring Transaction Fee and by 50% of any Monthly Advisory Fees paid to UBS in excess of $ 1,050,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Monthly Advisory Fees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Agreement provides for a \"\n   <strong>\n    Monthly Advisory Fee\n   </strong>\n   \" of $ 175,000 to UBS. In its objection, JD Holdings alleges that UBS has performed no services for months. However, at oral argument, UBS's attorney represented that UBS did perform work for Debtors under the Agreement each month through confirmation of the Joint Plans. The Agreement, which excuses UBS from timekeeping, requires nothing more. To the extent unpaid, UBS is hereby awarded Monthly Advisory Fees of $ 175,000 per month through May 11, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Expenses (Including Legal Fees)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Service Expenses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Section 2 of the Agreement provides that UBS shall be reimbursed \"for all reasonable expenses incurred by UBS in entering into and performing services pursuant to this Agreement, including the reasonable fees, disbursements, and other charges of UBS's legal counsel\" (\"\n   <strong>\n    Service Expenses\n   </strong>\n   \"). JD Holdings argues that UBS should not be awarded its claimed Service Expenses yet because UBS has not shown that those Service Expenses were reasonable. UBS responds that, as observed by this Court, approval of an agreement under \u00a7 328 is incompatible with a subsequent review for reasonableness under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20330\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This observation does not support UBS's position, however, because JD Holdings does not seek to review the Service Expenses for reasonableness under \u00a7 330. Rather, JD Holdings seeks to review the Service Expenses for reasonableness\n   <em>\n    under the Agreement itself\n   </em>\n   , which imposes a standard independent of \u00a7 330 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Whether or not any Transaction is consummated, and in addition to any fees payable to UBS, the Company shall reimburse UBS ... for all\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   expenses incurred by UBS in entering into and performing services pursuant to this Agreement, including the\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   fees, disbursements, and other charges of UBS's legal counsel ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Thus, JD Holdings is correct that UBS must show that its Service Expenses are reasonable-not under \u00a7 330, but under the Agreement itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   While UBS will be awarded Service Expenses, UBS has not yet made such a showing. Therefore, this portion of UBS's fee application will remain under advisement pending a demonstration of reasonableness to JD Holdings, with any disputes to be resolved by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Fee Defense Expenses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Section 9 of the Agreement provides that UBS shall be entitled to \"any costs and expenses incurred by UBS after the Termination Date to enforce its rights hereunder\" (\"\n   <strong>\n    Fee Defense Expenses\n   </strong>\n   \"). UBS thus asks for an award of Fee Defense Expenses, arguing that (1) UBS is entitled to reimbursement of such expenses under the Agreement, and (2) the Court approved the Agreement as \"reasonable\" under \u00a7 328, such that (3) those expenses may not now be reviewed for reasonableness under \u00a7 330.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   However, \u00a7 330 -the mechanism by which this Court may award compensation to UBS-requires more than a determination that a professional's compensation is \"reasonable\"; it also limits reasonable compensation to that which is for \"actual, necessary services rendered\" by the professional.

Put differently, while \u00a7 328 examines the\n   <em>\n    substance\n   </em>\n   of a professional's terms and conditions of employment, it says nothing about whether the professional\n   <em>\n    complied\n   </em>\n   with those terms and conditions.

However, as UBS correctly points out, the title insurance issue is a red herring. That issue did not cause UBS to earn fees without a \u00a7 363 sale. Rather, UBS earned fees without a \u00a7 363 sale because of Debtors' settlement with JD Holdings and the sale of Debtors' assets under the Joint Plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Settlement was clearly contemplated by the Agreement, which includes \"a comprehensive settlement arrangement, including with respect to any material litigation,\" as a method of effecting a Restructuring Transaction. Thus, settlement was not only\n   <em>\n    capable\n   </em>\n   of anticipation, it was\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   anticipated. As for the sale of Debtors' assets through the Joint Plans, liquidating plans are contemplated by the Bankruptcy Code itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(A) (addressing debtor discharge where \"the plan provides for the liquidation of all or substantially all of the property of the estate\"). And, while the Joint Plans are a creditor plan, JD Holdings' own objection-which argues that \"[t]he submission and confirmation of a creditor plan in a Chapter 11 proceeding is\n   <em>\n    uncommon\n   </em>\n   \"-implicitly acknowledges that creditor plans\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   sometimes confirmed. Under these circumstances, settlement and the sale of Debtors' assets through a creditor plan were clearly\n   <em>\n    capable\n   </em>\n   of anticipation. Even if UBS and the Trust did not\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   anticipate those developments when they executed the Agreement, that lack of anticipation does not establish grounds for disturbing UBS's pre-approved fee award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smart World\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705868\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/383/869/#p877\">\n    383 B.R. at 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Second, JD Holdings alleges that UBS had a professional duty to anticipate and address the title insurance issue, and that UBS's failure to satisfy that alleged duty was a development not capable of anticipation. However, the Agreement itself addresses UBS's liability to the Trust in the event UBS did not meet its professional obligations, providing that UBS would be liable only for \"gross negligence or willful misconduct ... in performing the services that are the subject of the Agreement.\" Because the Agreement itself anticipates UBS's alleged failure to meet its professional obligations, JD Holdings' argument that UBS's alleged failure was incapable of anticipation at the time UBS and the Trust entered into the Agreement must fail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Third, JD Holdings argues that it could not be anticipated that UBS might be awarded fees under the Agreement absent a causal connection between the work performed by UBS and the disposition of Debtors' assets and liabilities. This argument fails because it conflates the relevant \"developments\" analyzed under \u00a7 328 (here, Debtors' settlement with JD Holdings and the sale of Debtors' assets through the Joint Plans) with the\n   <em>\n    outcome\n   </em>\n   of those developments (an award of fees to UBS). Because this argument does not identify any relevant \"developments,\" it is-along with UBS's argument that a fee award would be \"unfair and inequitable\" under the circumstances-essentially an impermissible argument as to the reasonableness of UBS's fees.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re River Road Hotel Partners, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317566\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/536/228/#p239\">\n    536 B.R. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239 (Bankr.

Thus, the Court will not disturb UBS's fee award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Discovery\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   JD Holdings argues that this Court should not rule on UBS's fee application without discovery. However, Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) limits discovery to that which is \"relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case.\" Fed. R. Evid. 401(b), in turn, limits \"relevant\" evidence to facts that are \"of consequence in determining the action.\" Here, because each of JD Holdings' theories fails as a matter of law, no facts JD Holdings might discover would be of consequence to its objection. JD Holdings is not entitled to search the records of Debtors and UBS in order to develop new avenues of objection to UBS's fee application.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cuomo v.

All parties to this contested matter are aware of the relevant \"developments\" for purposes of \u00a7 328 : Debtors' comprehensive settlement with JD Holdings and the confirmation of a creditor plan. Discovery could only ever answer the wrong question: whether anyone\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   anticipated those developments. The right question-whether those developments were\n   <em>\n    capable\n   </em>\n   of anticipation-has already been answered in the affirmative here.
