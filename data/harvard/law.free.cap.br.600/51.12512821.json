Moberly, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   This matter came before the court on January 22, 2019 for hearing on the motion for summary judgment filed by the Defendant, United States of America (the \"Defendant\") against the Plaintiffs, Brenda and DC Chance (\"Plaintiffs\"). For the reasons stated below, the court grants the Defendant's motion and determines that the student loans owed to the Defendant are nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs seek discharge of their student loans, alleging that payment of them would be an undue hardship.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8). The Defendant designated fourteen (14) exhibits as evidence in support of its motion for summary judgment. Those exhibits include discovery responses, the depositions of each of the Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs' school transcripts and copies of the Plaintiffs' bank statements from 2016 through late 2018. Its brief in support contained a section entitled \"Statement of Material Facts Not in Dispute\". This section contained a lengthy description of the Plaintiffs' work and educational history, student loans, subsequent work history and expenses. Each factual assertion was followed by a specific citation to the record supporting that fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Plaintiffs designated their affidavits as evidence in opposition to the motion. Their response contained a \"Statement of Material Facts in Dispute\" which did not specifically challenge any of the defendant's supported factual assertions. Each of the Plaintiffs has submitted an affidavit in support of their response. A recitation of undisputed facts follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Educational History and Loans\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Brenda Chance (\"Brenda\") is 56 years old and Plaintiff DC Chance (\"DC\") is 57 years old. Brenda graduated from high school in 1981 and worked in the mortgage loan industry and later as a dental assistant. DC did title work for approximately 15 years before 2005. Both had experienced either layoffs or downturns in their jobs in 2005 and decided to attend school full time. They both enrolled in Marian University in the spring semester of 2005 to study nursing and were required to complete and pass prerequisite courses with a GPA of 3.0 or higher in order to be accepted into the nursing program. DC either withdrew from or had to retake some of the prerequisite classes. Brenda was accepted into the nursing program after two years of taking prerequisite classes, but DC was not, having earned a cumulative GPA of 2.88. Brenda was enrolled in six (6) nursing classes in the fall of 2007. It was her understanding that if she failed to pass the classes with a C+ grade or better, she would be out of the nursing program and would not be allowed to reapply to the program for five years. She was not passing at least two of the classes with that grade and therefore withdrew from all of her classes to avoid the five-year prohibition. Since she had to wait a semester before she could reapply to the nursing program, Brenda took other non-nursing courses in the Spring of 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Motivated by cheaper tuition and family that lived there, the debtors moved to New Mexico and transferred to the University of New Mexico (\"UNM\") in 2008 to continue to pursue nursing degrees. UNM required nursing majors to take no fewer than 12 credit hours each semester, but\n   each of the Plaintiffs took no more than 10 credit hours in any given semester and attributed it to lack of class availability. From Spring, 2010 to Fall, 2011, both Plaintiffs took between three and four classes each semester. They each withdrew from no fewer than two classes each semester. Neither Brenda nor DC were accepted into the UNM nursing program. Both graduated in May 2013, Brenda with an associates degree in science, and DC with an associates degree in science and an associates degree in applied science general studies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As of January 12, 2018, Brenda owed the Department of Education $ 81,011.75 and DC owed it $ 77,637.50. Brenda was participating in the Department's income-based repayment (\"IBR\") program at $ 96 a month shortly before the date of the bankruptcy filing, but discontinued making those payments. DC is currently attending plumbing school and his loans are in forbearance. In addition to the Department of Education loans, the Plaintiffs have private loans with Navient, also named as a defendant in this action. The dischargeability of those loans is not at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    The Plaintiffs' Work Histories after UNM\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Neither DC nor Brenda were gainfully employed during the time they attended Marian University and UNM. After leaving UNM, Brenda was unemployed for two years, from 2013 to 2015. She was hired by Edwards Electrical and Mechanical in the accounts payable department in March 2015 and earned $ 13 an hour. She was laid off in February 2017. In March 2017, Brenda went to work for Accountemps at $ 15 an hour and worked there until August 2017. In August 2017, she found new employment at Fanimation, Inc. in the accounts payable department earning $ 19.23 an hour and she continues to be employed there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   DC worked for Swift as a truck driver in 2013 but was fired for too many accidents. After his departure from Swift in 2015, he worked at Metalworking Lubricants, AutoZone and FedEx. Since July 2015, DC has been working as a plumbing apprentice at Edwards Electrical and Mechanical and currently makes $ 19.70 an hour. He expected to complete the four-year plumbing apprenticeship sometime in 2019 and has the potential to increase his income if a journeyman position arises or if he decides to become a licensed plumber. He is required to stay with Edwards Electrical for four years after he completes the apprenticeship program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    The Plaintiffs' Financial Condition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Brenda and DC have no dependents and are above median income debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In their Schedule I, DC listed his employment as \"maintenance\" with Edwards Electrical &amp; Mechanical and Brenda listed hers as \"accounts specialist\" with Fanimation, Inc. The Plaintiffs filed their schedules on October 25, 2017, along with their bankruptcy petition. The Plaintiffs' Schedule I shows combined monthly income of $ 4755. DC contributes $ 198 a month to his retirement, but in their responses to the defendant's interrogatories, they disclosed that DC contributes 6% of his pay and Brenda contributes 8% of hers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Among the $ 4559 in expenses listed on Schedule J are $ 475 for charitable contributions, $ 96 for \"Dept of Education Student Loans\" and $ 918 for \"Navient Student Loans\", leaving a monthly net income of $ 196. The charitable contributions are the Plaintiffs' 10% tithe to The Caring\n   Place. In her deposition, Brenda testified that this expense was $ 622 a month. (Deposition of Brenda Lee Chance, ECF #33-1, pg 86 of 167, line 11-12). Records from The Caring Place obtained by the defendant show that the Plaintiffs never contributed more than $ 250 a month in 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The $ 918 payment to Navient is for Brenda's private student loan. DC also has a private student loan with Navient, but it is in forbearance and has not yet come due. Both Brenda and DC in their respective affidavits filed in opposition to the defendant's motion state, \"Navient...is willing to reduce my debt to $ 25,000 payable over 10 years at a reduced interest rate at $ 241.40 per month\", (Affidavit of Brenda Lee Chance, ECF #39, pg 10, \u00b66; Affidavit of DC Chance, ECF #39, pg 14, \u00b65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Currently, the Plaintiffs live with Brenda's father who owns his home free and clear. The Plaintiffs provide physical assistance and care to the father and pay him $ 800 a month to help him purchase groceries, medications and other essentials. The father also receives $ 2700 a month from his pension and Social Security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   According to Schedule B, the Plaintiffs own a 1997 Toyota and DC owns a 2002 Subaru, a 1989 Honda and a 1982 Suzuki motorcycle, all free and clear of liens. Each of the three cars has mileage of no less than 120,000. Brenda purchased a Toyota RAV4 in May 2018 and obtained a 6\u00bd year car loan with monthly payments of $ 315.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Plaintiffs maintain a checking at Huntington Bank. Most of the withdrawals from the checking account were by debit card. A review of the bank records from January 2016 through September 2018 show debit card charges for monthly, reoccurring charges owed to Capital One, Discover, Wells Fargo, Comcast, and Life Loc, and periodic payments on department store charges. Brenda frequented the Tyler Mason and Wildflower hair salons and visited these salons six times from January 2017 through September 2018 and spent an average of $ 116 per visit. Between April and September 2018, the Plaintiffs spent nearly $ 750 or an average of $ 125 a month, on \"Stitch Fix\", an online personal shopping subscription service. Most of the remaining debit charges were for eating out and movies. It was not unusual for the Plaintiffs to eat out at least 20 times each month. In August, 2018 alone, the Plaintiffs incurred 46 charges at restaurants and fast food places. In September, 2017, the month before they filed their chapter 7 case, they incurred 31 such charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Other charges bear mentioning. The attorney fee paid by the Plaintiffs to file their bankruptcy case did not cover attorney fees for dischargeability litigation. The Plaintiffs filed this adversary proceeding on December 13, 2017. They paid their attorneys no less than $ 4800 between November 28, 2017 and April 30, 2018 to represent them in this action. There was a $ 2,000 payment to \"Carmax\" on May 14, 2018 and a $ 1499 payment to \"SP RAD Power Bikes\" on April 20. 2018. The Plaintiffs filed their chapter 7 case on October 25, 2017 and between October 2, 2017 and October 31, 2017, the Plaintiffs made nine (9) payments to Navient that totaled no less than $ 2900.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Summary Judgment Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate in cases where there is \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact\" and the \"movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\" under Fed.

The Plaintiffs have no physical or mental disabilities that would compromise their ability to continue to work full time. The Plaintiffs each have associates degrees and possess the skills to maintain gainful employment. Both before and after the date of the chapter 7 filing, the Plaintiffs frequently dined out. They have not altered their lifestyle post-filing and have had sufficient funds to pay for hair salons, bikes, and an online personal shopping service while maintaining more than a minimal standard of living.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The Plaintiffs were in their early forties when they decided to attend school full time and enrolled at Marian University in 2005. A main contention of theirs is that they each will be able to work at most another 20 years and the loans will not be paid off by then. The current ages of the Plaintiffs in regard to their student loans is a direct result of the extended period of education at a relatively late age.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Brenda was participating in an IBR plan at $ 96 a month shortly before the bankruptcy was filed but ceased making those payments. Schedules I and J show that the Plaintiffs still have $ 196 a month left over even when factoring in the $ 96 IBR and the $ 918 monthly private Navient loan payment. The Navient loan has been reduced to $ 241.40 a month for each of the Plaintiffs, or $ 482.80 per month for both. The Plaintiffs' affidavits state that their current monthly payment under an IBA REPAYE program would be $ 234.52 for each of them or a total monthly payment of $ 469.05. The combined monthly payment for both loans would amount to $ 951.85, which is still less than the $ 1014 amount accounted for in the Plaintiffs' I and J with $ 196 left over. There is additional room in the budget considering that I and J overstated the actual amount of charitable contributions by $ 225 a month. Nothing in the record suggests that the Plaintiffs' income will decrease if they remain employed full time. To the contrary,\n    DC has the potential for an increase in pay after he completes his apprenticeship. The Plaintiffs would maintain an above-minimal standard of living even if they reduced the number of times they dine out and went to hair salons and cancelled their personal online shopping subscription. Reducing their retirement contribution from the maximum they currently take would further allow them to pay their student loan under an IBR plan while elevating already above-minimal standard of living. The Court finds that repayment of the loans would not cause the Plaintiffs to fall below the minimal standard of living, and therefore, the Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof on the first Brunner factor. The court will address the other two prongs of the Brunner test despite the fact that it is not obligated to do so since the Plaintiffs failed to prove the first Brunner prong.

The bankruptcy court found that the debtor demonstrated undue hardship\n    and determined the student loan was dischargeable. The district court reversed and found that the debtor failed on the third prong of good faith effort to repay because she had not enrolled in an IBR program that would have offered her a 25 year repayment schedule. The Seventh Circuit reversed and agreed with the bankruptcy court that the loan was dischargeable. It stressed that a good faith effort to repay entailed a debtor's past efforts to repay, not a commitment to future efforts to repay such as participating in an IBR program. See also,\n    <em>\n     In re Williams\n    </em>\n    , No. 18-2762,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20517608\">\n     2019 WL 517608\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *2 (7th Cir.

Even though the district court held, and was reversed on the finding, that Ms. Krieger did not prove undue hardship, it nevertheless found that Ms. Krieger\n    <em>\n     had paid as much as she could\n    </em>\n    during the 11 years since receiving the loans.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558954,4061029\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/882/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558954,4061029\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/882/\">\n     at 884\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That cannot be said of the Plaintiffs, given their maximum retirement contributions and spending habits. Furthermore, Brenda actually chose to participate in an IBR program at $ 96 a month pre petition and simply quit paying once the bankruptcy was filed. The reduction in the Navient loan monthly payment and the overestimation of the Plaintiffs' charitable contributions easily would have freed up sufficient funds for Brenda to continue making this payment. Defendant's exhibits 8 and 9 provide that as of January 12, 2018, DC had paid $ 292. Brenda's $ 96 IRB payments are not reflected, so the amount of her loan payments made before she ceased making them is not known. DC's loan is still in deferment, and his attempt to discharge it before it becomes due is not indicative of a good faith attempt to repay it. The Plaintiffs have neither maximized their income nor minimized their expenses and have not made a good faith effort to repay the loans and therefore they fail under this third prong.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <em>\n     Partial Discharge under the\n     <em>\n      Fecek\n     </em>\n     Case\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The Plaintiffs argue that at least a portion of their student loans should be discharged, citing the\n    <em>\n     Fecek\n    </em>\n    case\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    decided by my colleague Bankruptcy Judge James Carr.\n    <em>\n     Fecek\n    </em>\n    involved a 43 year old single above-median income debtor who had no dependents. She attempted to discharge private loans with Sallie Mae that totaled more than $ 279,000. The debtor's contractual monthly payment on these loans was between $ 2,000 and $ 2677. The debtor was employed full time as a registered nurse earning $ 22.70 an hour. Her monthly net pay was $ 3033.52 and her monthly expenses on her Schedule J were $ 3002.10, which included a projected monthly payment of $ 250 to Sallie Mae. The debtor also had federal loans that were backed by the United States government and had entered into an IBR plan with a monthly payment of $ 450. There was no income based alternative repayment with respect to the Sallie Mae loan because it was a private loan and could not be reduced without Sallie Mae's cooperation,\n    which Sallie Mae had refused.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201329414\">\n     2014 WL 1329414\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *6-7.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Judge Carr found that repayment of the loan would not afford the debtor even a minimal standard of living. He also concluded that the debtor would have been unable to pay the entire amount during any reasonable repayment period and that she made good faith attempts to pay the loan and to reach out to Sallie Mae to make alternative payment arrangements. Judge Carr determined that the debtor was entitled to a partial discharge of the student loan but had the financial wherewithal to pay $ 500 a month to Sallie Mae every month for 180 months (15 years). He gave her a six-month deferment before commencing payments.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *9.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <em>\n     Fecek\n    </em>\n    is distinguishable from this case in that the loans at issue here are eligible for treatment under an IBR repayment option and in fact such an option has been offered. The Plaintiffs' combined monthly loan payment under a REPAYE program would be $ 469.05. Plaintiffs in their reply brief contend that their combined contractual monthly loan payment would be $ 1691.48 a month which would comprise nearly 37% of the Plaintiffs' current monthly net income of $ 4597.53. They also contend that the interest on their loans is accruing at $ 720.46 a month. They point out that the REPAYE monthly payment would not be enough to pay the interest, let alone reduce the indebtedness, on the loans. The result at the end of a 20-year repayment period - when the Plaintiffs are in their mid to late 70's-would be a balance owed that is as large if not larger than the current outstanding loans. Presumably, the unpaid portion of the loan would be forgiven and discharged at the end of the 20-year period and the amount of the forgiven debt would be taxed as income to the Plaintiffs, creating a substantial tax bill.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    A potential tax liability at the end of the repayment period is too speculative to constitute an undue hardship.\n    <em>\n     In re Archibald\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9410634\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/280/222/#p229\">\n     280 B.R. 222\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 229 (Bankr.
