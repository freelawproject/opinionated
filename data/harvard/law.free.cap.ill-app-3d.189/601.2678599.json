The trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent eight years\u2019 imprisonment terms. On this appeal the defendant claims for reversal that (1) the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could find defendant guilty of attempted murder upon a finding that defendant intended to do great bodily harm; (2) the evidence failed to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of attempted murder; (3) his conviction and sentence for possession of controlled substances with intent to deliver should be reduced to mere possession of controlled substances; and (4)(a) the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement to the jury, (b) the voluminous irrelevant, prejudicial, inadmissible evidence, and (c) the prosecutor\u2019s capacious argument to the jury on the facts and circumstances surrounding the issuance of the search warrant denied the defendant a fair and impartial trial. We reverse and remand for a new trial for the following reasons.</p> <p id=\"b624-5\" pgmap=\"624\">The State\u2019s trial evidence established that Chicago police officer Richard Rowan, the alleged attempted murder victim, and 10 additional Chicago police officers went to 1110 West 50th Street, Chicago, Illinois, to execute a search warrant for narcotic drugs. The officers knocked on the apartment door and announced their office. Officer Rowan testified that he heard a commotion inside the premises which sounded to him like someone running. Rowan smashed into the apartment door with a battering ram and gained entry into the apartment.</p> <p id=\"b624-6\" pgmap=\"624\">Upon entering the apartment, Officer Rowan related that he saw the defendant run up the stairs to the second floor. Officer Rowan stated that he yelled, \u201cpolice officer,\u201d drew his weapon and ran up the stairs in pursuit of the defendant. Upon arriving at the top of the stairs, Officer Rowan stated that he saw the defendant, at the end of a hallway, cross over from one bedroom into another. Rowan ran down the hallway to the bedroom door that the defendant had entered. The bedroom door was partially open. Rowan related that the defendant was in a crouched stance behind the door with a gun in his hand pointed at Officer Rowan\u2019s head, and that the defendant struck him in his face with the gun. Officer Rowan further stated that he attempted to knock the defendant\u2019s gun away but that defendant continued to point the gun at his head and simultaneously grabbed Officer Rowan\u2019s gun with his left hand. It was at this time, Officer Rowan testified, that he shot the defendant in his abdomen. Officer Rowan testified on cross-examination, however:</p> <blockquote id=\"b624-7\" pgmap=\"624\">\u201cQ. You also had occasion to make a report of this, did you not?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b624-8\" pgmap=\"624\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b624-9\" pgmap=\"624\">Q. I ask you to take a look at that. Do you recognize what Defense Exhibit No. 9 for identification is, Officer?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b624-10\" pgmap=\"624\">A. Yes, this would be the second page of a case report, on a vice case report.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b624-11\" pgmap=\"624\">Q. Who is the author of it?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b624-12\" pgmap=\"624\">A. If you mean who typed it, I am not sure, probably Officer Ramirez.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b624-13\" pgmap=\"624\">Q. Is the name of Richard Rowan on that report?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b624-14\" pgmap=\"624\">A. Yes, it is.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b624-15\" pgmap=\"624\">Q. Did you tell Officer Ramirez what was in \u2014 what to put in this report?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b624-16\" pgmap=\"624\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b624-17\" pgmap=\"624\">Q. Anywhere in this report, officer, is it that you were hit in the face with the defendant\u2019s gun?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b625-2\" pgmap=\"625\">A. No.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b625-3\" pgmap=\"625\">Q. Is it anywhere in this report, in your report, did you say that the defendant was crouched?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b625-4\" pgmap=\"625\">A. No.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b625-5\" pgmap=\"625\">Q. Is it anywhere in this report that you state that the defendant grabbed your gun?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b625-6\" pgmap=\"625\">A. Not in the narcotics report, no.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b625-7\" pgmap=\"625\">Q. Is it in any report that you made did you make mention of the fact on any reports that you made, did you make a report of the fact that the defendant grabbed your gun?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b625-8\" pgmap=\"625\">[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Object, Your Honor, to the form of the question.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b625-9\" pgmap=\"625\">THE COURT: He can answer the question, did you write any reports wherein you indicated that the defendant had grabbed your gun, is that correct Mr. [defense attorney]?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b625-10\" pgmap=\"625\">[Defense Attorney]: Yes, Judge.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b625-11\" pgmap=\"625\">A. That is the only report I prepared, all the other reports were prepared by the detectives.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b625-12\" pgmap=\"625\">[Defense Attorney]: Q. So, is it true, officer that the answer is no, I did not make a report that contained those answers?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b625-13\" pgmap=\"625\">A. I made no other reports, no.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b625-14\" pgmap=\"625\">A brief struggle ensued between Officer Rowan and the defendant until the other officers, who were immediately following behind Officer Rowan by five or six feet, arrived and assisted Rowan in subduing the defendant. Officer Rowan yanked the gun out of the defendant\u2019s hand.</p> <p id=\"b625-15\" pgmap=\"625\">The officers searched and seized from the defendant\u2019s person a plastic bag containing 7.71 grams of heroin and another plastic bag containing .45 grams of cocaine. In the bedroom across the hallway from the bedroom in which Officer Rowan shot the defendant, the officers found an Illinois Bell Telephone bill in the name and address of Femi Okundaye, apartment 11, 1110 West 50th Street, a triple-beam scale used to measure cocaine and heroin, a glass pipe used to smoke cocaine, a hypodermic needle used for the intravenous injection of heroin, and two plastic bags of 49.85 grams and .55 grams of cocaine, respectively.</p> <p id=\"b625-16\" pgmap=\"625(63) 626(4)\">Officer Michael Duffin examined the gun that Officer Rowan said the defendant pointed at his head. Duffin stated that the cylinder of the gun had three live rounds in three of the five chambers; that the chambers directly in front of and directly to the left of the firing pin were empty and the gun could be fired only by pulling the trigger three times for firing.</p> <p id=\"b626-5\" pgmap=\"626\">Mary Cook, a defense witness, testified that she was in the apartment and that the defendant was in the bathroom on the second floor when the police entered.</p> <p id=\"b626-6\" pgmap=\"626\">The defendant also testified that he was in the second-floor bathroom when the officers entered the apartment and ran up the stairs to him. The defendant related that one of the officers rushed up to him, pointed a gun at his stomach and asked him for the \u201cmoney and dope.\u201d Defendant asked the officer if he had a search warrant. With his teeth clenched, the officer angrily responded, \u201cThis is my search warrant,\u201d referring to the gun the officer had pointed at defendant\u2019s abdomen. The officer shoved the gun into defendant\u2019s abdomen. The officer further pressed his gun against the defendant\u2019s abdomen and it went off. The defendant fell wounded to the floor, and as he was lying there, the officer tried to put a gun in his hand and told him, \u201cIf you don\u2019t hold it \u2014 do you want to be shot again?\u201d The defendant denied that he ever had a gun in his possession.</p> <p id=\"b626-7\" pgmap=\"626\">On rebuttal, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Stuart Palmer testified that he questioned defendant at the hospital after the defendant\u2019s surgery there for his gunshot wound, that the defendant initially denied that he owned the gun, but later admitted the gun belonged to him. Palmer admitted that the defendant\u2019s post-surgery statement was never reduced to writing, that he did not tell the defendant that he could end his questioning when he desired and that his interrogation of the defendant terminated when the defendant\u2019s attorney arrived at the hospital.</p> <p id=\"b626-8\" pgmap=\"626\">We initially sua sponte note that count I of the indictment, the purported attempted murder count, alleges in pertinent part, that:</p> <blockquote id=\"b626-9\" pgmap=\"626\">\u201c[0]n or about May 7, 1985, at and \"within the County of Cook Femi Okundaye committed the offense of attempt in that he without lawful justification with intent to commit the offense of murder, intentionally and knowingly attempted to kill Richard Rowan by pointing a loaded handgun into his face, in violation of Chapter 38, Section 8 \u2014 4/(38\u20149\u20141) of the Illinois Revised Statutes 1983 ***.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b626-10\" pgmap=\"626\">Said chapter 38, section 8 \u2014 4(a), of the Illinois Revised Statutes (1983) alleged in count I to have been violated by the defendant defines \u201cattempt\u201d as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b626-11\" pgmap=\"626\">\u201cA person commits an attempt wnen, with intent to commit a specific offense, he does any act which constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 38, par. 8 \u2014 4(a).</blockquote> <p id=\"b627-4\" pgmap=\"627\">Count I of the instant indictment failed to allege that the defendant committed \u201cany act which constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that [attempt murder] offense.\u201d Our research does not reveal a single case of appellate review of a conviction for attempted murder in which the indictment or information failed to allege (1) \u201cthat the defendant committed \u2018[an] act which constitute^] a substantial step toward the commission of that offense\u2019; and (2) the specific act which constituted the substantial step toward the commission of the attempted murder offense.\u201d Our research reveals that in every case of appellate review of an attempted murder conviction, the indictment or information alleged that the defendant committed an act which constituted a substantial step toward the commission of the attempted murder, and also alleged the specific act committed by the defendant which constituted the substantial step toward the commission of the attempted murder. (People v. Roberts (1978), 56 Ill. App. 3d 667, 372 N.E.2d 143, rev\u2019d on other grounds (1979), 75 Ill. 2d 1, 387 N.E.2d 331; People v. Harris (1978), 72 Ill. 2d 16, 19-20, 377 N.E.2d 28; People v. Muir (1977), 67 Ill. 2d 86, 90, 365 N.E.2d 332; People v. Trinkle (1977), 68 Ill. 2d 198, 199-200, 369 N.E.2d 888; People v. Viser (1975), 62 Ill. 2d 568, 581, 343 N.E.2d 903.) The supreme court in People v. Jones (1979), 81 Ill. 2d 1, 8-9, 405 N.E.2d 343, specifically held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b627-5\" pgmap=\"627\">\u201cThe offense of attempted murder requires the mental state of specific intent to commit murder, to kill someone. Section 8\u2014 4(a) of the Criminal Code of 1961 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1973, ch. 38, par. 8 \u2014 4(a)) clearly sets this out: \u2018A person commits an attempt when, with intent to commit a specific offense, he does any act which constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that offense.\u2019 Knowledge (emphasis in original) that the consequences of an accused\u2019s act many result in death (or grave bodily injury), or intent to do bodily harm, is not enough; specific intent to Mil is required (People v. Trinkle (1977), 68 Ill. 2d 198, 201-04). Both the indictment and the instruction must unambiguously reflect this.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b627-6\" pgmap=\"627(90) 628(49)\">The instant indictment alleged that the defendant \u201cattempted to kill Richard Rowan by pointing a loaded handgun into his face.\u201d But the indictment does not allege that such act was an act or was the act which constituted a substantial step towards the defendant\u2019s commission of the alleged attempted murder. Nor does the indictment allege, as beforestated, that any act, or what act was committed which constituted a substantial step towards the defendant\u2019s commission of the offense. The mere pointing of a loaded gun into Rowan\u2019s face does not establish per se an intent to kill Rowan, and likewise, the mere pointing of a loaded gun in Rowan\u2019s face does not necessarily per se constitute a substantial step towards the commission of attempted murder, particularly in the total absence of an allegation that such act did so.</p> <p id=\"b628-5\" pgmap=\"628\">Because the validity of count I has not been briefed and argued by the parties before us, and also because we reverse the defendant\u2019s attempted murder and possession of controlled substances with intent to deliver convictions on other grounds, and remand for a new trial, we decline to resolve the question of the validity of count I.</p> <p id=\"b628-6\" pgmap=\"628\">The defendant argues that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that it could find the defendant guilty of attempted murder even if the jury only found that the defendant only intended to do great bodily harm to Rowan.</p> <p id=\"b628-7\" pgmap=\"628\">The indictment charged the defendant with the offense of attempted murder of Richard Rowan, as previously set forth. \u201cMurder\u201d is defined in section 9 \u2014 1 of the Criminal Code of 1961 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 38, pars. 9 \u2014 1(a)(1), (a)(2)) as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b628-8\" pgmap=\"628\">\u201c(a) A person who kills an individual without lawful justification commits murder if, in performing the acts which cause the death:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b628-9\" pgmap=\"628\">(1) He either intends to kill or do great bodily harm to that individual or another, or knows that such acts will cause death to that individual or another; or</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b628-10\" pgmap=\"628\">(2) He knows that such acts create a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to that individual ***.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b628-11\" pgmap=\"628\">\u201cAttempt\u201d is defined in section 8 \u2014 4 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 38, par. 8 \u2014 4(a)), as previously set forth.</p> <p id=\"b628-12\" pgmap=\"628\">A defendant\u2019s specific intent to kill is an essential element of the offense of attempted murder, and it must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. People v. Trinkle (1977), 68 Ill. 2d 198, 369 N.E.2d 888; People v. McDaniel (1984), 125 Ill. App. 3d 694, 466 N.E.2d 662.</p> <p id=\"b628-13\" pgmap=\"628\">In the case at bar, the trial court gave the jury three instructions which governed and controlled its deliberations on the attempted murder charge. Even though no act which constituted a substantial step towards the commission of the attempted murder was alleged, the trial court nevertheless instructed the jury on attempt, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b628-14\" pgmap=\"628\">\u201cA person commits the offense of attempt when he, with the intent to commit the offense of murder, does any act which constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of the offense of murder. The offense attempted need not have been committed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b629-4\" pgmap=\"629\">The trial court instructed the jury on murder, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b629-5\" pgmap=\"629\">\u201cA person commits the. offense of murder when he kills an individual without legal justification if in performing the acts which caused the death he intended to kill or do great bodily harm to that individual.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b629-6\" pgmap=\"629\">The trial court instructed the jury on the attempted murder issues, as follows, although, as stated, no act constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the attempted murder offense was alleged.</p> <blockquote id=\"b629-7\" pgmap=\"629\">\u201cTo sustain the charge of attempt the State must prove the following propositions: First, the defendant performed an act which constituted a substantial step toward the commission of the offense of murder, and second, that the defendant did so with the intent to commit the offense of murder.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b629-8\" pgmap=\"629\">If you find from your consideration of all the evidence that each one of these propositions has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, you should find the defendant guilty.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b629-9\" pgmap=\"629\">If you find from your consideration of all the evidence that any one of these propositions has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, you should find the defendant not guilty.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b629-10\" pgmap=\"629\">Thus, the defendant contends, the jury was instructed that it could find the defendant guilty of attempted murder on a finding that the defendant intended to kill Richard Rowan, but that the jury was also additionally, but erroneously, instructed that it could likewise find the defendant guilty of attempted murder on the jury\u2019s alternative finding that the defendant solely intended to do only great bodily harm to Richard Rowan, and even though the jury might also find that the defendant did not intend to kill him.</p> <p id=\"b629-11\" pgmap=\"629\">The evidence was far from overwhelming that the defendant intended to kill Officer Rowan. Indeed, such evidence was quite vulnerable, vincible and assailable, as we later herein more specifically observe. Defendant had an absolute right to have the jury determine by accurate governing instructions whether he acted with or was guilty of the specific intent to kill Officer Rowan.</p> <p id=\"b629-12\" pgmap=\"629(89) 630(17)\">It has been long and well settled that an instruction to a jury that it may find a defendant guilty of attempted murder upon its finding that the defendant intended to do great bodily harm is erroneous reversible error. People v. Harris (1978), 72 Ill. 2d 16, 24, 26-27, 377 N.E.2d 28; People v. Trinkle (1977), 68 Ill. 2d 198, 201, 204, 369 N.E.2d 888; People v. Gentry (1987), 157 Ill. App. 3d 899, 903-04, 905-06, 510 N.E.2d 963; People v. Cantu (1987), 157 Ill. App. 3d 934, 937-38, 510 N.E.2d 1183; People v. McDaniel (1984), 125 Ill. App. 3d 694, 701, 466 N.E.2d 662.</p> <p id=\"b630-3\" pgmap=\"630\">The State argues that because defendant did not object to the instructions or rely on their invalidity on his motion for a new trial, the defendant waived the issue on appeal. Conversely, the defendant argues that because of the grave error of the erroneous instruction, because the jury was not correctly instructed on this evidentiary factually close case and/or on the defendant\u2019s intent to kill, fundamental fairness required that the jury be properly instructed and that the waiver rule should therefore not apply. Moreover, the defendant urges that inasmuch as the erroneous instruction and the failure to correctly instruct the jury on the fragile evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, the error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and should be considered by this court as plain error under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 615(a). We agree. People v. Ogunsola (1981), 87 Ill. 2d 216, 222, 429 N.E.2d 861; People v. Harris (1978), 72 Ill. 2d 16, 28, 377 N.E.2d 28; People v. Gentry (1987), 157 Ill. App. 3d 899, 510 N.E.2d 963; People v. McDaniel (1984), 125 Ill. App. 3d 694, 466 N.E.2d 662.</p> <p id=\"b630-4\" pgmap=\"630\">In People v. Tannenbaum (1980), 82 Ill. 2d 177, 182, 415 N.E.2d 1027, the supreme court held that an exception to the waiver rule is contained in Rule 451(c), which permits the review of substantial defects in instructions if the interests of justice require, to correct grave errors or the case is close factually, and fundamental fairness requires that the jury be properly instructed. We hereafter note that the instant case is close factually, and as the supreme court held in People v. Joyner (1972), 50 Ill. 2d 302, 307, 278 N.E.2d 756:</p> <blockquote id=\"b630-5\" pgmap=\"630\">\u201c[T]he defendants\u2019 failure to tender the appropriate *** instruction was not as important with reference to the fundamental fairness of their trial as the requirement that the jury be fully and properly instructed. The failure to [properly] instruct on this important aspect of the case necessitates a remand for a new trial.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b630-6\" pgmap=\"630(123) 631(81)\">The State\u2019s reliance on People v. Roberts (1979), 75 Ill. 2d 1, 387 N.E.2d 331, is grossly misplaced. In Roberts, the defendant and his witness both admitted that the witness fired a shot from a powerful, .357 magnum Colt revolver in the door of a passing truck. The shot was fired directly in line with the truck driver\u2019s body, from the rear seat of the automobile driven by the defendant because she was disturbed when the passing truck awakened her from her nap. Roberts did not object to the \u201cgreat bodily harm\u201d instruction on his trial for attempted murder. Nor did he raise the issue instruction on his motion for a new trial. The supreme court held that the great bodily harm attempted murder instruction \u201cwas erroneous *** in that it told the jury that a person may commit the crime of murder when he has not only the intent to kill, but also when he has certain mental states other than an intent to kill,\u201d but that the exception provision of Supreme Court Rule 415(c) was inapplicable because, unlike in the case at bar, \u201cthe evidence in this case [Robert\u2019s] is not \u2018closely balanced.\u2019 \u201d 75 Ill. 2d at 14-15.</p> <p id=\"b631-5\" pgmap=\"631\">We conclude that because in the case at bar (1) there were substantial defects in the instructions; (2) the jury was not properly instructed; (3) the jury was instructed that it could find the defendant guilty of attempted murder simply upon a finding that the defendant only intended to inflict great bodily harm and did not intend to kill the alleged victim; (4) the interests of justice and fundamental fairness require; (5) to correct grave errors; (6) the case is factually close; and (7) the jury should have been correctly instructed, the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence for attempted murder must be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p> <p id=\"b631-6\" pgmap=\"631\">Defendant next argues that the evidence failed to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt that he attempted to murder Officer Richard Rowan. He adamantly urges that it was he who was shot by Officer Rowan, when, in response to his question to Rowan if he had a search warrant, Rowan angrily responded, \u201cHere\u2019s my search warrant,\u201d pressed his gun in the defendant\u2019s stomach and Rowan\u2019s gun went off. Defendant insists that Officer Rowan and the other officers\u2019 testimonial version of Rowan\u2019s shooting the defendant is a patently obvious concocted and fabricated subterfuge to cover up Rowan\u2019s accidental shooting of him.</p> <p id=\"b631-7\" pgmap=\"631\">Undeniably supportive of these contentions, the defendant demands, is the defendant\u2019s totally uncontradicted testimony that he was shot only once, and not in a vital area, but rather in his lower abdomen. Neither, the defendant insists, would ever have occurred, and indeed are even unimaginable by the most bizarre fantasy, if the shooting had occurred as related by the officers.</p> <p id=\"b631-8\" pgmap=\"631(110) 632(266)\">Defendant argues that upon the apartment being suddenly and forceably entered by a dozen police officers, for him to flee up a flight of stairs, followed by the officers with their drawn guns, enter a bedroom, take a crouch stance with a gun in his hand and point it at the head of Officer Rowan, who also had his gun drawn, would not only have been completely idiotic, it would also have been even more completely suicidal. The defendant posits that under the circumstances related by the officers, for Officer Rowan not to have riddled the vital organs of the defendant\u2019s body with gunshots demonstrates a truly unbelievable concern, and indeed an uncomprehensible and a totally unrealistic gracious consideration by Officer Rowan for the defendant\u2019s well-being and survival. For Officer Rowan to grab the defendant\u2019s gun, as he testified he did, and not shoot the defendant, as he assuredly would have done, the defendant urges, escalates the officers\u2019 version of Rowan\u2019s shooting of the defendant to a fanciful, ridiculous absurdity. Add to that, the defendant argues, the officers\u2019 compulsorily admitted testimony that the gun that they attributed to the defendant, which gun the defendant denied having had, did not even have a bullet in the chambers either under or next to the firing pin and would have required three pulls of the trigger to fire and that the defendant did not pull or attempt to pull the trigger, or for that matter, there was no evidence that the defendant even had his finger on the trigger, elevates the officers\u2019 version of the shooting to stark nonsense. The defendant insists that such a conclusion is inescapable even in the absence of Officer Rowan\u2019s pertinent testimony that he, significantly, never mentioned in his police report of the shooting that the defendant hit him in his face with the gun, or that the defendant was in a crouched position, or that the defendant grabbed his gun. The defendant finalizes that the officers\u2019 testimonial rendition of the incident is too preposterous to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt and that it should not be judicially condoned as a defense to Officer Rowan\u2019s unwarranted accidental shooting of him.</p> <p id=\"b632-5\" pgmap=\"632\">The defendant additionally argues that even if the officers\u2019 version is fallaciously accepted, their version nevertheless fails to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant attempted to murder Officer Rowan. He urges that the State\u2019s evidence that he pointed a gun at Officer Rowan\u2019s head, without any evidence that he had his finger on the trigger or that he attempted to pull the trigger or fire the gun and because the State\u2019s evidence established that the defendant could have fired or attempted to fire the gun if he had chosen to do so, and the undisputed State\u2019s evidence that the chambers of the gun were empty under and next to the firing pin and required three pulls of the trigger to fire, not only fail to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant\u2019s intent to attempt to kill Officer Rowan, but more importantly,' the foregoing State\u2019s evidence affirmatively established beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not intend to attempt to kill him. The defendant concludes that the mere pointing of the gun at Officer Rowan\u2019s head under these aforementioned circumstances certainly did not constitute a substantial step toward an attempt to murder the officer.</p> <p id=\"b632-6\" pgmap=\"632(10) 633(151)\">To sustain a conviction for attempted murder, the evidence must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had and acted with the specific intent to kill the victim and that he took a substantial step towards the commission of the attempted murder. (People v. Shum (1987), 117 Ill. 2d 317, 512 N.E.2d 1183.) The defendant\u2019s specific intent to kill may be shown by the surrounding circumstances, the character of the assault and the method in which the deadly weapon is used. (People v. Koshiol (1970), 45 Ill. 2d 573, 262 N.E.2d 446.) It is the function of the jury to determine the existence of the defendant\u2019s requisite intent, and that determination is not to be disturbed on review unless a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt clearly appears. Although the defendant\u2019s foregoing arguments and contentions are forceful, they are not sufficiently potent to warrant our disturbing the jury\u2019s guilty finding. Accordingly, we decline to reverse it.</p> <p id=\"b633-5\" pgmap=\"633\">We, likewise, and for the same reason, refuse to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict finding the defendant guilty of possession of controlled substances, cocaine and heroin, with intent to deliver. Although the defendant had no prior criminal record, not even an arrest, and denied that he lived in the premises in which he was arrested and in which the drugs were discovered and seized, and denied possession of the drugs, his possession of the drugs was a question of fact for the jury\u2019s determination. The competent and legally admissible evidence, if believed by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, was adequate to establish proof of the defendant\u2019s possession of the drugs and to sustain the jury\u2019s guilty finding. We reject the defendant\u2019s contrary argument and contention.</p> <p id=\"b633-6\" pgmap=\"633\">The defendant contends that the jury was precluded from making a proper assessment of whether the legally competent evidence established his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of possession of the drugs because of the improper influences of the other highly inflammable, prejudicial inadmissible evidence and the prosecutor\u2019s highly improper argument on the jury in its guilt decision-making process. The defendant persuasively argues that he was denied a fair trial by (1) the prosecutor's opening statement on; (2) the voluminous irrelevant, .prejudicial inadmissible evidence of; and (3) the prosecutor\u2019s capacious argument on the facts and circumstances of and surrounding the issuance of the search warrant. This argument is indeed meritorious, for which reason reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction of possession of the controlled substances and a new trial are required.</p> <p id=\"b633-7\" pgmap=\"633(36) 634(79)\">The defendant was charged with and was on trial for his alleged March 8, 1983, unlawful possession of the heroin and cocaine discovered on that date in and seized from a second-floor bedroom of a townhouse apartment at 1150 West 50th Street, Chicago, Illinois, in execution of a search warrant. The probable cause in the complaint for the search warrant was for, and the search warrant commanded the search of, \u201cFemi [with his description]\u201d and 1150 West 50th Street, not 1110 West 50th Street, the address of the premises at which the officers executed the search warrant and in which Femi Okundaye, the defendant, was arrested and the drugs were discovered and seized.</p> <p id=\"b634-5\" pgmap=\"634\">Although on October 25, 1985, the defendant\u2019s attorney filed a written motion to quash the search warrant and to suppress the seized drugs as evidence, the motion did not as a ground therefor assert or rely on the warrant\u2019s inaccurate or inadequate description, or failure to particularly describe the premises commanded to be searched. The clerk\u2019s half-sheet or memorandum of orders contains an entry of March 20, 1986, \u201chrg commenced on motion to quash warrant and suppress evidence motions denied.\u201d Nevertheless, the complete transcript of the entire trial proceedings of the record on appeal before us does not contain any transcript of any testimony of or reflect that any evidentiary hearing was held on the motion to quash the search warrant and suppress the evidence, or that the trial court ever ruled thereon. It appears from the record that the defendant\u2019s attorney did not pursue the motion to quash and suppress after filing it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b634-6\" pgmap=\"634\">For the foregoing reasons, and others, the legality of the search warrant, the search of the premises, the arrest of the defendant and the discovery and seizure of the drugs were not cognizable issues for the jury\u2019s determination. Thus, the highly prejudicial and irrelevant evidence of the facts and circumstances surrounding the acquisition or probable cause and the issuance of the search warrant was clearly inadmissible. Yet, the prosecutor indecorously commenced the trial of the case at bar with the following improper opening statement of irrelevant, prejudicial and inadmissible evidence of the facts and circumstances spanning the issuance of the search warrant:</p> <blockquote id=\"b634-7\" pgmap=\"634(36) 635(30)\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, you will hear the testimony that on May the 7th, 1985, approximately two hours before this incident, approximately 1:15 in the afternoon, police officer Richard Rowan walked right through those courtroom doors, walked right into this courtroom and appeared before the Honorable Roger J. Kiley, Jr., that was the judge who was sitting in this courtroom on May the 7th, 1985.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-3\" pgmap=\"635\">Officer Rowan presented to Judge Kiley information that he had secured earlier that day, information from a confidential informer the fact that the defendant was serving heroin from his townhouse located at 1110 West 50th Street.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-4\" pgmap=\"635\">Officer Rowan gave this information to Judge Kiley. Judge Kiley listened and looked at this information. Judge Kiley found that there was probable cause to issue a search warrant. Judge Kiley issued a search warrant to search the defendant Femi Okundaye and his townhouse and Judge Kiley commanded that all heroin and narcotic paraphernalia found either on the defendant or at that townhouse be confiscated.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-6\" pgmap=\"635\">Ladies and gentlemen, the evidence will show that after police officer Rowan received that search warrant from Judge Kiley he left this courtroom, he left 2650 South California and he went directly to the Organized Crime Division Narcotics Office of the Chicago Police Department located at 22nd and 24th.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-7\" pgmap=\"635\">Ladies and gentlemen, with this search warrant he went back to his office to organize, attempt to execute that search.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b635-8\" pgmap=\"635\">Although defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, its prejudicial impact is quite apparent, which the prosecutor aggravated by eliciting the following irrelevant improper testimony from State witness Chicago police officer James Molloy, on the officers\u2019 and the judge\u2019s procedure in obtaining and issuing a search warrant:</p> <blockquote id=\"b635-9\" pgmap=\"635\">\u201cQ. What are the functions of the Organized Crime Division?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-10\" pgmap=\"635\">A. The Organized Crime Division is broken up in three sections, Intelligence, Vice and Narcotics. The Narcotics Section of which I am part is specialized in narcotics investigations, making control buys, executing search warrants and focusing on dealers and we also do investigation to transcend . district boundaries and assist department district officers when it is needed.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-11\" pgmap=\"635\">Q. What is a search warrant?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-12\" pgmap=\"635\">A. A search warrant is a judicial order that allows the person who has applied for the warrant and had it signed to search a person and premise named in the search.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-14\" pgmap=\"635\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-15\" pgmap=\"635\">Q. How are search warrants obtained, sergeant?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-4\" pgmap=\"636\">A. There are several ways through surveillance, through going in after a controlled purchase is made or by acting on reliable information.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-5\" pgmap=\"636\">Q. Once information is obtained what would an officer do to obtain a search warrant?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-6\" pgmap=\"636\">A. To start with an officer would try to verify as much of the information as he could by on-site investigation. After doing so he would sit down at a typewriter and type out a complaint for search warrant and also the search warrant document itself. After the officer types up this complaint he then submits it to his unit watch commander for their approval. Once that is done the complaint and the warrant is taken to the Narcotics Section of the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and an assistant state\u2019s attorney will peruse the document, check it for reasonableness. He will then approve it, affix a search warrant number to it.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-7\" pgmap=\"636\">Q. Once the state\u2019s attorney approves a search warrant where is it taken afterwards?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-8\" pgmap=\"636\">A. The officer then takes it to a judge. The judge will read the warrant, he will swear the officer, he will ask the officer certain questions about the warrant if he has any. He will then ask the officer if it is in fact a true and accurate description of the things set forth in the warrant.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-9\" pgmap=\"636\">Usually in the warrant the officer is establishing the fact that there has been a crime committed or has been committed and fruits of the crimes can be found at a place. And then the judge will ask the officer to sign the warrant and then the judge will sign the warrant.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b636-10\" pgmap=\"636\">After State\u2019s witness Molloy testimonially led the jury through the irrelevant, prejudicial process surrounding the issuance of a search warrant, the prosecutor had State\u2019s witness Officer Rowan repeat the process in more minute detail. Rowan\u2019s testimony was as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b636-11\" pgmap=\"636\">\u201cQ. Officer, directing your attention to the early morning hours of May 7, 1985, did you have an occasion to have a conversation with someone?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-12\" pgmap=\"636\">[Defense Attorney]: Object, judge.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-13\" pgmap=\"636\">THE COURT: Basis?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-14\" pgmap=\"636\">[Defense Attorney]: The early morning hours of May 7th, judge, is [sic] not relevant. Relevancy.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-15\" pgmap=\"636\">THE COURT: I will allow it, go ahead.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-16\" pgmap=\"636\">[Prosecutor]: Thank you, your Honor.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-3\" pgmap=\"637\">Q. You may answer the question, officer[.]</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-4\" pgmap=\"637\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-5\" pgmap=\"637\">Q. And officer were you with your partner at the time you had that conversation?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-6\" pgmap=\"637\">A. Yes, I was.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-7\" pgmap=\"637\">Q. And that was Officer Ramirez?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-8\" pgmap=\"637\">A. Yes, it was.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-9\" pgmap=\"637\">Q. Officer, who did you have a conversation with?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-10\" pgmap=\"637\">[Defense Attorney]: Objection, judge.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-11\" pgmap=\"637\">THE COURT: Counsel, approach the bench.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-12\" pgmap=\"637\">(Discussion out of the hearing of the jury:)</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-13\" pgmap=\"637\">THE COURT: I thought this was just some quick orientation now you are going into something \u2014 .</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-14\" pgmap=\"637\">[Prosecutor]: I am not, I am only asking him based on this conversation with the Cl what did he do pursuant to that conversation.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-15\" pgmap=\"637\">THE COURT: You are going to the obtaining of the warrant, is that it?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-16\" pgmap=\"637\">[Prosecutor]: Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-17\" pgmap=\"637\">THE COURT: So, all you have to say you spoke to someone.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-18\" pgmap=\"637\">[Prosecutor]: Confidential informant, and pursuant to that conversation what did he do?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-19\" pgmap=\"637\">THE COURT: I can\u2019t see any problem with that.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-20\" pgmap=\"637\">[Prosecutor]: I am not going to conversation.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-21\" pgmap=\"637\">(Back before the jury:)</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-22\" pgmap=\"637\">THE COURT: Continue.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-23\" pgmap=\"637\">[Prosecutor]: Thank you, your Honor.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-24\" pgmap=\"637\">Q. Officer, you may answer that question[.]</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-25\" pgmap=\"637\">A. Confidential informant.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-26\" pgmap=\"637\">Q. Officer, after you had that conversation with the confidential informant did you go someplace?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-27\" pgmap=\"637\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-28\" pgmap=\"637\">Q. Did you go there alone or with somebody?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-29\" pgmap=\"637\">A. I went there with my partner, Officer Armando Ramirez and the confidential informant.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-30\" pgmap=\"637\">Q. Where did you go?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-31\" pgmap=\"637\">A. 1110 West 50th.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-32\" pgmap=\"637\">Q. What is located at 1110 West 50th?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-33\" pgmap=\"637\">A. A large complex of town houses all with the same address that are designated by individual letters going from A, B, C and to double A double B double C, through the alphabet.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-3\" pgmap=\"638\">Q. Officer, did you, your partner and the confidential informant go to a particular townhouse?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-4\" pgmap=\"638\">[Defense Attorney]: Objection, judge.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b638-5\" pgmap=\"638\">Out of the hearing of the jury, the prosecutor candidly admitted that \u201cthe argument going to whether or not they [the police officers] had a legal warrant is inappropriate to the jury. Now, with regard to what led up to the execution of the warrant, it is really not relevant ***. *** [H]is checking it out to get more probable cause is really immaterial in the case.\u201d After making the foregoing legally accurate acknowledgements, the prosecutor nevertheless promptly proceeded to further ignore them by thereafter eliciting in the jury\u2019s presence the following additional irrelevant, prejudicial inadmissible testimony from Officer Rowan of the facts encompassing the issuance of the search warrant, to which the defendant\u2019s objection was overruled:</p> <blockquote id=\"b638-6\" pgmap=\"638\">\u201cQ. Officer, [you] may answer that question[.]</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-7\" pgmap=\"638\">A. Right. If I recall the question, it was who I went to the location with.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-8\" pgmap=\"638\">Q. Who did you go to the location with?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-9\" pgmap=\"638\">A. I went with myself, my partner, Officer Ramirez, and the confidential informant.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-10\" pgmap=\"638\">Q. Did you go to the particular townhouse located at 1110 West 50th Street?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-11\" pgmap=\"638\">A. We didn\u2019t walk up to the townhouse in question, we drove by it and it was pointed out to me.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-12\" pgmap=\"638\">Q. Which townhouse was pointed out?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-13\" pgmap=\"638\">A. I, double I.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-14\" pgmap=\"638\">Q. Officer, did you then leave that location?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-15\" pgmap=\"638\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-16\" pgmap=\"638\">Q. Officer, after you left that location what is the next thing you did?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-17\" pgmap=\"638\">A. Earlier or later that morning I went to 2201 West 24th Street, narcotics headquarters and prepared a search warrant for the location in question and the individual described to me by the confidential informant.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-18\" pgmap=\"638\">Q. Officer, in the search warrant did you include the description of the individual described by the confidential informant?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-19\" pgmap=\"638\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-20\" pgmap=\"638\">Q. Did you also include the address?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-21\" pgmap=\"638\">A. I included the address of 1150 West 50th Street and a male black known as Femi, approximately 5 foot 11 inches, 155 pounds, dark complexioned.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b638-22\" pgmap=\"638(10) 639(9)\">Q. Officer, you included the address of 1150 West 50th Street. Was that the address you had gone to?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-5\" pgmap=\"639\">A. Yes, it was the address myself and the informant and my partner and again with my partner again.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-6\" pgmap=\"639\">Q. Officer, when you typed 1150 West 50th street, was that the correct address?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-7\" pgmap=\"639\">A. No, it is not.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-8\" pgmap=\"639\">Q. What was the correct address?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-9\" pgmap=\"639\">A. 1110 West 50th, apartment \u2014 .</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-10\" pgmap=\"639\">Q. Officer, why did you type a 5 instead of a 1?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-11\" pgmap=\"639\">A. Just a typo on my part, it was an accident.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-12\" pgmap=\"639\">Q. Does the address of 1150 West 50th Street exist?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-13\" pgmap=\"639\">A. No, there is no such address at all, it is a complex all with all the common address of 1110 West 50th and broken down by letters.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-14\" pgmap=\"639\">Q. Officer, are there any other town houses with the letters II?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-15\" pgmap=\"639\">A. No, that is the only double I townhouse in the complex.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-16\" pgmap=\"639\">Q. Officer, after you finished typing that search warrant and the complaint for the search warrant what did you do with those two pieces of document?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-17\" pgmap=\"639\">A. I presented it to my sergeant, Sergeant Malloy [sic].</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-18\" pgmap=\"639\">Q. Did you see him do something with it?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-19\" pgmap=\"639\">A. He read through it, asked me about the complex and then initialed the documents.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-20\" pgmap=\"639\">Q. After he did that, officer, what did you do?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-21\" pgmap=\"639\">A. I came to 26th and California, went up to the narcotics section and presented the complaint for search warrant and the search warrant itself to State\u2019s Attorney Levy in the narcotics section.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-22\" pgmap=\"639\">Q. Officer, what did you see Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Levy do with the search warrant and the complaint for the search warrant?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-23\" pgmap=\"639\">A. He read through it, asked me some questions about the location and then he assigned a search warrant control number to it and his signature and the date that he signed it.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-24\" pgmap=\"639\">Q. Officer, after Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Levy affixed his signature what is the next thing you did with the search warrant and the complaint for search warrant?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-25\" pgmap=\"639\">A. I presented it to Judge Kiley in this building, in this courtroom, as a matter of fact, and he read through it and he in turn signed it and put the day and date and the time that he signed it.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b640-4\" pgmap=\"640\">Q. Before he signed it, did you do something to it?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b640-5\" pgmap=\"640\">A. Yes, Judge Kiley swore me in and I signed the search warrant in front of him.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b640-6\" pgmap=\"640\">Q. Officer, after Judge Kiley signed that search warrant, had issued that search warrant, what did you do with it?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b640-7\" pgmap=\"640\">A. I went back to narcotics headquarters at 2201 West 24th Street, notified the sergeant of the fact that we had secured the search warrant to the premises and the defendant and we proceeded to do a draft of the complex in question and assign responsibilities of the team members.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b640-8\" pgmap=\"640\">The State\u2019s argument before us that the foregoing voluminous, highly prejudicial, irrelevant, inadmissible testimony was designed to establish, over and above Officer Rowan\u2019s testimony, that the 1150 West 50th Street address on the search warrant was a typographical error is ludicrous. First, Officer Rowan testified that the 1150 address was a mistake. Second, the legality of the warrant or its execution was not an issue for the jury\u2019s determination, as the prosecutor had earlier confessed. Third, the address on the warrant was further irrelevant for the reason that the defendant was arrested in the premises, whatever was the address on the warrant or of the apartment, in which the narcotics were seized, and in which the telephone services were billed to the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b640-9\" pgmap=\"640\">In the present case, the prosecutor brought out the prejudicially erroneous testimony of Officers Molloy and Rowan, not only that they had discussed the information about the defendant with the State\u2019s Attorney, but that they additionally obtained his approval and also that of the judge who issued the warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest. This court recognized that reversible prejudicial error occurs when a prosecutor testifies that after speaking to the police, he recommended that charges be brought against the defendant, and this foregoing complained-of testimony runs directly afoul of our following holding in People v. Turner (1984), 127 Ill. App. 3d 784, 792, 469 N.E.2d 368:</p> <blockquote id=\"b640-10\" pgmap=\"640(101) 641(50)\">\u201cThe fourth issue raised is whether the introduction of the testimony of an assistant State\u2019s Attorney recommending that charges be brought against the defendant was error. The State argues that Michael Ditore\u2019s testimony simply outlined the steps taken leading to the recommendation of charges. We find no merit in this contention. A prosecutor\u2019s testimony that he recommended that charges be placed against a defendant after discussing the facts of the case with the police was held prejudicial error requiring a new trial in People v. Blissit (1973), 12 Ill. App. 3d 551, 299 N.E.2d 562. The prejudicial impact of Di-tore\u2019s testimony is greater in the instant case because he testified not only that he spoke with police prior to recommending charges, but also with several witnesses and the defendant. * * * The prejudicial effect of this testimony requires that the case be remanded for a new trial.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b641-5\" pgmap=\"641\">People v. Hunter (1984), 124 Ill. App. 3d 516, 464 N.E.2d 659, relied on and cited in the specially concurring opinion, is not authority for the admission in the case at bar of the foregoing voluminous, highly prejudicial, and inflammatory \u201ctestimony of police officers concerning their [prearrest] investigatory techniques\u201d as stated in the specially concurring opinion. (189 Ill. App. 3d at 624.) First, the defendant\u2019s trial on the issue of his guilt or innocence of the offenses of unlawful possession of narcotic drugs and attempted murder (or for any other offense for that matter) did not authorize the prosecutor\u2019s presentation of the totally irrelevant and immaterial, but highly incriminating and prejudicial, evidence of the police officers\u2019 investigatory tactics and conduct. Educating the jurors on police investigatory techniques was not a legitimate function or an issue in the defendant\u2019s criminal trial, however thrilling and enchanting such techniques may be to them. At trial, the defendant was required to defend against only what he did, as alleged in the charges against him. He was not required to simultaneously defend against what the police did in their investigation.</p> <p id=\"b641-6\" pgmap=\"641\">Second, in the instant case, the defendant was arrested pursuant to and in execution of a search warrant which commanded the search of \u201cFemi [with his description]\u201d and 1150 West 50th Street, the premises in which the drugs were seized and the defendant was arrested. In Hunter, however, the officers arrested the defendant without a warrant. A month after a conversation with an informant regarding the defendant and his car, the arresting officers in Hunter began a surveillance of the defendant and his car and observed an individual approach the car and exchange something with the defendant. The officers followed the defendant to another location where the officers observed three to five people, known to the officers to be illicit drug users and addicts, approach the defendant\u2019s parked car and exchange something with him. Suddenly, one of the addicts recognized the surveilling police officers and the group around the defendant\u2019s car scattered and ran. The defendant attempted to pull away but obeyed the officers\u2019 signal for him to stop. When the defendant opened the car door, the officers observed 10 to 14 pills, which were an illicit drug, scattered on the front seat and floor of defendant\u2019s car.</p> <p id=\"b641-7\" pgmap=\"641(11) 642(44)\">Even if there existed some justifiable basis for explaining to the jury the officers\u2019 prearrest conduct and warrantless arrest of the defendant in Hunter, no such justification remotely existed for explaining the officers\u2019 presearch and arrest conduct in the execution of a search warrant and the arrest of the defendant in the instant case.</p> <p id=\"b642-3\" pgmap=\"642\">Second, there was no pretrial motion to suppress the narcotics, nor was there an in limine motion to exclude the officers\u2019 prearrest conduct in the instant case. In Hunter, defendant made both these motions. At a pretrial hearing in Hunter regarding probable cause to arrest defendant and search his car, one of the surveilling-arresting officers testified that approximately one month before the defendant\u2019s arrest, an informant told him that the defendant, whom the informant identified as \u201cSpeedy,\u201d was selling drugs in the area, having taken over the usual route of a deceased member of the El Rukin gang. The informant also provided the officers a description of the defendant\u2019s car, including the license plate number. The trial court ruled that the substance of this conversation could not be revealed at trial, but that the officers could testify that a conversation between the informant and the officers took place. Pursuant to this in limine ruling, the surveilling-arresting officers testified, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that they placed the defendant under surveillance based on a conversation with an informant concerning the defendant and his car, which the defendant assigned as error on the appeal of his conviction for the unlawful possession of the drug pills found in his car.</p> <p id=\"b642-4\" pgmap=\"642\">The Hunter court aptly pointed out that \u201c[t]he trial court took care to avoid undue prejudice to defendant by assuring that the damaging substance of the conversation [between the officers and the informant] would not be heard by the jury,\u201d and that the officers\u2019 testimony that they merely had a conversation with an informant was not inadmissible hearsay. 124 Ill. App. 3d at 529.</p> <p id=\"b642-5\" pgmap=\"642\">In Hunter, as in the case at bar, the prosecutor in closing argument to the jury improperly treated the officers\u2019 testimony of their prearrest investigative procedures as evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the commission of the offense for which the defendant was on trial.</p> <p id=\"b642-6\" pgmap=\"642\">The Hunter court noted that in arguing to the jury the evidence from which the jury could infer the defendant\u2019s intent to deliver the drugs, one factor mentioned by the prosecutor was \u201cthe prior conversation of the officer with the informant.\u201d The Hunter court concluded, \u201cWe agree that this was improper use of the evidence,\u201d and cautioned:</p> <blockquote id=\"b642-7\" pgmap=\"642(39) 643(80)\">\u201cWith regard to the impropriety of the prosecutor\u2019s argument concerning that testimony, it should be noted that prosecutors have recently begun to take improper advantage of the admissibility of such evidence by ostensibly offering it for the limited purpose [of explaining the officer\u2019s investigatory procedure], and once it is admitted, making impermissible use thereof in closing argument [citation], and we would warn that this conduct is improper and, in flagrant cases, may lead to reversal [citation]. If the State indeed intends to use it for the limited purpose permitted, the prosecutor should confine his arguments to that purpose, and any improper use should not be tolerated.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 124 Ill. App. 3d at 530-31.</blockquote> <p id=\"b643-5\" pgmap=\"643\">The foregoing Hunter warnings and admonitions were flagrantly unheeded and violated by the prosecutor in the case at bar. In opening and closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor relied on the officers\u2019 foregoing improper and prejudicial testimony of the circumstances of the issuance of the search warrant in urging the jury to convict the defendant on the totally improper and irrelevant grounds that the officers not only confirmed defendant\u2019s pretrial guilt to their satisfaction but also to the satisfaction of the assistant State\u2019s Attorney who supervised and approved, and Judge Kiley, who ordered the issuance of, the warrant to search the defendant and the premises. The prosecutor in his closing argument improperly stated in effect not once, but at least 10 times, that the assistant State\u2019s Attorney and Judge Kiley clearly believed that the officers had adequate evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. The prosecutor unfittingly argued:</p> <blockquote id=\"b643-6\" pgmap=\"643\">\u201cYou heard the testimony of Sergeant Molloy of the Organized Crime Division, who explained to you what a search warrant is and he described to you a little bit about what the Organized Crime Division, Narcotics Unit of the Chicago Police Department is.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b643-7\" pgmap=\"643\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b643-8\" pgmap=\"643\">He [the defendant] wants you to believe that there is a conspiracy, that the Chicago Police Department is out to get him. They\u2019re out to frame him. He wants you to believe, too, that that conspiracy includes the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, and the judicial system, Judge Kiley.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b643-9\" pgmap=\"643\">[Defense Attorney]: Objection, judge.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b643-10\" pgmap=\"643\">THE COURT: Objection sustained.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b643-11\" pgmap=\"643\">[Prosecutor]: He wants you to believe that we\u2019re all involved in the conspiracy.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b643-12\" pgmap=\"643\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b643-13\" pgmap=\"643\">You\u2019ve heard how methodical the process is. You\u2019ve heard all the procedures that have to be followed. When a police officer secures information from a confidential informant he must verify it.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-4\" pgmap=\"644\">Officer Rowan and Officer Ramirez went directly to Town House II with the confidential information located at 1110 West 50th Street, pointed out exactly where the defendant lived, found out the defendant\u2019s name, Femi, found out that the defendant was five feet eleven, found out that he was a male black, that he weighed 155 pounds.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-5\" pgmap=\"644\">Officer Rowan then took that information, went back to his office and typed up a complaint for a search warrant and a search warrant. He then took that information and brought it here to 26th and California. He went up to the Narcotics Unit of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. He gave that information to Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Levy.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-6\" pgmap=\"644\">Mr. Levy looked at that information. After looking at the information Officer Rowan then took that same information right here to this very courtroom. Judge Kiley was sitting on that bench.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-7\" pgmap=\"644\">Officer Rowan gave Judge Kiley that search warrant and that copy of search warrant. Inside, that complaint for search warrant contained all the information that Officer Rowan had gotten from the confidential informant.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-8\" pgmap=\"644\">Judge Kiley looked at that information. He read that information. He thought about that information. He ruled on that information, and he issued a search warrant.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-9\" pgmap=\"644\">[Defense Attorney]: Objection.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-10\" pgmap=\"644\">THE COURT: Objection sustained. Counsel, please argue material matters as they relate to this case.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-11\" pgmap=\"644\">[Prosecutor]: Judge Kiley issued that search warrant. Officer Rowan left this courtroom with the search warrant Judge Kiley had just issued and went back to the Narcotics Unit of the Chicago Police Department. There he gave that information to Sergeant Molloy. There began the Organization of the team who was going to execute that search warrant.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-13\" pgmap=\"644\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-14\" pgmap=\"644(99) 645(8)\">We have a Chicago police officer who is a Chicago police officer. He\u2019s not a typist. He went to 1110 West 50th Street, Town House II with that informant. He checked it out. He secured all the necessary information. He went to his office. He typed up that search-warrant and complaint for search warrant, including all that information. He brought it here. Judge Kiley issued the search warrant. He brought it back to his office. The team went out, went directly back to Townhouse II, 1110 West 50th Street. Ladies and gentlemen, typos happen. It doesn\u2019t affect the validity of the search warrant.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b645-3\" pgmap=\"645\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b645-4\" pgmap=\"645\">Ladies and gentlemen, you heard Police Officer Rowan testify. His testimony was clear, consistent and credible. He is to be believed by each and every one of you. He told you what happened on May 7, 1985. He told you how he met with that confidential informant, the necessary steps he took, how he went to 1110 West 50th Street, Townhouse II, with that confidential informant, how he took that information he received from that confidential informant, including a physical description of the defendant, placed it all into a search warrant, and here at 26th and California talked with the assistant state\u2019s attorney, showed him the information, came into this courtroom, showed the same information to Judge Kiley and Judge Kiley issued the search warrant.\" (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b645-5\" pgmap=\"645\">This foregoing argument flagrantly violates our following holding in People v. Turner (1984), 127 Ill. App. 3d 784, 792-93, 469 N.E.2d 368:</p> <blockquote id=\"b645-6\" pgmap=\"645\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s fifth and last contention is that statements made by the prosecutor during closing argument were prejudicially improper. *** During closing argument, the prosecutor stated, \u2018The fact Mr. Ditore told you that Malcolm Turner was [not] charged with the murder or anything until April 18th I think has significance. *** I think it showed we don\u2019t just charge people lightly with crimes. We have to get in the case of a homicide a cause of death from the medical examiner\u2019s office. And we are not going to charge people with crimes, like the crime of murder, until we have that evidence. ***\u2019</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b645-7\" pgmap=\"645\">A prosecutor\u2019s statements implying that charges would not have been placed against the defendant unless the prosecutor thought he was guilty are improper and prejudicial error. (People v. Fuerback (1966), 66 Ill. App. 2d 452, 456, 214 N.E.2d 330.) In light of the fact that it was highly prejudicial for Di-tore to testify regarding the placing of charges against the defendant after discussing the case with police, witnesses, the defendant, and the medical examiner, the prejudice to the defendant was further compounded by the prosecutor\u2019s reference to this testimony in closing argument. We are of the opinion that the outcome may have been otherwise had the State omitted these remarks and their inclusion constituted reversible error.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b645-8\" pgmap=\"645(11) 646(89)\">In the foregoing prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to the jury in the case at bar, far worse than the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument in Turner, the prosecutor repeatedly improperly and emphatically inferred that the police officers, the assistant State\u2019s Attorney and Judge Kiley prejudged the defendant\u2019s guilt of the possession of drugs by the issuance of the search warrant, and that the defendant was therefore guilty of the possession of drugs as charged. The defendant\u2019s conviction of the possession of the drugs must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial free of such egregious errors.</p> <p id=\"b646-5\" pgmap=\"646\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b634-8\" pgmap=\"634\">The record before us reflects that an evidentiary hearing was held on August 14 and September 9, 1986, on the defendant\u2019s written motion to suppress his statements on Miranda grounds, the original of which was filed on September 13, 1985, and an amendment thereto was filed on March 19, 1986. The trial court overruled the motion on September 9, 1986, at the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing thereon.</p> </footnote> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b646-6\" pgmap=\"646\">PRESIDING JUSTICE MURRAY and JUSTICE COCCIA,</author> <p id=\"A3u\" pgmap=\"646\">specially concurring:</p> <p id=\"b646-7\" pgmap=\"646\">We agree with the majority that this cause must be reversed and remanded, but we would limit the reason to the improper use in closing argument of otherwise admissible evidence. The testimony of police officers concerning their investigatory techniques is properly admitted into evidence despite its hearsay nature and despite the fact that a jury may gather an erroneous inference from such evidence. (People v. Hunter (1984), 124 Ill. App. 3d 516, 464 N.E.2d 659.) This court has recently noted that prosecutors have begun to take advantage of the admissibility of such evidence by ostensibly offering it for its limited purpose and, once admitted, making an impermissible use of it in closing argument. (People v. Hunter (1984), 124 Ill. App. 3d 516, 464 N.E.2d 659.) As the majority opinion aptly points out, in this case the evidence was used not for its legitimate purpose of showing investigative technique, but to infer guilt. We are of the opinion that this is the type of flagrant use of such evidence which this court warned could lead to reversal in People v. Hunter (1984), 124 Ill. App. 3d 516, 464 N.E.2d 659, and other cases. The war on drugs may not be successful by following the Marquis of Queensberry Rules. Yet individual cases may be reversed and remanded for the failure to follow well-established rules of evidence.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
