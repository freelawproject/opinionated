The proposed constitutional amendment would specify a single formula for the conduct of the lottery game and the distribution of prizes, a matter that present Article XV, section 4, leaves to the State Lottery Commission. The present provision dedicating the state\u2019s proceeds from the lottery \u201cfor the purpose of creating jobs and furthering economic development in Oregon\u201d would be replaced by a formula allocating 38 percent of the proceeds to counties for specified distribution to vocational education, law enforcement, and other uses. The proposed constitutional measure also would increase from 84 percent to 88 percent the proportion of the total lottery proceeds that must be distributed in prizes and to the local government programs specified in the amendment, reducing administrative costs from 16 percent to 12 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The Attorney General prepared a draft ballot title, to which petitioners made different objections under the procedure provided by ORS 250.067. The Attorney General then certified to the Secretary of State a revised ballot title, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: SHIFTS LOTTERY MONEY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\"><em>\u201cQUESTION: </em>Shall constitution be changed to remove requirement that lottery fund economic development projects, and money instead go to local governments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\"><em>\u201cEXPLANATION: </em>Removes requirement that lottery fund economic development. Distributes lottery proceeds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-11\">12% - Administration, advertising (presently 16%).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-12\">50% - Prizes (specifies prizes and game procedure).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-13\">38% - To counties, based on county lottery sales, for distribution:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-14\">a) 50% to schools for vocational education.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>b) 34% to cities in county for law enforcement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\">c) 3% to cities, county for economic development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">d) 8% to cities, county for community transportation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">e) 5% to cities, county for tourism.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Petitioners now bring their objections to the revised ballot title to this court pursuant to ORS 250.085.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Under ORS 250.085(4), as amended in 1985, this court\u2019s task is to \u201creview the title for substantial compliance with the requirements of ORS 250.035 and 250.039, and [to] certify a title meeting this standard to the Secretary of State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">The requirements of ORS 250.035 and 250.039, in substance, are that the caption of a measure \u201cidentifies the subject matter of the measure,\u201d that the question \u201cplainly states the purpose of the measure\u201d phrased so that an affirmative answer corresponds to an affirmative vote, that there be a \u201cconcise and impartial statement\u201d of the \u201cchief purpose of the measure,\u201d that the ballot title should avoid confusion with other ballot titles previously filed for the same election, and that the ballot title meet criteria of readability so far as practicable consistent with impartiality, conciseness, and accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Petitioner GTECH objects to the revised ballot title because it fails to inform voters that the proposal would constitutionally mandate a single form of lottery game and would eliminate the form of game which GTECH now operates. GTECH submits an alternative ballot title which would emphasize this aspect of the proposal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">\u201cMANDATES LOTTERY GAME PROCEDURE: SHIFTS PROCEEDS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">\u201cQUESTION: Shall lottery be limited to one constitutionally mandated game structure, with proceeds shifted from economic development to local governments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-14\"><em>\u201cEXPLANATION: </em>Mandates only one lottery game structure, eliminating on-line games (Lotto) as revenue source; shifts 38% of lottery revenue from economic development to counties, based on county lottery sales, for distribution as follows:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Petitioners Hill and Cohen object to the caption of the revised title because it only states that lottery money will be shifted to local governments but does not inform voters that the money will be taken away from economic development. They propose that the caption be changed to read: \u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: SHIFTS LOTTERY MONEY FROM ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO COUNTIES.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Respondent\u2019s answering memoranda in this court concede GTECH\u2019s claim that the revised ballot title does not adequately describe the mandated change in the lottery format and therefore does not substantially comply with ORS 250.035. In order to rectify this shortcoming and also attempt to accommodate reference to the loss of revenue for economic development, respondent suggests a new alternative ballot title phrased as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">\u201cCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT CHANGES LOTTERY PROFITS DEDICATION, MANDATES SINGLE GAME PROCEDURE</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">\u201cQuestion: Shall lottery be limited to one constitutionally mandated game structure, profits shifted from economic development to stated local government uses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201cExplanation: Constitutional amendment ends economic development dedication of lottery profits. Proceeds paid as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">50% as specified prizes in mandated game procedure (instant winners, 20 $100 winners compete for additional prizes); bars other lottery games;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">12%, administration and advertising, reduced from 16%;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">38% to counties based on county lottery sales, distributed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnA\">(a) 50%, schools for vocational education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\">a) 50% to schools for vocational education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-12\">b) 34% to cities for law enforcement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-13\">c) 16% to cities and counties for economic development (3%), community transportation (8%) and tourism (5%);</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-14\">\u201cKeeps prize money at 50% of revenue; lowers administration and advertising revenue to 12% from 16%.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>(b) 34%, cities in county for law enforcement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\">(c) 16%, cities and county for community transportation (8%), tourism (5%), economic development (3%).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The ballot title before us for review is the version that the Attorney General certified to respondent. We review it only for substantial compliance with the statutory standards, not to determine whether either party to a challenge or this court can further improve that version. The precertification procedure of ORS 250.067, added in 1985, provides an opportunity to improve the Attorney General\u2019s draft that should substantially reduce compelling demands for this court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\"> In the present case, respondent concedes the inadequacy of the title as written, and we agree with that concession. When a title does not substantially comply with the statutory standards, ORS 250.085(4) directs us to certify a title that does meet the standards. We consider the suggestions of the parties for an alternative, but we are not required to choose formulations from any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The primary dispute about the present ballot title is whether the change in the lottery format or in the use of the state\u2019s profits is more important and therefore should be featured in the caption, if both cannot be included. A further constraint is that the caption should identify the measure as changing the Constitution rather than only statutory law. <em>Fithian-Barrett v. Paulus, </em>296 Or 819, 822, 680 P2d 381 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">We agree that each point is important. The ten-word limit on the caption makes a tight fit, but we think the following will accommodate all three objectives:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">CONSTITUTIONALLY PRESCRIBES LOTTERY FORMAT, SHIFTS PROFITS FROM DEVELOPMENT TO COUNTIES.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Because in this caption the word \u201cdevelopment\u201d is not preceded by \u201ceconomic,\u201d that meaning should be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>clear in the statement of the question immediately following the caption. We draw the following primarily from respondent\u2019s proposed alternative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">QUESTION: Shall constitution be amended, limit lottery to one mandated game format, shift profits from economic development to specified local uses?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We also draw upon respondent\u2019s suggestions for the statement of purpose, making a few changes in the interests of readability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: Amends Constitution. Prescribes single lottery format (instant winners, 20 $100 winners competing for additional prizes). Ends dedication of profits to economic development. Distributes proceeds as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">50% as prizes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">12% administration and advertising, reduced from 16%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">38% to counties based on county lottery sales, distributed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">(a) 50% to schools for vocational education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">(b) 34% to cities for law enforcement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-12\">(c) 16% for community transportation (8%), tourism</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-13\">(5%), economic development (3%).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">Combining these elements, we certify the following ballot title to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<p id=\"b602-15\">CONSTITUTIONALLY PRESCRIBES LOTTERY FORMAT, SHIFTS PROFITS FROM DEVELOPMENT TO COUNTIES.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-16\">QUESTION: Shall constitution be amended, limit lottery to one mandated game format, shift profits from economic development to specified local uses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-17\">STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: Amends Constitution.
