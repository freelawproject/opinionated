While patrolling in a marked police car, uniformed Suffolk County Police Officers James Faughnan and Bryan Carty observed a red Hyundai automobile parked partly on the street and partly on the dirt yard of an abandoned house which they believed to be the site of drug and prostitution activities. The officers\u2019 version of what transpired was as follows. They pulled alongside the Hyundai and asked defendant, sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, for his license and registration and an explanation for his presence at that location. Defendant responded by rolling his window up, making an obscene hand gesture and slowly moving his vehicle forward. The officers then moved the patrol car at an angle to block defendant\u2019s forward movement and exited to position themselves on each side of defendant\u2019s vehicle. Because it was dark, raining and the windows of the Hyundai were tinted, the officers had difficulty seeing inside defendant\u2019s vehicle. But when they saw defendant appear to be reaching down for something below the passenger seat, the officer near the passenger\u2019s side broke the side window with his flashlight and ordered defendant at gunpoint to come out of his vehicle. Defendant then wildly maneuvered his car to extricate himself from the situation and eventually did so, but not before both officers were injured by contact with the Hyundai and three shots were fired by the police at defendant\u2019s car, one of which hit defendant in the elbow. After a high-speed chase for several miles, culminating at a dead-end street, defendant fled from his vehicle by foot and was then apprehended by Officer Faughnan and placed in handcuffs after a physical struggle in which he kicked and punched both officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The Appellate Division vacated the two assault, second degree, convictions and dismissed those charges (190 AD2d 764). Relying on our holding in <em>People v May </em>(81 NY2d 725) (decided after defendant\u2019s trial), the Appellate Division concluded that the police officers were engaged in an unlawful seizure of defendant when they detained him by blocking his vehicle and displaying their weapons without having any reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot at the time. The illegality of the seizure, therefore, negated a necessary element of the assault, second degree, convictions, i.e., that the defendant\u2019s acts against the police in evading detention were committed \"[w]ith intent to prevent [them] from performing a <em>lawful </em>duty\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 120.05 [3] [emphasis supplied]). Because the illegality of the seizure of defendant by the police had not been raised at the trial level, however, the Appellate Division invoked its interest of justice discretionary authority to vacate and dismiss the felony assault convictions <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.15 [3]). The Court, however, affirmed the convictions for reckless assault, third degree, and resisting arrest. A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">On this appeal from the affirmance of his assault, third degree, and resisting arrest convictions, defendant urges only two points. The first of his grounds for reversal is that substantive due process bars convicting him for actions in direct response to the \"grossly\u201d illegal seizure of his person by the police.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> As defendant concedes, however, this constitutional objection was raised for the first time before the Appellate Division and, thus, is beyond our power to review unless it falls within the narrow class of cases in which we have held preservation by timely objection is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Exceptions to the preservation rule have been limited to errors going to the very organization of the court or at such basic variance with the mode of procedure mandated by law that they impair the essential validity of the criminal proceedings <em>(see, People v Patterson, </em>39 NY2d 288, 295-296; <em>see also, People v Michael, </em>48 NY2d 1, 6). We have generally applied the preservation rule to due process objections <em>(see, e.g., People v Iannelli, </em>69 NY2d 684, 685; <em>People v Barry A., </em>40 NY2d 991, 993). Notably, in <em>People v Patterson </em>(53 NY2d 829, 831) we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>held that an objection based upon an unlawful seizure of the defendant\u2019s person was fully subject to the timely preservation requirement. Defendant\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of his conviction based on the unlawful seizure of his person by the police here is not distinguishable in kind from that raised by the defendant in <em>People v Patterson (supra) </em>as to whether some exception to the preservation rule applies <em>(see also, People v Dancey, </em>57 NY2d 1033, 1035; <em>People v Martin, </em>50 NY2d 1029, 1031). Accordingly, we find this claim unpreserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Defendant\u2019s remaining point is addressed only to his resisting arrest conviction. He argues that because the Appellate Division expressly found that the acts of the police in detaining and attempting to seize him \"were unlawful at the time the alleged injuries [to the police] were inflicted\u201d (190 AD2d 764, 767, <em>supra), </em>defendant\u2019s arrest by the police was not \"authorized\u201d, thus negating an essential element of the crime of resisting arrest <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 205.30; <em>People v Peacock, </em>68 NY2d 675, 677). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The trial court charged the jury that, to find defendant guilty of resisting arrest, it was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>inter alla, </em>that defendant \"punched and kicked\u201d the two officers, knowing that they were police officers, and in doing so intentionally attempted to prevent the officers from effecting an authorized arrest. Both officers testified that the only punching and kicking by defendant occurred well after the initial incident on Davidson Street and defendant\u2019s flight therefrom, when Officer Faughnan apprehended him on foot and both officers were attempting to subdue and handcuff him. Although defendant gave a different version of his and the officers\u2019 conduct when he was finally apprehended, there is no reasonable view of the evidence that any punching or kicking by him occurred at any earlier point in the entire incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Similarly, under the trial court\u2019s very specific fact-related instructions to the jury in submitting assault, third degree, as a lesser included offense to one of the other counts of the indictment, the verdict convicting defendant of assault in the third degree was necessarily based upon the jury\u2019s finding that Officer Carty was injured by contact with defendant\u2019s car during the initial Davidson Street encounter as a result of defendant\u2019s reckless conduct in maneuvering his automobile to avoid being detained by the officers. Defendant has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>disputed the legal sufficiency of the People\u2019s evidence to support that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Moreover, there is no issue properly before this Court of defendant\u2019s justification for his use of force in this initial encounter with the police. Penal Law \u00a7 35.27 provides that \"[a] person may not use physical force to resist an arrest, <em>whether authorized or unauthorized, </em>which is being effected or attempted by a police officer * * * when it would reasonably appear that the latter is a police officer\u201d (emphasis supplied). Defendant did not timely request a jury instruction that he would have been justified in using physical force in self-defense against any excessive force employed by the police in attempting to detain him <em>(cf., People v Stevenson, </em>31 NY2d 108, 112) and the trial court\u2019s refusal to entertain defendant\u2019s belated request to charge surely cannot be viewed as an abuse of discretion as a matter of law. Therefore, defendant\u2019s commission of an assault, third degree, against Officer Carty during that initial encounter furnished the predicate for his subsequent authorized arrest by Officer Faughnan. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s conviction for resisting that arrest was properly affirmed by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\"> Contrary to the position of the dissent, defendant does not claim on this appeal that there was any constitutional flaw in the conduct of the trial itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b265-7\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ape\">(dissenting). Because the trial in this case was fundamentally flawed, I dissent and would reverse the order of the Appellate Division. First, defendant was denied the opportunity to have a jury consider his position that his actions were justified when the trial court declined to give a charge on justification. Second, defendant\u2019s argument that his convictions violate due process should be reviewed by this Court even in the absence of preservation. Third, he was entitled to have a jury consider the charge of assault in the third degree with the knowledge that the conduct of the police was illegal. Fourth, no basis existed for a conviction for resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Defendant\u2019s conviction, after a jury trial, of two counts of assault in the second degree, assault in the third degree, and resisting arrest, stemmed from an altercation with two police officers as he sat in his car with a female companion, and in which the police officers were allegedly injured. The Appellate Division vacated the conviction of two counts of assault in the second degree and the sentences imposed thereon and dismissed those counts from the underlying indictment (190 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>AD2d 764). The Court concluded that the police officers were \"not acting lawfully at the time that they were allegedly injured,\u201d that they \"had no right to demand that the defendant produce his driver\u2019s license and registration,\u201d and that they \"had no right to detain or to arrest the defendant based upon his refusal to do so\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 766). The Court concluded further that \"the officers\u2019 efforts to detain, arrest, and later shoot the defendant were unlawful at the time the alleged injuries were inflicted\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 767). Nevertheless, the Court affirmed the judgment of County Court insofar as it convicted defendant of assault in the third degree and resisting arrest <em>(see, </em>190 AD2d 764, <em>supra). A </em>Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal (81 NY2d 978).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The facts demonstrate, as the Appellate Division concluded, that the conduct of the police in this case was unlawful. On November 18, 1987, at approximately 3:00 a.m., as Police Officers James Faughnan and Bryan Carty drove through the Town of Wyandanch, Suffolk County, on patrol, they observed defendant and a female companion seated in a red Hyundai vehicle, with the engine running and the headlights on. Based on the belief that the location was a \"high drug area,\u201d and that defendant\u2019s car was near a \"big hangout for drugs and prostitution,\u201d the officers pulled up alongside the vehicle and demanded the license and registration of defendant, who was in the driver\u2019s seat. Defendant ignored the officers\u2019 demand, gestured to one of them with his middle finger, and began to drive away. The officers then used their vehicle to block defendant\u2019s path, exited their patrol car and approached defendant\u2019s car. Officer Carty approached on the driver\u2019s side while Officer Faughnan went to the passenger side, brandishing a revolver in his left hand and a flashlight in his right hand. The officers permitted the female passenger to exit the car and leave the area. Defendant reached toward the passenger side of his vehicle. Observing this movement, Officer Carty yelled to Officer Faughnan, who smashed the passenger side window with his flashlight. In endeavoring to prevent his arrest by maneuvering his car out of an obstruction created by the police, defendant thereafter responded to a continuous, escalating encounter precipitated by the officers\u2019 unlawful conduct. His reactions were immediate, spontaneous, and proportionate to the officer\u2019s use of excessive force. Given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>display of violence by one of the officers, defendant understandably did not comply with the commands to get out of his car. Instead, he attempted to escape the precarious situation by maneuvering his car out of the impasse. In so doing, his car collided with Officer Carty, slightly injuring him. The officers responded by firing three shots into defendant\u2019s car. One of the bullets penetrated defendant\u2019s arm. Obviously fearing for his life at this point, defendant managed to depart the area and, in so doing, bumped into Officer Faughnan with his car and knocked him to the ground, causing injury. The two officers returned to their patrol car and pursued defendant. At some point defendant exited his vehicle and fled on foot. After a brief chase, defendant was handcuffed and arrested. A search of defendant\u2019s car revealed no weapons or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">First, defendant was denied the opportunity to have the jury consider his contention that his actions were justified. The trial court refused to instruct the jury on the defense of justification. Prior to the court\u2019s charge to the jury, defendant requested that the court adapt Penal Law \u00a7 35.30 (\"Justification; use of physical force in making an arrest or in preventing an escape\u201d) to the facts of this case. Specifically, the record indicates that the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5D\">\"[defense counsel]: What I\u2019m asking is that the Court encompass in its charge portions of Section 35.30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">\"the court: 35.30 of the Criminal Procedure Law? \"[defense counsel]: Of the Penal Law, applicable sections specifically relating to force, the use of deadly force, and I\u2019m certain the Court can interpret that as it applies in this instance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">\"the court: That has five subdivisions. Are you referring to a specific one? Do you want to look at it * * *?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">\"[defense counsel]: I\u2019m looking at it right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">\"[law secretary to trial judge]: Do you want the entire installment charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">\"the court: There are certain portions of the section that deal with private people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-12\">\"[defense counsel]: No. I\u2019m talking primarily 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>and the subdivisions thereof; 2 and 3 I don\u2019t even think are applicable. I\u2019m speaking too quickly. Yes, Section 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\"[law secretary]: 1 and 1 (a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">\"[defense counsel]: 35.30 Sub 1 (a), and you can\u2019t take portions. It\u2019s not fully disclosing. I\u2019m trying to cover the variations encompassed in the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">\"[law secretary]: So the entire section 1?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">\"[defense counsel]: Entire section 1, ending with Sub (c) or whatever you want to call it. I do not feel that Sections 2 and 3 are applicable or have any bearing on the facts here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">\"[law secretary]: Can I have a question off the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-11\">\"the court: Off the record. (Discussion held off the record)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">\"the court: Since Section 35.30 does not appear to the Court to apply in the instant case, the Court denies the request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">After the jury charge, defense counsel specifically requested a charge on justification. The following colloquy took place: \"the court: Any exceptions or requests * * *.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-14\">\"[defense counsel]: If your Honor please, I had not gone into this before. This is an element here which was not charged. That is with respect to the self-protection, self-defense, with respect to the actions of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-15\">\"the court: You mean justification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-16\">\"[defense counsel]: Justification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-17\">\"the court: It wasn\u2019t requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-18\">\"[defense counsel]: I\u2019m saying it was not requested. In sitting here I thought that would be encompassed in the charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-19\">\"the court: Only if the charge is requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-20\">\"[defense counsel]: Would your Honor consider, even at this late time, offering that charge on that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-21\">\"[prosecutor]: Judge, I would object. I didn\u2019t have a chance to sum up on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-22\">\"the court: That\u2019s the problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\"[defense counsel]: My error. I had thought that it was going to be encompassed in the charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">\"the court: It\u2019s not a standard charge. When I read the proposed charges to you, I did not include justification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\"[defense counsel]: I am aware of that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Each time, the trial court denied the request to charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Second, on this appeal, defendant argues, as he did at the Appellate Division, that his due process rights under both the Federal and State Constitutions were violated by his convictions following an illegal seizure of his person by the police. This argument, while not specifically made at the trial level, is related to the contention and request for jury instructions on whether his actions were justified. The argument was made in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">This case comes within the general rule that no preservation is necessary where the claimed defect goes to \"the organization of the court or the mode of proceedings proscribed <em>[sic] </em>by law\u201d <em>(see, People v Patterson, </em>39 NY2d 288, 295). The <em>Patterson </em>Court also stated that there were, occasionally, broader expressions of this rule. Thus, the <em>Patterson </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">\"Thus, the rule has come down to us that where the court had no jurisdiction, or where the right to trial by jury was disregarded, or where there was a fundamental, nonwaivable defect in the mode of procedure, then an appellate court must reverse, even though the question was not formally raised below * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\">\"This traditionally limited exception has, on occasion, been given broader expression.\u201d <em>(People v Patterson, </em>39 NY2d, at 295, <em>supra.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">As in <em>Patterson </em>the claimed error here \"goes to the essential validity of the proceedings\u201d (39 NY2d, at 296), and should be reviewed by this Court <em>(compare, </em>Cohen and Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals \u00a7 55 [referring to appeals in civil cases \u2014 \"failure to urge the constitutional question in the court of original instance is not fatal to the appeal, so long as the question was properly presented to the Appellate Division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>and necessarily involved in its decision\u201d]; <em>see also, </em>2 Newman, New York Appellate Practice \u00a7 13.08 [3] [d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The facts in the cases cited by the majority as precluding a review of a due process claim because of an absence of preservation do not involve unlawful police conduct. In <em>People v Iannelli </em>(69 NY2d 684), the defendant did not raise the issue that the statute prohibiting aggravated disorderly conduct was unconstitutional until after he was convicted. In <em>People v Barry A. </em>(40 NY2d 991), this Court refused to entertain an argument that a youthful offender statute was unconstitutional because it was not raised until an appeal was taken. In <em>People v Patterson </em>(53 NY2d 829), both the trial court and the Appellate Division found that statements made to the police were voluntarily made and were not in violation of defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination. This Court then refused to hear a challenge, made on appeal, that those statements were in violation of defendant\u2019s right to be secure in his person. In no sense do these cases stand for the proposition that a claimed due process violation resulting from illegal police conduct, and defendant\u2019s shooting and incarceration, is beyond this Court\u2019s power to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Third, defendant was entitled to have the jury consider the charge of assault in the third degree with the knowledge that defendant\u2019s actions were in response to illegal police conduct. Fundamental fairness requires that this case be presented to a jury not on a theory of proper police conduct but in terms of the unlawful police action found by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In its instruction to the jury on the charge of assault in the third degree, the trial court included the following five elements of that crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">1. That on November 18, 1987, the defendant revved the motor of his car and moved it, causing it to slide into Bryan Carty, a police officer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">2. That at the time he did so, defendant was aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">3. That the defendant consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk of physical injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">4. That the defendant\u2019s conscious disregard of the risk was a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in that situation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-12\">5. That defendant\u2019s act caused serious physical injury to Bryan Carty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">In determining whether defendant\u2019s conduct under the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>cumstances was a gross deviation from the conduct of a reasonable person, the jury should have been instructed that the conduct of the police officers was illegal. That fact bore on the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Fourth, no basis exists for a conviction for resisting arrest. The majority attempts to limit that conviction to the time after the chase when defendant was caught and allegedly struggled with the officers <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 196). However, this was not the limitation on which the prosecution tried the case. According to the record before the Court, the prosecutor\u2019s summation included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">\"I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that from the time he took off at the scene of the incident, 10 Davidson Avenue <em>[sic], </em>all the way until the time he was apprehended, that\u2019s resisting. Driving away from police officers, shutting off the lights, traveling over several streets, getting to his house, and then at his house, jumping two fences, running around the house and trying to flee from the police officers, that\u2019s resisting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">\"Once they actually have him in their hands, he kicks and punches. That all constitutes Resisting Arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The charge of resisting arrest required the People to prove that defendant intentionally prevented or attempted to prevent a police officer \"from effecting an authorized arrest\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 205.30). Here, no probable cause existed for the police to effect an arrest. As the Appellate Division concluded, the police conduct was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">On facts similar to those presented in this case, this Court concluded that the police had no reasonable ground to believe that the defendant had committed, was committing or was about to commit a crime, no probable cause existed to authorize the defendant\u2019s arrest, and, therefore, the defendant could not be guilty of resisting arrest <em>(see, People v Peacock, </em>68 NY2d 675). In that case, the defendant was charged with resisting arrest and harassment. According to the testimony of the arresting officer, the defendant was observed arguing with another individual and crying. When the officer approached the defendant and attempted to detain her, she struck him in the arm. The Court held that since there was no probable cause for defendant\u2019s arrest, defendant could not be guilty of resisting arrest <em>(id., </em>at 677). The Court explained further that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Penal Law \u00a7 35.27 \"is concerned with the defense of justification and does not amend Penal Law \u00a7 205.30 to make resistance to an unauthorized arrest an offense\u201d <em>(id,., </em>at 677).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Here, too, there was no probable cause for defendant\u2019s arrest. The police officers had no basis to believe that defendant was committing, had committed or was about to commit an offense. Defendant was merely sitting with a female companion in a car he had recently purchased when the unlawful conduct of the police that led to his being shot and spending three years in prison ensued.
