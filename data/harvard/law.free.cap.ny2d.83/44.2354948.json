We agree with the Appellate Division that the Tax Appeals Tribunal\u2019s decision was rational and supported by evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">United National Corporation (UNC) was a publicly held corporation formed in Delaware, with headquarters in New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>York City. Essentially a real estate holding corporation, UNC owned substantial real property in 11 States. In September 1982, the trustees of the Buffalo Savings Bank (later \"Goldome Bank for Savings\u201d, referred to herein as \"petitioner\u201d) decided to take \"any and all actions necessary\u201d to acquire UNO\u2019s business and executed an instrument entitled \"Agreement and Plan of Merger\u201d on January 21, 1983, amended on February 18, 1983, proposing that UNC merge with a wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner Goldome. Article VI of the agreement, entitled \"Shareholder Approval, Registration of New Preferred Shares, and Listing Thereof,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">\"(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and understand that as a condition precedent to the Merger and under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the approval of shareholders of UNC must be obtained and UNC shall, as expeditiously as possible, call a meeting of its shareholders for such purpose and solicit proxies to vote in favor of such Merger\u201d (\u00a7 6.1 [a]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Article VIII of the agreement sets forth \"Conditions\u201d of the \"Closing and Merger.\u201d Section 8.1 (a) of article VIII states \"[t]he satisfaction of * * * the following * * * shall be conditions precedent to the obligation of each of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger: (a) the requisite consent or approval of the shareholders of UNC shall have been obtained.\u201d Delaware law, moreover, requires that any agreement to merge \"shall be submitted to the stockholders of each constituent corporation at an annual or special meeting for the purpose of acting on the agreement\u201d (Del Code Annot, tit 8, \u00a7 251 [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The critical New York statute applicable here is Tax Law \u00a7 1443 (6), effective March 28, 1983, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">\"A total or partial exemption shall be allowed in the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\">\"Where a transfer of real property occurring after the effective date of this article is pursuant to a written contract entered into on or before the effective date of this article, provided that the date of execution of such contract is confirmed by independent evidence, such as recording of the contract, payment of a deposit or other facts and circumstances as determined by the tax commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>This statute provides an exemption from real property transfer gains taxes imposed under Tax Law \u00a7 1441 for \"gains derived from the transfer of real property within the state.\u201d Petitioner, construing the \"Agreement and Plan of Merger\u201d executed on January 21, 1983 as a \"contract\u201d entered into \"on or before the effective date\u201d of section 1443 (6), sought exemption from the section 1441 gains tax, notwithstanding the shareholders\u2019 approval of the agreement on May 13, 1983, approximately six weeks after the effective date of the statute. Because petitioner did not receive the exemption, it filed exceptions to the tax department\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) agreed with petitioner, granting it the tax exemption on the grounds that the parties had entered into a binding and enforceable contract prior to the effective date of Tax Law \u00a7 1443 (6) notwithstanding the lack of shareholder consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Respondent Commissioner filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s determination and the Tax Appeals Tribunal reversed the determination of the ALJ. That Tribunal held that petitioner failed to demonstrate clear entitlement to the Tax Law \u00a7 1443 (6) exemption noting that transfer of UNC\u2019s property \"was expressly conditioned upon and subject to shareholder approval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Pursuant to Tax Law \u00a7 2016 (delineating judicial review procedures for determinations of the Tax Appeals Tribunal), petitioner then commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding at the Appellate Division, seeking to review the Tribunal\u2019s determination. The Appellate Division confirmed that determination, agreeing that shareholder approval was required before a contract could exist. That Court held that the Tribunal\u2019s determination was rational and noted that absent a contract, \"there could be no exemption from the gains tax\u201d (189 AD2d 39, 42). Two Appellate Division Justices dissented on a question of law. Petitioner appealed, as of right, to this Court pursuant to CPLR 5601 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Petitioner contends that the written contract was \"entered into\u201d on or before March 28, 1983, thus entitling it to the exemption from the property gains tax. Respondent argues that the exemption under Tax Law \u00a7 1443 (6) does not apply to petitioner because the contract for the transfer of the interest in real property was not \"entered into\u201d until May 13, 1983, when the UNC shareholders approved the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">Initially, our review in this case is limited to whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Tax Appeals Tribunal\u2019s determination is \"clearly erroneous\u201d or \"irrational\u201d <em>(see, Matter of Moran Towing &amp; Transp. Co. v New York State Tax Commn., </em>72 NY2d 166, 173; <em>Matter of Grace v New York State Tax Commn., </em>37 NY2d 193, 195-196). \"If there are any facts or reasonable inferences from the facts to sustain it, the court must confirm the Tax Commission\u2019s determination\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 195; <em>see also, Hawkins, Delafield &amp; Wood v Michael, </em>67 NY2d 873, 875). The Tribunal\u2019s determination that no binding contract existed between UNC and petitioner prior to the effective date of Tax Law \u00a7 1443 is supported by article VI, \u00a7 6.1 (a) and article VIII, \u00a7 8.1 (a) of the agreement both conditioning the merger proposal upon approval by UNC shareholders. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the parties would not be bound by the agreement without the shareholders\u2019 approval is therefore rational. Based upon the parties\u2019 agreement, we cannot hold, as a matter of law, that the Tribunal\u2019s determination was arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Additionally, petitioner bears the burden of establishing entitlement to the exemption. Statutes creating tax exemptions \"must be construed against the taxpayer\u201d <em>(Matter of Moran Towing &amp; Transp. Co. v New York State Tax Commn., </em>72 NY2d 166, 172-173, <em>supra). </em>The taxpayer must show \"that its interpretation of the statute is * * * the only reasonable construction\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 173). Although petitioner here puts forth an alternative interpretation of the statute, its interpretation is by no means the \"only reasonable construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Consistent with the Tribunal\u2019s determination, Tax Law \u00a7 1443 (6) requires \"that the date of execution\u201d of the contract be \"confirmed by independent evidence, such as recording of the contract [or] payment of a deposit or other facts and circumstances as determined by the tax commission.\u201d The application of the section 1443 (6) exemption is explained in 20 NYCRR 590.20. That regulation, while indicating that the State Tax Commission\u2019s discretion in determining what constitutes \"independent evidence\u201d is to be guided by the two examples specified in the statute, nonetheless recognizes that the Commission itself decides what types of independent evidence are acceptable. Here, the Tribunal appropriately assessed the evidence and determined, based on the express intent of the parties, that the proposal would not become a binding contract until shareholder approval was procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Petitioner contends that even if the merger was subject to the gains tax, it should not be liable for the tax. At the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>petitioner entered the agreement, Tax Law \u00a7 1447 (3) (a) stated, in part, \"For failure to comply with the provisions of this subdivision, the transferee * * * shall be personally liable for the payment to the state of any such taxes stated in such tentative assessment to be due to the state from the transferor.\u201d The \"tentative assessment\u201d is generally issued by respondent pursuant to its \"pre-transfer audit procedure\u201d under Tax Law \u00a7 1447 (2). That audit procedure is set in motion by petitioner\u2019s submission of \"affidavits and any other information necessary to determine [the] tentative assessment\u201d required to be filed at least 20 days prior to the transfer <em>(id.). </em>Here, the \"other information\u201d consists of the questionnaires petitioner submitted in 1985 concerning the merger. Petitioner\u2019s position, that because no pretransfer \"questionnaires\u201d had been filed, no assessment can be made under section 1447 (2), is supported to some extent by the Legislative Proposal Letter (dated Dec. 1, 1983) from the Department of Taxation and Finance. The letter indicates that where questionnaires have not been filed, \"no provision for transferee liability\u201d existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Respondent recognized this and convinced the Legislature to amend section 1447 (3) (a) to hold the transferee liable for the taxes due where the transferee fails to file the required questionnaire or supplies \"willfully false or fraudulent information.\u201d Petitioner, who failed to timely file the questionnaires in 1983, may not, however, use its own dilatoriness to avoid the reach of the statute. Moreover, petitioner\u2019s liability under the questionnaires it filed in 1985, and the tentative assessment generated in response to them, is unaltered by the amendment <em>(see, </em>Tax Law \u00a7 1447 [3] [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Simons, Titone, Hancock, Jr., Bellacosa and Levine concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
