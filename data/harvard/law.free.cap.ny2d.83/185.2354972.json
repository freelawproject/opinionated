Concluding that DOH\u2019s determination was not arbitrary and capricious, we reverse the order of the Appellate Division that allowed recovery of such costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Petitioner, Monroe Community Hospital (Hospital), is an institution for extended care and treatment of the chronically ill. Under provisions of article 28 of the Public Health Law, acute care hospitals such as petitioner receive reimbursement for services rendered to Medicaid-eligible patients <em>(see, </em>Public Health Law \u00a7 2807 [3]). Pursuant to 10 NYCRR 86-2.10 (b) (1) (i), petitioner was required to use \"statistical data submitted by the facility for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1983\u201d to determine its reimbursement rate. The reimbursement rate consists of the following components: (1) direct costs, (2) indirect costs, (3) noncomparable costs, and (4) capital costs. The noncomparable component of the rate consists of costs which are not subject to peer facility comparison due to their nature <em>(see, </em>10 NYCRR 86-2.10 [\u00b6] [1]). Electricity costs are part of noncomparable costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">When DOH reviewed petitioner\u2019s 1983 costs, petitioner was sharing an electrical meter with three other facilities operated by Monroe County. In complying with the regulatory scheme petitioner estimated its share of those costs at 6,929,954 kilowatt hours. In 1990, after petitioner installed a meter to determine its actual electrical usage, petitioner assumed that it had underestimated its usage for 1983 because, according to the meter, its actual kilowatt hours were 8,761,200. Because its electrical costs would, in the future, reflect actual rather than estimated usage, petitioner sought increased reimbursement for 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Petitioner sought this adjustment, however, based on what it referred to as an increase in \"the electric usage\u201d due to \"[u]pdating and modernizing of electric systems.\u201d DOH recommended denial of petitioner\u2019s request because petitioner had failed to seek prior DOH authorization for \"updating and modernizing\u201d of the electric systems, in contravention of the regulatory scheme. The Director of the Bureau of Hospital Reimbursement concluded that the project \"resulted from a management decision * * * [and] no authority [exists] in regulation for additional reimbursement in this case, and no adjustment [was] warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Petitioner requested a hearing as authorized pursuant to 10 NYCRR 86-2.14 (b) (1) to address the denial of its appeal. That regulation requires that the hearing request be denied unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>there are factual issues that must be resolved. In its issue statement, petitioner alleged no factual dispute but changed the reason for the increase in the facility\u2019s utility costs from increase in costs from increases in usage due to modernizing and updating of the electronic systems to its claim that the \"1990 meter readings showed an increase in kwh [kilowatt hours] charged by the County to the Hospital of 26.4% in 1990 when compared to the 1983 estimated kwh charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">DOH\u2019s rate review officer determined that the governing regulations made \"no provision for additional reimbursement due to a change in the method of capturing costs.\u201d Because petitioner\u2019s \"appeal and reappeal raise[d] no issues of fact,\u201d the officer denied petitioner\u2019s request for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Petitioner then commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding. Supreme Court annulled DOH\u2019s determination as arbitrary and capricious and remitted the matter to DOH requiring it to redetermine petitioner\u2019s reimbursement rate in light of petitioner\u2019s 1990 metered figures. DOH appealed to the Appellate Division and that Court affirmed, with two Justices dissenting. DOH appeals, as of right, to this Court pursuant to CPLR 5601 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Here, petitioner argues that the prior courts\u2019 findings are supported by the record and applicable law. Appellant DOH contends that the prior courts had no authority to direct it to calculate petitioner\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement based on the 1990 metered figures and that the courts\u2019 determinations were not supported by the record and conflict with relevant law.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The appropriate standard of review here is whether DOH\u2019s determination was arbitrary and capricious. This settled standard requires the Court to assess whether the action in question was taken \"without sound basis in reason and * * * without regard to the facts\u201d <em>(see, Matter of Pell v Board of Educ., </em>34 NY2d 222, 231). DOH\u2019s determination need only be supported by a \"rational basis\u201d <em>(see, Matter of Heintz v Brown, </em>80 NY2d 998, 1001; <em>Matter of Pell v Board of Educ., supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">We conclude, and agree with the dissenters at the Appellate Division, that DOH\u2019s determination denying petitioner\u2019s reap-peal was not arbitrary or capricious. As DOH contends, several reasons support its decision to deny petitioner\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Aside from its explanations concerning its revised cost-capturing procedure, petitioner failed to sufficiently allege how its 1983 metered readings of its utility costs contain \"error\u201d for purposes of the regulation <em>(see, </em>10 NYCRR 86-2.13). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>petitioner claims here that the 1983 estimates constitute \"error\u201d because the 1990 metered readings indicate a 26.4% discrepancy as compared to the 1983 estimates, it is not clear that the only explanation for the discrepancy is that the 1983 rate indicates \"error.\u201d Other factors could explain the increase in kilowatt hours. Perhaps petitioner was not as efficient in its utility use as in 1983. Public Health Law \u00a7 2807 (3) obliges respondent to reimburse only for expenses incurred in the course of efficient and economic operation of a facility. It was therefore not arbitrary for DOH to deny reimbursement where no regulation authorized such for petitioner\u2019s change in its method of capturing costs and petitioner\u2019s actual expenses may have been incurred as a result of inefficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Pursuant to 10 NYCRR 86-2.14 (b) (1), the set reimbursement rate is deemed final absent a timely request for a hearing containing \"a statement of the factual issues to be resolved.\u201d The rate review officer determined that petitioner presented no factual issue requiring a hearing and when the officer makes that determination, \"the request for a hearing shall be denied\u201d <em>(see, </em>10 NYCRR 86-2.14 [b] [2]). Petitioner claimed no sufficient \"factual issue,\u201d and sought to assert a new ground to support its position that it was entitled to additional reimbursement. Thus, DOH\u2019s rate review officer\u2019s decision could have been upheld on that ground alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Additionally, notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s contentions to the contrary, the difference between petitioner\u2019s first and second level appeals consisted of more than a mere \"clarification\u201d of the basis of the appeals; petitioner changed the substance of the grounds for the relief it sought and its second claim was raised in an untimely manner. At the first appeal, petitioner claimed that the \"updating and modernizing\u201d of its electric systems caused the increase in its electric usage. At its second stage appeal, petitioner claimed that the increase in its electric costs was due to inaccurate estimates of its 1983 usage. Assuming for the moment that this ground constitutes an \"error,\u201d the regulations specify that rates may be adjusted where errors are \"brought to the attention of the commissioner within 120 days of receipt of the commissioner\u2019s initial rate computation sheet\u201d <em>(see, </em>10 NYCRR 86-2.13 [a]; 86-2.14 [b]). Petitioner received the rate computation sheet on November 2, 1990 and asserted its \"clarification\u201d upon its second level appeal on July 1, 1991. Petitioner\u2019s asserted basis for its second stage appeal, differing entirely in substance from the first appeal, would have unquestionably been denied as un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>timely had petitioner asserted it on the same date absent the first appeal. Thus, petitioner may not evade timeliness constraints by claims of \"clarification\u201d of substantive grounds as opposed to straightforward substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Simons, Bellacosa, Levine and Ciparick concur; Judge Titone taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
