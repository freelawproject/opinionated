Because the hearing court\u2019s order of suppression did not rely on the ground that defendant\u2019s State constitutional right to counsel had been violated, that issue is not a proper subject of review on this appeal. <em>(People v Goodfriend, </em>64 NY2d 695; <em>People v Santorelli, </em>80 NY2d 875; <em>People v Karp, </em>76 NY2d 1006; <em>People v Cade, </em>74 NY2d 410; <em>People v Harris, </em>77 NY2d 434; <em>People v Rogers, </em>48 NY2d 167; <em>People v Hobson, </em>39 NY2d 479; <em>People v Claudio, </em>59 NY2d 556; <em>People v Colon, </em>65 NY2d 888.)

Law enforcement authorities afforded full respect to defendant\u2019s right to interpose counsel between himself and the State, and this Court should decline to adopt defendant\u2019s proposed rule requiring the exclusion of statements whenever counsel enters an investigation and, through no fault of the police, gives less than adequate advice. <em>(People v Beam, </em>57 NY2d 241; <em>People v Settles, </em>46 NY2d 154; <em>People v Hawkins, </em>55 NY2d 474, 459 US 846; <em>People v Clark, </em>41 NY2d 612; <em>People v Robles, </em>72 NY2d 689; <em>People v Kazmarick, </em>52 NY2d 322; <em>People v Bing, </em>76 NY2d 331; <em>People v Hobson, </em>39 NY2d 479; <em>People v LaClere, </em>76 NY2d 670; <em>People v Skinner, </em>52 NY2d 24.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b146-5\">Levine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In the spring of 1980, defendant was indicted for the murder of a 16-year-old high school student. The indictment was based principally on defendant\u2019s own inculpatory statements, which had been made to the District Attorney\u2019s representative upon the advice of defendant\u2019s retained attorney. In 1983, this Court affirmed the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress these inculpatory statements after rejecting appellate counsel\u2019s contention that they were the result of a violation of defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel <em>(People v Claudio, </em>59 NY2d 556 <em>[Claudio I]). </em>Defendant appears before us once again following a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that a writ of habeas corpus should be granted and defendant released from State custody \"unless the state affords [defendant] an opportunity to present [his] Article 1, \u00a7 6 state law claim to the New York Court of Appeals\u201d <em>(Claudio v Scully, </em>982 F2d 798, 806). We now hold, as we did in <em>Claudio I, </em>that the ineffectiveness of defendant\u2019s first retained counsel affords no basis for reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">We accept the premise, which was shared by every court that has considered this case, that retained counsel\u2019s conduct in advising defendant to confess to the police \u2014 at a time when there was no concrete evidence against him and no possibility of a plea offer \u2014 represented gross professional incompetence <em>(see, Claudio I, supra, </em>at 560; 85 AD2d 245, 251; <em>Claudio v Scully, </em>982 F2d 798, 802, <em>supra). </em>The dispositive issue, therefore, is whether our holdings that the State constitutional right to counsel indelibly attaches when a criminal suspect invokes that right by obtaining an attorney <em>(see, People v Skinner, </em>52 NY2d 24; <em>People v Hobson, </em>39 NY2d 479; <em>People v Arthur, </em>22 NY2d 325) imply a constitutional State guarantee of effective assistance of counsel when an attorney enters a case on a suspect\u2019s behalf. We conclude that, except in most unusual circumstances not present here, the State is not charged with the responsibility of guaranteeing effective legal representation upon the entry of counsel at the preaccusatory, investigatory stage of a criminal matter, i.e., before the commencement of formal adversarial judicial criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Defendant acknowledges that all our relevant precedents have involved some law enforcement official\u2019s disregard of or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>interference with the attorney-client relationship by interrogation of the defendant in the absence of retained or assigned counsel. However, as we held in <em>Claudio I, </em>in the instant case, the prosecutor and the police scrupulously honored defendant\u2019s relationship with his retained attorney. Furthermore, defendant has not cited any case declaring a State constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel at the preaccusatory stage of a criminal investigation. However, defendant argues that logically, once his State right to counsel indelibly attaches, the panoply of constitutional guarantees associated with the right to counsel spring into being. Defendant supports this deduction largely with the statement in <em>People v Skinner (supra) </em>that the bar to an effective waiver of the right to counsel in the absence of a suspect\u2019s attorney \"simply recognizes the right and need of an individual to have a <em>competent </em>advocate at his or her side in dealing with the State\u201d (52 NY2d, at 29 [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In our view, <em>Skinner </em>and its predecessors <em>(supra) </em>are inapposite to this case. Our holdings that the right to counsel indelibly attaches upon the entry of counsel at the preaccusatory stage involve different constitutional concerns and interests from the guarantee of effective legal representation. Moreover, any implication that the language employed in <em>Skinner </em>to which defendant cites was intended broadly to extend the right to effective legal assistance to the preaccusatory stage, is dispelled by the more specific effective representation cases decided by this Court subsequent to <em>Skinner. </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">To be sure, we have developed a somewhat different test for ineffective assistance of counsel under article I, \u00a7 6 of the New York Constitution from that employed by the Supreme Court in applying the Sixth Amendment <em>(compare, People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 147, <em>supra, with Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668, 687). Nonetheless, the basic purposes and constitutional interests at stake under both constitutional guarantees of an adequate legal defense in a criminal case are the same: (1) the preservation of our unique adversarial system of criminal justice, the underlying presupposition of which \" 'is that partisan advocacy on both sides of a case will best promote the ultimate objective that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free\u2019 \u201d <em>(United States v Cronic, </em>466 US 648, 655 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>[quoting <em>Herring v New York, </em>422 US 853, 862]); and (2) the correlative necessity to provide a defendant with an advocate sufficiently competent to insure <em>\"fairness </em>in the adversary criminal process\u201d <em>(United States v Morrison, </em>449 US 361, 364 [emphasis supplied]). \"[T]he right to the effective assistance of counsel is recognized not for its own sake, but because of the effect it has on the ability of the accused to receive a fair trial\u201d <em>(United States v Cronic, supra, </em>at 658). These concerns are subsumed in our adoption of the standard of <em>meaningful representation </em>for the fulfillment of the State\u2019s own constitutional responsibility to insure effective assistance of counsel to the criminally accused <em>(People v Baldi, supra, </em>at 147). Moreover, the guarantee exists independent of any prosecutorial or judicial misconduct interfering with defense counsel\u2019s effectiveness <em>(Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US, at 686, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The foregoing intrinsic premise and purposes of the constitutional right to effective representation \u2014 as the bulwark of our adversary system of criminal justice and an absolute necessity to achieve fairness to the accused within that adversary system \u2014 imply that the guarantee of effective assistance of counsel is not triggered until adversarial judicial criminal proceedings have been instituted against a defendant, and the Federal cases so hold. Thus, in <em>Kirby v Illinois </em>(406 US 682) the Supreme Court held that no rights under the Sixth Amendment accrue until the commencement of the criminal action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\"The initiation of judicial criminal proceedings is far from a mere formalism. It is the starting point of our whole system of adversary criminal justice. For it is only then that the government has committed itself to prosecute, and only then that the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified. It is then that a defendant finds himself faced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law. It is this point, therefore, that marks the commencement of the 'criminal prosecutions\u2019 to which alone the explicit guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 689-690).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The language of our State Constitution also suggests that the guarantee of effective assistance of counsel does not arise until the commencement of adversarial judicial proceedings: <em>\"In </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>any trial in any court </em>whatever the party accused shall be allowed to appear and defend in person and with counsel as in civil actions\u201d (NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6 [emphasis supplied]). Thus, it has been held that, generally, it is only at arraignment immediately after the start of judicial criminal proceedings that an indigent defendant first becomes entitled to the assignment of counsel <em>(see, Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US, at 685, <em>supra; see also, People v Samuels, </em>49 NY2d 218, 223).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Our cases holding that a suspect\u2019s preaccusatory right to counsel indelibly attaches when retained or assigned counsel assumes representational responsibility do not implicate the same purposes and concerns as underlie the constitutional guarantee of effective assistance of counsel. Our rationale in those cases for applying an <em>indelible </em>right to counsel at the preaccusatory stage is essentially prophylactic, to prevent official overreaching and to insure that any waiver of the right to counsel is untainted. Thus, we have explained that a criminal suspect, by invoking the right to counsel, expresses a lack of competence to deal with law enforcement authorities without legal advice and, hence, needs the same protection before waiving the right to counsel <em>(People v Cunningham, </em>49 NY2d 203, 209). And, in <em>People v Hobson </em>(39 NY2d 479, <em>supra), </em>we emphasized that \"the <em>presence </em>of counsel is a more effective <em>safeguard against an involuntary waiver </em>of counsel than a mere written or oral warning in the absence of counsel\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 484 [emphasis supplied]), and that procurement of a waiver of counsel in the absence of the suspect\u2019s attorney violates ethical precepts barring interference with the attorney-client relationship <em>(id.). </em>We also said in <em>People v Bell </em>(73 NY2d 153): \"[o]ur ruling [in <em>People v Skinner, supra] </em>was designed <em>to prevent the police </em>from rendering the right to counsel ineffective by questioning the defendant about matters relating to the subject of the representation in the absence of counsel retained on the matter\u201d (73 NY2d, at 160 [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Because <em>People v Skinner </em>and its predecessors <em>(supra) </em>deal not with the role of defense counsel in preserving our adversary system of criminal justice, but rather \" '[preserving the integrity of an accused\u2019s choice to communicate with police only through counsel\u2019 \u201d <em>(Minnick v Mississippi, </em>498 US 146, 153 [quoting <em>Patterson v Illinois, </em>487 US 285, 291]), they have no precedential value for extending the State\u2019s guarantee of effective assistance of counsel to a suspect, such as defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>at the preaccusatory stage. More to the point are our holdings in <em>Claudio I </em>and in <em>People v Beam </em>(57 NY2d 241).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In <em>Claudio I, </em>we ruled that defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel had not yet become operative and, hence, was not violated by his attorney\u2019s incompetent advice to confess to the police at the preaccusatory stage of the criminal proceedings in which he was involved. Our reasons for so holding are equally applicable to defendant\u2019s claim here. In <em>Claudio 1', </em>we noted that, because defendant\u2019s confession occurred before the accusatory stage had begun, he would not have been entitled to assigned counsel when he was interrogated by the police had he then requested rather than retained a lawyer <em>(see, People v Samuels, supra; Strickland v Washington, supra). </em>We then reasoned that \"[inasmuch as defendant would have had no right to insist that a lawyer be provided for him when he talked to the authorities, he should not be rewarded by a suppression order merely because he chose to bring a lawyer who proved valueless\u201d <em>(Claudio I, 59 </em>NY2d 556, 561, <em>supra). </em>A second ground we expressed in <em>Claudio I </em>for refusing to impose at the preaccusatory stage an obligation under the Sixth Amendment to provide effective representation was that, prior to the beginning of formal adversary judicial proceedings, the courts have neither the ability to detect nor the means to remedy incompetent or disloyal conduct of defense counsel <em>(id., </em>at 562). The same is true with respect to the State right to effective representation. Indeed, any intervention by State agents to remedy any suspected incompetent advice of defendant\u2019s attorney would have been barred by our holdings in <em>People v Skinner </em>and <em>People v Hobson </em>and by the ethical precepts invoked in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In <em>People v Beam (supra), </em>we flatly rejected the claim that the preaccusatory right to counsel of <em>Skinner </em>created a corresponding State obligation to provide effective assistance of counsel at the same stage. We said in <em>People v Beam:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">\"When a person has had the benefit of counsel and then chooses to waive one of his rights, the police are not required to question the validity of that decision as long as they are assured that the decision was made in consultation with the suspect\u2019s attorney. * * * As long as the police honored the defendant\u2019s right to counsel, and determined that he was speaking with them on advice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>of counsel, the defendant was afforded all the protections encompassed by the constitutional right to counsel\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 254-255).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Thus, although in <em>People v Beam </em>we discussed the possibility that the retained attorney\u2019s improvident advice was not attributable to incompetence but rather to the incomplete information the defendant gave his attorney, the central holding of <em>Beam </em>is that the right to counsel that had indelibly attached by the entry of a retained attorney at the preaccusatory stage was simply the right not to have the attorney-client relationship interfered with or disregarded by law enforcement authorities. This right to counsel at that stage does not guarantee the efficacy of the attorney\u2019s representation; it only requires law enforcement agencies to honor fully \" 'the integrity of an accused\u2019s choice to communicate with police only through counsel\u2019 \u201d <em>(Minnick v Mississippi, </em>498 US 146, 153, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Because the law enforcement authorities in this case did fully honor the right to counsel of defendant which attached when he retained and then consulted with his attorney, he has not established any violation of article I, \u00a7 6 of our New York Constitution arising out of his attorney\u2019s incompetent advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Accordingly, on reargument, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\"> It is also dispelled by the fact that, virtually contemporaneously with <em>Skinner, </em>this Court declined to adopt a \"competency\u201d standard for the right to eifective assistance of counsel <em>(see, People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 146-147).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b151-8\">Titone, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AX\">(concurring). Utilizing principles that were developed largely in the Sixth Amendment context, a majority of this Court has concluded that the indelible State constitutional right to counsel that was formulated in such cases as <em>People v Arthur (22 </em>NY2d 325), <em>People v Hobson </em>(39 NY2d 479), <em>People v Rogers </em>(48 NY2d 167), <em>People v Cunningham </em>(49 NY2d 203) and <em>People v Skinner </em>(52 NY2d 24) does not encompass the right to legal assistance that is <em>competent </em>and meaningful. Because the majority\u2019s analysis reduces what was previously regarded as an important substantive guarantee to a mere technical device for regulating police conduct, I cannot concur in its opinion. Although I agree that the State Constitution does not afford defendant a basis for relief under the circumstance of this case, my reasons are so different from those of my colleagues that a separate exposition is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The central issue raised by this reargued appeal is whether a suspect is deprived of a right conferred by article I, \u00a7 6 of the State Constitution when the attorney he or she has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>retained has provided incompetent and affirmatively damaging advice. The majority does not dispute that the \"indelible\u201d right to counsel attached in these circumstances under <em>People v Skinner </em>(52 NY2d 24, <em>supra), </em>in which it was held that a represented suspect has the right to the advice and assistance of his retained counsel when confronted by the police \u2014 even in a noncustodial setting. Thus, the only question that divides us is whether we should ascribe any concrete legal significance to <em>Skinner </em>Court\u2019s statement that the right it was recognizing there was that \"of an individual to have a <em>competent </em>advocate at his or her side in dealing with the State\u201d <em>(id,., </em>at 29 [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The majority suggests that the quoted language in <em>Skinner </em>may never have been \"intended broadly to extend the right to effective legal assistance to the preaccusatory stage\u201d (majority opn, at 79). However, <em>Skinner </em>involved the <em>Arthur-HobsonCunningham </em>branch of the right to counsel <em>(see, People v Bing, </em>76 NY2d 331, 339; <em>People v Skinner, supra, </em>at 28-29), which only comes into play when a represented suspect has not yet been formally charged. Thus, the Court\u2019s recognition of a right to a \"competent\u201d advocate could only have been intended to refer to \"the preaccusatory stage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The majority also asserts that subsequent \"more specific\u201d cases make clear that the <em>Skinner </em>preaccusatory right does not include the right to <em>effective </em>counsel. But, three of the four cited cases <em>(United States v Cronic, </em>466 US 648; <em>United States v Morrison, </em>449 US 361; <em>Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668) were decided under the Federal Constitution\u2019s Sixth Amendment, which does not contemplate a preaccusatory attachment of the right to counsel at all <em>(see, Kirby v Illinois, </em>406 US 682). Further, all four of the cited cases involved the specific question of defense counsel\u2019s <em>trial </em>performance. It is thus not remarkable that each of the cited cases discusses the right to \"meaningful representation\u201d in terms of its relationship to \" 'fair trial[s],\u2019 \u201d the \"adversarial system\u201d and the \" 'adversary criminal process\u2019 \u201d (majority opn, at 79, 80). In light of their contexts, the judicial statements on which the majority relies have little bearing on the entirely separate and novel question presented here: the scope and effect of New York\u2019s pretrial right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Similarly, since the New York State right to counsel has always been deemed to be broader than its Federal counterpart, it does not aid analysis to invoke, as the majority has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>(majority opn, at 80), the <em>Kirby v Illinois </em>holding that no rights under the Sixth Amendment accrue until the commencement of the criminal action <em>(supra, </em>at 689-690). Once again, that circumstance is irrelevant in a jurisdiction such as ours, which has long recognized the existence of substantial preaccusation rights under the State constitutional right-to-counsel guarantee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Even more fundamentally, the majority\u2019s core rationale\u2014 that the previously recognized preaccusatory right to counsel \"do[es] not implicate the same purposes and concerns as underlie the constitutional guarantee of effective assistance of counsel\u201d (majority opn, at 81) \u2014 does not withstand close scrutiny. As the majority itself acknowledges, the purposes of the <em>Arthur-Hobson-Cunningham </em>branch of the right to counsel are to equalize the imbalance in the relative positions of official interrogators and their subjects and to protect the integrity of any waiver the suspect might make in the face of the State\u2019s powerful law enforcement machinery <em>(People v Bing, </em>76 NY2d 331, <em>supra; see, People v Cunningham, supra, </em>at 207). These aims cannot be achieved if the right to counsel can be satisfied by the presence of an attorney whose performance does not meet even minimal standards of competence. An attorney who, as here, provides such \"woefully inadequate\u201d counsel <em>(see, People v Claudio, </em>59 NY2d 556, 560) as to prompt his client to make an \"uninformed waiver\u201d <em>(People v Claudio, </em>85 AD2d 245, 252) certainly cannot be said to have fulfilled the goal of \" '[breathing] life into the requirement that a waiver of a constitutional right must be competent, intelligent and voluntary\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Bing, supra, </em>at 339, quoting <em>People v Hobson, supra, </em>at 484).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In the final analysis, the majority cites no case which holds or even suggests that the right to the assistance of counsel at preaccusatory phases requires the presence of a licensed but not necessarily competent attorney. Indeed, no prior decision has attempted to separate the notion of a right to counsel from the notion of a right to effective representation. This dearth of authority is not surprising, since the proposition that the right to counsel can exist separate and apart from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>the right to <em>competent </em>counsel is inconsistent with the \" long * * * recognized\u2019 \u201d maxim \" 'that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel\u2019 \u201d <em>(United States v Cronic, supra, </em>at 654, quoting <em>McMann v Richardson, </em>397 US 759, 771, n 14). \"To hold otherwise 'could convert the [right to] counsel into a sham and nothing more than a formal compliance with the Constitution\u2019s requirement that an accused be given the assistance of counsel\u2019 \u201d <em>(United States v Cronic, supra, </em>at 654, quoting <em>Avery v Alabama, </em>308 US 444, 446).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Finally, contrary to the majority\u2019s statements, the fact that law enforcement authorities are generally not in a position to monitor the quality of a suspect\u2019s representation does not provide a sound rationale for accepting incompetent and even worthless legal counsel in fulfillment of a suspect\u2019s <em>ArthurHobson-Cunningham </em>right. The right to counsel is a freestanding constitutional guarantee that exists separate from, and independent of, any of the constitutional proscriptions against official misconduct <em>(see also, Strickland v Washington, supra, </em>at 686 [noting that a defendant may be deprived of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance <em>either </em>by the actions of government <em>or </em>by counsel\u2019s own actions]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the fact that there has been no police impropriety in cases such as this does not in itself vitiate the theoretical merits of a claim based on the ineffectiveness of a suspect\u2019s counsel during the preaccusatory proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Nonetheless, the absence of unlawful conduct by law enforcement authorities does have critical legal significance when considered in the context of the specific suppression remedy that this defendant seeks. As this Court has recently observed, the primary rationale for the suppression of otherwise trustworthy evidence is the value that that remedy has for deterring official misconduct <em>(Matter of Boyd v Constantine, </em>81 NY2d 189, 195; <em>see, People v Drain, </em>73 NY2d 107, 110; <em>People v Harris, </em>72 NY2d 614, 621-622; <em>People v Boodle, </em>47 NY2d 398, 404; <em>People v McGrath, </em>46 NY2d 12, 21). Further, the suppression remedy is to be avoided when the deterrent benefit to be derived therefrom would be minimal <em>(see, e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>Matter of Boyd v Constantine, supra; People v Drain, supra; People v McGrath, supra; People v Arnau, </em>58 NY2d 27).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Here, the constitutional \"wrong\u201d was perpetrated not by a servant of the State, but rather by a private attorney acting in his capacity as the suspect\u2019s legal adviser. The law enforcement authorities who dealt with defendant after he surrendered himself were not in any way responsible for the woefully incompetent and injurious advice defendant\u2019s attorney gave and had no duty to ensure that defendant\u2019s right to the competent advice by counsel was honored <em>(see, People v Beam, </em>57 NY2d 241). Indeed, the State agents who questioned defendant were not even in a position to intervene had they wished to do so, since any such intervention would have undermined the sanctity of the attorney-client relationship <em>(see generally, People v Skinner, supra, </em>at 29-30, citing New York State Bar Assn Code of Professional Responsibility DR 7-104 [A] [1]; ABA Code of Professional Responsibility DR 7-104 [A] [1]; <em>People v Hobson, supra, </em>at 484-485). Thus, there was no official impropriety and no deterrent benefit whatsoever to be gained in these circumstances. Consequently, no sound legal purpose would be served by the exclusion of the statements obtained as a result of defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s substandard performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">I recognize that it may seem somewhat anomalous to some to argue for recognition of a constitutional right on the one hand while concluding on the other that the violation of that right has no remedy in these circumstances. Despite the potential incongruity inherent in that position, I prefer it to the position the majority has adopted, which radically diminishes the preaccusation right to counsel and dilutes this Court\u2019s traditionally steadfast commitment to \"safeguarding the right of an accused to have the assistance of an attorney at every stage of the legal proceedings against him\u201d <em>(People v Cunningham, </em>49 NY2d 203, 207, <em>supra). </em>I continue to believe that the presence of a trained and competent attorney is \"the most effective means we have of minimizing the disadvantage at which an accused is placed when * * * directly confronted with the awesome law enforcement machinery possessed by the State\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 207; <em>see, People v Settles, </em>46 NY2d 154, 161).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> My conclusion that suppression is unwarranted in these cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>cumstances merely reflects my additional belief that the extraordinary price of excluding trustworthy and probative evidence ought not to be exacted when there is no countervailing societal benefit to be gained <em>(cf., People v Bing, </em>76 NY2d 331, 348, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Accordingly, I concur in the Court\u2019s decision on reargument to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Judges Simons, Hancock, Jr., Bellacosa and Smith concur with Judge Levine; Judge Titone concurs in result in a separate opinion; Chief Judge Kaye taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">On reargument, order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">. For this reason, the majority\u2019s reason for invoking the language of article I, \u00a7 6 of the State Constitution is obscure. While it is true that the constitutional provision, literally read, creates a right to counsel only for \"any trial in any court,\u201d it cannot seriously be disputed that the provision\u2019s guarantee, as construed by the judiciary, extends to pretrial and even preaccusatory investigative proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\"><em>. </em>Indeed, when an appellate court reverses a conviction on the ground of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, its decision is based not on any error or wrong committed by the trial court but rather on the impairment of the adversary system that occurs when the accused is not represented in accordance with at least minimal standards of professional competence <em>(see, Strickland v Washington, supra, </em>at 684-686).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\">. The Court\u2019s opinion leaves open the possibility of an exception to its holding in the event of \"most unusual circumstances\u201d different from those present here (majority opn, at 78). However, the Court\u2019s rationale does not suggest any analytical basis for such an exception. Additionally given the unquestionably egregious performance of defendant\u2019s first attorney, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>difficult to imagine what \"unusual circumstances\u201d the majority would recognize as a basis for affording a preaccusatory right to representation that is \"effective.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
