The auction was advertised by the secured lender (Greyhound) through public notice. At the auction, the auctioneer stated that sale would be to the highest bidder and that no minimum bid would be required. Appellant Miami Aviation bid one million dollars. Thereupon, Greyhound bid 3.3 million dollars and took the aircraft and engines. The only issue to be resolved is whether the sale was \u201cwithout reserve\u201d as that term is used within the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Section 2-328 of the UCC deals with sales by auction. Sales by auction are held either \u201cwith reserve\u201d or \u201cwithout reserve.\u201d In an auction \u201cwith reserve,\u201d the auctioneer may withdraw the goods at any time until he announces completion of the sale. UCC \u00a7 2-328(3). In an auction \u201cwithout reserve,\u201d after the auctioneer calls for bids on an item, that item cannot be withdrawn unless no bid is received within a reasonable time. UCC \u00a7 2-328(3). A bid by the owner of an item likely would be considered the equivalent of withdrawing it from sale. An auction sale is \u201cwith reserve, unless the goods are <em>in explicit terms </em>put up without reserve.\u201d UCC \u00a7 2-328(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Appellant argues that the auctioneer\u2019s use of the words \u201cno minimum bid\u201d and sale to the \u201chighest bidder\u201d establish an auction \u201cwithout reserve.\u201d After carefully reviewing the records and the briefs, we find nothing explicit about those terms that would create a sale \u201cwithout reserve.\u201d A sale to the highest bidder has nothing to do with whether a sale is \u201cwithout reserve\u201d because every auction sale goes to the highest bidder. The only case appellant offers with respect to the term \u201cno minimum bid\u201d concerns the sale of realty, a sale not governed by the requirements of the UCC. Moreover, appellant\u2019s arguments that prior to the auction a Greyhound official stated that the auction would be \u201cabsolute\u201d are irrelevant. The only statements that affect whether an auction is \u201cwith or without reserve\u201d are those made at the time the item for sale is \u201cput up\u201d for auction. Appellee Greyhound made no explicit statement that the sale was \u201cwithout reserve\u201d at the time it \u201cput up\u201d the aircraft and engines for auction. Therefore, the sale was \u201cwith reserve,\u201d and Greyhound was entitled to bid on the aircraft and its engines.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
