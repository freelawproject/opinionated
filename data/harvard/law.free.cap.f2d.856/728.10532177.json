Concluding that Brown is subject to deportation and is ineligible for discretionary relief therefrom, we deny review.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">On January 12, 1980, Brown entered the United States on a student visa. On April 26, 1982, following his marriage to an American citizen, his status was adjusted to permanent resident alien. That marriage ended in divorce in December 1982. Brown remarried in July 1985 and on February 1, 1986 a daughter was bom to that union.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-17\">In August 1982 Brown was the subject of two criminal complaints in the state of Wisconsin. In one county he was charged with two felony counts of delivery of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in violation of Wisconsin law. In another county he was charged with four identical counts and a fifth involving delivery of cocaine. He pled guilty to three of the counts involving THC; the other counts were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-18\">The felony convictions triggered the initiation of deportation proceedings by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), pursuant to \u00a7 241(a)(ll) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(ll), which provides for the deportation of any alien who \u201chas been convicted of a violation of ... any law or regulation of a State ... relating to a controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-19\">The immigration judge found Brown de-portable and ineligible for the discretionary relief provided by \u00a7 212(c) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The BIA affirmed, concluding that Brown was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) discretionary relief because he had not accumulated seven consecutive years of lawful, unrelinquished domicile in the United States after the 1982 adjustment of his status to permanent resident. Brown petitions for review of that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-20\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b823-21\">Brown contends that he is eligible for discretionary relief from deportation under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>the aegis of \u00a7 212(c), applicable to aliens \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence [with] lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The BIA consistently has held that an alien\u2019s lawful unrelinquished domicile begins to accrue only after his or her lawful admission for permanent residence. <em>See Matter of S, </em>5 I &amp; N Dec. 116 (1953). Two circuits agree. <em>See Chiravacharadhikul v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>645 F.2d 248 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 893, 102 S.Ct. 389, 70 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981); <em>Castillo-Felix v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>601 F.2d 459 (9th Cir.1979). The Second Circuit, however, disagreed in <em>Lok v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>548 F.2d 37 (2d Cir.1977) <em>(Lok I), </em>and held that to meet the requirements of \u00a7 212(c), an alien need only show that he or she (1) has been domiciled lawfully in the United States for seven consecutive years, and (2) was a permanent resident at the time of the application for discretionary relief, <em>not </em>for all seven of the years of domicile.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">In <em>Anwo v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>607 F.2d 435 (D.C.Cir.1979), an alien asked the District of Columbia Circuit to follow <em>Lok I </em>and hold that he was domiciled lawfully in the United States while on a student visa. The court found it unnecessary to select between the interpretation espoused by the BIA in <em>Matter of S </em>and the reasoning of the Second Circuit in <em>Lok I, </em>noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-5\">We need not now choose between the conflicting interpretations of the Board and the Second Circuit, for we are convinced that even under the more permi-sive <em>[Lok </em>/] standard, Anwo has failed to satisfy \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s requirement of a \u201clawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years.\u201d Although the word \u201cdomicile\u201d is nowhere defined in the [INA], it is generally accepted that domicile is not established unless an individual intends to reside permanently or indefinitely in the new location.... In order to qualify for a student visa, however, the alien must \u201center the United States temporarily and solely for the purpose of pursuing such a course of study\u201d and must maintain \u201ca residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(F)(i) (1976). Thus Anwo could not have established a \u201clawful domicile\u201d in the United States during the period in which he held a student visa. On the one hand, if Anwo complied with the terms of his visa and did not intend to abandon his residence in Liberia, then he was not \u201cdomiciled\u201d in this country; on the other hand, if Anwo did intend to make the United States his permanent home and domicile, then he violated the conditions of his student visa and was not here \u201clawfully.\u201d Under either hypothesis, Anwo cannot satisfy the eligibility requirements of \u00a7 212(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">607 F.2d at 437-38 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">Following <em>Anwo, </em>the Second Circuit acknowledged that its suggestion in <em>Lok I, </em>that an alien who resides in this country for three years on a student visa and for four years as a permanent resident could accumulate seven years of lawful domicile, overlooked \u201cthe fact that students may not legally form the intent to remain in the United States under the terms of their visa.\u201d <em>Lok v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>681 F.2d 107, 109 n. 3 (2d Cir.1982) <em>(Lok III). </em>Thus, the Second Circuit does not interpret <em>Lok I </em>\u201cas permitting lawful domicile without the requisite lawful intent to remain.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>We agree with our colleagues in <em>Anwo </em>and <em>Lok III </em>and hold that an alien cannot lawfully possess an intent to be domiciled in this country while he or she is here on a student visa. <em>See Elkins v. Moreno, </em>435 U.S. 647, 98 S.Ct. 1338, 55 L.Ed.2d 614 (1978). Accordingly, Brown is ineligible for discretionary relief because he may not use his student visa time to satisfy the seven-year domicile requirement of \u00a7 212(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">Brown advances several other arguments. Because we find none meritorious, they merely are synopsized. The deportation is based on the Wisconsin convictions, the validity of which Brown challenges. He may not collaterally attack the legitimacy of those convictions in this proceeding. <em>Zinnanti v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>651 F.2d 420 (5th Cir.1981). Next, because Brown is deportable under \u00a7 241(a)(ll), the express language of the INA renders him ineligible for relief pursuant to \u00a7 241(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(b) (recommendation by sentencing court), \u00a7 244(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1) (suspension of deportation), and \u00a7 244(e), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(e) (voluntary departure). Further, Brown is ineligible for suspension of deportation pursuant to \u00a7 244(a)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(2), because he has not been in the United States for ten years since the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Brown\u2019s double-jeopardy contention also is groundless; it is well-settled that deportation proceedings are not criminal prosecutions. <em>See Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984); <em>Patel v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir.1986). Finally, this court does not have jurisdiction to address Brown\u2019s claim regarding his detention and bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Finding no validity in any point raised, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-13\">. THC is listed on Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802(6), 812.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-14\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) provides in pertinent part: Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unre-linquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General....</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b824-6\">. Although by its terms \u00a7 212(c) applies only to resident aliens outside of the United States who seek to return, the Second Circuit found that limitation unconstitutional in <em>Francis v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>532 F.2d 268 (2d Cir.1976). Subsequent to <em>Francis, </em>the BIA has held that relief is available under \u00a7 212(c) even if the alien has not left the country. <em>See Matter of Silva, </em>Interim Decision No. 2532 (BIA 1976). <em>But see Castillo-Felix v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>601 F.2d 459, 462 n. 6 (9th Cir.1979). The INS does not seek to deny \u00a7 212(c) eligibility to Brown on the ground that he has not left the United States. Accordingly, we need not decide that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AdND\">Additionally, the INS does not challenge Brown\u2019s current status as an alien \"lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b824-12\">. The BIA follows <em>Lok I </em>only in cases arising in the Second Circuit. <em>See Matter of Lok, </em>18 I &amp; N Dec. 101 (1981) <em>(Lok II).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b825-7\">. Brown suggests that he could lawfully form the intent to be domiciled in this country as of the date that he filed his application for permanent-resident status. We cannot rule on the merits of that contention; the date on which the application was filed is not in this record and we cannot determine the practical relevance of the suggestion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
