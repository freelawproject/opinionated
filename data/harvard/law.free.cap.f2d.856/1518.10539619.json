The district court certified that the order involved a controlling, unsettled question of law, the final resolution of which would advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. A panel of this Court granted the corporate defendant\u2019s application for appeal, establishing our jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(b). We affirm the denial of the motion for change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1519\">*1519</page-number>The issue is twofold: whether the district court <em>had </em>to dismiss or transfer the case under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1391(c), which requires a suit against a single defendant to be brought in the division where the defendant resides, or failing that, whether the district court abused its discretion in not transferring the case as a matter of convenience under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1404(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-4\">The suit arose when plaintiff Billy England was injured delivering a load of sheet metal rolls to ITT Thompson Industries\u2019 plant in Valdosta, Georgia. Valdosta is in the Valdosta Division of the Middle District of Georgia. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 90(b)(6). England and his wife reside in Crossville, Alabama. Their diversity action against ITT was brought in the Columbus Division of the Middle District of Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-5\">\n<em>Section 1393(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-6\">Section 1393(a) provides that a civil action of this kind \u201cagainst a single defendant in a district containing more than one division must be brought in the division where he resides.\u201d ITT argues that this section applies to corporations as well as personal defendants. Plaintiffs assert that the use of this pronoun \u201che\u201d reflects a congressional intention that this section apply only to personal defendants. Although plaintiffs\u2019 argument has received some support, <em>Technograph Printed </em>Circuits, <em>Ltd. v. Packard Bell Electronics Corp., </em>290 F.Supp. 308, 324-25 (C.D.Cal.1968); <em>Sharp v. Commercial Solvents Corp., </em>232 F.Supp. 323, 325-56 (N.D.Tex.1964), it has also been criticized.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1613-7\">Amazingly several cases have held that [section 1393(a) ] has no application to corporate defendants, relying on the fact that the final clause of \u00a7 1393(a) says \u201cwhere he resides.\u201d Fortunately this triumph of literalism over common sense has not had a wide following, and indeed in the cases in which it was advanced it was merely an alternative ground for results that were sound on other grounds. The sensible and widely-accepted view is that \u00a7 1393 applies to corporations as well as individuals....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1613-8\">15 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure 2d </em>\u00a7 3809, p. 90 (1986) (\u201cWright &amp; Miller\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-9\">We need not decide this issue here because even if section 1393(a) applies to corporations, it would not avail ITT. In our judgment, the residence of this corporate defendant is district-wide, not limited to a division. \u201c[T]he verb \u2018resides\u2019 in \u00a7 1393 must be given the same meaning as is stated in \u00a7 1391(c) for \u2018residence\u2019 of a corporation.\u201d Wright &amp; Miller at \u00a7 3809, p. 90. Section 1391(c) provides: \u201cA corporation may be sued in any judicial district in which it is incorporated or licensed to do business or is doing business, and such judicial district shall be regarded as the residence of such corporation for venue purposes.\u201d Although ITT is not incorporated in Georgia and conducts business only in the Valdosta Division, ITT concedes that it is licensed to do business throughout the State, including the Columbus Division. The weight of authority gives a literal reading to the three-pronged definition of residence in section 1391(c) holding that the corporation is a resident subject to suit in each division of the district where any of the three alternatives are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-10\">The Tenth Circuit appears to be the only circuit to have addressed this issue previously. In <em>First Security Bank of Utah v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>541 F.2d 869 (10th Cir.1976), the court held that the \u201cthree-prong definition of residence in \u00a7 1391(e) applies in deciding division venue questions under \u00a7 1393(a)_\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 871. The court found the \u201cpolicy arguments against venue where business was not transacted ... unpersuasive\u201d for two reasons: the plain language of section 1391(c) providing alternative venue grounds for a corporation; and the existence of another venue statute \u2014 section 1404(a) \u2014 to address considerations of convenience and hardship. <em>Id. </em>at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-13\">There are several district court opinions on this question and the majority of these have been decided consistently with <em>First Security. See Williams v. Hoyt, </em>372 F.Supp. 1314 (E.D.Tex.1974); <em>Denke v. Galveston, Houston &amp; Henderson Rail</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1520\">*1520</page-number><em>road Co., </em>353 F.Supp. 315 (S.D.Tex.1972); <em>Technograph Printed Circuits, Ltd. v. Packard Bell Electronics Corp., </em>290 F.Supp. 308 (C.D.Cal.1968); <em>Johnson v. Tri-State Motor Transit Co., </em>263 F.Supp. 278 (W.D.Mo.1966); <em>Sharp v. Commercial Solvents Corp., </em>232 F.Supp. 323 (N.D.Tex.1964). <em>But cf. Torres v. Continental Bus System, Inc., </em>204 F.Supp. 347 (S.D.Tex.1962) (corporate defendant may be sued only in division where it is actually doing business).</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-4\">We hold that under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1393(a), venue is proper in any division where a corporate defendant is incorporated, or is doing business, or is licensed to do business. Since ITT is licensed to do business in the Columbus Division of the Middle District of Georgia, it may be sued there under section 1391(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-5\">\n<em>Section 1404(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-6\">Section 1404(a) of 28 U.S.C.A. provides: \u201cFor the convenience of parties and witnesses, and in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-7\">ITT argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-8\">\u2014the plaintiffs are residents of Alabama, not Columbus, Georgia;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-9\">\u2014ITT resides in Valdosta, Georgia;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-10\">\u2014the incident took place in Valdosta;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-11\">\u2014neither of the parties\u2019 counsel reside in either Columbus or Valdosta;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-12\">\u2014the witnesses identified by ITT and most of the witnesses to the incident are residents of Valdosta; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-13\">\u2014no witnesses in the Columbus, Georgia area have been identified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1614-14\">Plaintiffs argue for their choice of forum by noting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-15\">\u2014the Columbus Division is approximately equidistant between their home in Alabama and the ITT plant in Southern Georgia;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-16\">\u2014it is difficult for Billy England to travel because of his physical disability and the drive to Valdosta from Birmingham is five hours further than the drive to the Columbus Division;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-17\">\u2014virtually all of Mr. England\u2019s medical treatment has been rendered in Birmingham, and his treating physicians are located in Birmingham;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-19\">\u2014witnesses who will testify regarding Mr. England\u2019s job performance and earnings live in the Boaz area, which is north of Birmingham; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUn\">\u2014the only eyewitnesses to the incident causing the injury were England and the operator of the forklift. The other 15 witnesses identified by ITT are persons who arrived at the scene of the incident after it happened. The testimony of these witnesses would presumably be merely cumulative as to what was happening insofar as aid rendered to the plaintiff after the incident. Of those 15, two now live in New York, two in Kentucky, and one each in Tennessee and Illinois.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1614-20\">Trial judges are permitted a broad discretion in weighing the conflicting arguments as to venue. <em>Howell v. Tanner, </em>650 F.2d 610, 616 (5th Cir. Unit B July 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 918, 102 S.Ct. 1775, 72 L.Ed.2d 178 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-21\">There appears to be no abuse of that discretion in denying ITT\u2019s motion for change of venue under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1404(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
